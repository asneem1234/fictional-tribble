L&T is a conglomerate with dominant presence in EPC, High Tech manufacturing, IT Services, and Financial Services. 
These businesses, the EPC and manufacturing in particular, have a significant impact on the environment in terms of 
GHG emission, energy and water consumption. Given the strong growth aspiration of the Company, the challenge is to 
balance the growth pursued while minimising its impact on the environment, and also achieve net zero position for both 
water consumption and carbon footprint by 2035 and 2040 respectively.
	
In the short term, the Company’s aim, even as it grows, is to flatten the emission curve in the next five years, through 
improved efficiency in the use of energy and increased use of renewable energy across its operations. This apart, the 
Company also aims to improve its share of green business offerings over the years, which currently stands at around 
38%.
	
Energy transition from fossil fuels to green energy is an established mega trend globally and some of the businesses of 
the Company like thermal power has already felt the impact of this over the last few years. Another business which could 
experience an impact over the next 5-10 years is the hydrocarbon business. The Company is therefore evaluating its 
prospects in green energy areas including green hydrogen, battery storage and offshore wind among others. Overall, the 
Company intends to reduce its presence across the fossil fuel space and build new businesses around green energy.
	
The EPC business is very labour intensive, and post-Covid the availability of skilled labour has become a challenge. 
This constraint could magnify over time as India increases its thrust on infrastructure development, an area that the 
Company seeks to grow in. Recognizing this, the Company has increased its off-site fabrication and its thrust on pre-cast 
technology. In addition, the Company is augmenting its mechanization and automation capabilities for on-site work. 
These initiatives are intended to reduce manual component of work, increase worker productivity, reduce wastages and 
thereby, improve the cost competitiveness of the business.
	
In an economy facing shortage of skilled workforce, the Construction Skills Training Institutes (CSTIs) run by the 
Company’s CSR department in India are worthy of mention. Setup in 1995 and currently with a network of 9 CSTIs 
spread across the country, CSTIs trains over 10,000 youth in construction and allied skills every year. These skill training 
institutes have grown over the years with a unique industry connect leveraging on the Company’s rich experience and 
deep knowledge of contemporary as well as new-age practices of the construction industry. 
	
The Company’s CSR programmes are focused on strengthening the country’s social infrastructure with its thrust in areas 
such as water and sanitation, education, health and skill building. The success of these initiatives lies in delivering impact 
with optimum use of resources, leveraging strengths and collaborating on areas where capacities need to be built. The 
Company’s Integrated Community Development Programmes (ICDP) being aligned closely to the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), is an example of one such effort. The ICDP was initiated 6 years back, specifically in remote water-scarce 
locations of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. The program was designed with a focus on improving the quality 
of life of the community by achieving water sufficiency and further expanding into various aspects of sanitation, health, 
education and livelihood. The ICDP consists of a unique mix of civil interventions (water harvesting structures, farm 
field structures, sanitation units etc.) as well as targeted programs to build community-based institutions, to provide 
ownership, accountability, self-management and sustainability of the interventions. These locations have become self-
sustaining now, and the Company is replicating this model in other locations.
	
Across industries, cybersecurity has also become a key concern for the business continuity. Vulnerabilities such as 
targeted attacks, ransomware threats and phishing have raised the importance of protecting the IT infrastructure and 
sensitive data of the Company. The Company has developed a robust 5-year cyber security & resiliency roadmap and 
made investments in state of art security platforms. It has implemented a groupwide Cyber Risk Assurance Framework 
and operationalised one of the most advanced Security Operations center to monitor developments 24X7 and respond 
effectively when required to any cyber incidents.
	
On the governance front, the Management and the Board are involved in active review of the Company’s ESG 
performance on a regular basis. The Company periodically reassesses all key policies such as Sustainability Policy, 
Supplier Code of Conduct Policy etc. To strengthen the policy framework further, two additional policies namely, Equal 
Opportunity Policy and ‘Public Policy Advocacy’ Policy have been recently adopted by the Company. 
	
While BRSR is mandatory from FY23, as a responsible corporate citizen, the Company has decided to report on its 
business responsibility and sustainability practices from FY22 onwards. This BRSR is a testimony of the Company’s 
commitment to sustainability in all its dimensions and the Company will constantly endeavour to strengthen this further 
on a continuing basis.

to the conflict of interest. The Directors have to exercise their responsibilities in a bonafide manner in the interest of 
the Company, should not allow any extraneous considerations that may vitiate their exercise of objective independent 
judgment in the paramount interest of the Company and not abuse their position to the detriment of the Company for 
the purpose of gaining direct or indirect personal advantage. Any conflict of interest arising with the Board Members

The LCA study concludes that maximum 
environmental impact is associated with procurement 
of primary raw material (steel) and the energy 
consumption (grid source) associated with the 
manufacturing process. Other than these, there 
is almost negligible impacts in the manufacturing 
process.
It has been recommended to look for green steel or 
recycled steel for the manufacturing of this product 
without compromising the quality of raw material. Also, 
it has been advised to consider usage of renewable 
source of energy in the manufacturing process. 
Management is evaluating this recommendation on 
feasibility of adoption.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
As a part of the EHS Management system, a project specific EHS plan is prepared at the inception of every new project 
that determines the broad parameters of EHS management. This EHS plan identifies the hazardous operations and 
the risks arising from such hazards which are within the scope of the work. It even specifies the required integrated 
preventive measures (Controls) to mitigate the same.
	
The Management provides strong demonstrable visible leadership and commitment towards EHS through personal 
examples and actions. This is the first principle of L&T L.I.F.E (Live Injury Free Each Day) leadership commitment. 
Management has participated in EHS meetings, conducted site Inspections and EHS Audits, to encourage and develop 
a positive attitude towards EHS within L&T projects and operations. Management ensured that sufficient EHS resources 
were available and allocated responsibilities for implementing the L&T LIFE framework. Roles & responsibilities, targets & 
objectives, goals, training needs & required behaviours had been clearly defined, agreed & communicated throughout the 
entire organisation & structure.
	
To support this further, there is a systematic risk management process in place to identify and control all the hazards in 
projects/units which requires verification of conformity. The EHS management system has various procedures and EHS 
norms. Therefore, a process has been established for carrying out Internal EHS audits. This process mandates to organise 
internal audits for all active projects and it is verified by each IC head office audit team at least once in six months. 
Certain projects were selected for frequent auditing, depending on their status, importance, and risk profile. This was in 
addition to any external audits carried out by accredited auditors.

construction projects, offices and manufacturing units. At least one internal audit is conducted in 
a financial year for all such operations/sites/ manufacturing units/offices.
15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant 
risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
	
The Company’s EHS Council undertakes a review of all accidents and incidents, and formulate procedures based on 
risk analysis of data gathered through respective IC. It makes use of advanced technology such as vison analytics/AI to 
detect any health & safety hazards and gather data. This data is used for predictive analysis, measurement of incidents 
and unsafe behaviours. This enables identification of the key areas of risk which in turn guides the projects to proactively 
manage and focus resources to prevent any accidents or incidents. Such analysis is shared throughout the group IC 
structure, to support L&T Mission ZERO HARM objective.
	
In view of this collective approach, efforts have been made in understanding the Company’s high- risk profile holistically 
as well as in general. EHS risk management culture has been inculcated across the Company. Various steps have been 
taken including:
 
• 
Implementation of HSE Surveillance Rating
 
• 
Developed HSE Training Modules on high-risk activities.
 
• 
Developed standardized template of HSE Lessons Learnt (EHS Alert) and these alerts are shared in the centralized 
knowledge sharing platform which can be accessed by all employees.
 
• 
Enrolled Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) into the HSES Management Community of central knowledge sharing 
module.
 
• 
Implementation of senior management audits based on standard checklist developed by the EHS Council.
	
The outcome of the efforts has been to capture the high-risk hazardous activities ubiquitous in various L&T’s Business 
verticals. This helps to devise an action plan to enhance the competency among stakeholders in managing such activities 
with higher degree of awareness and suitable training using technology such as AR/VR from competent external agencies 
as well as subject matter experts. Each employee of the organisation strives to achieve EHS excellence in their respective 
functions and align their actions and business decisions.

details can be retrieved from respective sites, manufacturing units and operations. 
	
The Company, based on all EHS analysis data gathered, has developed several procedures aligned to Sub-contractor 
procurement and management. The Health, Safety & Environment Management system has been reviewed and aligned 
to be a part of and fully incorporated into the contract between sub-contractor and the Company. Its purpose is to set 
forth the areas of EHS concerns and requirements routinely. This subcontractor system is intended to supplement any 
contractual requirements, including EHS Management System manual, guidelines, Standard Operating Procedures, any 
requirements of client, as well as sub-contractor’s own EHS Programme.
	
All the suppliers and contractors of the Company are evaluated on their safety infrastructure processes and strengths 
before awarding a contract. The continued monitoring and measuring of suppliers and contractors ensure a 
comprehensive safe environment. This is further enhanced with regular refresher training sessions and capacity-building 
programmes. In addition, periodic site visits by the senior management and site audits improve the EHS performance.

Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
L&T’s business is primarily EPC – engineering, procurement, construction, and high-tech manufacturing. Hence, in line 
with its business models, the Company has identified the following as key stakeholder groups:
Stakeholder Group
Basis of Identification
Suppliers/Contractors
EPC and high-tech manufacturing have significant dependence on supply chain partners for
i)	
Sourcing of key raw materials e.g., cement, aggregates, steel and other materials for construction 
projects, and high-grade metals, subcomponents and other inputs for manufacturing business.
ii)	
Outsourcing of business activities e.g., low-end civil works in construction projects and low-end 
manufacturing
To maintain sustainable growth, these partners are key elements in meeting the delivery and cost objectives 
for various contracts.
Government
Government (central and state) orders make up ~40% of the Company’s current orderbook. Additionally, 
orders from Government owned enterprises contribute to ~44% of the orderbook and therefore, they are 
the largest clients for the businesses. In addition to providing the business, they also determine policies for 
various areas as well as determine the future plans for various sectors.
Customers
Private sector makes up ~16% of the orderbook and plays an important role in business plans of the 
company. Many of them are long-term clients which offer repeat business over period of years and also act 
as partners in developing new solutions or business offerings.
Employees and 
Workforce
Construction is a labour-intensive activity, and L&T employs over 200,062 workers in addition to >50,000 
of its own employees (including manufacturing). Hence, their skills development, health and well-being are 
important for the Company’s ongoing and future operations.
Regulatory bodies
Various business units of the Company operate in variety of sectors, each of which are governed by 
specific regulatory bodies. In addition to this, there are bodies which oversee different steps in EPC and 
manufacturing air pollution control. It becomes important to understand priorities of these agencies and 
address their concerns, if any, to maintain compliance levels and establish benchmark performance levels.
Shareholders and 
Investors
Shareholders and investors make an important contribution to the growth of the company by providing 
financial resources for short term i.e., working capital and long term i.e., capital expenditure and 
investments. They also play an important role through exercise of their voting rights with respect to 
important plans of the Company.
Media
Media acts as important channel of communication of Company’s performance, policies and plans. They also 
help in reverse loop in highlighting concerns or issues related to the Company. In order to ensure that there 
are no gaps in communication, engagement with media entities is a continuous process.
Communities
L&T helps catalyse socio-economic development of communities around its premises and at various locations 
across the country. Focus is on under-privileged and marginalized sections to enable them to bring them 
on-par with others.
