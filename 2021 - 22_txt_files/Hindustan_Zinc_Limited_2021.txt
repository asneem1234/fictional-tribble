1
Water 
Management
Risk
Our operational activities involve processes 
in which water is an indispensable input, 
both for extraction and processing & 
smelting. 
Thus, it is even more important for us to 
strive to reduce water use and increase 
reutilisation throughout the value chain. 
According to our climate change 
assessment, climate change may result 
in increase in extreme weather events 
and subsequent resource shortages. Our 
operations are located in Rajasthan, which 
is one of the designated water stressed 
regions in the country based on WRI’s 
Aqueduct tool. There is a high probability 
of experiencing situations of drought and 
extreme heat waves. Since water is a 
critical input to our business, these factors 
have the potential to disrupt operations, to 
impact productivity of staff as well as our 
revenues and logistics
Water conservation is particularly 
important for us as we operate 
in a water-stressed region. We 
are 2.41 times water positive and 
are well on the path to be 5 times 
Water Positive Company and 
reducing the water consumption 
by 25% by 2025 from base 
year 2020. Company has taken 
several initiatives to reduce its 
dependencies on fresh water and 
greater availability of water for 
the communities surrounding our 
sites;
•	 Increasing efficiency in water 
usage and exploring less 
water-intensive technologies
•	 Strengthening water recycling 
and installation of ZLD across 
all plants
•	 Using alternative water 
sources to reduce dependency 
on freshwater
•	 Replenish water within local 
watersheds and rainwater 
harvesting
•	 Water risk assessment using 
WBCSD’s India Water Tool, 
WRI Aqueduct and GEMI local 
water tools.

Tailings Dam 
Management
Risk
 The monitoring and management of 
tailings storage facilities (TSFs) are not 
only a major factor in legal compliance and 
permitting, but also play a significant role in 
reducing environmental impact on our local 
stakeholders.
Tailings dam failure can lead to loss of life, 
injuries and damages to the environment, 
as well as impact our Company’s reputation. 
It can also entail significant financial costs/
losses and stoppages in production.
Failing of tailings dams can cause 
huge environmental impact. Hence, 
we accord top priority to managing 
them responsibly. 
•	 All the Company’s tailings 
facilities are designed and 
constructed to the highest 
engineering standards and 
meet regulatory requirements 
and best in class benchmarked 
practices
•	 External (Independent 
International  Technical 
Experts ) and internal 
inspection and monitoring 
of the dams to review the 
integrity/ stability of our dam 
structures and their associated 
management practices
•	 Collection and recycling of 
supernatant water in process
•	 Conducting periodic TSF risk 
assessment and developing 
mitigation plans to minimise 
associated risks
•	 Surveillance of Tailings Dams 
•	 Dam break analysis and 
Emergency preparedness
•	 Utilisation of Tailings in 
Backfilling
•	 Replacement of wet tailing 
disposal system with dry tailing 
disposal
•	 Company introduced a novel, 
satellite-based Interferometric 
Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(InSAR) monitoring technique 
to provide early warning of 
surface ground movements.

Air Emissions
Risk
Failure to comply with emission norms 
could lead to negative/inevitable long-term 
impact on the environment and society, 
with imposition of levies/ fines, escalation in 
costs related to monitoring and reporting, 
among others.
Large-scale air emissions 
can cause serious impact on 
the environment and local 
communities. We continuously 
work towards reducing air 
emissions.
•	 Well-designed state of art 
air pollution control devices 
(APCD) are in place
•	 Effective fugitive emission 
management
•	 Continuous monitoring and 
reporting
Negative
4
Energy & 
Climate 
Change
Risk
We consume large amounts of energy due 
to the nature of our operational activities, 
logistics and transportation processes. 
That is why we seek new technologies 
and progress regarding sustainable 
energy generation. This can impact the 
overall market value of the products in 
the geographies with restrictions, thus 
impacting our revenues. 
As a result, we keep track of all transition 
risks and changes in regional Climate 
Change Policy. 
As per our physical risk assessment for 
year 2020-2039, Hindustan Zinc is likely 
to face natural disasters like droughts, 
heat waves and increase in extreme 
weather conditions. These would impose 
challenges to mining operations. Climate 
change may cause or result in increase in 
extreme weather events and subsequent 
resource shortages, impacting overall cost 
of acquisition of resources from alternative 
sources.
The rising challenges of climate 
change and resource scarcity 
have put us on a path of 
transformation to a low carbon 
economy.
Our strategies for mitigating these 
risks include:
•	 Reducing fossil fuel-based 
energy use in our operations 
by using innovative energy 
efficiency technologies and 
process optimisation.
•	 Shifting to renewables and/
or low-carbon solutions where 
possible.
•	 The Company has committed 
for Net Zero Carbon emissions 
by 2050 and is planning to 
increase RE power portfolio by 
addition 200 MW solar project 
by 2025
•	 Replace diesel fueled 
transportation vehicles with 
Electric vehicles, Turbine 
revamping of all the CPPs, 
install Hydrogen or Electric/
Induction Furnaces, enhance 
our carbon Capture, Storage 
and Utilisation capacity etc.
•	 Climate Change risk 
assessment based on TCFD 
guidelines

Biodiversity 
Management
Risk
Biodiversity provides many of the 
ecosystem services. If improperly managed, 
mining, smelting and exploration activities 
have the potential to negatively affect 
biodiversity and ecosystem services. 
Impact could be loss of protected species 
and habitat fragmentation. Such risks could 
affect our social license to operate as well 
as our reputation.
We work to proactively manage 
our impact on biodiversity and 
strive to protect the ecosystems in 
which we operate.

Health & 
Safety
Risk
Hindustan Zinc’s mining operations 
are underground and involves various 
procedures that can have significant 
consequences on the workers and the 
environment. 
Failure to ensure health and safety could 
result in increased cost of litigation, reduce 
availability of manpower, reduced employee 
morale, or even threaten the viability of

Human 
Rights
Risk
Human rights is identified as one of the 
top priorities by our workers, communities 
and investors as part of our feedback 
mechanisms. The global spotlight on 
systemic inequities and the COVID-19 
pandemic pushed us to rethink on how we 
address these challenges within Company 
and as partners in communities where we 
operate. Our commitment to advancing 
equitable and fair culture and respect for 
human rights across the business is central 
to delivering on our strategy and broader 
purpose. 
Any deviation from Human Rights policy 
can lead to imposition of fines and legal 
actions. It can also affect our ability to 
attract talent and impact our reputation.
Our commitment to human rights 
is reflected in our values, policies 
and actions. We respect and 
always strive to protect human 
rights across our operations and 
value chain in all possible ways.

The Company is in business of mineral extraction and processing. Our final product- Lead, Zinc and Silver is used as 
a raw material for many industries and can be recycled and reused multiple times. The minerals are converted into 
ingot which are supplied to customers without any packaging. Company has recently started producing HZDA, a 
Die-Casting alloy which is a premix of Zn, Al, Mg/Cu in certain ratio to get best output of end product at customer’s 
side. Readily available premix saves the energy, time and cost to the customers. Thus, customer does not need to 
re-melt the zinc ingot to make an alloy, they can directly use the premix for their end product. 
	
However, the procedures are in place for managing all kind of wastes generated during the manufacturing of 
finished goods. We are using technology and innovation to reduce-reuse-recycle waste and restore natural systems, 
including land rehabilitation through top-soil cultivation and water reuse. waste and land, as part of our efforts to 
transition to a circular economy. Company also prioritises the repurposing of end-of-life mines as part of a broader 
remit to support local communities. Company is also exploring technologies to extract the valuable residual metals 
and minerals. New chemicals are enabling the company to optimise the mining process, minimise wastage through 
the leaching process and significantly enhancing recoveries.

Electricity consumption contributes to major environmental impact in the value chain of zinc. Company relies on 
captive power plant, it is imperative to improve the captive power plant efficiency To find the most energy efficient 
circuit design and operating strategy. Energy efficiency projects such as revamping of all the turbines, improvement 
of cellhouse efficiency at ZSD, other projects like installation of variable frequency drives across operations, 
switching from high-speed diesel to pipe natural gas, Replacement of conventional tube lights with energy efficient 
LED tube lights have also contributed to energy savings in our operations.
	
	
Water consumption was also identified as major environmental impact in the value chain of zinc. Company has 
commissioned India’s 1st Dry tailing plant at Zawar mines which recirculates more than 80% of the process water 
present in tailings. It has successfully commissioned a 3000 KLD RO-ZLD plant at its Debari smelter which recycles 
processed water, which is then reused in operations. We have also set out plans to commission the ZLD plants at all 
our units and remain committed to principles of water conservation and zero discharge.

proposed project or expansion, we map and engage with all such stakeholders on a proactive basis, particularly through 
our CSR activities. Further, we have stakeholder management processes in place at all our locations. Our stakeholder 
identification and prioritisation process is based on inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness. Our primary stakeholder 
groups are identified and prioritised based on their influence, dependency and impact. Grievance redressal is an 
important aspect of our stakeholder engagement process. We have a Grievance Committee, chaired by the respective 
unit heads, to review the grievances on a periodic basis.

STP at 
Udaipur
Company commissioned a 20 MLD STP in Udaipur in 2014 
under a public-private partnership, which is the first of its kind 
in Rajasthan. Further, Hindustan Zinc and Udaipur Smart City 
Limited signed an agreement in June 2017 to extend the sewage 
treatment capacity by another 40 MLD.
25 MLD has been commissioned in January 2019. Another 15 
MLD commissioned in FY 2020-21 taking the total to 60 MLD.
The replacement of fresh water for 
operations by STP treated water has 
led to increased availability of fresh 
water for the community.
Nearly 36% of total water withdrawal 
was satisfied with treated sewage.
2
Dry Tailing 
Plant
India’s first Dry Tailing Plant was set up at the Zawar Mines in 
Rajasthan. The Dry Tailing technology is based on separating 
water from tailings slurry, which is generated in the beneficiation 
process. Company repurposes tailings materials and waste rock 
as backfill to stabilise our underground mining operations, while 
the remaining tailings are then placed in a specially designed 
tailings storage to minimise the environmental, social, and 
economic risks.
We externally review the integrity/ stability of our dam structures 
and their associated management practices by global experts 
like Golder Associates. 
Key benefits of the dry tailing 
technology include recirculation 
of more than 80% of the process 
water present in tailings, a faster 
rehabilitation and restoration of 
storage site at mine closure and 
ensuring re-availability of water for 
further use.
3
Rainwater 
Harvesting 
Structure
Company executed groundwater recharge intervention project 
across Hurda, Shahpura, Kotri and Jahazpur blocks of Bhilwara 
district. We were able to complete the desilting of ponds, 
repairing, strengthening and increasing the height of damaged 
embankments and construction of 358 recharge shafts for 
effective groundwater recharge, in 83 ponds.
>8.7 MCM/Annum Total 
groundwater recharge potential

4
Paste fill
Instead of conventional hydraulic filling, Company chose to use 
the Paste Fill technology. This technology ensured fast filling and 
practically no bleeding water in the stopes. The other benefits of 
Paste Fill technology have been water conservation, better Stope 
stability, surface integrity in mines and more recycling of tailings. 
•	
Metal recovery from secondary 
stopes.
•	
It reduces cement consumptions 
with increase in uses of fly ash. 
•	
It reduces water consumption as 
paste solids content is high (77-
79% solids).
•	
Nearly, 39% of tailings used 
in Paste fill plant and this also 
helped in improving the stability 
of tailing dam.
5
Ancillary 
Plant
It treats residues produced during smelting process leading to 
in-house production of few key consumables and by-products, 
in collaboration with the Company's central R&D team. Few 
projects were successfully executed including production of 
copper sulphate and zinc sulphate from PF cake as well as 
production of potassium antimony tartrate from antimony dust.
•	
It treats different kinds of 
residues, namely Copper 
dross, Purification waste cake, 
antimony dust/slag and raw Zinc 
oxide.
•	
This has also enabled in 
improvement of metal recoveries 
of lead, copper, and Silver.

Jarofix Yard 
Restoration
Company follows the principle of reducing the waste, 
quantitatively as well as qualitatively & performing recovery 
and recycle. The last priority is disposal in Landfills. Company 
used Mycorrhiza technology for rejuvenation of fertile soil and 
reclamation of wasteland into productive land by Increasing 
the green cover, enhance biodiversity & control fugitive dust 
emission and restoring site. It also makes plants less vulnerable 
to environmental stresses and by optimum use of water 
resources. 
Development of green belt in an 
area of 6.25 Hectare (10,000 plants 
produced for the area).
Provides overall stability to waste

construction
Jarosite is waste produced in the hydrometallurgy process of zinc 
extraction, necessitating additional investment for its stabilisation 
and disposal. In collaboration with IIT-R, Company conducted a 
feasibility study to utilise Jarosite in construction-related works, 
using Jarosite in concrete, mortar and paver blocks as 10% - 15% 
replacement of cement. The study showed positive results and 
encouraged us to conduct field trials.
Company has been granted permission by Rajasthan State 
Pollution Control Board for gainful utilisation of Jarofix waste for 
Road Construction/Highway Construction (embankment).
