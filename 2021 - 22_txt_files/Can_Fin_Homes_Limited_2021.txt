Affordable 
Housing
Opportunity
•	
Fulfilling the demand for affordable housing is 
one of our objectives. 
•	
Rapid urbanization and migration to cities 
have caused severe housing shortage in India, 
particularly for economically weaker section. 
The government’s growing thrust for affordable 
housing through schemes such as Housing for 
All, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Credit Linked 
Subsidy Scheme, RERA, tax benefits and Smart 
city initiatives are fueling home ownership dreams 
of the common man. The schemes are aimed at 
empowering the urban poor, primarily the Low-
Income Group (LIG), Economically Weaker Section 
(EWS) and the Middle-Income Group (MIG I & II) 
to fulfil their home ownership dreams. There is 
immense scope to increase home ownership in 
the country across all income segments.
•	
These initiatives have helped the housing finance 
industry and the real estate industry to record a 
better performance during the year.
Strong credit appraisal help mitigate credit risks.
We have various sources of funds like 
Commercial Paper, Bank Borrowings, privately 
placed Non-Convertible Debentures, Deposits 
and NHB Refinance Facility to financing 
Affordable segment. NHB Refinance forms 
around 22% of our borrowings. The Company 
maintains a good Asset Liability Management.
Increasing trend in rate of interest could be a 
risk however the Company has annual reset 
clause in the contracts as a mitigant for this risk
Positive: There 
is a need 
to canvass 
the loans as 
it helps to 
reduce credit 
cost, thereby 
increasing 
our earning 
profile.

Does the entity provide transition assistance programmes to facilitate continued employability and the management of career

Since inception, the Company has not undertaken any retrenchment of employees owing to business exigencies or employees 
not having the requisite skills to do the required job. Skill upgradation of all employees remains a continuous activity in the 
Company. Given the low attrition rates and long duration of service of most employees, transition assistance programmes for 
retirees are not found to be compelling as the employees are mostly high skilled.
