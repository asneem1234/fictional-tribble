reporting and helps companies make better sustainable investment choices based on quantifiable matrices. Company has, 
volunteered to publish BRSR for current financial year 2021 – 22 to confirm its commitment on ESG.
Company acknowledges the issue and has been working extensively to minimize the environmental and social risks by 
strengthening due diligence, creating employee awareness, and enhancing its sustainable initiatives. Supreme Petrochem 
as a responsible organization has always focused on inclusive growth for all its stakeholders along with enhancing its 
business operations in a sustainable manner. In order to achieve its vision of sustainable business and to ensure compliance 
with regulatory requirements, Company has   disclosed its business practices on Environmental, Social and Governance 
aspects which are in alignment with the National Guideline of Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) guidelines and 
BRSR framework.  Company strives to continue its business operations across the value chain in an ethical, responsible,

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Members of Supreme Petrochem Limited
Report on the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of 
Supreme Petrochem Limited (“the Company”), which comprise 
the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2022, the Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including other comprehensive income), Statement 
of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows for the year 
then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 
“the standalone financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India including the Indian Accounting Standards 
specified under section 133 of the Act (“Ind AS”), of the state 
of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2022 and its profit 
(including other comprehensive income), changes in equity and 
its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. We have determined the matters described 
below to be key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key Audit Matter 
description
How the scope of our audit 
responded the key audit matter
Valuation of inventory:
Inventory forms a significant 
part i.e. 13.20% of the 
Company’s total assets.
Inventory comprises of Raw 
Materials, Finished Goods, 
Stock in process and Stores 
and Spares.
Inventories are valued at lower 
of cost and net realisable 
value.
Styrene Monomer is the main 
raw material for the Company. 
Styrene Monomer, which is 
imported, is subject to high 
price fluctuation risk as well 
as foreign currency risk. 
The volatility in the prices 
of Styrene Monomer may 
significantly impact the 
valuation of not only Raw 
material but also other items 
of inventory. 
In determining the net realisable 
value, the management uses 
data of sales of finished 
good available which is a 
management estimate.
We have considered this as 
a key audit matter due to the 
significance in the amount of 
inventory and volatility in the 
prices of Styrene Monomer.
We have reviewed the stock 
records and held discussion 
with the management. We 
verified arithmetical accuracy 
of valuation records / reports. 
Almost entire inventory, except 
inventory at third party locations 
and finish goods in transit 
were physically verified by the 
management as at March 31, 
2022. This verification was in 
addition to actual verification 
of inventory test checked by us 
during the course of our audit 
at the plant at Nagothane and 
Manali and at certain godowns 
of the Company. We have 
also carried out alternate audit 
procedures to satisfy ourselves 
with respect to existence and 
condition of the inventory at the 
year-end. 
For a sample of inventory 
items, we have verified that 
the weighted average cost 
calculation by the system and 
satisfied ourselves.
We have reviewed the price 
movement of Styrene Monomer 
prices with respect to cost to 
the Company based on  the 
contracts entered onto by the 
Company. Compared such 
prices with the last selling prices. 
Compared the value of Finished 
Goods with the last selling prices 
of the respective product to 
determine the basis of valuation 
adopted. 
Information Other than the Standalone Financial 
Statements and Our Report thereon 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The Other Information comprises of the Directors’ 
Report and Management Discussion & Analysis (but does not 
include the standalone financial statements and our report 
thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this report. Our 
opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover 
the Other Information and we do not and will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Supreme Petrochem Ltd
95
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the Other Information 
identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the Other 
Information is materially inconsistent with the standalone 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the Other 
Information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s 
report, we conclude that if there is a material misstatement of 
this Other Information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in 
equity, cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind 
AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also
l	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
l	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) 
Act,  we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal financial 
controls system in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
l	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
l	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
l	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of the misstatement in the 
standalone financial statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial 
statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative 
materiality and qualitative factors in; (i) planning the scope of 
our audit work and evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) 
to evaluate the effects of any identified misstatements in the 
standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit. 
Supreme Petrochem Ltd

We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure B 
Annexure B - referred to in paragraph 3(g) under "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" of our report of even date
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to financial statements under clause (i) of 
sub-section 3 of section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements of Supreme Petrochem Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for 
the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls system with reference to 
financial statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over financial 
statements criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (ICAI).
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards 
on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal 
Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements was established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
system with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system 
with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference 
to Financial Statements
A Company's internal financial control with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of standalone financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial control 
with reference to financial statements includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the standalone 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
With reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to financial statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
