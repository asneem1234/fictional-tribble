the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate the positive/

1.
Biodiversity 
and Land Use
Risk
Our operations may 
have negative impact 
on marine biodiversity 
and land use. We have 
to minimize the severity 
and magnitude of 
these impacts. Risks 
related to biodiversity 
and land use could 
impact our reputation, 
market proposition, 
draw penalties from the 
regulators and affect our 
financial stability
	§ We have developed site specific 
Biodiversity Management Plan for 
Mundra, Dhamra, Hazira, Kattupalli and 
Vizhinjam Ports.
	§ Development footprint is kept outside 
Eco-sensitive area.
	§ We have aligned five of our ports to Oil 
Spill Action plan in accordance with the 
National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency 
Plan (NOS-DCP), International 
Petroleum Industry Environmental 
Conservation Association.
	§ Assessment results of approved 
projects are required to be released 
on half-yearly basis to the relevant 
authorities.
	§ We have signed a CII-backed India 
Business and Biodiversity Initiative 
(IBBI).
The process of identifying 
and quantifying the 
financial implications of 
the identified risks and 
opportunities is currently 
underway.

2
Climate 
Change 
Adaptation & 
Mitigation
Risk
Our port operations are 
impacted by any natural 
phenomenon like cyclone, 
heavy rains, wind etc. 
Thus, without taking into 
account the impact that 
climate change will have 
on port infrastructure 
we will be placing our 
fundamental business 
asset at risk. Climate 
adaptation and mitigation 
are key to building a 
future-ready organisation. 
They can also reduce 
operational costs and 
drive greater efficiencies 
for the business.
	§ We have completed physical risk 
assessment study for all our ports and 
have identified short and long term 
adaptation and mitigation measures for 
ports depending on identified risk.
	§ We have strengthened our water 
sourcing to avoid fresh water use and 
attempt to have multiple water sources 
at each location. These activities 
strengthen our business continuity 
planning.
	§ Focus on container business is 
influenced by the changing landscape 
of fossil fuels due to climate change.
	§ We target to become ‘Green Ports 
Company’ and also become carbon 
neutral by 2025.
3
Human Rights
Risk
Upholding human 
rights is essential to 
protecting organisation’s 
communities, employees 
and other stakeholders 
and also to avoid 
regulatory liabilities.
	§ APSEZ has fostered an inclusive culture 
free from discrimination and powered 
by diverse employee capabilities.
	§ The Company is committed to free 
and fair employment practices free 
of any harassment based on race, 
religion, colour, age, sexual orientation, 
national origin, disability or any other 
classification as mandated by local 
laws.
	§ The Company’s commitment to human 
rights is reflected in its governance, 
procurement and social strategy.
	§ The Company has formalized Human 
Rights Policy aligned to UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human 
Rights.
	§ The Human Rights Policy applies to all 
stakeholders, including permanent and 
contractual employees, communities, 
consultants, trainees, subsidiaries 
and business partners. The Company 
has a zero-tolerance approach to 
human rights abuses and instituted 
mechanisms for remediation.
	§ To prevent child labour in the 
Company’s business, we have installed 
a system-based entry (Cronos) and 
Aadhar checks for workers.
	§ The Company provided awareness and 
training on human rights guidelines to 
suppliers.
	§ APSEZ has developed human rights due 
diligence to identify and assess impacts 
and risks relating to human rights of 
employees, suppliers, customers and 
communities.

chain and new relations (mergers, 
acquisitions, joint ventures etc).

discrimination, equal remuneration, 
freedom of association and collective 
bargaining. The due diligence has 
been extended to employees, children, 
women, local communities, third party 
contracted workers, local communities, 
indigenous people and migrant workers.
	§ All the company’s ports and offices 
were assessed on the basis of child 
labour, forced/involuntary labour, 
sexual harassment, discrimination at 
workplace and wages.
4.
Employee 
Health, Safety 
and Well-Being
Risk
Failure to ensure the 
health, safety and well-
being of the Company’s 
workforce can impact 
productivity. This can 
consequently affect our 
business operations, 
customer satisfaction and 
profitability.
	§ The Company strives to foster a safe 
working environment and ensure Zero 
Harm.
	§ Hazards and risks are periodically 
identified, with mitigation plans devised 
for each.
	§ All ports are having ISO 45001: 2018 
Safety Management System in place.

	§ Additionally, safety trainings are 
provided to employees and workers on 
a regular basis to ensure their holistic 
well-being.
5
Business 
Ethics, 
Integrity and 
Transparency

Ethical conduct, integrity 
and transparent two-way 
communication with 
stakeholders is integral 
to ensuring regulatory 
compliance and building 
stakeholder trust.
	§ The Company has instituted several 
policies and procedures on business 
ethics, integrity and transparency.

Environmental 
Disaster 
Preparedness
Risk
Acute environmental 
events have the potential 
to disrupt operations and 
the supply chain, inflict 
physical damage on the 
Company’s facilities and 
drive-up operational 
costs.
	§ Business continuity plans have been 
formulated. Additionally, environment-
related risks are being identified, and 
mitigation plans are being devised.
9
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
Failure to comply with 
regulatory requirements 
can manifest in financial 
consequences for the 
company and erode 
stakeholder trust.
	§ The Company has a robust set of 
environmental, social and governance-
related policies to foster a culture of 
compliance within the organization.
	§ Disciplinary measures and 
reinforcement mechanisms have been 
defined as well.
	§ In addition, legal and functional 
teams also monitor the regulatory 
compliances across businesses at 
defined frequencies.
10
Anti-Bribery & 
Anti-Corruption
Risk
Preventing practices like 
bribery and corruption 
helps an organization to 
avoid liabilities, maintain 
stakeholder trust, and 
keep its leadership 
position.
	§ The Company has instituted an Anti-
Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, 
in addition to others like the Code of 
Conduct, Whistle Blower Policy and 
other ESG policies to mitigate this risk.
11
Talent 
Attraction and 
Retention
Opportunity
Employing and retaining 
the right talent helps 
organization deliver value 
to its customers and 
maintain its leadership 
position.
	§ We have built a strong culture 
through acquiring right talent, 
providing engaging and motivating 
work environment, encouraging 
informed risk-taking, offering growth 
opportunities and developing future 
leaders from within, along with focus 
on building harmonious relationships 
between employees and ensuring stress 
free working environment.
12
Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
Risk
Controlling its energy 
consumption and 
emissions footprint 
is crucial to mitigate 
climate change. Adopting 
low-carbon technologies 
is also helping the 
organisation prepare for a 
future, which could bring 
more stringent legislation 
and taxation related to 
energy and emissions.
	§ An Energy & Emission Management 
Policy has been instituted by the 
Company. It is designed to aid and 
formalize the Company’s efforts to 
manage its energy consumption and 
emissions and align with country’s goal 
to become net zero.
	§ Company has committed to become 
Carbon Neutral by 2025.
	§ We signed for the Science-Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi), becoming the 
first Indian port operator to commit 
to science-based emission reduction 
targets.
13
Labour 
Practices
Risk
Respecting human rights 
and ensuring sound 
labour practices allows 
the organisation to avoid 
regulatory action, avoid 
penalties, and empower 
its employees and 
workers.
	§ The Company adheres to all the laws 
of the land, related to human rights 
and labour practices. No forced child 
or compulsory labour is deployed by 
the Company, and its policy framework 
nurtures a diverse, safe and empowered 
workforce.

https://www.adaniports.com/-/media/Project/Ports/
Investor/corporate-governance/Policies/Sustainable-

(https://www.adaniports.com/-/media/Project/Ports/
Investor/corporate-governance/Policies/Supplier-
Code-of-Conduct.pdf) 
which 
covers 
sustainable 
sourcing requirement related to development of 
systems & process, products, and services (including 
office products).
For sustainable sourcing we consider the following in 
our procurement decisions
	§ Suppliers are operating their facilities in compliance 
with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, 
obligations, safeguards, and controls to prevent 
health and safety risks and with an endeavor to go 
beyond the compliances
	§ Suppliers 
strive 
to 
continually 
improve 
the 
environmental performance by setting objectives, 
targets, and processes for efficient use of natural 
resources, energy, water, prevention on use of 
hazardous or toxic substances, waste minimization, 
emission reduction, and pollution prevention
	§ Supplier’s measure, monitor and review the 
environmental performance of the organization 
at regular intervals and get it audited (internal/ 
external) 
before 
communicating 
to 
relevant 
stakeholders.
	§ Suppliers 
ensure 
eco-friendly 
manufacturing 
with minimum and environmentally compatible/
recyclable packaging.
	§ Suppliers conduct business activities with high 
ethical and moral standards and respect Human 
Rights 
considerations 
of 
other 
stakeholders, 
including their employees.
	§ Suppliers act responsibly with their stakeholders and 
collaborate and associate with them, particularly 
the local community for their development.
	§ Procurement of recycled/part recycled product 
with extended producer responsibility.
	§ Procurement of product with certification and eco-
labels wherever applicable.
APSEZ believes that the development of its suppliers 
is imperative for its business growth. Therefore, the 
Company is committed to working with suppliers to 
inculcate APSEZ’s Sustainable Procurement policy 
that focuses on - reduced use of toxic substances, 
conservation of natural resources, minimization

3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim 
your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) 
(b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
The Company is in the port and infrastructure 
development sector, which provides services for 
cargo handling & logistic, operations & maintenance 
of port sector. Being a service industry, we don’t 
have potential to reclaim our products for re-use and 
recycling of generated waste in our operations.
However, the Company complies with all applicable 
regulatory 
requirements 
pertaining 
to 
waste 
management. The Company has defined processes 
for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. 
As part of vision for Zero Waste, APSEZ has taken 
several initiatives in the handling and management 
of waste at all operating port locations by focusing 
on 5R principles of waste management i.e. Reduce, 
Reuse, Reprocess, Recycle and Recover. As part of the 
initiative Mundra, Kattupalli, Ennore, Dhamra, Goa, 
and Tuna sites have achieved Zero Waste to Landfill 
Assurance Statement. All our operating ports are 
certified as Single Use Plastic (SUP) free.
The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, 
stored 
and 
transported 
in 
accordance 
with 
applicable regulatory requirements and best industry 
practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an 
environmentally sound manner through authorized 
vendors for recycling as required by regulation. In 
addition, we work with our customers to manage 
their wastes through appropriate channels. Waste 
collection and segregation systems are installed 
from the waterfront to the gate, enabling systematic 
waste 
handling. 
Hazardous 
waste 
(chemicals, 
sludge, oil etc.) collected from incoming vessels was 
channelised through a separate line, which is handed 
over to authorised third party dealers. Under the 
International Maritime Organisation’s MARPOL 73/78 
convention, vessels that call at our port deliver their 
waste safely to our facility at a nominal charge, in 
alignment with the ‘polluter pays’ principle.
Other Major initiatives include, reuse of treated 
sewage, recycling of paper, plastic, metal, E-waste, 
used oil etc., reprocess of food waste, STP & ETP 
sludge, oily cotton waste etc.
Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the 
generation of waste to divert waste from disposal 
through reuse and recycling wherever possible.
4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line 
with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, 
provide steps taken to address the same.
Owing to the nature of the Company’s product/service 
offerings, EPR is not applicable to the Company.
Principle 3: Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their 
value chains
1. a. Details of measures for the well-being of employees:
Our people form an integral part of our journey towards transformational, responsible and sustainable change. 
Our people policies are designed to provide an excellent work environment which is safe, conducive, harmonious 
and support all round development of our employees. Our efforts to nurture our Human Capital are in alignment 
with our ESG commitment.

Capacity Building:
Many drives are taken across units to create awareness 
on identification of high-risk activities such as work 
at height, Confined Space, Lock Out Tag Out Try 
Out (LOTOTO) etc. and training on its standards. We 
acknowledge the fact that operations free from risks 
on health have the potential to escalate productivity 
also. Hence, we have processes in place to manage 
and monitor health risks of employees, right from 
the time of their first interaction with the company. 
We are having OH&S management system (as per 
the requirement of OHSAS 45001/ ISO 18001) for

risks as unsafe Acts/ unsafe Conditions, near misses, 
injuries and illness and serious incidents. This is 
followed by a comprehensive Root Cause Failure 
Analysis (Investigation), formulation of corrective 
actions as per Hierarchy of Controls, its tracking and 
monitoring and subsequent closure. The outcome 
and learnings from these events and incidents are 
deployed horizontally across the Group through a 
systemic process of ‘Critical Vulnerable Factor’ (CVF) 
as a part of Safety Governance Process. The progress 
on CVF is reviewed during Adani Apex Group Safety 
Steering Council Meetings as well as during their 
Business Safety Council Meetings.
To facilitate this, an advanced digital platform

are taken at all our sites.
All our employees and contractors are provided with appropriate PPEs and it is ensured that they are not 
negligent in using them. We are providing job related training to our employees to perform given task safely 
along with display of do’s and don’ts at prominent locations of the sites. Beside this, we have stringent work 
permit system in place. Toolbox talks, task briefing, job specific training, job hazard analysis and mock drill help 
us in building safety culture within our businesses.
Mental and emotional health is a core part of our work culture. In view of this, an emotional wellness program 
was launched as part of Adani Care- Our integrated suite of health and well-being services and support platform. 
As an inclusive health service, the program offers professional and confidential counselling for our employees.

7. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
APSEZ has zero tolerance towards discrimination, bullying, harassment and inappropriate or abusive conduct 
by its stakeholder groups. We include following points to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in 
discrimination and harassment cases.
	§ To keep an eye on any harassment and discrimination cases within our company, the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee ensures a strategic alignment of sustainability and human rights with the business. The Risk 
Management Committee oversees the potential and actual risk pertaining to human rights at every stage 
of the project including merger and acquisition through human rights due diligence. Ultimate oversight for 
human rights resides with Board of Directors which are briefed on quarterly basis by the ESG Head.
	§ To make our stakeholder aware of relevant guidelines pertaining to human rights, we upload these on our 
Company website for easy access to all employees and stakeholders. Awareness and familiarization sessions 
for different sets of employee population are also conducted.
8. Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
Yes, All the suppliers and vendors are required to adhere to APSEZ’s Supplier Code of Conduct which provides 
comprehensive guiding principles and embodies our commitment to internationally recognized standards, 
including UN Global Compact, the core conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO), United 
Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and prevalent industry standards for our vendors and suppliers.
APSEZ has zero tolerance towards violation of human rights and keep a strict vigil on the policies and practices 
followed by the suppliers. Also, we try to enforce the best practices on human rights in our supply chain using 
the influence we have on our suppliers. Our expectation of respect for human rights from all our business 
partners is unambiguously conveyed at multiple levels of engagement. During the on-boarding process and 
later, the suppliers undergo third party audit of their operations for compliance with safe working condition 
requirements, avoidance of child and forced labour, environmental and social impacts, and human rights due 
diligence. The human rights aspects are also covered in-depth in our annual survey of the vendors and the 
training programs organised for them. In the survey, the suppliers are required to disclose their policy to avoid 
child labour, forced labour, workplace harassment, gender & ethnic discrimination and their human rights due 
diligence process. The suppliers are assessed on whether their policy is aligned with the requirements set by 
APSEZ for their suppliers and business partners.

9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company is in the port and infrastructure development sector, which provides services for cargo handling & 
logistic, operations & maintenance of port sector. Being a service industry, we don’t have potential to recycling 
of generated waste in our operations.
However, the Company complies with all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to waste management. 
The Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. As part of vision for 
Zero Waste, APSEZ has taken several initiatives in the handling and management of waste at all operating 
port locations by focusing on 5R principles of waste management i.e. Reduce, Reuse, Reprocess, Recycle and 
Recover. As part of the initiative Mundra, Kattupalli, Ennore, Dhamra, Goa, and Tuna sites have achieved Zero 
Waste to Landfill Assurance Statement. All our operating sites arec certified as Single Use Plastic (SUP) free.
The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound 
manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation
Other Major initiatives include, Reuse of treated sewage, Recycling of paper, plastic, metal, E waste, Used oil 
etc., Reprocess of food waste, STP & ETP sludge, Oily cotton waste etc.
Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through 
reuse and recycling wherever possible.

Integrated Annual Report 2021-22

At APSEZ, we considered the success of our CSR activities as equally important as any other primary business 
objectives and committed to positively impact the communities directly and indirectly affected by our 
operations. As some of our operating locations were in areas where the poorest segments of Indian population 
lived, we were deeply conscious of our responsibility to dedicatedly contribute towards inclusive growth of 
those communities. We believed that everyone, regardless of who and where they were, deserved equitable 
access to opportunities and a fair chance to a better quality of life.
APSEZ had a group-wide strategy that directed our CSR activities. By giving strategic priority to CSR activities, 
we directly contributed towards the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). In addition, we 
aligned all our activities to the CSR Policy with the aim of facilitating and guaranteeing their correct development 
and implementation, while ensuring long-term outcomes and impacts. With over 25 years of experience in 
catering to the changing needs of society, Adani Foundation, the CSR arm of Adani Group, continued to strongly 
move forward focusing on scaling integrated development efforts across India. Some of the key areas of focus 
for our CSR activities/programmes included education, community health and nutrition, sustainable livelihoods, 
community infrastructure development and addressing environmental concerns. Apart from universal aspects 
like Human Rights and Rights of Indigenous People, we brought issues specific to Indian scenario such as 
mitigating poverty and generating livelihoods into focus.
Company carried impact assessment of its CSR/social activities in the areas of Health, Livelihood & water 
conservation during the year. Details of Company’s work under Corporate Social Responsibility and impact 
assessment is given in Corporate Social Responsibility chapter of Integrated Report for FY 2021-22.

The Company provides communities with a grievance reporting system (recorded, reviewed, escalated and 
actioned upon within a timeframe). A Grievance Management System was implemented for the aggrieved to 
view status, resolution and feedback. The Company is further in the process of developing and roll out of an

(b)	 From which marginalized /vulnerable groups do you procure?
Local/regional suppliers and Local communities
(c)	 What percentage of total procurement (by value) does it constitute?
APSEZ is driving economic development by enhancing procurement processes for social and environmental 
gains. The procurement focus was not just on local development but a range of accrued benefits of lower 
costs, higher brand recognition and livelihood support. Local vendors generally employ hundreds unlikely to 
leave that city, delivering benefits for the local economy in which they are based. Utilising procurement more 
progressively and innovatively has facilitated the participation of small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in 
public procurement in support of common societal goals.
The Company’s business model supports the ethos of - ‘What is good for the country is good for us’. APSEZ’s 
operations are dependent on vendors to execute its goal of being an end-to-end integrated logistics player. 
Local procurement therefore, is a key facet of the overall sustainable supply chain strategy. The Company aims 
to fulfil these aspirations without compromising standards. Some material supplies are procured centrally and 
through vendors from other parts of the country.
In FY2021-22, 63% of the Company’s procurement was derived from local State vendors and 26% from the same 
district.
