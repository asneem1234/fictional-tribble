Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements :
EIL has focused on providing innovative technological solutions for energy security, carbon neutral technologies, measures to reduce 
energy and carbon footprints, renewable energy development including green hydrogen & solar power, improving bio-diversity and 
similar measures to combat the existing ESG challenges. In the rapidly changing global energy landscape, carbon intensity is becoming a 
key performance indicator for the success of any organization. New project investments are also diverted towards clean & green 
technologies instead of carbon intensive technological solutions. Hence, it is quite essential to become a net zero service provider to 
enhance company’s brand Image. EIL has also been providing consultancy in the area of hazardous and solid waste management. EIL is 
committed towards assisting its esteemed clientele in their energy transition journey towards net zero by providing clean and green 
technological solutions leading to a sustainable future for the generations to come. In view of the above, EIL has declared 2035 as the 
target year to achieve Net Zero aiming towards fulfilling our Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision to be Net Zero by 2070. EIL has also taken 
several initiatives for its own premises to minimize the water & electricity consumption, recycling wastewater, utilizing solar energy, 
reducing solid waste generation, bio-digesting canteen waste, increasing biodiversity etc. EIL has minimized water consumption in its 
premises by installing water saving nozzles & recovery of water from sewage generated to the extent possible. EIL has state-of-the-art 
sewage treatment plants at its Gurugram, Chennai and Mumbai offices, wherein the treated sewage is recycled & reused for secondary 
applications within the office premises. EIL has also reduced solid waste generation within its premises by replacing plastic tea cups 
with washable tea mugs. EIL’s print paper reduction program continues to expand across the board in the organization.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
EIL has certified its HSE Management system to ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) and ISO 14001 (Environmental 
Management system). An independent department (Corporate HSE) audits the HSE Management system of all divisions/departments including 
construction sites. The results of these audits are reported to the Management through Management Review Committee Meetings. Apart from 
other Agenda, the performance of the HSE management system and opportunities for improvement are presented to the Management in these 
meetings. A number of improvements pertaining to Health, Safety and Environment are triggered and addressed through these meetings. 
Digitization of employee claims, organizing health camps, health talks, improvement in safety processes are few examples.
On the engineering front, HSE aspects that are to be addressed in the design engineering phases are built into the procedures/specifications of 
various engineering departments. Exhaustive HSE checklists are in place to ensure that these aspects are complied positively during process 
design and engineering phases. 
Being a renowned engineering consultant in the hydrocarbon sector, EIL deploys proven risk assessment methodologies like HAZOP, RRA, QRA

construction contractors, has been revised during this year in line with the current trends and to improve the HSE performance. Award to 
construction sites based on HSE performance, Issue of appreciation certificates in best performing construction contractors, are a couple of 
other examples of improvements implemented during this year. EIL celebrated National Safety week across its offices and sites and the 
celebrations were used as a platform for improving safety awareness amongst the employees. 
Apart from the rating system for construction sites, EIL has introduced HSE award mechanism for Individuals. The objective of these reward 
mechanism is to foster and promote the culture of safety.
To enhance HSE competence, employees have attended various trainings in HSE domain, namely, ISO 45001 auditor certification, ISO 14001 
auditor certification and other special trainings specific to construction safety.
