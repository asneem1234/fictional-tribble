BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
FOREWORD
Over the years, the global outlook towards Company’s performance have changed with evolving externalities. COVID-19 pandemic, 
evolving regulatory landscape and increasing stakeholder traction on issues such as climate change, equality and ethical governance 
have evaluated companies’ resilience in recent years. These changes have reiterated the importance of integrating sustainability and 
transparency strategically into their business operations. 
Our focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and business growth are both essential ingredients for long-term 
sustainability and as a responsible Corporate Citizen, we believe in creating a strong business which touches lives responsibly. Continuing 
our sustainability journey and commitment towards National Voluntary Guidelines, we present our first Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) as envisaged by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”). The BRSR report contains a 
comprehensive list of measurable KPIs for its nine principles, encompassing ethical business practices, product stewardship, employee 
wellbeing, safety & development , stakeholder engagement, human rights, environmental stewardship, public policy advocacy, inclusive 
growth and responsible customer relationship.
We have voluntarily started our BRSR reporting journey in FY 2021-22 itself as a best practice ahead of time and we aim to enhance our 
processes, policies and reporting going forward. We will continue being a responsible and a sustainable Company creating value for all 
our stakeholders and touching lives responsibly.

Product quality 
and safety 
Risk
The use of high-quality and 
safe goods ensures that 
improved health outcomes 
are attained. Compromise 
on pharmaceutical product 
quality would imply a 
compromise on patients’ 
overall health and wellbeing. 
This will also entail failure 
to comply with GxP (Good 
Laboratory Practices, Good 
Manufacturing Practices and 
Good Clinical Practices).
Any lapse can lead to 
product withdrawals, recalls, 
regulatory action, decreased 
sales, reputational risk, 
increased litigation followed 
by increase in litigation 
expense.
•	
Drug product quality and patient 
safety are the fundamental 
principles for Torrent Pharma. The 
Company being in the healthcare 
sector, the nature of its business 
requires the utmost attention to 
the quality of its product. We have 
taken following measures to ensure 
resilience against the risk:
•	
The Company has in place 
strong Pharmacovigilance system 
through which all the stakeholders 
can access the adverse event / 
product complaint reporting form 
on the website of the Company 
or dedicated phone line and a 
dedicated mailbox. 
•	
The Pharmacovigilance department 
of the Company oversees 
monitoring and managing the safety 
of all of our products throughout 
their lifespan, employing rigorous 
systems and procedures to 
ensure that manufacturing quality 
standards, GMP compliance, and 
other regulatory criteria are met.
•	
Audits are conducted by the Quality 
Assurance department to ensure 
that our high-quality requirements 
are met.
•	
Risks are sought to be managed 
by appropriate laboratory and 
clinical studies for each new 
product, compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practices and 
independent quality assurance 
systems.

Innovation: 
Strengthening 
R&D pipeline 
Opportunity
Innovation and R&D plays an 
important role in determining 
the long-term success of 
our Company. The cutting-
edge research includes 
engaging in the discovery 
of NCEs, developing new 
processes for known APIs 
and developing value-
added and differentiated 
formulations. These 
developments come out as 
the differentiators for the 
Company, and thus, leads 
to an increase in revenues 
as well. We have committed 
to invest dedicatedly to tap 
opportunities and introduce 
new therapies, medical 
benefits and formulations 
across the globe.

Water and 
wastewater 
management 
Risk
There is a great degree of 
dependency on uninterrupted 
supply of water for continued 
operations. Therefore, water 
management becomes 
crucial for the Company’s 
operations. With changing 
climate and drought like 
conditions, water availability 
is increasingly becoming 
a risk across different 
geographies.
Secondly, wastewater 
management is highly 
crucial for pharmaceutical 
industry. The presence of 
pharmaceutical compounds 
in environment is recognized 
as emerging micro pollutants 
in aquatic environment, 
which can indirectly impact 
human and animal health. 
If not managed properly, 
it can lead to high level of 
ecological risk. 
The Company is not only adhering to 
the statutory criteria set forth by the 
Central Ground Water Authority & State 
Government water supply agency for 
surface water supply, but it is also 
taking responsibility for reducing use 
through effective recycling.
Water recycling systems are in place in 
water-stressed locations such as Indrad 
and Pithampur manufacturing facilities, 
Bileshwarpura project site and R&D 
centre. The water efficient designs limit 
the amount of water that can be utilized 
in different operations. Water usage 
monitoring across units enables us to 
strategize the reduction efforts.
We also make certain that our effluents 
are treated properly before being reused 
or discharged. At our manufacturing 
facilities, we have a high-tech ETP and 
a three-stage effluent recycling RO 
system.
For more information, please refer 
to ‘Natural Capital’ section of the 
Integrated Report.
Negative
Energy 
efficient and

energy
Opportunity
Renewable energy is 
expanding at a quicker rate 
than it has ever been before. 
The cost of renewable 
energy has dropped because 
of increased government 
support and continued 
research and development. 
Energy efficiency also serves 
major opportunity to reduce 
operational costs in the long 
term and is also one of the 
decarbonization levers for 
our Company. 
For more information, please

section of the Integrated 
Report.

Employees are our biggest

This material aspect is 
therefore an opportunity to 
integrate employees’ views 
in the core functioning of the

Positive
Equality
Opportunity
Investing in equality and 
diversity brings numerous 
benefits to the Company. 
From bringing skills to the 
team, respecting each and 
every employee’s rights, 
promoting innovation and 
diverse views, enhancing 
Company’s reputation, 
and promoting new talent. 
We believe in giving equal 
opportunities to everyone 
irrespective of caste, gender, 
color, religion or any other 
bias.
Positive
Ethics and 
business 
integrity 
Risk
Torrent Pharma is a global 
Company with millions of 
stakeholders. Any ethical 
and business integrity breach 
can hamper the Company’s 
credibility, employee morale 
and may result to significant 
fines and financial loss. 
We have zero tolerance for any ethical 
and business integrity breach within 
the Company. The Principles enshrined 
in the Company’s Code of Business 
Conduct guide the work culture in 
terms of ethics and law. The Code in 
real sense promotes honesty, trust, 
accountability and transparency. 
It establishes key corporate and 
organizational ideals that influence the 
value system and business operations.
Every new employee receives a Code 
of Business Conduct orientation at the 
time of joining, ensuring that they fully 
comprehend, embrace, and adapt to 
the Code.
Its implementation and adherence is 
aided by a powerful vigil mechanism 
that monitors deviations or disrespect in 
any form.

Adherence to

Torrent Pharma operates 
in various territories and 
markets, each having its 
own regulatory landscape, 
which continuously evolves 
changes, and undergoes 
increased scrutiny from 
the regulators. Any non-
compliance with regulations 
or scrutiny process can result 
in dilution of financial position 
or jeopardize the Company's 
reputation.
Regulatory risks are managed through 
a strong governance mechanism based 
on the philosophy of ‘zero tolerance to 
non-compliance’. This is implemented 
through: 
•	
Assessment of regulatory and 
compliance requirements on regular 
basis
•	
Robust internal controls 
•	
Compliance management systems 
and continuous monitoring 
•	
Internal communication and training 
on the ethics standards and

SECTION C: PRINCIPLE WISE PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE
PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner 
that is Ethical, Transparent and Accountable.
At Torrent Pharma, we always believe that highest level of Corporate Governance practices is pre-requisite for 
growing sustainable and successful business. The sound governance processes and systems guide the Company 
on its journey towards continued success. The Company has built its Corporate Governance practices on the three 
inviolable principles of TRANSPARENCY, INTEGRITY and ACCOUNTABILITY. We ensure that the Company and its 
employees act in a way that is effective, ethical, accountable, and transparent at all levels. On a continual basis, we 
also maintain responsive, inclusive, participative, and representative decision-making. 
Our Core Values, which we believe in and constantly strives to build are: Integrity, Passion for Excellence, Participative Decision Making, 
Concern for Society & Environment, Fairness with Care and Transparency.
Each of these Timeless Values, a Pillar of Strength, ENSURES OUR LONGEVITY. 
INTEGRITY: When Truth is Paramount
Thoughts and actions entail doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances; whether or not anyone is watching. This requires 
inner courage and conviction, no matter what the consequences are. It is honoring one’s commitments and being accountable for one’s 
actions, end-to-end.
PASSION FOR EXCELLENCE: When best is not enough
Passion for excellence means not doing extra-ordinary things, but doing ordinary things in all pursuits exceedingly well. Passion and 
excellence are forces that fuel each other on the exclusive path to leadership. As we are what we repeatedly do, excellence then is not 
an act, but a habit.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22

PARTICIPATIVE DECISION MAKING: Involvement that engenders effectiveness
An ideal organisation facilitates participation and involvement of each of its members in various decision making processes, thus 
ensuring their commitment to such decisions as well as its outcome. It provides a platform for seeking and nurturing constructive ideas 
from individuals, teams and units which eventually yields exceptional results.
CONCERN FOR SOCIETY & ENVIRONMENT: When every smile matters 
Concern for Society & Environment is a sense of responsibility and contribution to society that defines our existence. It entails making 
a difference in the quality of lives and environment surrounding us. It is important to encourage fellow-members on collective as well as 
individual basis to fulfil the responsibility of leaving behind a world rich in flora and fauna and rich in time tested values and ideals and 
above all rich in social fervour for our future generations.
FAIRNESS WITH CARE: Harnessing equality
Fairness and Care towards all fellow members are inextricably linked. Weaving the threads of equality, irrespective of caste, creed, 
religion and gender, into the day-to-day fabric, ensures fairness for each and every individual. Empathic care recognizes needs and 
aspirations of all. Only such fairness and care eventually lead fellow members to the dawn of eternal success.
TRANSPARENCY: Openness that builds enduring trust
Transparency implies openness. It is the opposite of secrecy. It encourages more informed decision making and aids in creating 
enduring trust among all stakeholders.
 
Our Core values are aligned with the nine Principles of NGRBC. 
At Torrent Pharma, we firmly believe and adhere to transparent, fair and ethical governance practices to encourage professionalism, 
honesty, integrity and ethical behavior. The Board of Directors have formulated a Code of Business Conduct (“the Code”), which is 
applicable to all the employees and Board Members of the Company, and which lays down the important corporate ethical practices that 
shape the Company’s business practices and represents the ever cherished values of the Company. The Code is an extension of our 
values and reflects our continued commitment to ethical business practices across our operations.
In this endeavor to create enduring value for all our stakeholders and to ensure the highest level of honesty, integrity and ethics 
in all its operations, the Company has adopted the ‘Whistle Blower Policy’. Through this Policy, the Company encourages its 
stakeholders to bring to the Company’s attention any instances of unethical behavior, actual or suspected incidents of fraud or 
violation of Company’s Code of Business Conduct that could adversely impact the Company’s operation, business performance 
and reputation.
In order to protect investors’ interest, the Company has adopted this Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by 
Designated Persons.
The Related Party Transactions Policy of the Company provides the process for the approval of various types of Related Party 
Transactions (RPTs) and general principles governing RPTs. This brings necessary transparency in the RPTs and ensures that the 
transactions are fair and in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.
The Policy on Materiality of Events or Information brings consistency in the disclosure of various events or information to the Stock 
Exchanges in accordance with the thresholds determined.
