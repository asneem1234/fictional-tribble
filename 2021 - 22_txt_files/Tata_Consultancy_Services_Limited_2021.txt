Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG  related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)31
	
TCS has set forth its new carbon reduction goal to reduce its absolute greenhouse 
gas emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 70% by 2025 (over 2016 base year), 
and to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. The new goal is after having achieved 
the previous target of reducing its specific carbon footprint by half by 2020 (versus 
baseline year FY 2008), ahead of schedule.
	
N G Subramaniam, COO & Executive Director, TCS32: “Our net zero goal underlines 
our renewed commitment to environmental stewardship. To curb emissions and 
limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to 
pre-industrial levels, all organizations will have to reimagine existing business models 
and aim for sustainable growth. We are in a unique position to combine our purpose-
driven world view with digital innovation to not only drive our own sustainability, but 
also partner with customers, civil society and governments to lead and shape solutions 
for a sustainable future,” 
	
At the core of TCS’ strategy to reduce its carbon footprint is improved energy 
efficiency through the addition of more green buildings to the company’s real estate 
portfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, and the use of TCS Clever Energy™, 
which leverages IoT, machine learning and AI to optimize energy consumption across 
campuses. TCS’ Vision 25x25 is a strategic lever that delinks TCS’ business growth 
from campus expansion, and brings down emissions related to employee commutes 
and business travel. Other elements of the company’s net zero aspiration include 
greater use of renewable sources of energy and carbon removal offsets.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the 
entity59.
	
TCS engages with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, to deepen its insights 
into their needs and expectations, and to develop sustainable strategies for the 
short, medium and long term. Stakeholder engagement also helps to manage 
risks and opportunities in business operations. The key stakeholders identified 
in consultation with the company’s management are: customers, employees, 
shareholders, academic institutions, head-hunters, staffing firms, other 
suppliers, partners and collaborators, industry bodies such as NASSCOM and CII, 
governments, NGOs, local communities, regulators and society at large. 
	
Some other stakeholders that TCS closely engages with – such as industry 
analysts, equity analysts, and the news media –are proxies for other named 
stakeholders – i.e. customers, shareholders, and society at large, respectively. 
	
Stakeholder interactions might be structured (e.g. surveys, account 
statements) or unstructured (town halls, 1x1 meetings). Based on mutual 
convenience and need, the engagement maybe scheduled as needed, or 
pre-scheduled on a periodic basis (fortnightly/ monthly/ quarterly/ annual) or 
continuous (e.g. website, social media).

Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy 
intensity, in the following format70:
	
TCS uses multiple energy sources in its daily operations, electricity being the 
primary source. Majority of the electricity comes from conventional sources, 
but TCS has increased the share of renewable electricity (RE) over the 
years through onsite rooftop solar generation, third party procurement and 
purchase of Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) (in select geographies). Other 
sources of energy include natural gas (mainly used for space heating/cooling), 
district heating and cooling, fuel used in company owned vehicles, cooking gas 
used in cafeteria and diesel used in diesel generators (mainly used as a back-
up source for power shortages). The RE consumption as a % of total electricity 
consumption has increased from 15.6% in FY 2021 to 37.2% in FY 2022 The 
electricity used across India operations reduced by 6.5% Y-o-Y. For global 
operations, there is an increase in total electricity use by 2.7% Y-o-Y due to 
the increased reporting boundary in FY 2022 covering operations in North 
America (NA), Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe and Middle East.

74 TCS has not calculated the emission intensity per full time employee (FTE) during the 
pandemic years as the employees working out of offices was very less.
7.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas 
emission? If Yes, then provide details75.
	
Yes. TCS has taken up the target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 
carbon footprint by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030. To achieve 
these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key 
levers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, 
and renewable energy. These energy efficiency initiatives have resulted in 
avoidance of GHG emissions of approximately 3,200 tCO2e in FY 2022.
	
Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:
	
All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building 
standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have roof top solar 
photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. Currently, 34 TCS 
offices spanning across over 28.2 million sq. ft of office area, are certified 
green buildings by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). These make up over 
64.4% of TCS’ total real estate portfolio in India.
	
In FY 2022, projects were taken up to improve the energy efficiency in 
existing buildings as well through retrofits. Cooling systems were upgrade to 
efficient energy star rated appliances. UPS resizing and consolidation. Modular 
UPS were adopted where feasible. Other auxiliaries like pumps, cooling towers, 
etc. were also replaced. TCS’ resource optimization center continues to help 
monitor the energy use on real time basis to optimize it further by leveraging 
AI and ML.
	
Green IT:
	
Green IT initiatives include a) IT Energy optimization in Data center and 
Equipment rooms and b) IT energy optimization in the delivery centers. Data 
center and Equipment room efficiency projects included replacement of over 
75 GRI 305-5
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  |  220
20 UPSs and 30 cooling units with more efficiency systems. The company 
achieved PUE of 1.65 at the two owned-premise TCS data centers at Yantra 
Park and Siruseri. Looking forward, the company is incorporating next-gen 
green data center practices with futuristic and modular technologies like 
Modular UPS, Cold Aisle Containment, real time monitoring of temperature 
and energy consumption, etc​. For IT energy optimization in the delivery 
center, the energy efficiency initiatives are through switching off/replacement 
of excess capacity/inefficient UPSs, replacement of desktops with laptops​ and 
improved rack per user ratio.
	
Renewable Energy 
	
The company continued to augment the roof top solar photo voltaic 
installations this year as well taking the total installed capacity to 10.2 MWp 
contributing to 3.76 percent of total electricity use in the reporting year. 
Solar roof top installations at Adibatla Hyderabad (2,154 kWp) and TCS 
Center Kochi (207 kWp) was completed within the reporting year. The 
company increased the renewable energy procurement through third party 
PPA for solar energy at TCS Siruseri office and switch over to green tariff 
for its operations in the states of Karnataka and Maharashtra. This resulted 
in an increase in the renewable energy use to 37.2% of the company’s total 
energy use in FY 2022. TCS is committed to improve the RE mix in its energy 
portfolio further in the coming years.
	
Carbon Neutrality:
	
The company has become carbon neutral across Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon 
footprint for its operations in Asia Pacific (APAC)76 , Europe and North 
America (NA) for FY 2022 in line with PAS 2060:2014 standards assured by 
Bureau Veritas India Limited.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your 
establishments. Describe   the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes80.
	
TCS being an IT services and consulting organization, does not manufacture 
physical products and therefore does not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals 
in any of its processes. The company has offices and facility operations, and 
the waste is generated from the auxiliary processes used to run these facilities. 
Based on the nature of services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic, 
electrical, and municipal solid waste, and generate very less hazardous waste 
and do not use toxic chemicals. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes 
such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil are generated in relatively 
smaller proportions which are disposed through government approved 
recyclers as per regulations. E-waste is disposed to government approved 
e-waste recyclers. 
	
TCS is committed to sustain the best practices that have already been 
institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes, 100% compliance to 
management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and 
100% recycling on printer and toner cartridges, paper and packaging wastes. 
TCS also ensures 100% disposal of biomedical waste (BMW) through govt 
authorized BMW disposal agencies in India as per regulatory requirements. 
The company targets to maximize the recycling and reuse of all waste 
categories to divert waste from landfill.

a “gold standard of privacy” addressing applicable privacy regulations and based on inputs from industry bodies dealing with privacy. 
100 GRI 2-23
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  |  231
	
The Global Privacy policy covers all stakeholders 
across the value chain 	including – employees 
(full-time and contracted), customers, partners, 
vendors/suppliers, and any other stakeholder 
whose Personal Data is processed. All third 
parties (vendors/suppliers) are engaged / 
contracted with adequate due diligence, and 
commitment towards privacy obligations.
	
From a cyber security aspect, TCS has 
implemented cutting edge security tools to 
protect itself from external as well as internal 
threats.
	
TCS has moved to a proactive early detection 
approach. Any approach to protect an 
organization from threats, needs to focus 
on all the risks and learnings from various 
attacks, understanding the modus operandi 
of the attacker and ensure that adequate 
processes and latest in technology are 
implemented to protect and provide proactive 
detection capabilities. TCS has implemented a 
comprehensive threat intelligence framework 
to proactively identify external threats as they 
unfold globally, be it a ransomware propagation, 
a nation state actor group, attackers for purely 
monetary gain etc. The threat intelligence 
framework includes gathering intel on external 
threats by means of commercial, government, 
open source and vendor security feeds, threat 
hunting in dark web, analyse new attack patterns 
and constantly monitoring the publication of 
vulnerabilities or various tools and software 
in use in the organization. The threat intel 
information is processed in TCS’ AI/ML based 
correlation tools and automated scripts ensure 
that the indicators of compromise from the 
threat feeds are automictically blocked on the 
perimeter devices.
	
TCS has also rearchitected its network and 
has implemented tools in tandem to work in 
a defence in depth model to provide a holistic 
protection against threat vectors/actors. 
The defence in depth model has a strong 
multi-layered perimeter setup consisting 
of Next Gen Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention 
Systems, DDoS attack protection for critical 
resources, Web Application Firewalls, Advanced 
malware protection and other email gateway 
security controls. TCS network design is 
compartmentalized for every customer and 
critical resources to ensure that the services 
provided to each customer remains isolated. 
This network design ensures that if there is an 
impact at one customer end, say a ransomware 
attack on a customer network, the segregated 
network along with the company’s incident 
response process ensures that there is no 
impact to other network segments.
	
In addition to the perimeter defences, TCS has 
implemented technical controls and processes 
within the network to protect the information 
resources. Tools based on machine learning that 
can detect and prevent known and unknown 
ransomware, malware and active intruder 
attempts to exploit like lateral movement, 
privilege escalation or credential dumping in 
addition to many other malicious actions. AI/
ML tools that can detect behaviour anomalies 
of users. Tools that can correlate audit logs 
from various sources. Alerts from these tools 
are monitored 24x7x365 by the TCS Cyber 
Security Operations Center.
	
TCS has also implanted a strong vulnerability 
management program which includes 
proactively identifying vulnerabilities in its 
network and systems by conducting periodic 
vulnerability assessments, penetration tests and 
red team exercises.
