Yes. 
NLCIL follows mining activities as per guidelines and procedures stipulated by the Government and has taken number 
of Green/ Sustainability initiatives such as use of Clean Energy technologies for Mine production, large scale green belt 
development, bio-reclamation of derelict mined out land and farming, utilization of renewable energy such as Wind & 
Solar. 
The extensive green belt developed in NLCIL acts as a natural carbon sink and improves the Air quality of the surroundings. 
Every year nearly 100 Ha of land is being reclaimed and afforested by planting 2500 trees per Ha as per guidelines of the 
Ministry. 
The use of latest technologies in Thermal plants such as ESP, Super Critical Boilers, FGD (to be implemented), etc.,, are 
helping to reduce the emission levels within the prescribed norms. 
All the Units are adopting energy conservation measures to augment the reduction of GHG emissions. 
NLCIL’s venture into renewable energy has proved to be a great stride forward to reduce the dependence on coal fuels in 
our country. NLCIL has implemented 1370.06 MW of Solar 
& 51 MW of Wind Power Plants at various places. The introduction 
of battery cars in NLCIL General Hospital was implemented to reduce the carbon footprint due to conventional vehicles. 
Future Endeavours: 
NLCIL has bagged 510 MW through Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) under CPSU scheme 
and 150 MW through Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). 
Under Smart City Scheme, 10 MW Solar Project will be implemented at Neyveli. 
NLCIL has planned to establish 4250MW of renewable energy projects in Tamilnadu and various states. 
The shift towards adoption of renewable power generation will considerably reduce the dependence on coal fuel and 
most of all it will further reduce the Carbon footprint of the industry in the near future.
