This section is aimed at helping entities demonstrate their performance in integrating the Principles and Core Elements with

ethically responsible.
PRINCIPLE 1 : Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner 
that is Ethical, Transparent and Accountable.
Integrity, transparency and accountability
The Company’s Code of Conduct is the framework that explains the behavior the Company expects of every employee and 
stakeholder who work with it. The Company’s Code of Conduct provides a framework to put business principles into practice 
with utmost integrity. It is a breach of the Company Code of Conduct to fail to report a violation or suspected violation that 
employees know about or to refuse to co-operate with the investigation of a suspected violation. Each employee is responsible 
for ensuring that his or her conduct and the conduct of anyone reporting to the employee fully comply with all applicable laws 
and the Company Code of Conduct. The Company with guidance from Group has developed and implemented a systematic 
approach designed to prevent, detect and resolve any potential integrity concerns. This is supported by tools and processes 
and a zero-tolerance policy for any violations.
The Company’s integrity program has created an environment where all its employees can be open about identifying risks, 
asking questions, and raising concerns. This is in line with the Group using a systematic approach, designed to foster a culture 
of integrity and compliance. This is carried out through leadership and business accountability, supported by strong tools and 
processes, and a zero-tolerance policy for violations. As a part of the integrity program, employees of the Company are not 
just encouraged but are required to speak up and to report any suspected or observed violations of the law, the Company 
Code of Conduct, or if they are asked to do something that might be a violation. They are to report on any of their concerns 
initially to their direct management, country head of integrity, country human resources manager, or alternatively, through 
country specific business ethics hotline numbers and e-mail which is routed to the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), which 
is a corporate function within the Company. The Company’s OSI along with the integrity team then work towards investigation, 
and resolution of issues reported there-in. The Company has multiple reporting channels available to all its employees/
stakeholders and this includes a business ethics hotline and an email id that is available for employees to report integrity and 
compliance concerns or seek guidance. There is a web-based reporting system available for employee/stakeholders reporting 
(http://pg.ethicspoint.com/). All reports received are subjected to appropriate investigation, follow up, and brought to full 
closure; systematic process and tracking system and the Company enforces a rigorous non-retaliation policy. The Company’s 
Anti-Corruption Policy is stated explicitly in the Corporate Regulations on bribery and anti-corruption and emphasizes key 
components that are essential for ensuring strict compliance to anti-bribery laws but also refraining from corruption. The 
Company enforces a rigorous zero-tolerance policy against any involvement in bribery or corruption and has put in place robust 
policies to prevent bribery such as on gifts, entertainment and expenses, charitable contributions and representatives, and 
measures to ensure ethical supply chains. 
The Company also ensures continuous compliance with competition and anti-trust laws. The Company Code of Conduct requires 
the Company to compete fairly, safeguard confidential information and be mindful of anti-trust risks. The Company’s behavior 
within its teams, with customers, other business partners and in the communities where it operates, are guided by its business 
principles - respect, responsibility and determination - in compliance with anti-trust requirements. The Anti-Trust Guidance Notes 
aim to address practical business situations and provide rules and guidance for all Company employees on how to conduct 
themselves in order to comply with anti-trust requirements. The Company has an Internal Complaints Committee for the prevention 
of sexual harassment as a part of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 
2013 that aims to provide protection against sexual harassment of women in the workplace and for prevention and redressal of 
complaints of sexual harassment and for matters connected there with or incidentals thereto. The Company has Internal 
Complaints Committee at each location and establishments (all locations where more than 10 women are employed).

PRINCIPLE 2 : Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable
and safe
The Company strive to have a life-cycle perspective when managing environmental aspects and impact. This means looking 
beyond the environmental impact from our own operations to include our supply chain, the use of our products, and the end of 
their lives. Environmental considerations are constantly made to reduce environmental impact and risks over the lifespan of our 
solutions. Life-cycle Assessments (LCAs) and risks as well as collaboration with and feedback from customers are used as input 
for improving the environmental performance of our products, systems, and services.
The most recent HVDC light technology reduces climate impact by 67% compared to previous generations, thanks to lower power 
losses. Reduced risk of environmental incidents through dry type transformers and bushings, minimizing contamination and fire 
risks. Reduced risk of environmental incidents thanks to biodegradable ester fluids in transformers.
For decades, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has been the norm in the electrification industry due to its excellent insulation and switching 
capabilities. However, it has high Global Warming Potential (GWP), and its life-cycle management requires careful handling.
As part of our commitment to reduce emissions and enable a sustainable energy future, Hitachi Energy have invested in
eco-efficient alternative solutions like EconiQ™ and enhanced SF6 life-cycle management striving for zero leaks. The Company 
will improve SF6 management through the implementation of a new SF6 management standard.

PRINCIPLE 6 : Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment 
	
Hitachi Energy is a global technology leader that is advancing a sustainable energy future for all. The Company serves 
customers in the utility, industry and infrastructure sectors with innovative solutions and services across the value chain. 
Together with customers and partners, the Company pioneers technologies and enable the digital transformation required 
to accelerate the energy transition towards a carbon-neutral future. The Company is advancing the world’s energy system 
to become more sustainable, flexible and secure whilst balancing social, environmental and economic value.
	
To meet the changing needs of a growing population and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, large-scale volumes of 
variable energy generated from renewable sources need to be efficiently integrated into the world’s energy system.
To facilitate the deployment of technology at the scale and speed required, The Company believes that it must adapt and 
adopt new business models and collaborate with all stakeholders to support sustainable, flexible and secure energy 
systems such as power grids. As more renewable power sources join to gradually replace carbon-based energy, the 
Company needs to ensure grids remain resilient, and become more flexible as they adapt to fast-changing demands and 
increasing decentralization. Only through effective digitalization of all elements of the energy value chain can this be 
delivered. Making energy more accessible, affordable, and sustainable also needs better energy efficiency at all stages 
of distribution and a reduced environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of all components.
	
Sustainability 2030 is new strategic plan for sustainability where the Company summarizes the main commitments to act 
and drive business in a sustainable way. Based around four pillars: Planet, People, Peace and Partnerships. 
	
Hitachi Energy India understands that ESG factors have become the norm to build resilient and successful businesses. 
Our ESG targets are aligned with the four pillars of Sustainability 2030 plan : Planet, People, Peace and Partnerships.
Our strategy draws from the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, where each pillar has corresponding targets that drive 
our business to contribute social value, environmental value and economic value. 
	
Together with customers, partners, and key stakeholders, the Company is contributing to accelerating the energy 
transition to ensure a sustainable energy future for all.

By 2030, the Company aims to achieve carbon-neutrality in our own operations. The Company is targeting to reducing 
carbon emissions by 50% along the value chain. And reducing waste – along with our use of precious resources, like water. 
	
To achieve carbon-neutrality in our own operations, our first step is to invest in fossil-free electricity and energy efficiency, 
ensuring our facilities are as efficient as possible.
	
In December 2021, the company has reached its first step target to use 100% fossil-free electricity in its own operations, 
showing fast progress in achieving its Sustainability 2030 target of becoming carbon-neutral in own operations. By using 
100% fossil-free electricity in our own operations, the Company has reduced our CO2 equivalent emissions by over 50% 
compared to 2019. The Company did this through projects generating own fossil-free electricity, such as installing solar 
roof panels, switching electricity contracts to green tariffs, buying International Renewable Energy Certificates (IRECs), 
and signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). 
	
The company is continuing to invest in its journey towards carbon-neutrality by further increasing energy efficiency,
as well as electrifying its own operations.
	
The Company’s ambition extends beyond carbon-neutrality. The Company is working to reduce waste – along with our 
consumption of precious resources, like freshwater. The Company will support SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and 
Production) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). The Company will minimize the use of water, materials, pollution, 
and waste in our operations and throughout the life cycle of our solutions through a circular mindset.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
	
	
Yes, Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is part of Hitachi Energy’s organizational resilience program. It is designed to 
reduce the impact of a business interruption which could occur due to a range of events ranging from financial, natural 
causes or man-made events. It helps Business Unit/Function to respond effectively to the disruption and restore its 
essential services and mission critical processes as quickly as possible to ensure timely recovery. It provides a reference 
tool for the actions required during or immediately following an emergency or incident that threatens to disrupt Business 
Unit/Function normal business activities.
46
|  HITACHI ENERGY INDIA LIMITED    ANNUAL REPORT 2021–22
	
The key objectives of this business continuity plan are to:
•	
Identify advanced preparations and procedures that will enable Business Unit/Function to respond quickly to 
disruptive incidents, and ensure continuity of critical business functions
•	
Reduce employee injury or loss of life, and minimize damage and losses
•	
Have documented plans and procedures to ensure effective execution of recovery strategies for critical business functions
•	
Reduce and mitigate disruptions to business operations
•	
Identify teams which would need to respond to incidents and define specific responsibilities
•	
Quantify the impact of incidents in terms of monetary, time, operations, and work force
•	
Recover quickly from an emergency and resume full operations
Steps
Key Business Processes & Recovery Priorities
	
List all the key processes and sub processes that must be maintained or quickly restored in the event of a disruptive incident. 
It provides a high-level description for each of the process and assigns a priority (criticality) ranking to each of them. 
Risk assessment
	
Risk assessment is one of the main parts of the BCM system. The RA process involves identification, analysis, and evaluation 
of all possible risks, hazards, and threats to the operating environment, and defines likelihood / impact of disruptive events 
caused by such threats.
Once the risks have been identified, their impact on different aspects of operations are gauged. Those risks which affect 
mission-critical operations should be handled first. The following strategy is used to handle risks:
•	
Prevent – Risks which are of high probability with high impact. These risks must be attended first by using mitigation, 
prevention or any other strategy to lessen or avoid its impact
•	
Accept – Risks which have low probability and low impact. Nothing specific needs to be done for such risks, but the 
organization should be vigilant. If a back-up strategy is put in place for such a risk, all the better
•	
Contain – Risks which have a high probability of occurring but having low impact on operations. Use mitigation 
strategies to minimize impact of the risk on business operations
•	
Plan – Low probability but high impact events. Though this may be once in a lifetime event, its impact could be 
disastrous. The business should plan the steps to be taken if such a risk occurs. Once the steps to be taken are in 
place, production can be resumed in the shortest possible time with the least loss
Business Impact Analysis
The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies and prioritizes the mission-critical business processes and key functions, 
disruption related operational impacts, and the resources (internal and external) required to recover critical operations.
A properly executed BIA will guide in reducing the overall operational and financial impacts, reduce potential losses, and 
enhance the business operations.
Business Continuity Strategy
Business Continuity Plan describes the strategy devised to maintain business continuity in the event of a disruption to 
operations. This strategy will be invoked when the primary facility(ies) somehow be damaged or inaccessible, and business 
critical operations are interrupted.
Recovery Priorities
The strategy is to recover critical business functions at an alternate site location (if an off-site strategy has been put into effect 
to provide recovery service). Critical business functions are the most critical for immediate recovery at the secondary location.
