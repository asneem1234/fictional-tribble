BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
With the vision of ‘Reaching people and touching lives 
globally as a leading provider of valued medicines’, we at 
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (“SPIL”) continue 
to build our legacy of integrating Environment, Social 
and Governance (ESG) parameters within our value 
creation model. While we continue our relentless focus 
and commitment towards ESG initiatives, we published 
our progress through our maiden Sustainability Report in 
the previous year. We further enhance our transparency 
in ESG disclosures, by voluntarily adopting the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report this year.
Governance
To embed ESG parameters within our business growth 
model, we have integrated the principles of sustainability 
within our corporate governance framework. Building 
on our legacy of caring for people, communities and 
the planet, we have adopted a diversified approach 
towards workforce welfare and community upliftment 
with a strong interlinkage to our commitment towards 
enhancing our environment performance.
Employee workforce and community upliftment
At Sun Pharma, our strong global workforce of 38,000+ 
employees including 22,000+ SPIL employees (including 
contractual) are integral to realising our vision. Our 
employees exhibited strong resoluteness during COVID-19 
pandemic by overcoming the difficulties with an unwavering 
strength. As part of our systemic efforts in creating a 
conducive working environment for employees across 
the functions, we have implemented relevant e-training 
modules, enabling the advancement of skill sets. Through 
the implementation of our inclusive policies, we aim to 
foster a culture of employee wellbeing and resource 
development within a well diversified workforce.
As a responsible Company striving towards the growth and 
upliftment of community, we implement Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) initiatives to augment our contribution 
towards social development. In FY 2021-22, we contributed 
towards initiatives pertaining to alleviation of the COVID-19 
impact on local communities by enhancing accessibility of 
medicines through mobile healthcare units. Further, we 
enhanced our positive impact on the community through 
rural infrastructure development projects, among others.
Environment
As a proud signatory of the India CEO forum on Climate 
Change, we have pledged to build a resilient business 
that factors around the important issue of environment 
protection. It reflects our resolute commitment 
towards climate change action plans in line with the 
recommendations of the Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDC) and the Paris agreement.
In cognizance with the growing momentum on climate 
change and sustainability, we have set targets for reducing 
carbon emissions by 35% by 2030 (for scope 1 and scope 
2 emissions), reducing water consumption by 10% by 
2025 and disposing 30 % of hazardous waste through 
co processing by 2025. As part of our target setting 
approach, we have developed a comprehensive road map 
inclusive of the energy, water and waste management 
plan, their corresponding implementation strategy and a 
combined strategy to integrate them within our existing 
growth model.
Through our transition from Business Responsibility Report 
(BRR) to Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(BRSR) this year, we envision to augment our transparency 
on the ESG performance amongst our stakeholders in 
accordance with the principles of SEBI’s National Guidelines 
on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). We endeavor 
to improve our sustainability performance by welcoming 
your valuable insights and feedback.

Yes.
	
14 out of 18 manufacturing and R&D locations in the Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited boundary are Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD). The Company implements water conservation through reduce, reuse, recharge and recycle 
approach within its manufacturing locations. As part of recycle initiative, the Company provides tertiary treatment to 
its effluent, the treated effluent water is then effectively recycled and reused as make-up water in cooling towers and 
in-house gardening. This enables the Company to implement ZLD at its manufacturing locations.

as well as outcome of such initiatives:
Initiative undertaken
Details of the initiative 
(Web-link, if any, may be provided along-with summary)
Outcome of the initiative
Heat pump
Heat pump is energy conservation device which is used to transfer heat from source to 
sink with small energy addition. It is used simultaneously generating hot water and chilled 
water. The utilisation of condensation and evaporation heat enables in reduction of fuel 
consumption in addition to saving the water used in cooling towers. Further, due to higher 
Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the heat pumps, steam consumption is minimised.
1.	 Reduction in fossil 
fuel consumption
Intelligent Flow 
Control System 
for compressed 
air System
 Intelligent Flow Controllers (IFC) are used in compressed air system for controlling air flow 
and minimising energy waste. IFC reduces artificial demand by controlling air flow and 
pressure being delivered to plant. Pressure study was conducted to evaluate supply and 
demand requirement of plant and IFC was installed to minimise energy losses.
1.	 Reduction 
in electricity 
consumption
SBT 
(Soil Biotechnology) 
For sewage 
treatment
The initiative is implemented with the aim of reducing the energy consumption and 
overall treatment cost of domestic waste in comparison with conventional treatment. 
Soil Bio- technology is a terrestrial system for wastewater treatment which is based 
on the principle of trickling filter. In this system, combination of physical processes like 
sedimentation, infiltration and biochemical processes are carried out to remove the 
suspended solids, organic and inorganic contents of the wastewater. The technology works 
on scientific principles such as Adsorption, Filtration, Biodegradation and Bio Indicator. 
Filter media which houses filter material, culture & catalyst helps in biodegradation of the 
adsorbed organic molecules which is essential for adsorptive site rejuvenation. Range of 
microflora ensures the microbial diversity required for degradation of various contaminants. 
Hence, the technology facilitates the treatment of sewage in effective manner and meet 
the desire parameters of treated water, further to which it can be recycled and reused.
