and key commitments which will 
guide our initiatives and actions 
for the coming years. 
Sustainability is becoming one of 
the key deciding factors during 
a consumer’s buying journey 
and this trend is shaping how 
the FMCG industry evolves. 
At Tata Consumer, ESG is 
ingrained in the way we think 
and operate and is a core part 
of our culture. Our ESG agenda 
has evolved to become sharper 
and more integrated, as we 
set out to achieve our ambition 
of becoming a leading FMCG 
Company. 
Good Governance forms the 
cornerstone of our business, 
and our Governance standards 
are best in class in the industry. 
This guides the Company’s 
strategy towards the way 
we do business, and we are 
constantly improving our policies 
and practices where needed. 
We are committed to defining, 
following and practicing the 
highest level of corporate 
governance across all our 
business functions. We will also 
continue to further strengthen 
data privacy and information 
security standards across our 
global operations. At the core 
of our corporate governance 
practice is the Board of the 
Company, which oversees how 
the management serves and 
protects the long-term interests 
of all our stakeholders. More 
than the majority of the Board, 
five out of 9, are independent 
members. As active and well-
informed members of the Board, 
they are fully committed to 
ensuring the highest standards 
of corporate governance. In 
addition, the Audit Committee, 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
& Sustainability Committee, 
and the Risk Management 
Committee are fully comprised 
of Independent Directors 
while 2/3rd of the Nomination 
& Remuneration Committee 
is made up of Independent 
directors, thus bringing their 
valuable perspective to the 
functioning of the Board and 
Board Committees.
Sustainability is an important 
parameter for stakeholders 
when they evaluate the 
Company and its prospects. 
We have a thoughtfully crafted 
value creation model to create 
enduring value for all our 
stakeholders. Our prudent 
and responsible choices have 
transformed into tangible and 
intangible outcomes over the 
short, medium, and long term.
Our range of products 
harmonizes with our ‘For 
Better’ philosophy. We are 
strengthening the ‘better-
for-you’ portfolio, to give our 
consumers access to great-
tasting products that enhance 
health and nutrition. As a 
consumer-centric company, 
we are also continually striving 
to understand and address 
the needs of the conscious 
consumer, who is interested in 
knowing where the products 
they consume are sourced 
from. We take special care in 
responsible sourcing of our 
tea and coffee products in 
collaboration with partners 
such as trustea and Rainforest 
Alliance. 
Consumers are also increasingly 
becoming aware of climate 
change, and its impact on the 
environment. TCP is doing 
its part in mitigating climate 
change. We are reducing our 
environmental footprint and 
we have ensured that 24% of 
the current energy needs for 
the India supply chain now get 
fulfilled from renewables. Our 
Himalayan Water factories are 
powered with solar energy and 
equipped with a biomass boiler 
for reducing GHG emissions. 
We have extended our good 
practices to our supply chain 
partners as well, such as 
support with Environment and 
Safety Management System 
certifications, renewable energy 
installation guidance and 
support, ensuring adherence to 
the Tata Code of Conduct and its 
principles among others. 
Our aim is to reduce the use 
of natural resources and 
create a positive impact 
through responsible resource 
management. We are also 
placing emphasis on the circular 
economy of packaging. Tata 
Consumer is one of the founding 
members of the India Plastics 
Pact and is also a member of the 
UK Plastics Pact. In fact, all our 
beverages’ factories worldwide 
are zero waste to landfill, with 
waste being disposed through 
authorized vendors, who recycle 
or re-purpose the same.
Apart from integrating 
sustainability in our operations, 
we also aim to create a culture 
which encourages employees 
to contribute to the community 
around them. Our employees 
across the globe have been 
contributing their time and 
efforts to serve the community 
Sustainability 
is becoming 
one of the 
key deciding 
factors during 
a consumer’s 
buying journey 
and this trend 
is shaping 
how the FMCG 
industry 
evolves. 
through various volunteering 
programmes. Our CSR 
programmes are designed for 
the betterment of communities 
with focus on critical areas 
spanning healthcare, nutrition, 
water management, education, 
and skill development for 
vulnerable groups in the 
communities we operate in – 
currently impacting over 8 lakh 
beneficiaries and aiming for 2 
million beneficiaries by 2030.
As a responsible corporate 
citizen, safeguarding human 
rights is an integral part 
of doing our business. The 
Business and Human Rights 
Policy at TCP is well aligned 
to the required standards of 
International Bodies and the 
Tata Code of Conduct. Our 
employees remain our most 
valued assets and diversity 
is an important parameter 
in building a well-balanced 
workforce. We launched 
Women’s Inclusion Network 
(WIN), a global forum to foster 
inclusion and bring together 
women across the Company to 
connect, learn, and grow.
A business is truly successful 
when it can create meaningful 
positive change and benefit 
communities. At Tata 
Consumer, we believe that 
shared prosperity is paramount, 
and we will continue to 
do our bit to build resilient 
communities. We have been 
focusing on environmental 
welfare and social progress 
for over a decade now. With 
a strong foundation, network 
and several initiatives in place, 
we will continue to build on 
the Tata Group’s philosophy of 
giving back to the planet and 
the community.
With warm regards,
Sunil D'Souza

ABOUT THE 
REPORT
This is TCP’s second 
sustainability report and our 
first Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report 
(BRSR). The recently published 
Integrated Report FY ‘22 
has detailed sections on 
sustainability and value 
creation and has been 
accordingly cross-referenced 
for ease of understanding. 
The annual report is aligned 
to the International Integrated 
Reporting Council (IIRC) and 
has sections detailed on the six 
capitals and value creation. 
 
This report highlights our 
ESG approach, strategy, and 
disclosure on the basis of the 
BRSR template and guidelines. 
The BRSR seeks disclosures 
from listed entities on their 
performance against the nine 
principles of the ‘National 
Guidelines on Responsible 
Business Conduct’ (NGRBCs) 
and reporting under each 
principle is divided into essential 
and leadership indicators. As this 
is voluntary for FY ‘22, we have 
included it as a separate report, 
as part of the overall ESG report. 
Further, we have addressed 
the essential indicators for 
this year and will endeavor to 
report on leadership indicators 
as well going forward. The 
BRSR indicators have also been 
mapped with the GRI indicators 
for better clarity and continuity 
from our previous reports. 
 
The report boundary 
encompasses our standalone 
business in India which include 
our own manufacturing units, 
second- and third-party 
units (where we have 100% 
operational control), and our 
corporate offices for Food and 
Beverage business verticals. 
Assurance:
This report has 
been externally 
assured by the 
British Standards 
Institution (BSI), 
who also provide 
verification of 
Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions (GHG) 
to the company 
as per ISO 14064. 
The scope and 
basis of assurance 
have been 
described in the 
assurance report 
issued  
by BSI.

JOURNEY 
SO FAR 
The company’s sustainability 
initiatives were earlier focused 
on the tea sector — including 
enhancing livelihoods of the 
plantation workers. In the initial 
years, these initiatives aimed to 
minimize our impact across the 
tea value chain and strengthen 
our sustainaible sourcing 
agenda. trustea, Ethical Tea 
Partnership, and the Rainforest 
Alliance collaborations were 
an outcome of the same. We 
gradually evolved to encompass 
the Foods business vertical. 
With the evolving regulatory 
landscape, we also were one 
of the first brands in India to 
have adhered to the Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
requirements. We also joined 
the UK and India Plastic Pacts, 
reinforcing our commitment to 
transition to circular economy-
based operating models. 
 
In 2022, we continued to 
improve in the areas of 
renewable energy, water, and 
circularity on the environmental 
front; on the community 
initiatives, our projects impacted 
close to 8 lakh beneficiaries in 
India across 5 thematic areas.

report for further details.

APPROACH TO 
ESG STRATEGY 
Responsible business practices 
play an important role in 
progressing our vision and 
mission. At Tata Consumer 
Products, our purpose and 
values are aligned with the Tata 
Code of Conduct and provide 
the building blocks of our 
Sustainability Strategy. 
At TCP, we strive for Better 
Living — for our consumers, 
value chain partners, employees, 
investors, and other key 
stakeholders through a four-
pillar approach. For Better 
Nutrition, For Better Sourcing, 
For Better Planet, and For Better 
Communities. Over the years, 
we have built on these pillars 
and have bettered our approach, 
performance, and disclosure to 
engage our stakeholders through 
our journey and our plans for  
the future. 
Our Company’s sustainability 
strategy ‘For Better Living’ is 
inspired by the Tata core values 
of Integrity, Responsibility, 
Excellence, Pioneering, and Unity 
and focused on our corporate 
identity of ‘For Better’. The 
strategy incorporates metrics 
from Tata Group’s Sustainability 
strategy around Driving Net 
Zero, Pioneering Circular 
economies, and Preserving 
Nature and Biodiversity. 
Tata Consumer supports 
development programmes for 
1 million community members. 
We received the award for Best 
Growth Performance – F&B 
at India’s top 500 Companies 
2021 conference by Dun & 
Bradstreet on the theme of 
‘Laying foundations for an ESG 
ready corporate India’. We were 
also recognized on the CDP India 
leadership index.

our products are produced 
in an economically,

Belief in the Tata group 
philosophy of giving back

While our focus on sustainability 
is being strengthened and is 
becoming an integral part of 
the way we do business, we 
are cognizant of the need to 
embrace and articulate ESG and 
its elements. More importantly, 
how will sustainability now 
transition to become a holistic 
framework and act as a 
guidance for all functions at TCP. 
The Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) provide a powerful 
framework for businesses to 
develop an interconnected model 
for sustainable growth. SDGs 
have immense opportunities 
for the corporate sector’s 
participation. These goals are 
bringing private players from 
various sectors together to 
achieve the common aim of 
sustainable development, by 
exploring synergies between 
different stakeholders for 
cumulative synchronized growth. 
At TCP, we are committed to 
sustainable food and beverage 
production and consumption 
and endeavor to align our ESG 
strategy to the SDGs.
Industry and sectoral trends 
play a pivotal role in steering 
the sustainability agenda – 
identifying pain points, areas of 
critical need for action and more 
importantly providing solutions 
to tackle them. Consumer trends 
and what the consumer wants – 
now and in the future are critical

in determining how our products 
should be made, packaged, 
delivered and managed. 
We analyzed, material topics 
for the Food & Beverage 
sector through national and 
international standards including 
the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB), ESG 
ratings and matrices, NGRBC & 
global coalitions among others. 
In addition, we also carried out 
a stakeholder consultation that 
helped us understand what 
aspects were critical and how 
in turn they would impact TCP 
business operations. 
Issues that have emerged as 
material basis the analysis, are 
part of the ESG framework.
Apart from the above, the 
regulatory landscape both 
current and future were

Corporate
Governance
TO BECOME A LEADING GLOBAL RESPONSIBLE FOOD COMPANY
Businesses have been facing 
increasing expectations from 
stakeholders in the past 
few years to include social, 
environmental, and governance 
dimensions in their corporate 
strategies. Sustainability 
has become an increasingly 
critical consideration for 
corporations and they have 
started to define and formulate 
broader responsibilities. The 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development and the SDGs 
provide a good opportunity 
for us to align our strategic 
goals with globally agreed 
sustainability principles.
Sustainability is built into the 
Tata group’s business processes 
through a well-defined policy, a 
value system committed to social 
expenditure and environmental 
preservation, and through a 
SDG MATRIX 
governance structure that 
engages employees and other 
key stakeholders.
The role of business is not just 
about giving back to the society 
from its profits but also about 
ensuring that the processes 
and practices it employs to 
earn these profits are ethical, 
socially responsible and 
environmentally sound.

We care for our consumers and 
are committed to help them 
live better and healthier lives. 
We strive to make nutritious 
products that support reduction 
in malnutrition and improve the 
overall health of our consumers. 
We strive to build a portfolio of 
fortified foods and to increase 
consumer awareness about  
the nutritional content of  
our products. 
Consumers expect meaningful 
and transparent information 
(e.g., calorific information) 
for aiding dietary choices. 
Providing the same is key to 
maintaining consumer trust. 
To become a brand that is 
synonymous with ‘nutritious 
and tasty’, we are relooking at 
consumer fundamentals and 
renewing brand packaging to 
bring the nutrition ethos alive 
while enhancing taste. We 
will endeavour to enhance our 
product related information 
through increased product 
information – nutritional, 
environmental and social 
aspects. This will help consumers 
make informed choices about the 
product they would like to buy 
or the brand they would want to 
be associated with. Awareness 
therefore becomes key, to 
educate and provide information 
on the way our products are 
being sourced, packed and 
transported to various channels; 
as also information on how our 
products will help consumers 
meet their nutritional needs. 
At TCP, we have identified 
health and wellness as one of 
the focus areas for innovation 
strategy. While we continue 
to drive leadership with the 
salt category, the other focus 
category for us is beverages. 
We have launched Vitamin 
C fortified Tetley tea, and 
are working on new product 
platforms focused on health 
and wellness under cereals and 
pulses as well. 
Please refer page 68 of the 
Integrated Annual Report for details. 
As standard operating procedure 
for onboarding any new raw 
material/vendor, a non-GMO 
certification is a mandatory 
requirement and is part of the 
standard declaration from 
vendor base. We also ensure 
non-GMO purchases for our 
imported raw materials as well. 
We would also endeavour 
to advocate policy changes 
which aid in addressing 
malnourishment and eating 
right and healthy. This would 
mean collaborating with and 
bringing the value chain partners 
together, to share experiences, 
learning and knowledge. 
Consumers 
expect 
meaningful & 
transparent 
information for 
aiding dietary 
choices. 
HIGHLIGHTS ’21-’22
The sustainable sourcing strategy 
is focused on a two-pronged 
approach – the materials sourced 
must be sustainable and grown 
or made in a responsible manner. 
TCP is focused on sustainable 
agricultural practices and we 
imbibe our principles and our code 
of conduct in purchasing food and 
beverage raw materials for our 
packeting & processing units. 
We stipulate minimum 
requirements with respect to 
social and working conditions, 
safety and environmental 
demands, and agricultural 
practices at suppliers. 
These have been established 
to make TCP’s position clear to 
suppliers and their colleagues, 
as well as any other parties. The 
Rainforest Alliance and trustea 
code help us to source tea and 
coffee sustainably.
We aim to achieve last mile 
transparency for all our products 
which will give us greater 
control, increased visibility and 
therefore the ability to create 
greater environmental and 
social impact, while creating an 
uninterrupted supply chain. 
The ESG strategy will 
encompass action on raw 
material sustainability, 
supply chain traceability 
and sustainable agriculture 
programs. While we have 
made significant progress in 
some of these areas already, 
we will strive to extend it 
across product categories. We 
intend to create a sustainable 
supply chain framework – 
encompassing Supplier Code 
of Conduct, Policy, supplier 
assessment and score cards. 
Our belief is that a collaborative 
approach is more likely to 
imbibe sustainable practices 
among value chain partners. 
Supplier training programs on E, 
S and G elements will not only 
strengthen our supply chain to 
become more sustainable, but 
will also provide benefits to the 
supply chain partners.

DRIVING NET ZERO 
Over the past few years, we 
have been observing erratic 
changes in the climate such 
as depletion of the ozone 
layer, change in temperature, 
erratic rainfall patterns, 
climate variations, rising 
sea levels, increased acidity 
of the oceans, and so on. 
These changes are not only 
affecting the livelihoods 
of millions of people, but 
also have the potential to 
adversely affect our business 
resources  
As a responsible company, TCP 
is committed to taking strong 
actions to bring its net carbon 
dioxide contribution down to zero 
and work towards minimizing 
the effects of climate change. 
We aim to achieve this by robust 
accounting of Scope 1, 2 and 3 
and aligning with the Science 
Based Target initiative (SBTi) and 
working towards developing a 
decarbonization roadmap which 
will include energy efficiency, 
renewable energy, switching to 
alternate energy sources, offset 
programs among others. This will 
require a significant participation 
from our value chain as well.
Zero Waste to Landfill: 
 
Reduction in waste generation as 
well as safe and scientific disposal 
of all types of waste is the need 
of the hour. Our beverage units 
are already zero waste to landfill 
and extending the same to the 
other business units is underway. 
We will continue to work with 
authorized waste collectors and 
recyclers to support us with this 
commitment.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY 
At TCP, we endeavor to 
transition from linear to 
circular business models – be 
it packaging, waste or water 
management. Our R&D function 
has a specialized team working 
on sustainable packaging 
and innovation. This includes 
reduction, optimization and 
switching to sustainable 
alternatives of packaging 
material. 
Sustainable Packaging: 
 
TCP is committed to optimizing 
consumer packaging, making 
efficient use of resources and 
reducing environmental impact 
without compromising product 
quality and safety. Sustainable 
packaging is fit-for-purpose, 
resource-efficient, made from 
low-impact materials, and 
reusable or recyclable at the 
end of its life. The environmental 
impact of packaging is shared 
by companies throughout the 
packaging supply chain (raw 
material suppliers, packaging 
manufactures and suppliers, 
brand owners and retailers), 
consumers, waste service 
providers and recyclers. TCP 
will also collaborate with other 
stakeholders to find sustainable 
packaging solutions, and 
mitigate and manage the 
packaging wastes in a holistic 
manner.
We are founding members of 
the India Plastics Pact, aimed at 
creating and enabling a circular 
economy for plastics. We had 
earlier joined the UK Plastics 
Pact in 2018.  
Please refer to page 92 for further details 
on our waste management initiatives. 
Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR):
EPR meets increasing consumer 
demand for environmentally 
friendly packaging that can 
easily be recycled or are 
manufactured using recycled 
content. Under the EPR, 
TCP aims to collect brand 
independent plastic packaging 
equivalent to the plastic 
packaging quantity used by the 
company and also adhere to 
all the requisites of the Plastic 
Waste Management Rules. We 
are 100% in compliance with the 
same, and will continue to do so. 
Water Neutrality:
We support the right to water 
for everyone - “to sufficient, safe, 
acceptable, physically accessible 
and affordable water for personal 
and domestic uses.” In order to 
operate in a sustainable manner, 
we understand the importance of 
water resources management, and 
to promote water for life and water 
for livelihood in all the geographies 
that we are present. Rain-water 
harvesting, water conservation 
measures, usage of recycled 
waste water as well as community 
watershed programs (as discussed 
in the annual report page 93) are 
paving way for our operations to 
become water neutral. 
PRESERVING NATURE 
AND BIODIVERSITY
Nature-Based Solutions (NbS): 
Nature-based Solutions (NbS) 
are defined by IUCN as “actions 
to protect, sustainably manage, 
and restore natural or modified 
ecosystems, that address 
societal challenges effectively 
and adaptively, simultaneously 
providing human well-being and 
biodiversity benefits”. NbS can 
follow any of the approaches 
such as ecosystem restoration, 
issue-specific ecosystem related, 
infrastructure related, ecosystem-
based management, and 
ecosystem protection. We intend 
to undertake projects that involve 
Nature-Based Solutions..
To create a positive ecological 
impact, we conserve biodiversity 
hotspots and forests near 
plantations in our subsidiary 
and associate companies – at 
Coorg, Munnar and Assam. Our 
conservation measures include, 
guarding the forest areas and 
preventing human encroachment. 
TCP is 
committed 
to optimizing

of resources 
and reducing 
environmental 
impact without 
compromising

A Case Study On The Use Of Biogas 
Plants In The Rural Households: 
Himmotthan Society
Our Business and Human Rights (‘BHR’) Policy which is aligned with the principles 
contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights and is consistent with the Tata Code of Conduct. This 
will be extended to our own operations, as well as to the supply chain.  
Indian households in villages 
depend on domesticated 
cattle for their livelihood and 
nutrition, and cow dung for 
manure in agriculture. These 
dung cakes are also being used 
for cooking as an alternative 
to firewood, since firewood 
collection is time consuming 
and also poses health hazards 
owing to the smoke produced 
while cooking, The Himmotthan 
Society, realizing the true 
potential of dung cakes as 
biofuel, stepped forward and 
initiated the construction of 9 
domestic biogas plants with 20 
vermicompost pits in 20 villages 
of Sirmour district, Himachal 
Pradesh. However, convincing 
people about the abundance 
and richness of this biofuel 
was a task. Through constant 
meetings and negotiations by 
the Himmotthan society, it was 
accepted by the local community
Residents of Village Belwali, 
near Paonta Sahib have 
benefitted from the biogas 
installation, due to efficiency 
in cooking time and a life free 
from firewood soot. Installation 
of biogas plants was met with 
skepticism at first from villagers, 
but it has helped in enhancing 
living conditions for them. 
Using cowdung as biogas and 
vermicomposting pits also helps 
in enhancing fertilizer value 
of the dung. The Himmothhan 
society is constantly working 
towards promoting community 
participation for creating a 
sustainable and long-lasting life 
supporting systems.
To promote the wider 
acceptance of the biogas 
plants, the Himmotthan Society 
implemented an innovative 
strategy. For every biogas plant 
installed and handed over to 
families, the society demands 
a little personal contribution 
that would make the biogas 
plants earned and not gifted. 
This can be in any form. Most 
people contribute in labor 
costs, others in laying the 
foundation, and some help 
with the roof of vermicompost 
pits. The technician is present 
for the entire duration of the 
construction with the family 
to explain the functioning and 
any possible scenario that 
might arise during the life of 
the plant. Even after 2-3 years 
of the final installation, most of 
the families are still in contact 
with these technicians and 
experts.
The by-product of the 
biogas plant – slurry is used 
as a fertilizer. This collects 
in a separate compost pit 
chamber adjacent to the plant. 
Shifting from conventional 
chemical fertilizers to slurry 
has benefitted crop yield. 
Through interventions of 
the Himmotthan Society, 
villagers realized the long 
term disadvantages of using 
chemical fertilizers, and are 
now reaping benefits of biogas 
manure. These biogas plants, 
installed with the intervention 
of Himmotthan Society present 
an opportunity to have a life, 
away from smoke-filled and 
soot-tainted kitchen walls.
Please refer to our impact assessment 
report for a detailed understanding of 
the projects and their impacts on the 
communities - Sustainability | Tata 
Consumer Products.

with the intervention of

Iron Removal Plants (IRP) – Jorhat 
In the tea gardens of Jorhat, 
the major source of water for 
drinking and domestic use 
is through water taps that 
have been provided at every 
line on sharing basis and the 
water is available 2 times 
a day. The groundwater 
is highly contaminated 
with iron and households 
usually use basic filtration 
techniques or no filtration 
of water before drinking. It 
is often reported that the 
majority of the population 
suffers from skin diseases 
due to water and diseases 
like fever, cold, diarrhea, etc. 
are very common. 
Under Project Jalodari, Iron 
Removal Plants have been 
installed in Teok, Dallim, 
Bhelaguri and Rajoi divisions 
to provide safe and assured 
drinking water to 1200 
households. These plants 
are run by an operator who 
has to turn the plant on 
and off every morning and 
evening respectively and do 
the backwashing for 2 hours. 
Households are provided with 
ATM cards and 20 litre jars 
so that they can collect water 
by swiping the cards on a 
daily basis. Since awareness 
with regard to safe drinking 
water is low in the community, 
continuous educational sessions 
along with follow-ups are being 
carried out in the tea gardens.
Sulochana Karmakar is one of 
the beneficiaries from Dallim 
(Borline) who collects and 
consumes the IRP water every 
day. According to her, before the 
installation of the IRP plant, the 
tap water that she was receiving 
was not suitable for drinking 
due to iron contamination. The 
installation of the IRP has helped 
her in consuming cleaner water, 
without being worried about the 
health of her family. 
Though the awareness in 
the gardens with regard to 
drinking water is low, the team 
from Centre for Micro-finance 
and Livelihood (CML), Tata 
Trusts with the help of Estate 
management is trying to change 
their perception regarding clean 
drinking water. Women like 
Sulochana are being mobilized 
to encourage the community to 
drink safe and assured drinking 
water.
Menstrual Hygiene Management 
(MHM) Modules 
Story of a woman who often 
felt that there was something 
wrong with her body since she 
did not give birth to a boy
In the tea gardens, due to 
prevailing patriarchy, there is 
a marked preference for male 
children over female children. 
Most households want a male 
child and when a woman is 
unable to give birth to a boy, she 
is often criticized. Awareness 
with regard to menstruation, 
pregnancy and body changes 
is very minimal in the tea 
communities; also there are 
existing myths and stigma 
prevailing in the community. This 
case story is on a woman named 
Sangeeta Gupta from Gupta 
group from Kakajan tea estate.
Sangeeta Gupta is one of 
the beneficiaries from Gupta 
group and she has attended 
all 4 modules of MHM. In 
the 4th meeting, the sakhi 
(‘sakhi’ meaning ‘friend’ who 
form groups of women and 
adolescent girls and conduct 
MHM meetings with them; they 
are the on-ground Community 
Resource Persons who work for 
MHM intervention on ground) 
Sangeeta Guala shared various 
insights like connection between 
menstruation and pregnancy, 
safe and unsafe days, and sex of 
a child and how it is determined 
through playing a chromosome 
game in the meeting. The 
beneficiary Sangeeta Gupta’s 
family always wanted her to 
give birth to a male child but 
she gave birth to a female and 
that made her life miserable as 
she started doubting her own 
body believing there was some 
problem with her body because 
she was not able to give birth to 
a male child. However, when she 
played the chromosome game 
in the 4th meeting and learned 
about X and Y chromosomes and 
how we can’t decide the sex of 
a child, she was relieved. All her 
misunderstandings were clear 
and she was happy and proud to 
give birth to a girl child.
MHM in tea gardens focuses on 
4 modules from Tata Trusts EPIC 
model that focus on changes 
in the body as one attains 
puberty, biology of menstruation, 
menstrual symptoms, nutrition, 
products that one must use 
during their periods, hygiene, 
addressing myths and stigma, 
having conversations around 
menstruation, safe and unsafe 
days, connecting menstruation 
and pregnancy, and involving 
men in these conversations.
Breaking the silence around 
menstruation
Mira Rajowar, one of the 
beneficiaries, after attending the 
4 modules told the sakhi that 
she and other women in the 
tea gardens were completely 
unaware of menstruation and 
they always considered it to be 
a curse. Whenever she would 
have any difference or delay in 
her periods, she often thought 
it was some disease but she 
was happy to learn about the 
normal days of menstruation 
in the 1st meeting. She further 
shed light on how women were 
asked to follow certain rules and 
restrictions during menstruation. 
Interactions with the sakhi 
helped women like Mira 
destigmatize menstruation and 
do away with the taboos related 
to periods.

young adults
These special young adults, are 
now taking care of their aged 
parents and leading fulfilled 
lives.
Special employee Amar Singh 
had this to say: He came to 
Srishti as a young man newly 
married to Jabamary, who is also 
deformed in one hand. He works 
in the Deli and his wife works in 
Aranya Natural. His daughter 
came as a little girl to the creche 
run by Srishti and has now 
passed class 12. Thanks to the 
income that they both have, they 
have bought themselves a house 
in their hometown. He says he 
owes whatever he is today to 
Srishti. He leads a life with pride 
and dignity and is most thankful 
to the company for all that he 
has received.
55 special students and 103 
special adults with various kinds 
of challenges including mental 
retardation, hearing & speech

Complaints submitted through the Ethics & Compliance Helpline are evaluated and investigated by 
the designated ethics and compliance personnel. Wherever necessary, independent external parties 
are called for assisting in matters to warrant independence. The company makes sure to keep the 
confidentiality intact, without mandating disclosure of identity while raising a complaint. A unique 
case reference number is designated to the complainant, which can be used for a future status 
check after 45 days of lodging the complaint. In case, the complainant experiences retaliation or 
victimisation after reporting an incident under the Vigil Mechanism Whistle Blower Policy, they can 
reach out to the Ethics Committee. 
Corporate Governance - Policies | Tata Consumer Products
As part of CSR initiatives through the Ethical Tea Partnership programs, we have established a 
thousand community structures including Child Protection Committees (CPC), Mothers’ committees, 
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI), and School Management Committees (SMC) across 205 tea estates. 
Through the support of the tea management, these committees have been successful in addressing 
child protection issues. The committees have played a vital role in protecting children from abuse and 
monitoring protection-related concerns amongst children. These committees initiate action to address 
these concerns, focusing on the prevention of harmful practices to children, such as child marriage, 
abuse, exploitation, neglect, and violence. 
In case, the adolescents have concerns, they can report them to the management staff, welfare 
officers, line chowkidar, school/college teachers, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM), Accredited Social 
Health Activist (ASHA), Anganwadi Workers (AWW), Child Protection Committee, Police, 1098 
ChildLine, as well as the District Administration. The efforts to institutionalise and optimise referral 
mechanisms with governance structures at the village and district levels are ongoing.
Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to 
environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for

issues. We carried out stakeholder consultations with both internal and external stakeholders, seeking 
their perspectives and inputs on TCP’s ESG issues. Basis, their responses, along with sectoral, peer 
analysis and in alignment with Indian and Global ESG standards, we arrived at the following key focus 
areas. The materiality approach, methodology and outcomes have been elaborated in the Materiality

Opportunity 
The pandemic 
has had a huge 
impact on consumer 
behaviour globally. 
Consumer 
preferences are 
changing and 
shifting towards 
trusted brands and 
towards health and 
wellness focused 
products. The Tata 
brand name and an 
extensive portfolio 
of products in that 
space position us 
well to capitalize 
on the emerging 
opportunities.
Risk 
The performance 
of our products 
will depend largely 
on consumer 
preferences and our 
ability to align to the 
changing trends.
We track consumer 
trends, which act 
as inputs in our 
innovation process 
•	 We have deployed 
a dedicated 
innovation 
funnel, which 
encompasses 
evolving changes 
in consumer 
preferences
•	 During the year, 
we accelerated the 
pace of innovation 
across key 
categories with 
multiple launches/
extensions within 
key brands
•	 Implemented a 
well-defined NPD 
stage gate process 
and embedded the 
use of technology 
for tracking 
projects
Positive: our 
products are 
natural and 
are focused on 
the well-being 
of consumers, 
therefore have 
the ability to 
meet consumer 
requirements 
from a wellness 
and healthy food 
requirement. This 
will ultimately 
lead to enhanced 
consumer 
satisfaction and 
brand loyalty.

In addition, we

Safeguarding human

chain (Eg., extension 
of the Tata Code 
of Conduct and 
its Human Rights 
principles, through 
payment of minimum 
wages, avoidance 
of forced and child 
labour, among 
others) are critical to 
the integrity 
of our value chain
Positive: we 
are expanding 
our sales and 
distribution 
footprint giving 
us greater reach 
in general trade/
retail outlets. 
Our expansion 
in the D2C and 
e-commerce 
segments also 
help reach out to 
wider consumer 
segments. Hand 
holding our value 
chain partners 
and extending 
our policies and 
good practices 
will create a 
positive impact 
across the

GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)  
 
This is not something that is an add-on for us. It is embedded in the way we think, in our 
value system and culture. The focus is now sharper, and more integrated, with consumers and 
other stakeholders beginning to value their association with organisations and brands that 
are responsible. We are focusing on responsible sourcing with partners such as trustea and 
Rainforest Alliance. We are reducing our environmental footprint by ensuring that more than 
a quarter of the energy of the India supply chain now comes from renewables. We are also 
placing emphasis on the circular economy of packaging. We are one of the founding members 
of the India Plastics Pact and are also members of the UK Plastics Pact and the Europe 
Plastics Pact. We are doing our part in mitigating climate change. Our community investments 
continue to focus on critical issues spanning healthcare, education, and skill development for 
vulnerable groups. Our employees across the Company contributed to serving the community by 
participating in volunteering programmes. 
 
As a purpose-led organization, we are imbibing global best practices to make Tata Consumer 
a great place to work. We are strengthening diversity and inclusion through initiatives such as 
health insurance for the partners of employees of the LGBTQ+ community and the launch of the 
Women’s Inclusion Network. Nearly a third of all our open positions for external hiring were filled 
by women last year. We are also taking multiple steps to foster employee health and well being, 
through initiatives such as the Caregivers Support Programme (CUSP) for expecting parents, 
and counseling and awareness building for holistic health. Our governance standards are best in 
class and guide our strategy and the way we do business, and we are constantly improving our 
policies and practices where needed.

2.	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?  
Yes 
 
We are dedicated to ensuring that our products are produced in an economically, environmentally, 
and socially just manner. Tata Consumer is committed to sustainable sourcing of our tea, coffee, 
water and foods offerings. We are founding members of the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP). The ETP 
is a non-commercial partnership of tea companies committed to improving the lives of tea workers 
and their environment, to create a thriving tea industry that is socially just and environmentally 
sustainable. While we have made considerable progress, there’s still a long road ahead. Our mission 
is to enable sustainable growth across the tea supply chain— from crop to cup.  
 
Tata Consumer’s partnership with the Rainforest Alliance is a major step towards sustainable 
sourcing in our International Business. The international non-profit organization works to conserve 
biodiversity and ensure sustainable livelihoods, while helping solve specific sustainability-related 
issues within the tea sector. Nearly all our Tetley Tea in the International business is 100% Rainforest 
Alliance certified. 
 
Tata Consumer is a founding member of trustea - a sustainability code and verification system for 
the tea sector in India. The trustea program exceeded the verification target of 100 million kg in 
2021and has cumulative verified volumes of 790 million Kg till Feb 2022, which is over 60% of the 
total tea sold in Indian markets. Over 80,000 small growers have been verified and 6.4 Lakh workers 
reached under trustea. 
 
Our pulses are unpolished, which helps retain their natural goodness and nutritional value. Our 
spices are wholesome and have their essential oils intact – which is known to have a variety of 
health benefits. We also offer a range of organic pulses, sourced from organic certified farms, and 
produced without chemical fertilisers and pesticides. They are made using an environmentally 
responsible and sustainable agriculture approach. The Tata Sampann Organic range is certified as 
per National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP), India and the National Organic Program 
(NOP USDA), USA. 
 
Packaging - 100% of our Packaging Vendors are compliant with sustainable sourcing norms. There 
is clear communication in the Purchase order terms and in our contracts on our expectation from 
Vendors to deliver on social, ethical, and environmental factors.  
 
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
This FY, we sourced 59% of trustea / Rain Forest Alliance certified tea in India.  
 
3.	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and 
disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous 
waste and (d) other waste. 
 
The waste – hazardous and non-hazardous generated at our manufacturing units are disposed to 
authorized recyclers, as identified by the State Pollution Control Boards. Our products being natural, 
we lay emphasis on reclaiming packaging material – post consumer use. We are 100% compliant 
with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and work with designated waste recyclers to help 
us with collection, recycling, and disposal.  
 
The Computer Policy for End Users acts as an internal document for establishing the guiding 
principles. The policy mandates the disposal of the generated e-waste through an authorized dealer. 
The asset team identifies the assets older than stipulated time for disposal. Later, the procurement 
department enlists a certified e-waste dealer through whom all e- wastes are managed. 
 
4.	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / 
No).  
 
If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same. Yes. 
The Company is committed to circularity in waste management. All beverage factories in India are 
now zero waste to landfill and all wastes are disposed of through authorized vendors who recycle or 
repurpose them to avoid landfill. Under the Plastic Waste Management Rules in India, the Company 
has implemented Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Plan for the collection and reprocessing of 
100% plastic packaging waste on a brand-neutral basis.
