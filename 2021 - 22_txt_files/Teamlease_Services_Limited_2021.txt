BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY 
AND SUSTAINABILITY 
REPORT
The prism through which companies are being looked at is rapidly changing. In the recent period, the resilience of companies 
has been tested in terms of how they have been able to withstand the turmoil of the COVID-19 induced pandemic. The other 
issue taking centre stage is a company’s commitment towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) parameters. Each 
company’s experience on dealing with the pandemic is different as is each company’s journey on ESG. For TeamLease, the 
pandemic has reiterated that there can be no greater security in life than having a job, a source of income. ESG links together 
all spheres of activity within TeamLease. 
Due credit must be given to the Indian capital markets regulator, The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for taking the 
lead in putting together the Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework. In response to the worldwide 
trends, SEBI, has adopted new sustainability reporting criteria as part of its ongoing efforts to improve ESG disclosures. This 
new, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), reporting format intends to establish ties between a company’s 
financial outcomes and its ESG performance. This can help regulators, investors, and other stakeholders get a more accurate 
picture of a company’s overall stability, growth, sustainability and transparency. It is a comprehensive framework, which calls 
for more measureable, quantitative metrics to facilitate better benchmarking. 
With effect from the Financial Year 2022-2023, ESG Reporting - as per guidelines provided by SEBI, India, i.e. Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is mandated for the top 1000 listed companies (by market capitalization). The 
existing Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) which is based on the National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct 
(NGRBCs) is succeeded by the BRSR. SEBI through a notification dated May 05, 2021 has discontinued the requirement of 
submitting BRR by listed companies after FY 2021-22. As per the notification, TeamLease is required to submit a new report on 
ESG parameters, namely Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report from FY 22-23 onwards.
At TeamLease, it was a collective decision to adopt the BRSR ahead of schedule for FY22 itself.
At TeamLease, we remain committed towards deepening our engagement with our stakeholders as we strive towards increasing 
employment, employability and e-workforce in the country.
As we all know, ESG- where E represents Environment; S represents Social and G represents Governance – These are the three 
core pillars to measure the sustainability, societal impact, and corporate governance, plus investment potential in a business/
organization.

respect to the expertise, experience, and diversity on the Board. Evaluations of Board composition consider a number 
of matters, including director independence, skill set, experience, expertise, and diversity, to ensure the Board remains 
effective and well–qualified. In 2022, we added three new directors with relevant and board experience.

III.	Does the company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?

ensuring better energy efficiency standards whilst procuring electronic equipment, lighting devices, computers, 
HVACs, sensors, amongst others. This initiative will bring in energy savings over the medium to long-term. At most 
of the Company’s offices, there are LED light fittings to conserve energy and conscious endeavours have been made 
to replace electronic equipment with high energy star ratings. Sensors are installed to economise power and water 
consumption only when these facilities are being used. The major suppliers of hardware are green standard compliant.
	
IV.	 Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services wherever possible from local &small producers, 
including communities surrounding their place of work? If yes, what steps have been taken to improve their 
capacity and capability of local and small vendors?
	
	
The Company endeavours to engage with suppliers who integrate environmental and social considerations into their 
products and services. At an all-India level, preference is always given to sourcing from local suppliers.
	
V.	 Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and wherever possible waste? If yes what is the 
percentage of recycling of products and waste (separately as <5%, 5-10%, >10%).Also, provide details thereof, 
in about 50 words or so.
	
	
Given the nature of the business, the Company has limited scope to use recycled material as processed inputs. 
	
	
However, the Company has systems in place at an all-India level to manage and dispose dry/wet waste efficiently.
	
VI.	 Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the 
entity, respectively.

(IT) capex. In FY22, capex incurred towards IT hardware and software (including capital work in progress), which 
facilitated the enhanced digital initiatives of the Company was 0.19% of total revenue. Greater adoption of digital 
platforms not only brings in increased efficiencies of operations but also ensures substantially reduced consumption 
of paper.

Principle 3 - Businesses should promote the well-being of all employees
TeamLease believes that its success depends on its ability to develop knowledge, skills and expertise of its employees. This 
belief translates in ensuring that every business vertical  is  equipped  with  right  talent,  which  is both competent and engaged. 
The Company achieved this objective by undertaking various initiatives for talent development, employee engagement and 
communication. We have always been committed to inclusive and merit based policies. We are proud of the fact that the 
representation of women leaders in our senior team is at 40%. Our policies are for the benefit of all employees . In today’s world, 
the need for flexibility in terms of workplace (Work from home / work from office) is the most commonly mentioned and highly 
valued benefit and we are trying to create as much flexibility as possible without compromising on cohesion and team work. We 
have always had a transparent, merit-based and open culture. 
All our policies are geared towards equal opportunity. We pride ourselves on our compliance and ethical standards. All of these, 
put together create a work environment where everyone has a voice, has opportunities to grow and learn and take on higher 
responsibilities. Examples for this include our outcome-based performance management system, a promotion policy aligned 
with performance and learning opportunities for all our people.

We have monthly connect sessions with Department and Business Heads. People are encouraged to speak up and voice their 
thoughts, recommendations and suggestions. HR teams have regular connects with people to ensure that we are able to 
strengthen good practices and act proactively where gaps need to be addressed. There are CEO connect sessions for new 
joiners and senior leaders to ensure that transitions are smooth and there is a common language and culture of outcome 
based performance. We also have a cadence on Monthly, Quarterly and Annual Awards to recognize strong performance and 
adherence to our Principles. We have several recognition and connect activities to ensure that people have the resources and 
information they need to succeed and successes are recognized and rewarded. 
RESPONDING TO COVID–19
TeamLease has always prioritized the health and safety of our team members. Throughout the pandemic, we have monitored 
developments, consulted external experts, and worked with TeamLease leaders to establish and maintain stringent protocols 
to safeguard team members on a local, regional, and PAN India level. 
SAFEGUARDING OUR HEALTH 
Vaccinations are a crucial weapon in the fight against COVID– 19. In the first half of 2021, as several countries launched their 
vaccination programs, case counts improved in several parts of the world but, sadly, worsened in others. In India, for example, 
record–high case numbers rapidly overwhelmed the medical system. To assist our India team members and their families, we 
acted quickly. In all locations, TeamLease continues to encourage vaccination through local government and health resources. 
SUPPORTING OUR COLLEAGUES 
Team members have worked in several ways to support their colleagues, families, and communities during the pandemic. Every 
month we shared information, tips, and best practices focused on a specific theme of well–being. 
For the Company, the focus immediately shifted to ensuring the health and well-being of all employees, and on minimizing 
disruption to services for all our customers. From a highly centralized model consisting of work spaces set in physical locations 
capable of accommodating thousands of employees, the switch to work from home for employees all over, extending all the 
elements of the Company’s working model, was carried out seamlessly.
Employee wellbeing checks are conducted frequently. In the event of an unfortunate turn, TeamLease offers support to the 
grieving family, including financial support reimbursements for medical expenses, salary advance and leave. Employees who 
have contracted it were allowed 14 days of additional paid leave to recuperate.
RETURNING TO OFFICE
At the start of the pandemic, many team members transitioned to working from home, allowing us to better protect both our 
team members who were required to come to our offices for essential operations as well as our team members who could 
perform their job duties remotely. As conditions improved in our communities around the country, we began enacting plans to 
return all team members to our TeamLease offices. We continue to adjust those plans, along with our Health & Safety protocols, 
to account for developments such as the emergence of variants. Recognizing that the needs of our team members have shifted 
over the course of the last two years, we remain committed to flexible work arrangements, and will continue to offer the option 
to work a combination of at office and remotely if the job allows once the pandemic ends. Hybrid working models give employees 
the benefit of in–person interactions with their colleagues while also enjoying the conveniences of working remotely. In 2022, 
we will continue to follow the advice of health organizations, doctors, and scientists as we plan for the balance of our workforce 
to return to the office. 2021 was a difficult year, particularly as we mourn the loss of colleagues, family, and friends to the virus. 
To the TeamLease team, we express our admiration for their resilience and for the care and concern they’ve shown for others 
throughout the pandemic. This compassion and sense of community are among the company’s greatest assets.

All employees of the Company undergo an annual performance appraisal process as determined by the Company. 
Further, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board evaluates the performance of the Executive 
Directors, members of Executive Management (one level below the board), Senior Management Personnel and the 
Company Secretary on an annual basis. The underlying philosophy of the performance management system is to 
have a fair and transparent system of appraisal, which ensures an objective mechanism to measure each employee’s 
performance and potential and implement a reward system which recognises merit. The performance appraisal 
system has been designed to achieve the following objectives: • Review the previous year’s performance with specific 
reference to achievement of targets and give constructive feedback on performance; • Provide an opportunity for 
communication and interaction between the appraiser and appraisee regarding the previous year’s performance and
