Energy
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Sona Comstar is buying 100% of our 
energy requirements from the grid. We 
don’t control the input mix of power in 
the grid. Therefore we have decided to 
improve our energy mix and efficiency 
through the steps mentioned in the 
approach.

power generating capacity
of 1505.8 kWp in our plants
at Gurgaon, Manesar and
Chennai.
2. We will be adding roof top
solar power generating
capacity in the upcoming
Chakan (Pune) plant.
3. We are also constantly
working on improving the
energy intensity per rupee of
revenue.
Positive:
Reduced GHG emissions 
and less sensitivity to 
changes in cost of fossil 
fuel.
2.
Low Carbon
Mobility
Opportunity
Sona Comstar believes that electrified 
mobility is necessary to reduce 
the GHG emissions arising from 
automobiles and for a greener planet.  
It has therefore embarked on a journey 
to increase its revenue from battery 
electric vehicles (BEV) and focused its 
R&D efforts towards developing drive 
motors, controllers and transmission 
solutions for different types of electric 
vehicles.
N.A
Positive: 
Sona Comstar derived
