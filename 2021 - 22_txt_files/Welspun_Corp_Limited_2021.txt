Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR)
The SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD-2/P/CIR/2021/562 has stated that with effect from the financial year 
2022-2023, filing of BRSR shall be mandatory for the top 1,000 listed companies (by market capitalization) and 
shall replace the existing BRR. Filing of BRSR is voluntary for the financial year 2021-22. As a proactive measure 
to adapt to changing regulatory requirements, we have attempted to map our existing ESG information with 
the requirements of BRSR. In addition to BRSR, we are also reporting Business Responsibility Report (BRR) 
as per mandates.
WELSPUN’S 
APPROACH 
TO 
BUSINESS 
RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
As the method’s to assessing business performance 
evolves rapidly, their commitment and action with 
respect to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
principles have come into prominence. Welspun Corp 
Limited (WCL) believes in conducting its operations 
sustainably and aligning business with ESG objectives 
to enable value creation for all our stakeholders and to 
preserve the natural ecosystem for future generations.
At WCL, we build stakeholder value by taking 
responsibility for our operations and ensuring positive 
impacts in the ecosystem in which we operate, while 
ensuring the highest standards in product quality 
and fulfilling customer needs. The key pillars of 
business responsibility at WCL are: Governance, 
Protecting the Planet, Customer Centricity, Creating 
Healthy Communities, Empowering Our People and 
Collaborating with Stakeholders.
We believe that a sustainability centric approach 
is foundational to business responsibility and is 
instrumental in the coming together of economic, 
environmental and social dimensions that are essential 
to building a future ready organization and making a 
lasting positive impact on our stakeholders, operations 
and the natural ecosystem. Thus, we have integrated 
ESG goals into our overall business strategy to reinforce 
our market position, deliver financial performance, 
secure long-term value for our stakeholders and 
promote environmental preservation.
WCL is strongly committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance, transparency 
and fairness in all matters related to the business 
and stakeholder engagement. A performance-driven 
successful business is governed by a defined structure 
of authorities guided by fundamental policies to 
operate ethically and create value. These policies are 
brought together as an assurance for WCL to enhance 
its integrity through a professional and mature work 
environment. We intend to build on these policies 
along our journey, and as we mature.
In light of our commitment to being a responsible 
business and growing sustainably, we have established 
an ESG committee at the Board level and have 
formulated plans for initiatives to be implemented 
across 
Environment, 
Social 
and 
Governance 
dimensions. 
Further, 
we 
have 
redefined 
the 
governance of Environment and Social aspects across 
organizational levels and this is helping to propel us 
towards meeting our commitments on carbon, water, 
waste, supply chain and CSR.
Operational excellence, high standards of compliance 
and a performance driven culture are prioritized at WCL. 
Our manufacturing facilities are certified for quality 
management system, environmental management 
system, occupational health, and safety management 
system. The certifications include: APIQR, SPECQ1, 
ISO-9001, ISO/TS-29001, AD 2000-Markblatt, HPOIEN 
/ ISO 3834-3, ISO-14001 and ISO-45001. Our processes 
aim for maximum asset utilization and most of our 
products are made from externally procured plates 
and coils and make limited use of natural resources 
as raw materials. We continue to work towards 
greater resource efficiency by leveraging innovation, 
technology, R&D expertise and recovery and recycling 
methods.
Aligning with our commitment to minimizing the 
environmental impact of our operations, we have 
adopted a detailed risk assessment process that forms 
a part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework. The process includes a detailed evaluation 
of all our processes, raw materials, products and services 
and helps to identify and measure the significance of 
Environmental Aspects and Associated Impacts. Our 
environmental performance is continuously monitored 
to ensure that it complies with regulatory requirements 
and we regularly submit compliance reports to relevant 
authorities to communicate our performance.
We are working to minimize the use of energy in our 
production and processing operations. We have put 
into action measures for energy efficiency and aim for 
carbon neutral status by employing renewable energy 
124
Annual Report 2021-22
and negating emissions with carbon offset programs. 
To this end, we have also taken steps in logistics that 
allow for greater efficiency in transporting materials 
and thereby reduce GHG emissions.
Our processes are not water intensive and we do not 
have a significant impact on water bodies through 
water withdrawal. The major industrial usage of 
water is for coating applications on line pipes while 
our offices use municipal supply water for domestic 
purposes such as drinking, cleaning, flushing, etc. We 
measure and monitor the quantity of water consumed 
across all our business locations and operations. 
WCL aims to ensure water stewardship by identifying 
operations where water conservation techniques can 
be implemented and by using recycled water to limit 
water consumption.
In order to reduce the impact of waste generated by 
our operations on the environment, we have adopted 
the 3R approach (i.e., Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to 
monitor the waste generated and identify areas for 
waste reduction, recycling and reuse. All waste is 
segregated, treated, and disposed appropriately, in 
line with guidelines from Pollution Control Boards
For us to be truly sustainable, it is imperative that our 
value chain is equally a part of this journey. We recognize 
the need to take on board our supply chain and support 
necessary capacity building to enhance their ESG 
performance. Therefore, training in Environment and 
Social aspects and supplier assessments are among 
some of the steps we have articulated to develop a 
sustainable supply chain. We regularly evaluate our 
vendors on required quality standards to ensure the 
highest standards in material procurement. As our 
products depend on customer-specific requirements, 
we engage with a limited supplier base to procure 
high-quality materials. However, we encourage and 
promote local procurement for other components used 
in our processes. This not only lends to reducing the 
environmental impact of our procurement practices, but 
also supports employment and continued livelihoods 
in the communities surrounding our operations.
WCL’s employees are our greatest asset, and we 
believe our diverse workforce contributes significantly 
to the innovation and creativity that fuels our growth 
strategy. We make equal opportunities available for 
all our employees, regardless of race, religion, gender, 
age, nationality, or disability. Our approach to learning 
and development aims to inculcate new competencies 
and enhance existing skills that address our people’s 
development needs as well as our business goals.
Ensuring a healthy and safe work environment is 
accorded high priority and a culture of safety is 
driven by the top management and executed at 
every level through the EHS Management System. 
WCL is accredited for ISO 45001 that enables risk 
assessment of all activities for achieving organizational 
HSE goals. We have a well-established Occupational 
Health, Safety and Environment (OHSE) policy, and 
Safety Committees at the facilities ensure compliance 
with regulations and deliver safety trainings to our 
employees and contract staff.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is ingrained 
into our business strategy. Our CSR contributions are 
aimed towards creating a positive impact on the lives 
of the less privileged through well-planned initiatives 
and key focus areas. Our social mission is enshrined 
within the 3Es, namely, Education, Empowerment and 
Environment & Health. WCL’s CSR activities are carried 
out through the Welspun Foundation for Health and 
Knowledge (WFHK) in areas such as strengthening 
educational foundation, improving access to healthcare 
services, empowering people, and preserving the 
environment.
In the coming years, our strategic focus would be to 
undertake action and allocate adequate resources to 
achieve our ESG goals in alignment with associated 
business goals:
	
¡
Energy-efficiency measures, prioritizing renewable 
energy strategies
	
¡
Effects on the wellbeing and prosperity of 
employees and stakeholders
	
¡
Monitoring 
targets 
and 
communicate 
to 
stakeholders on a timely basis while prioritizing 
our Environment and Social goals
	
¡
Sustainable supply chain program
	
¡
Strengthening organization’s reputation through 
strategic stakeholder engagement and facilitating 
collaborations
Each phase of our ESG action is a holistic long-
term vision aligned with our business, social and 
environmental objectives aimed at establishing a 
healthy ecosystem of economic growth and societal 
value creation. As we move into the future, ESG will be 
the cornerstone of our financial success, competitive 
advantage, and future accomplishments.

7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements: Integrated Report >> Leadership messages
WCL is dedicated to cultivating a culture in which sustainability is woven into the very fabric of all that we 
do. We believe that a sustainability-centric approach is fundamental to business responsibility, and that it is 
pivotal in bringing together the economic, environmental, and social dimensions that are necessary for building 
a future-ready organisation and having a long-term positive impact on our stakeholders, operations, and natural 
ecosystem. We have integrated ESG objectives into our growth strategy and are convinced that working towards

thus focuses on identifying and mitigating environmental and social risks in its value chain. We have adopted 
renewable energy in our operations and will continue to track greenhouse gas emissions and remain committed 
to lowering our overall carbon footprint.

Principle 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
In case any product supplied to the client is found to not conform to the specifications, then the Clients can 
raise a formal customer complaint. Upon receiving the complaint, we review the same, refer the data of the 
testing done at our mills and if need arises, we mobilise our inspector to the site to verify the complaint. 
Once the complaint is verified as genuine, a root cause analysis is done to identify the root cause/s and 
a corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) is prepared and presented to the customer. Any commercial 
issues, costs for repair/ rectification, rectification plan schedule etc is negotiated with the customer and 
the rectification/ repairs are completed.
	
As a preventive action, any lessons learnt from the project are discussed at Quarterly review meetings and 
any modifications needed to the SOP’s/ Quality Assurance Plans are made. These lessons learnt are taken 
into consideration while negotiating any future project contracts.

Cyber Security and Data privacy of customers: We have a project specific server/ share point for each 
project where the data pertaining to that project is stored. The access to this is controlled and provided 
to only select persons handling the project. Generally, project contracts have a secrecy/ non-disclosure 
clause wherein a specific period is mentioned up to which we must store the project data with us. If not, 
then the project data is stored for a period of 5 years.
	
Re-occurrence of instances of product recalls: In case even after taking the preventive actions and 
modifications to SOP’s Quality plans as mentioned above, there is an instance of a re-occurrence of defects, 
then a re-assessment of the root cause analysis is done any parameters that were previously overlooked 
are identified. A new CAPA is made and accordingly actions taken, and any further necessary changes 
made to the SOP’s and Quality plans
	
Penalty/ action taken by regulatory authorities: Since our products are engineered by the client, the 
question does not apply to us. Regarding any manufacturing related activity, we have not received any 
penalty/ action on safety of our products. We are certified as per ISO 45001 and SA 8000 and continue to 
conform to the same.

procedure to safely store the pipes for a long term are provided to the customer as and when required 
against the specific project.

Yes. To conform to API 5L requirements the API monogram and minimum required information is always 
marked on each pipe.
In addition to this depending on project requirements, specific additional information can be marked and 
is covered under a separate document titled “marking map.”
Depending on customer requirements 1D or 2D bar codes can also be applied to the pipes at 
specified locations.
Upon the completion of the Final delivery of every project, a customer feedback form is sent to the 
customer. Their responses and ratings are noted and circulated to the plant, quality team and all relevant 
departments for their continuous improvement. The customer satisfaction scores across various projects 
are compiled into a final CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) score. This score must satisfy the CSAT target for 
the year. If not, then a root cause analysis and CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions) is performed.
