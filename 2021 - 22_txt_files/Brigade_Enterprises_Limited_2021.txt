Annual Sustainability Report 2021-22
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Brigade Group is India’s leading property developer with over three decades of expertise in building 
positive experiences for all its stakeholders. ‘Brigade Group’ refers to Brigade Enterprises Ltd (BEL), the 
listed entity’s subsidiaries and associated companies.
Stepping up for ESG (environment, social and governance) disclosures, we have included Sector-Specific 
disclosures for the construction and real estate sector in this fourth Sustainability Report, over and above 
GRI Standards. In addition, it includes ESG  disclosure requirements, known as Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Reporting (BRSR), mandated for the top 1000 listed entities as per Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Regulations.
This sustainability report discloses the ESG performance of the Brigade Group and its subsidiaries under the 
three verticals, Real estate (Property Development), Lease Rentals (Property Management) and Hospitality 
segment for all locations. The data represented in the report is consolidated  at the Group Level for the 
environment, social, governance and financial/economic parameters, while the
disaggregated data, is also disclosed for transparency. 
In the previous year, we conducted an elaborate stakeholder consultation that revealed material areas 
important for all stakeholders and management. We continue to focus on these strategic areas while 
tracking all other ESG indicators. Identified material areas are  Climate Protection, Biodiversity, Water and 
Wastewater; Corporate Governance, Business Growth and Profitability, Ethics & Integrity and  Human 
Rights. In this report, metrics are shared for all material strategic indicators and tactical indicators. 
Key highlights of the reporting period are as follows:
Climate Protection (Energy & Emissions): Continuing our work on Climate protection, our focus remains 
on reducing emissions and developing resilient infrastructure. Our overall electricity consumption from 
renewable sources was 21 % during the reporting period, We have installed an onsite solar capacity of 260 
kWp and 1213 kWp in our World Trade Center, Chennai and Brigade Tech Gardens, Bengaluru respectively. 
We continued to innovate around pre-fab structures and digitization. 
Biodiversity: 60,000+ trees were planted across our projects, increasing the green cover in the urban 
landscapes. To reduce embedded emissions in projects, we created project-based plant nurseries so that 
transport emissions for plants are reduced. It also helps develop the unique plant mix required for the 
specific site. 
Water and Wastewater: In line with the Group’s philosophy to conserve water, we have taken several new 
initiatives in the reporting period for efficient water management, such as ‘WeGOT’- smart water flow 
measurement, triple plumbing system,  ECOSTP for wastewater recycling and rainwater harvesting.  These 
new initiatives are being implemented on a trial basis in select projects and based on the success, these 
will be gradually introduced to all projects.
Corporate Governance: We continue to strengthen the policy implementation framework.  In adherence to 
the corporate governance requirements as per SEBI, we are mapping details of the organization and value 
chain for BRSR reporting.
Business Growth and Profitability: FY 2021-22 was a recovery period from the pandemic, and we have 
achieved the highest ever pre-sales in our real estate development sector. 
Occupational Health and Safety:  With ISO 45001:2018 management systems in place, we have achieved the 
consistent result of Zero fatality across all our project sites. A well-driven health and safety system with strict 
protocols for CoVID appropriate behaviour has helped us achieve consistent results with respect to health 
and safety.
Employee Engagement and Diversity -  Our current Board diversity is at 30% and employee gender diversity 
at 20%. Our employee engagement programs and good governance practices have helped us secure the 
‘Great Place to Work’ certification for the 12th consecutive year.
Suppliers - The construction and real estate business is a highly resource-intensive industry. In the reporting 
year, we have sourced about 40% of the input materials directly from small suppliers and (MSME) companies. 
Across our project locations, about 60%  of the input materials are sourced locally, within the district or 
neighbouring districts.
Customers – A strong CRM function along with the Customer Care Services (CCS), Estate Management 
(EM), Sales departments and Brigade Plus makes sure that we engage with our customers responsibly and 
efficiently while handling the customer queries. In the reporting period, we introduced Qwikspec app for 
ease in customer handover. 
CSR:  Our social contribution continued in the identified environmental and social initiatives, with total 
spending of INR 643 lakh on socio-cultural and environmental projects. 
The focus on ESG is advancing, and efforts are made to move towards a more inclusive and resilient 
organization. The way forward for Brigade is to set targets for the future in the coming year and continue to 
work on achieving those targets in this decade.

REPORT OVERVIEW
1.1 About the Report
01
Leap into the future – towards a sustainable tomorrow
It is our collective responsibility to create a sustainable tomorrow. Construction has a long-term footprint 
and whatever is created today has a bearing on our collective future. 
Our sustainability journey and the progress with respect to ESG are disclosed in the sustainability report, 
which helps us, and our stakeholders know about the impact of our work and evolve new strategies to take 
the challenges head-on. This is Brigade Group’s fourth sustainability report and the journey progressed from 
a basic sustainability report to a full GRI Standards-aligned Sustainability Report. This year we have disclosed 
sector-specific indicators for construction and Real Estate, as also the BRSR indicators. 
As a responsible organization,  we adopt the business strategies and activities that meet the organization’s 
and its stakeholder’s needs, sustaining and enhancing the human and natural resources that will be needed 
in the future. Our report, Leap into the future is about being diligent today while keeping the best interest of 
future generations always at the forefront. Continuing to work on energy, emissions, water and biodiversity, 
we have worked on resource optimization across verticals.  We use digital and technological advancements 
to deliver state-of-the-art products and services to our customers. 
1.2 Reporting Framework
The sustainability report provides information on our Environmental, Social and Governance progress. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the ‘Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 
option’. The report discloses information related to the GRI G4 Sector-Specific Disclosures (Construction and 
Real Estate). As per the SEBI notification, this report also maps the BRSR requirement, mandating the top 1000 
listed companies to follow the new reporting format on ESG parameters from 2022-23. However, the BRSR 
reporting for the current reporting period is voluntary. We have disclosed the essential indicators against the 
nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business 
Conduct (NGBRCs). 
We conducted a detailed materiality assessment for the previous reporting period and have continued the 
work on the same material areas for the current reporting period. The report provides progress for each 
material area compared to the previous year, wherever applicable.

ABOUT BRIGADE GROUP
2.3 Message from the Chairman
Dear Stakeholders,
I am delighted to share our Sustainability Report for the financial year 2021-22 on the topics material to 
our organization and sector. The Sustainability Report is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Standards and stepping up we have also included sector-specific disclosures relating real estate sector. 
The report also covers the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) requirements of the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India which is voluntary for the financial year 2021-22.
02
The financial year 2021-22 was operationally a good year as compared to the previous year which was impacted 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are excited to share that we have a strong pipeline of ongoing projects 
equivalent to 17.4 Mn sq ft. All the business segments performed well. The residential business segment 
performance was remarkable, achieving the highest ever pre-sales of 4.72 Mn sq. ft with a sale value of INR 
30,227 Mn in FY22, an increase of 2 % from FY21. The Leasing and Hospitality business segments performed 
better as compared to the previous financial year. 
Brigade Group posted a revenue of Rs. 3,066 crores for FY 22 as against Rs. 2,010 crores in the previous year, 
an increase of 52%. The Earnings before Depreciation, Interest, Tax and Amortization (EBITDA) of Rs. 833 
crores in FY22 as against Rs. 532 crores in the previous year, an increase of 56%. The profit after Tax and 
Minority Interest of Rs. 83 cores as against Rs. 46 crores loss in the previous year.
This economic recovery is incomplete without assuring our stakeholders about our commitment to safe-
guarding the environment, having best practices for employees and workers, and making a positive contribution 
to our local communities. Through the Brigade Foundation, we continue to serve society in the areas of health 
& education, and the groundwork for skill development has begun. Our team delivered remarkably, continuing 
to bag the ‘Great Place to Work for the 12th consecutive year. Our board diversity remains among the highest 
in the industry and we continue to find new ways to engage our employees. Our excellent safety performance 
continued in the financial year and implementing ISO 45001 has helped keep safety as one of the top agendas. 
Climate Protection and Water Conservation are the need of the hour. 
Brigade started its reliance on renewables early on and we are continuing to enhance renewable power sourcing 
for all verticals. Similarly, several projects this year are helping drive the importance of water conservation for 
our team and our customers.
Looking forward, I see FY23 as a year that will have fresh starts and much of the dust will settle in the markets 
that will enable us to take up new projects and continue to excel in the operational and financial performance 
in all our business segments. During this year, we would be able to understand our stakeholder concerns a bit 
more deeply and focus on specific areas that can help us look into the future. The focus on ESG is advancing 
and efforts are made to move towards a more inclusive and resilient organization by leaping into the future 
with sustainable initiatives.
I take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders for their continued overwhelming support and for being a 
part of our growth journey.

ABOUT BRIGADE GROUP
2.4 Corporate Governance 
We respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in our value chains (Principle 3)
Accessibility of workplaces 
Our office spaces are built keeping in mind differently-abled employees and workers. The spaces are designed 
and constructed as per the requirements of the NBC, considering all the requirements and arrangements for 
people with disabilities as per the PWD Act 2016. 
Equal opportunity policy 
Brigade is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against employees/candidates based on 
gender, caste, race, colour, religion, sexual orientation or expression, pregnancy, age, nationality, disability, 
etc. Performance and merit are the only parameters for the selection, and equal opportunities are 
provided. 
Real Estate has traditionally been a male-dominated industry due to the laborious site work. At Brigade, we 
are making all possible efforts to create an inclusive environment and provide equal opportunity to all those 
interested to work in this industry based on their skill sets. As of this year, our gender ratio stands at 80:20 
(Male: Female). We have initiated additional measures to ensure the workplace is easily accessible to the 
differently-abled, which helps them to contribute efficiently. The senior management has a deep-rooted 
commitment to create an inclusive environment throughout the workforce. Some steps that we have taken 
at Brigade, include: Encourage diverse pools of talent
 
•   Have an inclusive interview process – do away with any chances of bias and have a diverse interview       	
      panel
 •   Choosing the right tools to support recruitment and onboarding
 •   Adopt relevant facilities to assist the differently-abled
 •   Special focus on enhancing  gender ratio
We do not have an explicit policy for the same, however, some of our other policies cover inclusion and 
fair practices for all, and we encourage and ensure that we abide by the rules and regulations set by the 
authorities. 
02
Grievance Redressal mechanism
Making the workplace positive and spreading positivity is our highest priority. We believe in redressing any 
grievance escalated by an employee, properly and promptly. Grievances in the workplace could lead to a 
negative environment. Hence, we at Brigade believe it is important to have a proper redressal system in 
place.
We provide open avenues for employees to share experiences about their job or how he/she feels about the 
management policies, and procedures and ensure every employee has a voice and feelings are expressed by 
the employee and brought to the notice of the management for corrective action. This has been an integral 
part of our journey.
We have put in place a full-proof mechanism to address the grievances, and a mechanism, to resolve these 
in a time-bound manner. We have the following initiatives as a mechanism to understand and hear from 
employees.
1. Write @ CMD: one-on-one with our CMD.
2.  Skip Manager Meeting: A way to create a stronger bond with employees at all levels.
3.  HR CONNECT Zonal HR: “Every good conversation starts with listening”- A platform to listen to 
     employee concerns.
4.  Whistle-blower @ Brigade: an opportunity for all to blow the whistle and raise their voice.
5.  Criss-cross Connect: Leaders Connect and communicate with cross-functional teams for a PURPOSE.
6.  KAFFEEKLATSCH: A lot can happen over a cup of coffee
7.  Ear to the ground Policy : An opportunity for the employee to stand up against anything harmful” 
     The following steps are adopted for effective grievance handling:
      •  Enable employees to air their grievance
      •  Clarify the nature of the grievance
      •  Investigate the reason for the dissatisfaction
      •  Help in finding a speedy resolution 
      •  Inform the employees about their right to escalate the grievance to the next level, in the event of         
          an unsuccessful resolution

We conducted an elaborate stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis in the previous year. The 
material topics that emerged as high priority remain our focus for the reporting year. The rationale for 
identifying the material areas through an extensive stakeholder engagement is to arrive at strategic areas 
that present risks or opportunities for the business.

Financial implications of the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative implications)
By adopting energy-efficient construction to limit damage to the ecosystem 
and reduce the use of natural resources like energy, land, water, and raw 
materials. Reducing energy consumption is crucial because it means fewer 
emissions of greenhouse gases, a known cause of global warming. The 
conservation of Energy and Water, and the protection of the 
environment – air, water & Land from pollution – is an integral part 
of Design and Development.
Short term financial investment can provide long

Low financial implications, but investment in right 
technologies will be rewarding for long term 
1. By adopting in-house sewage treatment & recycling for flushing and 
gardening through well-designed STPs
2. By installing well-designed rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge 
facilities
3. By Installing IoT-based smart flow meters to monitor the consumption and 
losses to take required corrective action on time.
4. By installing flow water fixtures to reduce the consumption and losses.
5. By installation and use of waterless urinals to reduce the freshwater 
consumption

Our commitment to environmental concerns is evident in the best principle, the precautionary 
approach that we follow in our daily operations. We have an integrated Environmental 
Management system with policies and processes to measure and reduce our environmental 
impact. We have so far delivered 13.52 Mn sq. ft of Green Certified buildings and are 
pioneers in Green buildings in Southern India. By going for LEED (Leader in Energy and 
Environmental Design) or IGBC (Indian Green Building Council) certifications, we ensure that 
our environmental and climate impact is minimized. We have optimized energy consumption 
in our operations owing to the best energy efficiency and conservation measures that we 
follow at our projects. We will also try to reduce our dependence ongrid electricity by 
increasing the purchase of green power year on year. We use green power for our projects, 
Orion Mall Gateway, WTC Bengaluru, Brigade Tech Gardens, Brigade Opus and Brigade 
Magnum and our Hotel Projects. We have measures in place to monitor air quality at all our 
construction sites and all compliance is adhered to diligently. We will continue our efforts 
to improve our environmental performance in areas of energy and emissions to minimise 
climate change impacts and work on buildings that are adapted to the emerging scenarios.
Clearly laid out vision, shared and inclusive mission and clarity on values is the bedrock for 
promoting a culture of responsibility, equity and fairness. These values are translated into 
systems, procedures through policies and careful monitoring of those policies, systems and 
standards. Any diversion from the code of conduct has implications. We strive to be the 
benchmark in ethical conduct and integrity whether communications with our investors, 
partners, customers, value chain and employees.
The construction sector is highly dependent on water and as much as possible, we try 
to reduce our water consumption. We use innovative ways to reduce water usage by 
minimising wastage. During the construction stage, we use curing agents to minimise water 
consumption. We have STP at our project sites and use recycled water for landscaping, 
vehicle washing and dust suppression activities in the project sites. We have rain-water 
harvesting measures to recharge the groundwater table. It is imperative to operate 
responsibly to have minimal impact on the environment.

One of the main indicators of our economic success and shared value proposition is business 
growth and profitability. Whether ongoing, completed or in the pipeline, information on 
products is always transparently available on our website. We have many firsts to our 
portfolio, and we endeavour to bring more and more sustainability into our core business 
proposition that reflects the current needs of society
At Brigade Group, we try to preserve the natural biodiversity of the project site as much 
as possible. Our approach targets the prevention of damage to biodiversity as the first 
step. The next is to conserve what we can, and if we are unable to conserve, we relocate 
the trees. In circumstances that relocation of a tree is not possible, we plant three trees in 
place of one. The third approach is to enhance biodiversity through proactive afforestation 
and reforestation measures. The objective to create ‘Urban Forests’ using the Miyawaki 
method to increase the green lung spaces in our cities. Our ‘Urban Forest’ initiative aims 
to develop dense mini forests.
We have implemented inclusive policies for women and other vulnerable groups. We protect 
the rights be it labour conditions on work timings, forced labour, child labour etc. We do 
realise that every supply chain at the rear end can have blind spots. It is our responsibility 
to identify those areas and iron those out for equity and fairness as reflected in our values. 
We work with established suppliers who have human rights practices embedded in their 
core business proposition, but not all the supply chains in the Construction Industry follow 
the same standards. There is more work required in this area to create awareness and set 
measurable targets for improvement
We adhere to all corporate governance regulations laid out by the regulatory authorities, 
be it our tax approach, remuneration, audits and all policies. Board oversight on critical 
issues and the record of the meetings is shared in our annual reports regularly.

Mixed-use space
Mixed-use buildings and developments not only sustainably utilize resources and spaces, but also provide 
city inhabitants with neighbourhoods that integrate home, work, shopping, transportation, and even green 
spaces. 
A mixed-use building combines three or more uses into one structure such as residential, hotel, retail, 
parking, transportation, cultural and entertainment. Whatever the combination, it brings together several 
uses within either one building or a small area. The two most common forms of mixed-use design are Vertical 
and Horizontal development.
Brigade Group has mixed-use projects in Bengaluru, of which four (4) are ongoing and two (2) are at the 
design stage.

4.2 Lease Rentals (property management)
The Brigade Group manages its Retail space under the Leasing segment also known as Lease Rentals. Under this, 
the two subsidiary companies are WTC Trades & Projects Pvt Ltd. and Orion Property Management Services 
Ltd. (OPMSL). The WTC –Bengaluru, Chennai and Kochi properties are managed by WTC Trades & Projects Pvt 
Ltd., whereas all the retail spaces (malls and commercial spaces) are managed by OPMSL. The Board of the two 
wholly-owned subsidiaries has approved a scheme of amalgamation in which Orion Property Management 
Services Limited will amalgamate with WTC Trades & Projects Private Ltd. The rationale for the amalgamation 
is the similarity of business model, synergy in operations and scale & size of the business.
Our retail projects share a few key factors, such as strategic locations, convenient access, imaginative 
architectural planning, excellent front and back-end infrastructural facilities and a winning mix of retail outlets. 
Our top-class retail projects include Orion Mall at Brigade Gateway, The Arcade, Orion Avenue, Orion Uptown, 
Brigade Solitaire, Nalapad Brigade Broadway, in Bengaluru and Brigade Vantage in Chennai. Nalapad Brigade 
Gateway and Brigade Vantage are in the ready-to-fit-out stage, whereas the Orion Avenue Mall and The Arcade 
are operational.
The commercial office space at Brigade Group offers an excellent workspace environment, catering to both 
small and large businesses. Some of our commercial projects include Brigade Triumph, Brigade Deccan Heights, 
Brigade Tech Gardens, World Trade Centre and more. 
The total leasable area during the reporting period is 8.70 Mn. sq ft out of which 6.22 Mn. sq ft has been leased 
out. As the pandemic situation continued to loom around us, it has impacted international travel and has had 
a negative impact on the office leasing space. However, we are hopeful of picking up speed in the lease and 
rental business as the situation improves.

4.4 Green Building Services 
A green building refers to both structure and application of the processes that are environmentally  responsible 
and resource-efficient throughout the building’s life cycle from planning, design, constriction, renovation and 
demolition. The green building practice encourages the classical design concerns of economy, durability and 
comfort. In doing so three dimensions of sustainability should be considered, planet, people and profit. 
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is an internationally accepted certification for green 
buildings, which is a set of rating systems for the design and construction of green buildings. Projects pursuing 
LEED certification earn points for different green strategies and the buildings will be rated as Silver, Gold and 
Platinum according to the points gained.
IGBC is the Indian Green Building Council, that promotes a sustainable built environment through green 
building certifications. We started our green building journey in 2011 with Green building certification for 
‘Brigade IRV’ and every year we have added green building space across our commercial projects.

The ongoing pandemic situation in India and globally caused significant disturbance and slowdown of 
economic activities
The economic highlights shared here are FY 22 business results for the Brigade Group. As the reporting 
period was still under the pandemic influence partially, our operations were impacted because of labour 
shortages. However, we achieved the highest ever pre-sales of ~4.7 Mn sq. ft with a sale value of INR 30,227 
Mn in FY22, an increase of 2% from FY21 and a strong pipeline of ongoing projects of ~17.4 Mn sq. ft in our 
Real Estate (Property Development)  vertical.
In the  Lease Rentals (Property Management) vertical, we leased out ~1 Mn sq. ft during the reporting period 
and have an active pipeline of ~1 Mn sq. ft. Office renewals of ~0.5 Mn sq. ft during FY22 at 14% escalation 
were observed. Retail sales consumption surpassed pre-covid levels from mid of Feb 2022; F&B, Multiplexes 
performed well due to big box office releases.
The Hospitality vertical showcased an impressive revival since February, with an occupancy rate of 64%. A 
sharp recovery in the F&B segment, banquet events (corporate and social), leisure and group travel is a 
positive sign for the next financial year.

6.1 Overview
We respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment (Principle 6). 
The construction industry accounts for an incredible 36% of the worldwide energy usage and 40% of the 
CO₂ emissions. 
We believe in sustainable practices to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment. Our 
approach to safeguarding the local environment and creating a positive impact on the global environment is 
to map and measure the sectoral issues. On the one hand, identifying areas that can lead to quick wins and 
having long-term context for target setting on the other helps keep our workforce motivated and engaged. 
Some initiatives taken across the Group are energy conservation and efficiency programs, renewable 
energy, recycled materials, water conservation and waste management endorsed through green building 
certifications. Some of our work on biodiversity is exemplary as we have demonstrated the art of relocating 
the city’s oldest heritage “the large trees’’ to newer venues. This is in line with our commitment to safeguard 
the local environment.
06
This chapter provides information on environmental indicators, especially those that featured high on 
our material priorities -  climate protection- energy & emissions, water & wastewater and biodiversity. 
Additionally, disclosures are made for other significant environmental parameters such as materials & waste, 
and environmental compliance. Other disclosures such as land degradation, contamination and remediation, 
transport and environmental impact of products and services as required by the sector-specific disclosures 
are also discussed here.
The data is analysed for each of our business verticals separately namely, Real Estate (Property Development), 
Lease Rentals (Property Management) and Hospitality. Consolidated data for the Group is also disclosed for 
each thematic priority. While for Real Estate (property development), all data is mapped for disclosures, in 
Leasing and Hospitality, disclosures are based on data that is available and tracked and it is not representative 
of 100% of the resource use and other indicators e.g., data for Signature Towers and GIFT City- Gandhinagar 
(Lease Rental) is excluded and similarly some minor data pertaining to other indicators may be missing.

6.1 Materials & Waste 
06
The durability of any structure is determined by the quality and quantity of the materials being used. We 
are aware that the construction industry is highly resource and material intensive. It is thus important for 
us to practice efficient management of such huge quantities of materials as it directly affects our waste 
generation. At Brigade, effective resource utilization is key, we formulate and follow a waste 
management plan (WMP) at all our sites before commencing any construction works. 
 
Material and waste, though, didn’t emerge as one of the material topics; being in the material-intensive 
sector we feel that disclosing the same is our moral responsibility towards all our stakeholders. 
 
In this section, we have disclosed our material consumption and waste generation for real estate and lease 
rental verticals. Since the hospitality vertical is leased out to third parties and the material consumption is 
not directly under our operational control; we have disclosed a few select material consumptions. Similarly, 
the waste data for the hospitality vertical is for one project and should be 
considered representative.
The sustainability report provides information on our Environmental, Social, and Governance progress. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the ‘Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 
option’. The report discloses information related to the GRI G4 Sector-Specific Disclosures (Construction 
and Real Estate). This report also maps the BRSR requirement, as per the SEBI notification mandating the 
top 1000 listed companies to follow the new reporting format on ESG parameters from 2022-23. However, 
the BRSR reporting for the current reporting period is voluntary. We have disclosed the essential indicators 
against the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGBRCs).
We conducted a detailed materiality assessment for the previous reporting period and have continued the 
work on the same material areas for the current reporting period too. The report provides progress for 
each material area compared to the previous year, wherever applicable.

6.1 Materials 
Material requirements for real estate vertical are very distinct from hospitality and Lease Rentals.  For construction, 
large quantities of materials such as cement, steel, aluminium, and wood are required as raw materials that 
contribute to the building envelope. The fittings and finishing stage for the buildings require an entirely different 
set of materials such as electric wires, plumbing pipes, fixtures, paints, etc. For Property Management, on the 
other hand, the material requirement is mostly for maintenance such as LED lighting equipment, consumables, 
and occasionally installation of new machines e.g. luggage screening machines.  In the case of hospitality, data 
for some of the consumables are disclosed for the reporting period.

disclosed is for all categories of construction such as residential, commercial 
and mixed-use.
For any property construction, the first stage involves excavation, casting of the foundation and backfilling 
of earth. In the reporting year, the total earth used for backfilling is 78458 CuM. The backfilling can be done 
with materials available onsite or sourced from outside. Due to the varying size of the projects, the ratio of 
onsite to offsite backfilling earth has decreased from the previous year. For the reporting year, backfilling

Real Estate
Real Estate (Property Development)
There are various types of materials used in developing any property. To simplify, we have classified the ma-
terials used into different categories. First is the raw material category of manufactured products required 
for construction such as bricks, iron, steel, aluminium, etc. The second category comprises materials used for 
concrete such as construction aggregates, cement, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), etc, and 
the third category is for fixtures, paints and other miscellaneous materials. All the materials listed are exter-
nally sourced, however certain raw materials are recycled and reused. The data disclosed for each material 
type is based on direct measurements.
We are aware that the construction industry is resource-intensive, and we must use the resources efficiently. 
We follow the recycle and reuse principles as much as possible. We have specified recycled/reused materials 
as a distinct set of items which includes GGBS, fly ash, wood, concrete waste and steel. The following tables

6.1b Waste
The construction industry is resource-intensive, and the waste generated is also in significant quantities. 
The waste generated, if not handled properly, can be a threat to the environment. We, therefore, aim for 
optimum resource utilization and minimum waste generation in all our operations. We try to utilize waste 
materials in two ways, one is reusing (components) and the second is recycling (processing raw materials 
from construction waste and reusing). However, material management that reduces wastage is the best 
strategy deployed in all projects. At Brigade, we ensure materials are handled and stored in good conditions 
to prevent deterioration and wastage. 
Waste generated is categorised as hazardous and non-hazardous. Hazardous wastes contain toxic substances 
that can create substantial damage to the environment and public health whereas non-hazardous wastes 
can be reused or recycled or disposed through authorised vendors.
Hazardous Waste:
In the reporting period, at the Group level, the hazardous waste generated is used oil (10,964 l), used oil 
filters (304 numbers) cotton waste (686 kg), e-waste (247 kg), biomedical waste (380 kg), paint waste (533 l) 
and other miscellaneous waste (1511 kg).

Real Estate (Property Development)
Hazardous waste generated in the Real Estate segment (Property Development) could be compared with the 
previous year. In the reporting year, we identified two new streams, for which monitoring and measuring 
were carried out, such as biomedical waste and rubber waste. We were able to achieve reductions in waste 
quantities for used oil, used oil filters and cotton waste whereas there was an increase in paint waste from 
the previous year owing to more projects in the final stages of completion.
When it comes to measuring hazardous waste intensity, in 2020-21, against an area development of 18 
million sq. ft., 18.6 tonnes of waste was generated; whereas in 2021-22, the hazardous waste quantity for 
12.6 million sq. ft of development was 9.3 tons. The waste intensity is calculated in kg/sq. ft for both the 
years is shown in the given chart.

6.1 b Waste
All three verticals generate non-hazardous waste such as scrap steel, paper, plastic, food waste, etc. In the 
reporting year, the total non-hazardous waste generated was 1987 tons of which 82% was generated from 
the Real Estate (property development) vertical. Scrap steel constitutes the major portion of the waste which 
is 883 tons (44%), wet garbage is 406 tons (20%), food waste, paper waste and waste wood together account 
for almost one-third of the total waste i.e., 662 tons (33%), whereas plastic and other wastes constitute 
36 tons (2%) of the total waste. The construction and demolition waste generated under the property 
management vertical is 26 tons which are included here under other waste.
At Brigade, we are aware of the importance of the proper disposal of waste. For Real Estate and Leasing 
segments, most of the waste is handed over to third-party contractors (BBMP, KSPCB, HK Services). Under 
hospitality, for some projects, waste is handled by Pollution Control Board (PCB) authorized vendors and 
some by BBMP.

6.1 c Wastewater Management
In order to protect our environment, careful monitoring and treatment of wastewater are very important. It 
saves the nearby water bodies from getting contaminated with excess organic load and toxic chemicals and 
thus saves aquatic life. 
At Brigade, we monitor wastewater for all the verticals, right from the quantity, quality, treatment, and 
suitable usage along with scientific treatment methods and reused. A total of 497 million litres of wastewater 
was recycled in the reporting year with the maximum quantity from lease rentals which is 436 million 
litres (88%), whereas the hospitality vertical generated 52 million litres (10.5%) and the real estate vertical 
contributed to 9 million litres (2%) of the total waste water recycled.  
The wastewater generated at our properties is scientifically treated through well-designed in-house sewage 
treatment plants (STPs) with various treatment principles such as ASP, SBR, MBR, MBBR and Eco-STP to meet 
the treated water quality beyond statutory discharge limits and to reuse for toilet flushing, landscaping, and 
Make-up water for water-cooled air-conditioning systems. This reduces the dependency on municipal water 
supply which is pumped from far-off locations; indirectly saving energy and freshwater consumption.

Eco STP
We at Brigade always look for innovative ideas, new technologies, processes, and practices to make sure all 
our developments and operations are sustainable and have minimal impact on the environment and the 
natural resource reserve we depend on. Hence, as part of our Brigade REAP initiative, we have explored the 
environment-friendly wastewater treatment system ECOSTP - Zero Power, Zero Chemicals Sewage Treatment 
Technology.  and installed a 10KLD plant at our new development site “Brigade Cornerstone Utopia” - office. 
The ECOSTP system can be designed to fit any shape based on the availability of space. 
This Eco-STP consists of primarily three parts: i) Bio–Settler ii) FBR (Fluidized Bed Reactor) and iii) FFR (Fixed 
Film Reactor). This technology treats sewage in a decentralized, self-sustainable way in underground chambers 
without consuming any power, chemicals, or human intervention. Using biomimicry, and regenerative 
innovation inspired by nature, the ECO-STP utilizes functional principles and strategies of microorganisms 
and the ecosystem found in a cow’s stomach.
The uniqueness of this technology is the “Zero Power Zero Chemical” Sewage Treatment process which has 
no moving parts compared to conventional STPs which depend on energy-hogging motors, exhaust fans, 
pumps, and blowers. The Eco STP plant is a replica of a cow’s stomach based on biomimicry concepts. After 
installation of ECOSTP in Brigade Triumph Residences and Brigade Cornerstone Utopia project office, further, 
it is designed for Neem Groove at Brigade Orchards and Brigade Ivory labour camp.
Parameters such as BOD, COD, Total Solids, Total DIssolved and Total Suspended Soilds, Phosphorus, 
Chloride, Alkalinity, Grease, Total Nitrogen, Ammonical Nitrogen as NH4-N and Faecal Colliform are 
monitored regularly for real estate, lease rentals and hospitality. All parameters are also sent for testing 
and values are found to be within permissible limits.

6.2  Energy & Emissions
Construction industry has a large GHG footprint. Given the growing demand in the sector, it is expected that 
the energy demand will continue to rise, which if sourced from conventional energy systems, will lead to rise 
in emissions. This section provides information on energy consumption and carbon emissions across all the 
verticals under Brigade Group. Although India’s overall emissions per capita are low, however, there is an 
opportunity to leapfrog to low emission buildings. 
Energy consumption and emission for any entity are completely interlinked. For Brigade, energy in terms of 
power is generated through grid electricity, renewable/ green sources and DG sets. Apart from electricity, 
some additional energy sources are LPG, diesel and petrol consumption for different purposes.
We are also striving towards using renewable sources  for our electricity consumption by investing in the 
installation of solar panels or procuring green energy. This year 21 % of the total electricity is generated 
through onsite and offsite renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.
06
Of the total energy consumed, the Leasing segment (Property Management) accounts for 49%, while 
Hospitality is at 28% and the Real Estate segment (Property Development) at 23%. In the leasing segment, 
the maximum power of ~50% is utilized at all three WTC locations (Bengaluru, Chennai and Kochi) and the 
six malls and commercial sites all based in Bengaluru. 
           
kWh: Kilo Watt-hour; MWh: Mega Watt-hour; TJ: Terra Joules
A total of 96146 MWh of power is consumed across all verticals. The major source of electricity is the state 
grid which produces 73.3% of the total power, followed by renewable energy produced on-site and offsite 
at 21.4% and the rest  5.3% is produced by DG sets.

control of many subsidiaries across verticals, the data for emissions is presented as Scope 1 and Scope 
2, irrespective of the type of control. As the entity intensifies Scope 3 carbon accounting, the overall 
emissions may get further clarified in coming years. The emissions for Scope 1 are primarily carbon dioxide 
(fugitive emissions and other GHG emissions are not factored in these calculations) and so these should 
be considered tentative and an attempt to initiatiate accounting for Greenhouse gases (GHGs). This initial 
accounting helps us analyse areas where energy efficiency improvement is most required. 
We have calculated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions across three verticals that are presented in the following 
charts. We have total 76,065 tons of CO2 emissions, out of which 20,368  tons CO2 (27%) is from Scope -1 
and 55,697 tons CO2 (73%) from Scope-2 emissions. 
Scope-1 emissions arise from any fuel consumption such as diesel , LPG, petrol, etc. LPG consumption in 
hotels is quite high which reflects in considerable Scope 1 emissions for Hospitality sector. 
Scope-2 emissions are due to grid electricity consumption. In our case, lease rentals vertical has high scope-2 
emissions majorly due to extensive energy use in malls and commercials.

Emissions intensity-Real Estate  
The overall building emission intensity (development of property in one financial year, in this case reporting 
year) for real estate vertical  is 1.44 kg CO2 /sq. ft. for 12.6 million sq. ft of area developed.  Here,  scope-1 
emission intensity is 0.27 kg CO2 /sq. ft. and scope 2 is 1.17 kg CO2 /sq. ft. These figures at an early stage do 
not represent the development emissions per sq. ft. for the building, as buildings are in various stages of 
development. However, as we continue to monitor data across the full development cycle, we will be able to 
arrive at an average building emission development intensity.

                                       Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency Initiatives
We understand the risks of climate change and prioritise efforts to improve energy efficiency and reduce 
our GHG emissions. We have adopted various energy efficiency initiatives in order to reduce our emissions 
such as:
• Design of energy-efficient buildings by embedding sustainability into the design and by carrying out building 
orientation, energy, air, sun path and daylighting simulation and modelling. 
• Reducing energy loss by reducing heat loss through energy-efficient building planning and by adopting 
engineered building insulation and envelope.
• Implementing a whole-building systems approach for new construction to achieve an energy-efficient 
building. The whole-building approach treats the building as one energy system with separate, but dependent 
parts which affects the performance of the entire system (the whole building).
• Designing of energy-efficient buildings by considering the provision to allow for future retrofits without 
impacting the performance of the building.
• Installing energy-efficient light fixtures, and LED lights with motion sensors, timers, and dimmers across all 
our projects.
• Use of occupancy sensors in the sparingly used area in the buildings, viz., Rest Rooms, Change Rooms, 
Corridors, Staircase, Car Parking / Basement Area, etc.
• Utilization of solar energy wherever possible for water heating and lighting in all the projects of the 
company.
• Solar PV Panels are installed in all commercial projects of the company to harness renewable energy 
sources to ensure reduced carbon emissions.

encouraging the installation of renewable energy systems and catering clean energy for our clients/occupants.
• Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) Star-certified electro-mechanical equipment (Viz., Pumps, Drives, 
Compressors, etc.) are used in the project.
• Adopting an Energy-efficient Water-Cooled Air-Conditioning System with a high coefficient of performance 
in all Commercial Buildings developed by the company.
• Installation of smart app-based electrical systems to control and optimize their use.
• Reduce energy wastage due to distribution by designing the right sizing of copper cables and Installation 
of copper wound transformers to reduce the losses.
• Optimizing the use of backup power systems (DG Sets) by using synchronizing panels and sensors.
• Planned preventive maintenance for all electrical and electro-mechanical installations is prepared and 
handover to the facilities team or to the respective building associations as guidelines to ensure the right 
usage and long life of the systems.
• IoT sensors for the collection of data are installed for all water and energy-consuming fixtures or devices.
It is estimated that these energy efficiency initiatives help us save 15-20% energy when compared to the 
base case of the latest Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), in our commercial projects.

Renewable Energy: Engineering, Supply, Installation, Testing & Commissioning of  260 kWp rooftop solar 
PV plant at World Trade Center, Chennai and 1213 kWp rooftop solar PV plant at Brigade Tech Gardens, 
Bengaluru.
Renewable energy is the need of the hour in combatting climate change. Other benefits of renewable energy 
are self-reliance on electricity in a cost-effective manner, insurance against future increases in electricity 
tariff, and utilizing unused roof space. Hence switching to renewable energy is one of the most important 
actions an organization can take to reduce the environmental impact of electricity generation. At Brigade, we 
are cognizant of this need and are pursuing to increase our share of renewable energy across our business 
verticals. During the reporting period, we had two new solar PV installations, one at WTC- Chennai and the 
other at BTG, Bengaluru.   
At Brigade Tech Garden (BTG), Whitefield, Bengaluru
The total solar PV plant capacity is 1213 kW with the installed capacity at Block-B: 550 kW and at Block-C: 663 
kW. Each of the solar PV systems is placed on a different building block/tower roof with different capacities 
for shadow-free areas. The 550kWp system is divided into two blocks of 257.5 kWp and 292.5 kWp, with 1692 
modules with a module capacity of 325 Wp. Similarly, the 663.68 kWp solar photovoltaic rooftop system is 
installed on four different building blocks to achieve the required power, consisting of 1952 modules with a 
module capacity of 340 Wp. The power evacuated is 415V at LT Panels placed in each building with built-in 
protection and meter. All the data related to inverters, weather monitoring systems, and energy meters are 
monitored through a web portal gateway which in turn is displayed on the computer screen.

6.3 Water Management 
Overview 
Water is one of the most important resources in the construction industry and is required in large quantities 
for constuction and maintenance of the buildings. With the increasing pressure on the water table due to 
rapid urbanization, water scarcity has become a major issue today. Water conservation efforts are the need 
of the hour and at Brigade we take conscious efforts to reduce our water consumption and follow better 
water management practices.
We have disclosed parameters such as water withdrawal, additional water sources, water consumption, 
water recycled and water conserved for all three verticals. 
Data highlights: 
Water withdrawal: Out of a total of 845 million litres of water, 704 million litres (83%) is from freshwater 
sources and the remaining 141 million litres (17%) from additional water sources such as collected rainwater 
and treated wastewater from the in-house sewage treatment plant (STP).
Water consumption:  The total water consumption for the reporting period was 338 million litres (40%).
Water recycled:  A total of 552 million litres (~65%) of water is recycled and around  11.6  million litres (1.4%) 
is conserved.
Maximum water withdrawal for the reporting year is for the real estate vertical,  at 49.7%. This is attributed 
to  construction activities.

                                        A. Smart Water Flow meters
 
The construction industry is highly water-intensive, with water required in almost all stages of 
construction. At Brigade, we are aware of the issues related to water scarcity and are very meticulous 
in managing our water withdrawal and consumption. We take every effort in adopting responsible and 
sustainable methods by implementing innovative practices and focusing on continual improvement in 
our day-to-day operations. We approached a “Smart Water Management” service provider – “WeGOT” 
through Brigade REAP initiative.
‘WeGOT’ is a real-time water management solution that helps monitor water consumption from source 
intake to individual consumption supported by IoT based mobile application with about 50% savings. 
WeGOT enables water footprint traction by precision monitoring of supply, consumption and alerts on 
leakage in plumbing network.  Where required, immediate action can be initiated to make sure no 
wastage of water at facilities. 
WeGot Smart Flow meters are installed at Brigade Buena Vista, Parkside East, Woods, Bricklane, etc. and 
the monitoring of water management & performance is in progress.
                                              
                                          B.  PHE (Plumbing) 
•  We introduced a triple plumbing system at Brigade Cornerstone Utopia, where separate water  
piping is done for drinking & cooking, grey treated (flushing) and Ultra filtration (UF) + grey treated 
water (bathing and washing). 
•    Optimization of PHE pump scheme in Project Serene at Brigade Cornerstone Utopia PHE pumping 
scheme – reduction in the number of pump sets without compromising functional requirements and 
cost savings
•   Colour coding – UPVC Shaft pipes
           • To avoid cross-connections of domestic and flushing pipes, reclaim pipes (purple coloured) 
              are used for flushing pipes in the shaft.
           • To avoid water leakage issues- Installed a water metering system for all apartments to get 
              notifications and consumption details on the mobile app
           •  Reducing excessive noise and vibration of STP 
           •  Submersible pumps are used to transfer raw sewage, sludge, filter feed pumps etc., which     	
               also reduces the pump room footprint. 
            • Air blowers are placed on mother earth, so there will be no vibration transfer. 
•  Rooftop rainwater harvesting

  C) Rainwater Harvesting at Brigade Tech Gardens (BTG), Bengaluru.
Rainwater harvesting is a simple but effective technique used to conserve rainwater by collecting, storing 
and purifying rainwater that runs off from rooftops, parks, roads, open grounds, etc. for later use. As a 
sustainable corporate citizen, we practice rainwater harvesting as much as possible. We have recently 
completed the installation of a rainwater harvesting system at BTG, Bengaluru, which is designed based on 
the meteorological data obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department.  Runoff water from the roof 
areas is collected in underground sumps through a filter. The stored water is either used for ground recharge 
or domestic non-potable uses.
Provision of valves to drain out first rain to external drain is at the ground level. A tank is proposed in the 
basement driveway level sump for terrace rainwater (i.e., converting the elevated driveway to a collection 
sump) and this collected water is also used for domestic purposes after preliminary treatment.

Air pollution and noise pollution are critical issues in many cities in India. Deteriorating ambient air quality 
and high noise levels pose many health risks and affect the quality of life. At Brigade, we understand our 
responsibility and take every step to mitigate any air and noise pollution generated from our operations.To 
ensure that air emissions and noise levels remain within permissible limits, we deploy DG sets in locations 
that are away from regular public use and conduct regular maintenance. We use high end equipment to 
monitor noise levels. 
We regularly monitor stack emissions and noise levels from DG set at all our sites. The frequency of stack 
monitoring is quarterly, and samples are collected and tested by an ISO 9001:2015, ISO 45001:2018 certified 
and MoEF recognized laboratory. The data disclosed is representative data from one commercial unit 
BTG-Commercial, Bengaluru under the Lease Rentals vertical. The values observed are found within the 
permissible limits.
Ambient air quality values at our select properties in real estate vertical are shown in the following graphs. 
All values are found to be within permissible limits.

Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variety of life found in any given location. This can refer to the 
variety of plants, mammals, insects and birds; or habitats and ecosystems. Research shows that biodiversity 
is vital to human survival and well-being. 
Protection: Biodiverse habitats within cities can offer natural protection against extreme weather events like 
floods and heatwaves. 
Livelihoods: Preserving a diverse set of organisms is vital to protecting livelihoods like agriculture, livestock 
rearing and fisheries, and providing economic security. 
Health: Access to biodiverse public parks and green spaces improves physical health by reducing exposure 
to pollution, and mental health by reducing anxiety and depression.
Cultural: Biodiversity is an intrinsic part of human cultural and spiritual practices.
All our projects are in locations that are not in the proximity of any ecologically sensitive areas such as 
national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, biodiversity hotspots or coastal regulation zones. 
We obtain all required environmental approvals and clearances before the project commences. 
Over the years, we have planted 60,000+ trees at various project sites and transplanted more than 300+ 
trees across different project locations. We have taken many initiatives to improve our efforts to enrich flora 
and fauna in our property spaces. As part of such initiatives, we have successfully developed mini forests at 
many of our property townships.

'Nurseries at the site' Initiative: 
To make biodiversity management more effective we have recently started a new initiative of developing 
nurseries at the project site itself. This helps us in planning the biodiversity mix that will be best suitable for 
the project site and enable us to produce healthy plants.
Any project of more than 10 acres requires a large green space. Allocating and maintaining the nursery at the 
site helps in saving fuel that would have been used for the transportation of plants from other 
nurseries.  
How the nurseries are maintained: 
There are around 150 different varieties of plants and trees that are grown in our nurseries. These include 
ornamental, air purifying, and aromatic plants. Many medicinal plants and herbs such as brahmi, lemongrass, 
amruthaballi, tulasi, mint, etc. are also grown and nurtured in the nursery.  Some salient features of our 
nurseries are:  
•  Locally available manure for mixing with soil that helps in strengthening the soil quality and increasing 
soil efficiency by 20%.
•  Use of drip irrigation to minimize the wastage of water and maintain proper water distribution. 
•  Special care for preparing the right nutrient-rich soil mix according to the plants’ needs. Coco peat, red    	
    soil, M-sand etc. for the right proportions to enable healthy plant growth. 
•  Shade structure provided all around the nursery for better plant growth  even during peak summer. 
•  Avoid use of pesticide to ensure healthy soil.

Practices in the Nurseries:  Many innovative techniques are used in the nurseries to produce healthy plants 
while minimizing chemical and water usage. Some of these are discussed briefly 
PLANET
06
 Air Layering  is an easy method for 
propagating new plants from the parent 
plant without cutting them. This method is 
easy and efficienct for numerous trees and 
shrubs. 
Seed Propagation  is one of the most 
used methods and many varieties such 
as  Jackfruit trees, Areca palms, etc. are 
propagated through seeds.  
Serpentine Layering is used for 
propagating vines at the project sites. 
This produces fast and healthy plant 
growth with minimum use of water. 
Hydroponics is a soil less method of propagating 
plants using water. We use waste irrigation 
materials from our project sites such as water 
pipes for propagation of many plants. 
Going Organic is about propagating 
plants 
without 
any 
pesticide, 
herbicide, fungicide or synthetic 
fertilizers. Organic liquid nutrients 
work wonders for our indoor and 
outdoor plants such as areca palm. 
Air purifying plants clean our air while 
providing us with aesthethic ambience. 
Snake plant, spider plant, peace lilies 
grow well in our projects. The plants 
keep the indoors and outdoors oxygen 
rich and pollution free.

Oxygen park – Bamboos are known for their high capacity of carbon sequestering. They are capable of
cleaning the atmosphere from CO2 generated due to the burning of fuels, oil, etc. Beema Bamboo is a
variety of bamboo that is thornless. It contains 50% carbon in all its parts as a result of carbon
sequestration. A fully matured Beema bamboo can sequester over 450 kgs of CO2 and releases up to 320
kgs of oxygen per tree within a year. This much oxygen is sufficient for one person for a whole year. It also
prevents soil erosion and has a good water retention capacity. Apart from these qualities, Beema bamboo
doesn’t attract snakes like other bamboo making it the best choice for residential and commercial projects.
New Initiatives to enhance Biodiversity-
Enchanting Seasonals- For a long time we wanted to have seasonal flowers at our properties but local 
nurseries were not able to fulfil the requirements. After initiating our own nurseries at the site, we now 
are capable of providing seasonal flowers for the landscape for many projects. This will not only help the 
environment by attracting bees and butterflies but also add aesthetic value.

6.6 Environmental Compliance 
At Brigade, we strictly adhere to all the relevant compliance regulations. The management team ensures that 
all operations conform to the required performance compliance parameters with respect to environmental 
indicators. We are compliant with all applicable environmental laws/regulations/guidelines in the country. 
The required compliances with respect to the Air (Prevention and Pollution Control) Act, Water (Prevention 
and Control of Pollution) Act, Noise Pollution Control, Waste Management (Hazardous and Non-hazardous 
waste, Municipal solid, Bio-medical waste, etc.) Environment Protection Act and Rules and Resource 
Conservation are strictly adhered to at all our project sites.
In the reporting period, we have had no non-compliance with respect to any of the regulations. For all our 
project sites, we follow an environmental management framework within which due diligence obligations 
are met and allow us to minimise any environmental damage that can occur during construction. Project-
wise Environment Management Plan is prepared according to Environmental Impact Assessment Guidance 
Manual for Building, Construction, Townships and area development projects. 
We follow all regulations as per the  Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA Act). The RERA Act protects 
home buyers and helps boost real estate investments. The RERA Act helps both builders and buyers alike in 
reducing unwarranted project delays and property fraud. We have had no non-compliance with respect to 
RERA Act implementation in our projects. 
 Land Degradation, Contamination and Remediation 
As a real estate developer, the land is a crucial element in our operations. Due to certain operations in real 
estate the land can get adversely affected or can become unproductive due to contamination. Contamination 
may affect soil quality, water quality, human health or other environmental or ecological receptors. 
Contamination may be solid, liquid or gas, in, on, or under the land or in buildings and structures.
We are happy to inform that none of our operations has impacted or degraded or contaminated the land 
where our projects are under construction or in the near vicinity of our operations. 
In the reporting period, we had no land that was remediated, or needed remediation for the existing or 
intended land use, according to applicable legal designations.
Good asset design and redevelopment or retrofit can mitigate environmental and end-user human health 
impacts. The effective management of existing buildings is also fundamental to mitigating impacts on the 
environment and end-users.
The construction and real estate sector is considered to have a significant impact with respect to 
environmental and social aspects. The impacts of the construction industry are widely visible in all stages 
of the product life cycle. The project execution phase is highly resource-intensive, and at Brigade Group 
we try to reduce the impacts of our products and services by opting for Green Building certification. We 
try to bring in the intervention to reduce the environmental impact in the design stage by maximizing 
the daylight availability and efficient HVAC designs to reduce the energy consumption and associated 
emissions. We aim for the highest certification rating for our commercial buildings. 
As per the recommendations from IGBC, we even modify the designs to achieve the highest certification 
rating. In general, Green building certifications have helped us achieve energy savings of around 20-30% 
and water savings of 30-50%. 
Although our residential projects are not certified for Green Building, we follow all best practices 
from the design perspective to reduce our overall negative impact and enhance the positive impact. 
Integrating environmental considerations into product and service design may help identify new business 
opportunities, differentiate products and services, and stimulate innovation in technology.
Transport of construction equipment, materials and resources to and from the construction sites has a 
huge impact on the overall emissions during the construction phase.
We are aware of the impact created by the transport of materials, machinery and people. However, for 
the current reporting period, we were unable to map the required data.  
In our operations, we try to minimise any traffic disruption during construction activity by planning the 
vehicle movement at non-peak times.  All construction equipment operated in our projects is rented or 
leased. The construction materials are sourced from third-party suppliers, and we do not have direct 
control over the movement of the raw materials to our project sites. However, for any material movement 
between our sites, we try to manage the movement times during non-peak timings.
Most of our construction workers live in the worker colonies provided. The worker colonies are generally 
situated near the project site and hence there is no transportation of workers involved.

7.1 Employees
Overview
Employees and workers are our most significant stakeholders. We place the highest priority on the health, 
safety and well-being of our employees, which in turn helps us achieve all the success that we enjoy as an 
organization. 
The employee data includes all information at the group level and for all three verticals. The employee data 
discussed in detail include the new employee hires, turnover, benefits to employees and workers, parental 
leave, etc. Details on the numbers, age and gender categorization of new employee hires indicate the strat-
egy and ability of the organization to attract diverse and qualified employees. It also signifies the organiza-
tion’s efforts in implementing inclusive recruitment practices. Similarly, a high rate of employee turnover can 
indicate levels of uncertainty and dissatisfaction among employees. An uneven pattern of turnover by age or 
gender can indicate incompatibility or potential inequity in the workplace. It also has direct cost implications 
either in terms of reduced payroll or greater expenses for the recruitment of employees.

7.1 Employees (Group Level)
New Hires:
Employee recruitment is the activity of identifying and soliciting individuals. The Brigade Group hires talented 
and qualified people. Committed to gender and generational diversity, the Group is making efforts to 
bring equity in hiring and recruitment. The total number of male and female employees hired was 197 
and 65, respectively in the reporting year. The percentage of female employees hired is 25% of the total new 
hires. Among the new hires, 50% are in the 30-50 age group, while 46% are in below  30 years age group and 
the remaining in above 50 years age category.
Employee Turnover:
The pandemic has been a tumultuous period for employees across  industries.   Especially, the Indian 
construction industry has been marked by a high turnover rate. The attrition rate for BEL & related companies 
is 14.5% for FY 21-22, which is at par with the current market conditions. 
Brigade’s total employee turnover has reduced in the reporting period. There are multiple factors which 
help maintain a low attrition rate. Once the HR team is notified of the resignation, an interview with the 
employee helps the organization understand the potential reasons for exit. The team always tries to make 
amends in circumstances if there are organizational issues. The aim is to retain the employee.
Additionally, we have a strong performance management system in place which also helps modulate the 
attrition rate. A career acceleration program called BRIGHT (Brigade High Talent), helps to motivate and 
retain high performers. A strong employee engagement plan and activities throoughout the year help in 
motivating and retaining the engaged employees. 
In the reporting year, the total employee turnover of Brigade Group is 178, with 137 (77%) male employees 
and 41 (23%) female employees. The maximum turnover was in the junior management category with 73%, 
whereas the turnover rate was 21% in the middle management and 6% in the senior management category. 
Employee turnover by age category shows that 32% of the turnover was in below 30 age group, 63% in the 
30-50 age group and about 5% turnover in above 50 age group.

Digital / IT transformation
a) Qwikspec mobile app for unit handover 
Construction work undergoes a lot of quality inspections and assurances from the projects team at the 
site to complete the unit handover to the customers. The inspections and assurances are carried out by 
the site engineers and QA engineers. The inspection report and quality reports are then shared with the 
CRM and CCS team for updating the customers, on registration and handovers. This communication and 
coordination between the functions happen over e-mails, WhatsApp and phone calls; and the status of 
the units is not easily visible/traceable to the senior management. To fix this problem of coordination, we 
deployed a Brigade REAP-mentored startup called Qwikspec.
By using the Qwikspec application, engineers can easily capture data on snags and update after fixing, 
request for inspection, and generate snag reports from their mobile. Information can be made available 
to other functions when required. Dashboards are developed for senior management to track the status 
of units and manage the operations of the site. Using Qwikspec, the QA team can quantitatively analyze 
the data, identify the areas that require focus/improvement and make suitable recommendations to the 
Projects Team and to the management.  
Overall, the app unifies all the internal functions involved in the unit handover process. We have also 
integrated Brigade Plus, our one-stop solution for all interior needs to customers before handover, to those 
who have opted for the same. We have initiated the Qwikspec system on a trial basis at Brigade Cornerstone 
Utopia and are gradually implementing it for all our project handovers.  
7.2 Employee Engagement 
b) Digital transformation
The engineering department generates about 600 requests for approval every month and as the approval 
is a six layered process and when done over email it is time consuming. The documents are consolidated 
by the QS department and forwarded to Finance Department for final clearance. 
With digital transformation in our systems, the following benefits are observed:
• Improved traceability
• No e-mail follow-ups
• Digital data availability
• Rework option in workflow
• Ease of Inter department approvals
When the outcome was measured it was found that a total of 4706 documents generated  for a certain 
time period led to saving of 300+ person-hours after start of this programme.
• Booking and Sales: The booking and sales are traditionally done manually. and later the documents 
are scanned and entered into the systems manually. The data is usually not in sync when the booking is      
completed to when it starts. When the digital initiation started, reduction of data errors, empowered 
customers, scalable system & consistency, direct data transfer to C4C and digital signing got enabled. This 
helped in the distribution of workload and reduced time for booking from 150 min to 40 min. This is a 
scalable and consistent system and it eliminated the human effort.

An engaged employee brings the best to the workplace, is emotionally connected and is motivated. As an 
employer, Brigade Group values employee's loyalty and productivity and looks after the overall job
 satisfaction of the employee. Engaged employees are the backbone of a strong business. However, there are 
certain areas of working with employees which are considered basic and fundamental and then the 
organization looks at various other ways that helps in connecting with the employees. 
Nurturing a culture of  ‘mutual TRUST’ has been an important step in this journey. We believe that if 
employees trust the people they work for, take pride in what they do, and enjoy working with peers and oth-
er colleagues, this can only have positive outcomes. High performance, high trust culture is built on the fun-
damentals of credibility, respect, fairness, pride and camaraderie. The outcome of this is happy workforce 
and recognition for Brigade as the "Great Place To Work" for 12 consecutive years. We have also retained the 
feat of being among the best in the Industry – 'Construction & Real Estate. The recognition reinforces our 
firm belief that people are one of the prime movers in fueling corporate growth & success.

Communications and Nurturing Leadership 
Brigade Townhall Meet: A bi-yearly, half-day event is celebrated in a big way. The theme for the event is 
'Inform & Involve', which strongly emphasizes our value system. It was conducted virtually this year. This 
forum appraises employees on the business environment and the organization's long-term goals. This also 
provides an opportunity for the employees, to share their ideas, as well as acts as a stimulus, for others to 
aspire for growth opportunities. 
Our CMD and various SBU heads shared the real-time updates on their respective Business Units. Business 
updates are best understood when directly communicated by the team leaders. 
BRIGHT- Brigade's High Talent: BRIGHT is Brigade's talent development/Career progression initiative for 
Brigade's High Talent. Through this initiative, we provide developmental opportunities by creating a clear 
roadmap of developmental areas with tracking & monitoring the progress and providing coaching and 
mentoring benefits. Through this, we intend to develop an internal talent-building leadership pipeline 
& succession planning. Engaging and retention of key talent, accelerating talent development. Staff with 
consistent performance ratings for consecutive years are considered for this program. The identified BRIGHTs 
undergo an individual assessment of Psychometric and Leadership traits through a scientific tool. This will 
enable the development of leadership skills, identify thrust areas for enhanced Learning, and creates a 
talent pipeline for career progression.
Business Challenges Meeting: Effective speaking builds high-performance culture and trust. And open 
communication increases employee morale, productivity, and commitment to the organization, boosting 
company revenue and enhancing employee engagement. Therefore, an open culture that encourages 
transparent and two-way communication with all stakeholders is a way of life at Brigade Group. 
To facilitate this, we organized Business Challenges,  a solution-finding focused work. It was a two-stage 
workshop with an initial brainstorming session in groups of cross-functional team members, followed by the 
presentation of solutions and action plans with an indicative timeline for implementation. The consolidated 
list of operational issues/business challenges is shared with respective SBU/dept heads to review and 
prioritize for group discussion. The final ideas/suggestions are submitted to the CMD /Senior Leadership 
team for review.
Strategy Brainstorming Sessions: Strategy Brainstorming Session is an annual one-day forum where the 
Brigade Leadership team along with Tier 2 leaders connect, collaborate, and develop the current and 
future strategic objectives along with the team. In the Strategy meeting, the leadership team brainstorms 
the challenges faced by the company, using the Involve, Ideate, Innovate & Implement policy to create a 
clear vision of the future business; identify immediate, short-term, medium-term, and long-term priorities;

Fitness and Sports: 
Participation in Bengaluru Marathon: Running is a great way to increase our overall level of health. 
Research shows that running can raise good cholesterol levels while helping grow lung function and use. 
In addition, running can also boost your immune system and lower your risk of developing blood clots. We 
encourage our employees to participate in Marathon and lead healthier lives. We sponsored nearly 50 
employees of the Brigade Group. 
Corporate Sports Events: All work and no play leads to dullness and that’s what we would like to avoid for 
our employees. Among the various forms of pushing for employee wellness, we focus on sports and fitness 
alongside work to ensure good health and employee productivity. We organize many sports events and 
encourage our employees to participate in the intercorporate sports event. We have formed a corporate 
sports team representing Brigade in the Intercorporate Sports competitions. Recently a team representing 
Brigade Group took part in the Box Cricket tournament organized by SILA. The team comprised six players 
and two substitutes. The Box Cricket involves a stand-and-bowl cricket format played on a 6x6 turf. The team 
and selection of the captain were made based on past performances. A practice session was arranged for the 
players to get acclimatized to the turf and playing conditions and prepare for the match ahead.
Fitness@Brigade: Brigade has defined fitness not in reference to someone else but being better than one’s 
previous self, so everyone can become fitter than they are. We realized that everyone needs some rhythm 
and a reminder, so a 28-day Fitness@Brigade competition helps Brigadiers get into the loop of a healthier, 
happier, and a more productive lifestyle. Split over four weeks, there are several challenges that employees 
opt for: 
•   To walk at least 10,000 steps a day and individually reporting this back to Administration and the 
     HR departments weekly
•  Steppingstone
•   Yoga
•   Meditation
•   Other Fitness activities 
The Tyro and the Champ were two categories that participants could opt for. Over the months of 
September and October,  Participants could opt between the Tyro Category, which targeted beginners, where 
a participant had to cover at least 70,000 steps within a week for eligibility, and the Champ category, where 
a participant had to cover 1.5-lakh steps within a week. Participants were free to use any fitness band or 
app installed on their mobile to calibrate the steps. After completing the week's target, the employees were 
required to send the snapshots of their weekly targets to the employee engagement team. Once all the 
entries were received, the participants were judged, and the results were announced, wherein the winners 
walked away with gift vouchers from Shoppers' Stop. Through this initiative, we intended to foster the 
culture of being physically fit and active.

Health Card-Health Management system: A healthy and engaged workforce always ensures a positive and 
motivating workspace that improves productivity, drives business results and fosters employee delight. So, 
it's vital to have an Employee Health Management system to ensure a healthy workforce. This also helps us 
be aware of varying health conditions, take care of ourselves and our family, and contribute to organizational 
growth. In line with this, we collected the health details of employees through the "Employee Health Card," 
which will help us to have important information on individual health parameters of Brigadiers that may be 
needed at the time of crisis to assist/provide medical assistance as required. This enabled us to have a ready 
reckoner on the crucial health parameters of the entire workforce. New joiners to the Brigade Group are also 
required to fill in the health status forms before joining the company.
Employee Assistance Program (EAP): We fully understand that in today's work environment, the emotional 
health of employees is essential, and it is as important as their physical health. To help in this matter, 
we have entered a close partnership with YourDost, a specialized counselling organization that provides 
counselling services to all our staff and their dependents. The Group fully bears the cost of this service. 
YourDost aims to provide professional help to all employees and their families to enable them to manage 
stress and work-related anxiety. All Brigadiers are enrolled for this service. The topics on which they were 
counselled vary from marriage, self-development, relationships, parenting, mental health, and work-
related issues. The new normal induced by the COVID-19 pandemic has kept everyone apart. This has forced 
everyone to stay away from loved ones, friends, and colleagues, increasing stress and anxiety levels. With 
24/7 services available in over 20 languages, the platform provided employees access to experts during the 
difficult times of the COVID pandemic. To provide a platform for the staff to address these concerns and have 
emotional stability, the Brigade Group has partnered with "YourDost" to bring Emotional Wellness to the 
employees and families. This is a tech-enabled platform for emotional health with complete confidentiality 
of individual identity for those who would approach YourDost to seek help on their concerns. In addition, 
YourDost will conduct periodic virtual knowledge-sharing sessions on common subjects.
Vaccination drives:  Reinforcing our commitment to the health and safety of our workforce, we tied up with 
reputed hospitals and arranged vaccination drives for not only Brigadiers but their families as well.
Employee Emergency Fund: To extend a helping hand to those in need, we have set up an 'Employee 
Emergency Fund'. Through this fund, we will be able to extend financial assistance to employees who are in 
need, in addition to the corporate service being provided. 
Goodbye, Stress. Hello wellness: As a Group, we facilitated initiatives to help our employees handle stress 
at work or at home. We believe that stress has a direct impact on output and the efficiency of the 
employees. Regular stress management and wellness sessions were conducted, and several other forums 
were organized. Leading training institutions such as APEX, Lee Hatch Harrison, ZR Consultants, and doctors 
from the Columbia Asia Hospital were involved in the programs, which received overwhelming participation 
from the employees of the Group. 
Big-6 Employee Engagement Club: When people are emotionally invested, they want to contribute. The 
main objective of the Big 6 Employee Engagement Club is to make all the Group employees emotionally 
motivated at work, be healthy and fit, which would bring work-life balance to them. The Big 6 Employee 
Engagement Club is a cross-functional team with an underlying theme of the 3 C's - Connect employees 
emotionally, Communicate core values, and Collaborate - create cross-functional teams and enhance trust. 
Cross-functional teams drive employee engagement initiatives, break down silos, and act as a gateway for 
business alignment, greater involvement, and a customer-centric mindset. To enable this, all employees at 
Brigade are divided into six teams, each representing our Core Value - QC First, viz. Quality Team, Customer 
Centricity Team, Fairness Team, Innovation Team, Responsible Socially Team, and Trust Teams. Through this, 
the Group aims to connect employees with Brigade Core Values, resonate with their values and have a sense 
of belongingness. The Senior Leadership's role in employee engagement cannot be ignored, and they play 
a vital role in the success. The Group's BU heads are assigned the role of 'Mentors' for each of these teams, 
and they help reinforce positive experiences. The Big 6 team drives the Employee Engagement Initiatives at 
Brigade.

digital capabilities across different domains. Some of the learning programs conducted for employees 
include buoyance personality development – a hybrid model of classroom and online, and STEP - for 
online, personalized English courses. We are associated with virtual training partners - Udemy & 
Coursera online courses, LinkedIn learning, etc. We measure the effectiveness of the Training 
conducted through four levels from the Kirkpatrick evaluation model.
Employee development is critical to an organization's success and therefore investing in the learning and 
development of the employee is important for the growth of the employee as well as the organization. 
Growth in this context refers to technical competency, skill development and knowledge transfer, as well as 
employee well-being, behavioural, and other critical growth factors. 
Our comprehensive training program is based on employee performance appraisals and future industry 
requirements. The impact of the pandemic had enforced a digital work format and we were fully equipped 
to handle the virtual workplace, as well as manage and manoeuvre the shift, and have a work-life balance. 
This was possible due to the training provided to the employees. 
Brigade Group has conducted various training programs for employees. Trainings are categorized as techni-
cal training, leadership programs,  behavioural training, soft skills, digital and cyber security, etc.

Health and Safety Management Systems
Occupational health and safety management systems serve as an effective approach to managing and 
continually eliminating hazards and minimizing risks. It is a systems-based approach that seeks to integrate 
occupational health and safety management into overall business processes. The health & Safety Manage-
ment system ensures a well-defined process for all the health and safety practices across our offices and 
worksites. We are certified for Integrated Management System, including ISO 45001:2018. The standard 
ensures that we are proactive and systematic in identifying, assessing and monitoring health and safety 
risks and opportunities. During every stage of work, we determine and assess the risks and opportuni-
ties, relevant to our operations. All information about the risks and opportunities; processes and actions 
are well documented. Risks are assessed using a standard severity versus likelihood health and safety risk      
assessment. Risks if not managed effectively may well cause more than just accreditation issues. Oppor-
tunities for improvement of health and safety can arise from the performance and management of the 
health and safety systems.  
 All our employees and contractual workforce are covered under the Health & Safety Management System. 
During the reporting period, we had a total of 1018 male employees 251 female employees and 6996 
contractual workers.

Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment & Incident Investigation
At our work sites, we conduct regular hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) of all 
construction-related routine and non-routine activities before commencing the work. The HIRA is reviewed 
every six months and revised for any changes and any new activity that is included. Some of the routine 
activities in the construction site are site clearing, excavation, shuttering, concreting, block work and plas-
tering, whereas the non-routine activities are the erection and dismantling of tower crane, temporary pas-
senger lift, material hoists, batching plant etc.,
A hierarchy of controls is applied to eliminate the identified hazards and minimize risks. The control 
mechanisms followed at our sites are elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative 
controls and PPEs. A few of the control measures practiced at project sites are safety nets, lifelines, fall ar-
restor systems, closing all the cutouts, lift shafts and plumbing shafts that are used at worksites for safety 
purposes. These control measures are monitored daily during site visits and ‘Monthly Helmet of Honour’ is 
provided as a motivational incentive for adhering to the best practices followed by workers. 
PEOPLE
07
We ensure the quality of the process by conducting regular training, toolbox talks, following daily 
applicable checklists, permits and formats, and maintenance of plant and machinery. Job-specific 
training is conducted before commencing the work. Leading and lagging indicators are captured 
and analyzed, and monitored on basis of reduced incidents, near misses, first aid, unsafe acts and 
unsafe conditions. Any obstacles to the implementation of these processes are removed for 
workers who might be more vulnerable to the risk of a work-related injury or ill health by 
providing occupational health and safety training and information in a language easily 
understood by workers.
We make sure that the personnel in charge, who is responsible for the quality of implementation 
should possess good working experience in all construction activities and should have previously 
worked or assisted in preparing the HIRA register. The progress and efficiency of the system are 
evaluated by checking the first aid cases, near misses and accidents, this helps us to improve the 
weak areas.  The process to identify hazards and risks related to incidents are reviewing the iden-
tified hazard and risks for the effectiveness of the implemented controls. Manufacturers’ 
information and previous incident/accident records were also analyzed to identify the risks. Hier-
archy of control normally leads to the implementation of inherently safer systems, where the risk 
of illness or injury has been substantially reduced. Hazards which led to incidents/accidents/first 
aid will again be rechecked from the first step of the HIRA process. 
We have processes in place to investigate any work-related injuries, through the involvement of 
workers and operators in the vicinity to understand the cause. Gathering information by witness 
interviewing or examining incident place or documents, analyzing information to find out the 
immediate and underlying root cause, identifying suitable control measures to both immediate 
and underlying causes, planning remedial action by proving additional control measures.During 
the reporting period, we have had no workers identified with any risk of diseases related to their 
occupation. 
Our partners are mandated to adhere to applicable laws pertaining to worker wages, health and 
safety, and other workplace laws pertaining to human rights. Proactive engagement with them 
aids us in imparting industry best practices and aligning with our ESG goals for achieving 
sustainable development.

7.4 Occupational Health and Safety
Occupational Health Services
Occupational health services aim to protect the health of workers in relation to their work environment. 
The health services at the work site are provided by competent individuals with recognized qualifications 
and accreditations and comply with all legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines. They 
undergo premedical checkups and are provided with a BOCW registration card which helps in claiming 
medical expenses. 
As an organization, we give workers access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services through 
weekly doctor visits to the project sites and monthly medical camps. All our project sites are always 
equipped with a medical room and a male nurse. All workers have access to the medical room facility in 
case of any health emergencies that occur at the site. All communication to the workers is made in a lan-
guage that is easily understood by the workers and the workers are allowed to adjust workloads to allow 
workers in need to make use of these services.
We have a tie-up with the nearest hospital for any medical emergencies. Health promotion services and 
programs are conducted for the benefit of the workers to address major non-work-related health risks. 
The health promotion services include health camps to create awareness among workers on health risks, 
healthy diet awareness, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, Covid precautions, etc. Im-
parting knowledge regarding HIV, tobacco, mental health, injury and violence all are a part of the worker’s 
health promotions. 
To facilitate the worker’s access to safety, toolbox talks are conducted and workers are encouraged to 
speak about their concerns, and all these are recorded and addressed immediately to resolve the issues. 
We maintain the worker’s health-related information confidential and will communicate to them if in case 
any further treatment is suggested.

Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety
A health and safety committee with joint management representation can facilitate a positive
health and safety culture. Worker participation in occupational health and safety happens through
joint management-worker health and safety committees. The committees have representation
from all job levels. Consultation is a two-way process between employers and workers where we
can talk to each other about health and safety matters - listen to their concerns and raise concerns
- seek and share views and information, and let workers provide feedback before decisions are
made Workers are provided access to communication systems for sharing their concerns either
directly or through indirect communication. Everyday toolbox talks are a direct communication
mode available to the workers. Workers are encouraged to communicate to their supervisors
during site walks and safety committee meetings.
The joint-management worker committee is formed with 50% participation of worker
representatives. The joint-management worker committee is chaired by Mr. Jaishankar, Chairman
and MD. The safety committee meetings are conducted monthly, with proper agenda laid down.
The management team and the safety committee together conduct site tours to interact with
workers and understand any concerns and feedback.
We provide advice on the risk assessment process for minimizing the risks. We make sure the
distribution of any information on innovative controls, issue alerts and improve procedures where
necessary. For Brigade Group, all the OHS requirements are a part of the tender document. On
placing the work order to the contractor, a kickoff meeting will be conducted to brief on the OHS
requirements and statutory compliances, we review and approve the OHS plans submitted by the
contractor. To mitigate any negative OHS impact on the operations, we follow all safety
precautions as laid out by the regulations. Among our employees and workers, we avoid any
blame culture but take full responsibility for the safety and well-being of all. All required resources
in terms of people, equipment, and PPEs are provided as and when required. Above all, we have
continuous support from the top leadership in setting up good procedures and methodologies
across the organization. Any incident at the workplace is taken as a point for improvement and we
share good and not-so-good EHS practices during the monthly Engineers’ meet, so all have an
opportunity to learn from the incident, to not repeat the same. At Brigade, all engineers are safety
and quality inspectors and each one is responsible for the safety implementation.

Medical Emergency Team: MET
Challenges are part of life and they always give us opportunities to make us stronger.  Keeping our employ-
ee’s well-being as our utmost priority, we introduced a “Medical Emergency Team” (MET) who would be 
available to assist all Brigadiers in times of any medical emergency. The objective of setting up MET is to 
ensure that employees get the required support during any medical emergency, especially in a pandemic 
situation. Employees can contact the MET in case of any support required during a medical emergency for 
themselves or their families. 
The MET supports employees with:
• Coordinating with hospital and Government authorities for arrangements and efficient treatment
• Coordinating ambulance and funeral services for deceased staff/family members
• Supporting staff families and coordinating medical facilities in case of family members by COVID or any 
other major illness
• Supporting staff/family for quarantine accommodation as part of COVID
• Safe accommodation and transport facility for staff who were required to work during lockdown
Financial and ration support for the workers at construction sites
Health check-ups
For a business to succeed in its endeavours, it is mandatory for its employees to be fit and healthy. In great 
workplaces, productivity is equivalent to the health of the employees. At Brigade Group, the health of 
every one of our employees is as important as our bottom line. From periodic health check-ups to compre-
hensive health insurance to everything necessary for a healthy and happy life, we ensure that every em-
ployee always has help at hand in times of a medical situation – be it at home or at work. 
Brigade Group collaborates with reputed hospitals for annual health check-ups/ awareness/camps (includ-
ing dental & eye) for all Brigadiers. Additional check-ups are offered to all women employees. Check-ups 
are also offered at special rates to the dependents of staff. A regular health check-up helps in minimizing 
the threat of any ailments. Hence, we provide a complete health check-up once in two years. This is man-
datory for all the employees. Comprehensive Health Insurance policies for self and family including depen-
dents are provided and the same is well received by all members.
Contactless Attendance System
As part of its commitment to introducing the latest technology and ensuring the health and safety of its 
employees – particularly amidst the COVID pandemic. We introduced the contactless attendance system, 
as well as other innovative tools to ensure minimal touch and spread of the virus among the users.
Suppliers are a crucial link to any organization and building a resilient supply chain across our projects 
is essential in establishing a successful enterprise. At Brigade Group, we value our partnerships with the 
supply chain partners and together focus on delivering sustainable real estate projects.As compared to the 
previous year (2020-21), we have had no significant changes to the supply chain in the reporting period, 
which implies that there were no changes in the location of suppliers, the structure of the supply chain or 
relationships with suppliers, including selection and termination. All our supply and procurement contracts 
emphasize the specific aspects of quality and EHS (Environment Health & Safety) practices at the supplier 
organization. Owing to the pandemic situation we have not been able to conduct any physical audits of our 
suppliers with respect to environmental or social parameters. We are happy to let our stakeholders know 
that in the reporting period, we have had no negative environmental or social impacts across our supply 
chain.
As we make steady progress in our sustainability journey, we would like to make sure that the supply chain 
partners also move forward in the ESG aspects. A few of our supply chain partners have exemplary ESG 
practices that include publishing sustainability reports, and complying with international standards for 
quality, environmental management systems and health and safety practices. A select few suppliers have 
EcoVadis certification, and many have accounted for green practices such as RoHS Compliance, DW Ener-
gy Rating, conducting LCAs, certified green buildings and standardized waste disposal practices. However, 
there are certain supplier groups that will need complete handholding in the ESG journey to take them to 
the next level. We will introduce an elaborate supply chain management framework. 
We have a diverse value chain and are categorized as Material Suppliers, Contractors, Consultants and 
Channel Partners. We have a long relationship with each of the supplier groups, with some spanning more 
than a decade. 
The construction and real estate business is a highly resource-intensive industry. In the reporting year, 
we have sourced about 40% of the input materials directly from small suppliers and (MSME) companies. 
Across our project locations, about 60%  of the input materials are sourced locally, within the district or 
neighbouring districts.

At Brigade Group, Customers are our most important stakeholders and we value the strong association 
that we have with all our customers. Customers are the end-users of our products and services. We have a 
varied customer base depending on the different verticals that we operate in. For example, under real es-
tate, customers are the individual home buyers/owners, who buy our properties; under Lease Rentals and 
hospitality the customer base changes to organizational customers, i.e., large MNCs, retail store owners, 
etc. The details under this section refer to the customers of the real estate vertical. Customer engagement 
activities are from different Brigade residences across Bengaluru.
Our core values QC- FIRST stands for Quality, Customer Centricity, Fairness, Innovation, Responsible Social-
ly and Trust, which are at the centre of our interactions with all our stakeholders, especially the customers.
We bring trust and transparency in all our interactions with the stakeholders. 
Marketing & labelling
Customers need accessible and reliable information about the products and services that they intend to 
buy. In the case of our products, customers rely on the project information that is available through mar-
keting brochures. Our website and the project brochures give reliable information about the property 
and the amenities to prospective buyers. Information related to the type of materials and fittings are also 
detailed along with the approved plan and layout of the property.  Access to such information helps our 
customers to make an informed purchasing decision. 
During the reporting period, we have had no incidents of non-compliance concerning product and service 
information labelling and marketing communication with reference to regulations and/or voluntary codes.

ously explained the project and options available.  He further took us personally to your fully 
furnished full-scale  2 & 3 BHK model flats and explained in detail the various aspects that 
encouraged us to move positively in the matter. We were particularly impressed by the pre-
sentation, attention to detail, and enormous patience at his young age to ably provide infor-
mation on multi-dimensions of the project to satisfy our concerns as a prospective buyers. Mr 
Dilip has actively followed up to assist in the actual visit to the flat proposed to be taken by 
us, as well as assist in filing the application for allotment through your new app  ‘sign easy ’  
online.  He also took further interest to explain the nuances of your agreement and assisted 
in finalizing the same. Thanking you and your team at the ‘ Brigade 7 Gardens ‘ project for all 
the courtesies extended.

Customer health and safety
 
Protection of customer health and safety is a recognized goal of many national and international regulations. 
And rightly so it is of prime importance to us. At Brigade, we believe our customers have a right to safe and 
secure products, where their health and safety are not negatively affected. 
We keep in mind the health & safety of our customers, during all stages of the project construction and 
handover. Construction sites are prone to common hazards and risks such as tripping, slipping and falling, 
contact with electric equipment, electrocution, fall of material on individuals, exposure to dust and noise, 
getting trapped under vehicles, nails piercing into a foot, and uneven walkways in the project site during 
construction.
We have well-defined policies and practices to ensure the health and safety of the customers during all 
stages of the life cycle of the product. We conduct regular health and safety training for customers including 
fire and elevator safety; provide disabled access; end-user training on health, safety and security practices, 
including asset and site security arrangements; disaster management and emergency procedures. 
We have no non-compliance with the regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety 
of products and services. We take adequate care to ensure customers have a safe visit to our projects during 
all stages of the construction. All our projects are constructed, and facilities are maintained following all 
regulatory compliances as per the National Building Code and Fire Safety protocols. All precautions are 
followed at the site, to ensure the safety of the customers during site visits. The facility management teams 
ensure the safety and well-being of the customers during such visits. We make sure that the visitors are 
accompanied by a representative from the team during the site visit. They also have access to emergency 
contact numbers. Visitors are encouraged to follow the right path and the sites are marked clearly with 
signages. 
As the pandemic situation was still prevalent in the country, a lot of our customers could not make it to our 
sites to see the progress of the projects. We were able to broadcast the updates to our customers through 
online mediums. 
The health and safety impacts of our products are looked into at the design stage and necessary improve-
ments are carried out at the design stage. However, we have not mapped the percentage of products and 
service categories for which health and safety impacts are assessed.

The Brigade Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation established in 2003 to carry out the Brigade 
Group's CSR projects. It is registered under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. Currently, the 
foundation works in the fields of education, health, and community development. Mr. M. R. Jaishankar, the 
founder and CMD of Brigade Group, serves on the foundation's Board of Trustees as a managing trustee 
and lifetime trustee. It also features a well-structured hierarchy that includes trustees, a review committee, 
an executive committee, an administrator, and managers, as well as other personnel. This allows for 
efficient program execution. 
Brigade Foundation focuses on projects in areas such as education, health services and skill development:
Health
Brigade Foundation and Brigade Enterprises have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the 
St. Johns Hospital Trust to establish a hospital at Brigade Meadows on Kanakapura Road.
Brigade Enterprises Limited has donated the required land to Brigade Foundation for developing the 
hospital, which will be developed in the next two to three years. During the reporting period, a sum of 
INR 5.91 crore was donated towards hospital development. The project is in the initial stage of seeking 
approvals from relevant authorities.

providing lights, etc. The concept of the flyover area improvement was approved by Brigade and the desired 
results were obtained once the project was completed. The work was started in November 2020 and completed 
by February 2022.  The total expenditure for this project was Rs 15 lakhs, with a breakup of Rs. 5 lakhs for 
materials and Rs. 10 lakhs paid to the volunteer group Ugly Indians for executing the project

 D. Landscape Works
Landscaping and environmental sustainability have always been one of the most important components 
of our CSR activities. We did landscape work as CSR for the fire department in Chennai.  
The landscaping project allowed different species of plants to grow and nurture themselves, provided with 
an adequate amount of water, good quality soil, and sunlight. Plants improve the air quality around us by 
capturing dust, smoke particles, and other pollutants, and by producing oxygen, thus reducing air
 pollution.

5. Covid Support 
Brigade Foundation battles with the pandemic..
Brigade Foundation with its commitment to supporting the community in fighting the pandemic had taken 
up several initiatives, during the reporting period. Some of the initiatives for Covid support were:
• Contribution to the Karnataka Disaster Management Authority, Government of Karnataka
• Contribution to the SOS Children’s Villages of India
• Donations to six (6) charitable hospitals including the renovation and remodelling of an existing hospital:
• Patient Multi-Parameter Monitors,
• Ultrasound Systems, Ventilators,
• Bipap Machines and
• PFT Machines.
• Supply of medicines/oxygen concentrators/ PPE kits/ hand sanitisers/masks/etc. to Government and    
non- Government organizations
Livelihood for 6000 families of migrant workers/needy people through the supply of ration kits and rice
Support Government institutions by donating desktop and laptop computers to the DDPI, BEO and Govt 
schools
6) The Indian Music Experience As part of our CSR work under “Art, Heritage 
and Culture, we have set up the Indian Music Experience Trust, which has set up 
a Museum of Music, the first of its kind in India, and is India’s only interactive 
music museum. The vision of the museum is to increase the understanding and 
appreciation of the diversity of Indian music, from traditional to contemporary 
styles through exhibits, performances and learning activities. A few select
 initiatives of IME during the reporting period are discussed here.
PEOPLE

PROJECT SVARITHA 
To promote inclusiveness in museums, the Indian Music Experience 
Museum embarked on its flagship community project, Project Svaritha, 
targeting children with neurodiverse needs and children from socially 
disadvantaged backgrounds. Supported by Kotak Mahindra Investments 
Limited CSR Education and Livelihood Grant, over 550 children from 
socially disadvantaged backgrounds and over 50 with neurodiverse needs 
were brought to the museum for experiential learning and workshops.
#YUVAINCULTURE 
IME partnered with the British Council to launch a series of 
programmes to involve the youth in culture in different ways. IME 
became the first cultural institution in the country to have a Youth 
Advisory Board, where a group of 18 young people, from the ages of 
14-18 years worked together to conduct audience research and provide 
implementable recommendations to the museum to make IME a more 
youth-friendly space. They also conducted an online ‘open mic’ called 
Swar Stage where young people showcased their musical talents to 
their peers. 
LEARNING CENTRE
The IME Learning Centre offers offline and online classes in various art 
forms, be it Indian or Western genres. The Centre has its own diploma 
curriculum of five years duration in all the art forms, comprising 10 
semesters, each of six months duration. The students are encouraged 
to hone their skills and are guided by experts, with assessments held at 
the end of each semester.. 
WORK FROM MUSEUM
With work from home being the norm during the pandemic, the team 
at IME introduced ‘Work from Museum’, as a unique and refreshing 
alternative that gives people the opportunity to work from the museum 
premises. The initiative has helped IME attract a new audience base of 
working professionals who may not be traditional museum-goers but 
seek alternative arrangements to work from home.
