−Solid waste generated at Units and colonies are separated as per characteristic of waste viz. dry waste 
containing burnable fraction of paper; clothes; plastic; wet waste containing canteen / kitchen waste, horticulture 
waste etc. The dry waste is co-processed at the kilns and wet waste is stabilized by composting or is used in 
biogas plants.
	
−There is no process waste generated from cement manufacturing operation and the dust collected from pollution 
control equipment is being re-used in the process.
	
−Hazardous waste generated viz. lube oil, grease and oily cotton, is managed through authorized recyclers in 
terms of the provisions of Hazardous Waste Rules, 2016.
	
−Cement manufacturing process do not use any kind of hazardous or toxic chemicals, whereas it co-processes 
various hazardous as well as toxic material of other industries in the cement kilns which is a best proven and 
scientific method to dispose of such materials without harming the environment.
	
−The Company re-uses the fly ash and bottom ash generated from its captive power plants.

tar topped roads inside the Units to avoid dispersion of dust and good housekeeping practices have been 
adopted to control fugitive emissions.
