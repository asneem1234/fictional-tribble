advertising, and promotion. 
	
The long-standing relations with the tobacco farming

a sustainable livelihood by implementing good 
agricultural practices that improve crop yields and 
result in an environmental benefit.

2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
We have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing 
of tobacco leaves and stems. We maintain long term 
contracts with farmers (other than purchases on 
auction platforms maintained by Tobacco Board), 
requiring them to comply with the applicable labour 
laws as per the ALP (Agriculture Labour Practices) 
code and to practice good agricultural practices 
prescribed in the farmer handbook. 
	
Field technicians are deployed to sensitise farmers on 
the requirements and provide necessary guidance on 
implementation of the good agricultural practices. We 
provide our field technicians with the GMS application 
to collect data and monitor progress of the farmer 
against the compliance checklist. The compliance 
checklist encompasses measures associated with:
•	 Seedbed management
•	 Agriculture Labour Practices (ALP)
•	 Transplanting
•	 Crop Protection Agents (CPA)
•	 Topping
•	 Curing
•	 Bulking
•	 Bailing and marketing
	
Some of the practices that testify the sustainability in 
our tobacco supply chain include: 
•	 Toxicity and Pollution Control: Low tobacco 
specific nitrosamine (TSNA) is ensured through 
early purchase from farm and deraking tobacco 
leaves under natural conditions.
•	 Pesticide usage: VST ensures supply of Crop 
Protection Agents (CPAs), approved by the Central 
Insecticides Board and the Registration Committee, 
to the farmers. Farmers follow the guidelines on the 
recommended doses of individual CPAs prescribed 
in the Farmer Handbook. During procurement of 
tobacco leaves we undertake CPA residue analysis 
to ensure threshold limits are maintained.
•	 Soil nutrient management: Farmers practice crop 
rotation, multiple cropping, ploughing of the fields 
across the slope and addition of farmyard manure 
to enrich soil health.
•	 Curing: Majority of the farmers indulge in sun curing 
and the balance farmers undertake fire curing using 
crop residues such as tobacco stalks, maise husk, 
saw dust, sunflower head, ground nutshell and 
cotton stalks. Further we have increased the size 
of the barns which has improved fuel efficiency and 
reduced the period of curing.
•	 Non-tobacco related material (NTRM) removal: 
Bailing of tobacco is monitored by field staff. 
Bales identified to contain NTRM are rejected. 
Subsequently the bale is cleaned and purchased. 
Post purchases threshing is done in factories 
having NTRM Sorters.
•	 Health and safety: Prevention of Green tobacco 
sickness (GTS) is ensured through provision of 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and 
access to water for sanitation and hygiene.
•	 Human Rights: Through implementation of the ALP 
code VST monitors and reviews the tobacco supply 
chain to prevent any form of discrimination, child 
labour, forced labour and ensures adherence to safe 
working conditions.

The Company is committed to implement and maintain robust Business Continuity Management Systems (BCMS) 
for ensuring resilient business operations.
	
To fulfill this commitment, we have established a holistic business continuity management system that identifies 
potential threats which may disrupt our operations and develop effective responses to minimize their impacts. 
This BCMS is fully aligned and integrated into our operations and processes across the organisation including 
technological capabilities.
	
This ensures quick recovery of business operations after a disruption to minimize the impact on business, our 
customers, protect the interests of all our stakeholders, safeguard our brand image and reputation.
VST INDUSTRIES LIMITED  STATUTORY REPORTS

Our endeavor is to develop, implement, exercise and maintain Business Continuity Plans for critical business 
operations to ensure they can continue to operate with acceptable levels of disruption. We are also working on 
providing business continuity awareness to all employees and interested parties through trainings and consultations.
	
The effectiveness of the BCMS will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure continual improvement and to embed 
business continuity culture in the Company.
8.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
	
Our tobacco supply chain is required to comply with stringent audit procedures specified under the Sustainable 
Tobacco Programme. Our contracts with the farmers are in alignment with the standards. We closely monitor 
compliance of our contract, through a team of field technicians. The field technicians are equipped with the GMS 
application that records the farmers’ progress against the contractual requirements and audit standard. Key 
environmental risks in our tobacco value chain along with their risk mitigation strategy are elaborated below.
	
I.	
Waste management- Tobacco cultivation requires high volumes of agrochemical usage. The containers of 
agrochemicals are hazardous in nature; hence it is essential to responsibly dispose the waste. Our contracts 
specify guidelines on safe disposal of the containers. Upon emptying a container, the farmer is required to 
rinse the container three times and pour the liquid into the spray tank, following which the container is to be 
punctured to prevent re-use. Finally, the empty container is required to be disposed/recycled in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s label recommendations and/or national regulations.
	
II.	
Water management- A portion of farmers supporting the Company are dependent on irrigation facilities for 
cultivation of the tobacco crop. We have developed plans to mitigate this risk by creating access to micro 
sprinklers and drip irrigation facilities to optimise water consumption and increasing water holding capacity 
of the soil through green manuring.
	
III.	 Climate change- Globally most farmers prefer curing of tobacco leaves through flue curing process which 
requires large scale deforestation for firewood. Majority of the farmers in our supply chain undertake sun 
curing, hence the risk of biodiversity loss is less. However, for the portion of farmers undertaking flue curing, 
we are mitigating the risk by ensuring farmers utilise agricultural waste such as tobacco stalks, maise husk, 
saw dust, sunflower head, groundnut shell and cotton stalks as a substitute to firewood.
9.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for 
environmental impacts.
	
10.32% of our value chain members which comprises the contract farmers are assessed on the basis of environmental 
criteria at an ongoing basis.
