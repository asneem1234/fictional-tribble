In case of risk,

Financial 
implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1.
Tie-up with 
Fintech 
companies 
for delivering 
financial 
services.
Opportunity
Fintech is enabling and 
empowering the next 
generation of consumers 
who are highly tech-savvy 
and have greater financial 
literacy but had a paucity of 
time. These customers can 
avail the services on the go. 
With the enablers like the 
use of Artificial intelligence 
for credit decisions based 
on algorithms, APIs for 
e-documentation, and 
system integrations any 
bank can excel and deliver 
the desired services and can 
enhance its asset/liabilities 
portfolios.
Though the 
activity has 
inherent risks, 
however with 
appropriate 
risk mitigates in 
place, the risk 
can be reduced 
substantially.
The adoption 
of newer 
technology will 
help any bank to 
provide financial 
services across 
the ecosystem 
even without 
having a brick 
and mortar 
structure more 
swiftly and 
enhance its 
asset/liability 
portfolio.
2.
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals 
-“Green Fixed 
Deposits”
Opportunity
Green Deposits will help 
enhance Central Bank of 
India’s participation in 
projects directly supporting 
United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) 
and empower our depositors 
to opt for financial products 
that have a positive impact 
on the environment, and the 
society at large.
Green deposit is 
offered at special 
rates which are 
above other fixed 
deposit rates.
Positive: 
Safeguarding 
our environment 
from climate 
change is the 
need of the hour. 
Hence there is 
immense scope 
to increase 
green deposits 
in the country.
3.
Green 
Financing
Opportunity
The government often 
employs SDGs as a 
framework to achieve a more 
sustainable future for all and 
companies are increasingly 
setting the corporate target 
to align with those SDGs.
Encourage dealers to sell 
more electric vehicles by 
providing incentives to 
dealers and sales executives.
Charging lower interest rates 
on electrical vehicle loans 
than fossil fuel vehicle loans 
to attract more customers.
Access to a 
diversified pool 
of green finance 
like water 
management, 
waste 
management, 
affordable green 
housing, green 
vehicle financing, 
etc.
Positive:
Immense scope 
to build a larger 
green Portfolio.
