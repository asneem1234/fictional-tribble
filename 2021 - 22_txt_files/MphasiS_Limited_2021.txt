Digitization of Company 
operations contributes to 
increased efficiency and

Risk and 
Opportunity 
• 
The transparency, accuracy, 
and 
comprehensibility 
of 
marketing 
statements, 
/service descriptions, service 
terms and processes play an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
relationship 
between 
customers and companies. 
• 
Customers should have 
access to accurate and 
adequate information to 
make 
an 
informed 
purchasing decision. In 
the case of Mphasis, this 
is linked to the disclosure 
of 
reliable 
information 
regarding the services. 
 
Risk mitigation 
approach: 
The company has put in 
place 
proactive 
measuring mechanisms 
to gauge the levels of 
customer 
satisfaction 
and obtain feedback from 
various 
perspectives, 
including, the satisfaction 
of the customer with the 
present work, growth of 
the 
account, 
and 
innovative 
and 
cost-
effective 
solutions 
offered by the Company. 
The CSAT surveys are 
conducted and closely 
monitored 
by 
the 
Company Board. 
Positive: 
Customer 
satisfaction 
and 
loyalty 
have 
a 
significant 
positive 
influence 
on 
the 
Company’s 
profitability. Improved 
customer satisfaction 
can 
also 
lead 
to 
better 
business 
opportunities 
and 
growth. 
 
Negative: 
Consumers can lose 
trust 
in 
Mphasis’s 
reliability to provide 
proposed 
quality 
services, which can 
lead 
to 
loss 
of 
business 
opportunities.

Talent attraction 
and retention 
Risk and 
opportunity 
• 
The attrition rate of the 
IT/tech 
sector 
is 
14.6%, 
which is higher than the 
country's average of 13.1% 
(Salman P, 2021). A higher 
attrition rate can lead to a 
higher cost incurred from the 
onboarding and recruitment 
of 
replacement 
talent. 
Training 
the 
replacement 
hires to the same level of 
productivity 
as 
the 
employees who left requires 
additional 
resource 
investment. 
The 
retention 
report by the Work Institute 
(2017) finds that the cost of 
turnover can be as high as 
33% of an employee's annual 
salary. 
• 
On the contrary, investing 
in people development 
can enable organizations 
to realize the skills and 
abilities 
of 
their 
Risk mitigation 
approach: 
1. Mphasis categorizes 
employees into Critical 
Risk, High Risk, and 
Low-Risk profiles. The 
Company has well-
established mitigation 
plans like role/project 
change, and onsite 
assignments, in case 
of a change of 
assigned staff. 
2. Promotions encourage 
the retention of a 
capable workforce. 
3. Mphasis has 
developed a 
remuneration policy 
with the main objective 
to attract and retain 
excellent talent. 
Positive: 
A lower attrition rate 
will lead to reduced 
costs incurred from 
hiring and training 
new recruits. 
Negative: 
Mphasis 
relies 
heavily 
on 
human 
capital 
for 
the 
development of its 
products 
and 
services that require 
software developers 
and 
continuous 
research 
and 
development. 
Therefore, Mphasis’s 
ability to attract and 
retain talent and train 
them has a direct 
impact on the quality 
of 
Mphasis's 
services.

to 
further 
expand the business and 
create value. 
• 
Mphasis has a platform 
that has grown to become 
the bedrock of our talent 
development 
initiatives. 
Over the years, Talent 
Next has matured into a

Energy and

management 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
• 
Digital infrastructure such as 
data 
centres 
consume 
significant 
resources 
- 
including water and energy - 
and are large emitters of 
carbon 
emissions. 
It 
is 
estimated that by 2040, data 
centres would emit ~ 6.3% of 
global 
GHG 
emissions 
compared to the 2016 level 
(Belkhir and Elmegli, 2017). 
• 
This 
could 
make 
ICT 
companies face operational 
and reputational issues in the 
coming years. 
• 
Other 
risks 
(such 
as 
exposure to physical risks 
of climate change), could 
also 
have 
significant 
operational impacts on 
data centres. 
We 
ensure 
managing 
our 
customer’s 
IT 
Infrastructure 
seamlessly 
with 
unmatched 
efficiency. Our offerings help our 
customers in optimizing production, 
create decarbonized ecosystems, 
and increase the throughput of 
existing assets. 
Risk mitigation 
approach: 
1. Mphasis is investing 
increasing its 
renewable energy 
portfolio by investing 
in green technologies, 
such as its solar 
plants(10KW) at its 
Mangaluru facility. 
2. Rallying stakeholders 
towards a low-
emission, climate-
resilient future 
3. Mphasis has 
accelerated its efforts 
to phase out ozone-
depleting pollutants 
[NO6]. 
4. The 
company 
has 
also 
invested 
in 
energy-saving 
interventions such as 
replacing its current 
equipment such as 
UPS 
and 
air 
conditioning units with 
those 
with 
higher 
energy efficiency. 
Positive: 
Identifying, 
designing, 
building
and 
implementing
newer 
business 
models to achieve 
decarbonized energy 
systems 
for 
our 
customers which also 
improve 
efficiency 
and 
productivity, 
leading 
to 
better 
customer satisfaction 
and 
business 
outcomes. 
Negative: 
Mphasis’s impact is 
mainly in the form of 
data storage centres, 
E-waste, 
and 
electricity used in its 
offices, 
and 
direct 
and 
indirect 
GHG 
emissions (scope 1, 
2, and 3) from its 
activities.

Waste type 
Waste management procedure in place 
Plastic (including packaging) 
Plastic waste is sent to ITC for recycling. 
Mphasis has a “Say no to plastic program” which helps to divert waste and 
reduce our effects on the local community and, as a result, the climate. It will 
necessitate a few minor adjustments to everyday routines, both at home and 
at work. Our leadership team, the administration SPOC’s and the CEO took 
the challenge to ban single-use plastic at all offices with each one of our 
employees to support in becoming the poster child for a plastic-free 
organization.  
All Mphasis facilities have also resorted to using 100% biodegradable plastic 
garbage bags to collect and dispose of wet waste, diverting thousands of 
disposable plastic waste in the process. 
E-waste 
Disposed of as per E-waste Management Rules, 2016 
Hazardous waste 
Disposed of as per Batteries (Management and Handling) Amendment 
Rules, 2010
