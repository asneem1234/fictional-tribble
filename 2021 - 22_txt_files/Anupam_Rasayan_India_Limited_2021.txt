9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
A. Being a chemical manufacturing and environment conscious company, our focus is to manage the 
waste at the source itself which includes segregation of the waste so that it can be managed accordingly. 
We believe in 3R principles of waste management i.e., reduce, reuse and recycle. We have adopted the 
processes that are environment friendly and generate less wastes as compared to conventional methods 
like hydrogenation which helps in reducing the hazardous waste. We recycle our effluent and reuse within 
the premises and thus working towards zero liquid discharge. We are recovering waste heat and utilizing 
the same again thus there by reducing the energy requirements. We have diverted 84% of our waste from 
landfill to either recycling or reuse activities.
B. To handle the hazardous and toxic chemicals, we are making our premises safer and more hygienic by 
implementing latest available technologies and making employees more aware with respect to the handling 
and usage of the chemicals.
10. If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks,

3. Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
Grievances can be written or verbal and can be expressed in local languages. They can by lodged by email, 
phone, through our community relations and development staff working locally, and other locally dedicated 
channels, as well as at corporate level. The grievances can be expressed anonymously, as well as on behalf 
of another individual. The channel is also open for our local suppliers. Each grievance is acknowledged once 
received, and the complainant is informed of the next steps. Once we receive a grievance, we assess its 
severity and assign to designate person, who will follow through to ensure that the issue is investigated 
by departments that are best suited to do so, and that the complainant is responded to in due course. 
Grievances with high severity levels are escalated to senior management levels. The grievance manager 
and the respective departments investigate the grievance and respond to the complainant informing them 
about the proposed resolution. In some cases, more information may be requested from the complainant 
to ensure a thorough investigation. We strive for our community grievance process to be based on dialogue 
where a resolution can be found together with the complainant. Remedies may be proposed on case-to-case 
basis. If the solution is refused, the complainant can appeal, in which case the grievance will be re-evaluated 
by alternate investigators. Once the complainant accepts the solution, the grievance is considered resolved. 
We aim to solve all grievances quickly.
