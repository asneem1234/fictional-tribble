Sub: Clarification with respect to XBRL Filing of Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report for the Financial Year 2021‐22  
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 
 
In furtherance to the Company letter no. VEDL/Sec./SE/22‐23/71 dated July 16, 2022 wherein 
the Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR) published for the financial year 
2021‐22 had been filed in PDF format, we hereby submit the XBRL format duly filled in line 
with the PDF file enclosed herewith. 
 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), vide its Circular dated May 10, 2022, has 
allowed  companies  which  are  preparing  and  disclosing  Sustainability  Reports  based  on 
internationally  accepted  reporting  frameworks  (such  as  GRI,  SASB,  TCFD  or  Integrated 
Reporting) to cross‐reference the disclosures made under such framework to the disclosures 
sought under the BRSR. We, henceforth, wish to inform that our primary disclosure document 
on Sustainability & ESG practices, performance is our Annual Sustainability Report which is 
written  in  accordance  with  “GRI  Standards:  Core  option”  and  the  Company  continues  to 
publish TCFD Report also on an annual basis. These reports may be referred to for detailed 
information on our sustainability and ESG performance and can be accessed on Company 
website at www.vedantalimited.com. 
 
With respect to XBRL utility made available by the stock exchanges, we wish to submit that: 
 
BRSR for the financial year 2021‐22 has been submitted by the Company on a voluntary 
basis (excluding non‐mandatory information and leadership indicators) in pursuance to 
SEBI provisions. Hence, the complete format has not been reported in the PDF version.  
 
Because of limiting nature of XBRL utility, certain mandatory fields have been filled with 
‘Not Available’ or ‘Not Reported’ or ‘0.00’ figures as per acceptance of respective fields. 
 
The format is not accepting decimal values and accordingly, adjustments have been made 
to validate the file with resolution of errors. 
 
The format also suffers from inconsistency in terms of the information asked. Hence, the 
submission from the Company’s end would have some alignment different from the PDF 
version or other sustainability disclosures. 
 
Request you to kindly take the above on record.  
 
Thanking you. 
Yours faithfully,  
For Vedanta Limited
