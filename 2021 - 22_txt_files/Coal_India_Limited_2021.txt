We have planted over 30.42 lakh saplings during FY’22
expanding the green cover in mining areas significantly
to 1,468.5 Hectares (Ha). This represents 70% growth
over 862 Ha of FY’21. Achievement against the target of
1310 Ha, for FY’22, was 112%. In FY’22, 76 major OCPs
have reclaimed 62.5% of the excavated area, limiting
active mining area to 37.5 %. We have developed 27
eco-parks until now. Dialogue is on with various States to
introduce more such parks which could generate
employment opportunities.
Ensuring the safety of our miners, mines and machines is
a priority concern. Eliminating risk at work and health of
the employees is a key focus area. We are mindful of our
environmental and social footprints across our value
chain.
We are fully conscious and sensitive of our role in
reaching out to the marginalized sections of the society,
to enhance their quality life, through a well-structured
Corporate Social Responsibility policy. Coal India is one
of the largest CSR spending entities in the country. Our
CSR spend of INR 583 Crore during FY’22 was 29 %
higher than the statutory requirement of INR 452 Crore.
Coal India spent 42% of the year’s CSR expenditure - INR
244 Crore – on Covid care measures.
I am thankful to all the employees for their unwavering
support in excelling in sustainability. Our integrated
approach to technology and decarbonization is designed
to deliver a broad range of sustainability outcomes
across the three pillars of environment, social and
governance (ESG). There are still challenges ahead to
overcome diligently.

I am pleased to present Coal India Limited's first
‘Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report’
(BRSR).
This
replaces
the
earlier
Business
Responsibility Report and aims to establish a link
between the financial results of the business and
its ESG performance. BRSR requirements are
based on the National Guidelines for Responsible
Business Conduct.
BRSR reflects our commitment to govern business
with ethics, transparency, accountability, being
responsive to stakeholders and committed to
customers.
The
aim
is
to
achieve
business
excellence and long-term value in sustainable and
responsible manner.
This is reflected in our resilient response to the
Covid-19 pandemic on two fronts. On one hand,
we have focused on containing its spread in the
mining areas and scaled up the health care
measures of not only our own employees but also
of society within the proximity. On other hand we
have kept up the pace of our output to the best
possible extent and introduced a slew of consumer
friendly measures to lift our off-take.
Coal
India
supports
India's
commitment
of
Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and
aim to become a net-zero company by FY 2027.
Pursuing Solar Projects of 3 GW capacity and
minimizing the carbon footprint in environment
friendly transportation of coal through first mile
connectivity projects are important strides in this
direction.

Coal remains the predominant indigenous energy
source in the country. The energy security of the
country and its prosperity are integrally linked to
the efficient and effective use of this abundant,
affordable and dependent fuel, coal. Currently, 55%
of India’s installed power capacity is coal-based.
CIL produces around 80% of India’s overall coal
production in India. India’s energy demand is
expected to increase in the coming years, most of
which is expected to come from coal. The share of
coal in the overall energy mix is expected to remain
high at 48-54% even beyond 2030. CIL is committed
to 1 BT (billion tons) of coal production by FY 2024-
25.
Coal India Limited (CIL) is committed to building a
sustainable
and
resilient
future
through
its
resources and responsibilities.
CIL believes in a
proactive
and
future-focused
approach
by
understanding the importance of communicating
ESG criteria in their business strategy and action
plans. We believe that operating ethically and
sustainably is not just a responsibility but a
fundamental enabler for organization growth.
We are pleased to put forward this 1st voluntary
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report,
2021 - 22 of Coal India Limited (CIL). We at CIL
believe this voluntary reporting is more than just a
way of presenting statistics; it's also a way of
presenting our commitment to sustainability and
demonstrating it to our stakeholders transparently.
CIL has embarked on this path where disclosure of
our business & our sustainability performance to all
stakeholders will help in attaining a bond with the
stakeholders
CIL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in India are
included in this year's BRSR study. CIL manages 84
mining sites throughout eight (8) Indian provinces,
with 318 mines (141 underground, 158 opencast
and 19 mixed mines), 13 operational coal washeries
and other CIL-managed facilities such as workshops,
hospitals and training institutes.
Preface
The content of this report is for the period of 1st
April 2021 – 31st March 2022. As mandated by the
SEBI
(Listing
Obligations
and
Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR) through a
notification dated 5 May 2021, the top 1,000 listed
companies, in terms of market capitalization, must
prepare a Business Responsibility Report (BRSR)
describing the initiatives taken by the company in
terms of Environmental, Social and Governance
perspective.
Those
companies
preparing
Sustainability
Report
based
on
internationally
accepted reporting frameworks need not prepare a
separate report but furnish their stakeholder's
mapping of the principles contained in BRR to the
disclosures made in their Sustainability Report. The
GRI index at the end of the report includes all the
disclosures. The general and specific indicators of
GRI standards and their location mapped with BRR
have also been included in this report on Page-XX
Our involvement in strengthening sustainability and
impacting the triple bottom line of People, Planet
and Profit is depicted in three sections of the
report. You'll find information about the material
parts of the organization that have been identified,
as well as our many attempts to handle these
aspects
effectively.
This
report
also
includes
information on the status of long-term goals and
targets set during the previous reporting period. We
have also sought to project our aims for the
following year in these material elements. The
reported data were checked for completeness and
accuracy at the operations level. There are no
explicit reiterations of previously reported data
We at CIL believe in the continual improvement of
the Sustainability Reporting process and would
value your suggestions and feedback on the report.

Introduction.  
The Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, constituted a committee under the
Chairmanship of Joint Secretary, MCA, on Business Responsibility Reporting in November 2018 to finalize
business responsibility reporting formats for listed and unlisted companies based on the framework of the
National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC).
The committee, after several rounds of consultations, recommended through its “Report of the Committee on
Business Responsibility Reporting” that Business Responsibility Report (BRR) be renamed Business
Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR). The report suggested that all the disclosures should be based on
ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) parameters in the prescribed format, compelling organizations to
holistically engage with stakeholders and go beyond regulatory compliances in terms of business measures
and their reporting.
Reporting / Disclosure Framework.
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) made the reporting through BRSR mandatory for the top 1,000
listed companies (by market capitalization) from FY2022–23 while disclosures was voluntary for FY2021–22.
The notification mentions that entities already preparing and disclosing sustainability reports based on
internationally accepted reporting frameworks (such as GRI, SASB and Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures) may cross-refer to disclosures made under these frameworks.
Further, the companies were allowed to disclose any other relevant sustainability-related information under the
appropriate section in the BRSR and the mandatory disclosure were sought.
Reporting Sections
Unlike the BRR, which had five sections, the BRSR report has three sections. The inclusion of Sustainability in
the name BRSR was done to enhance the scope of the Report and convey the thrust on sustainability and
business responsibility more accurately.
Section A: General disclosures 
Section A contains details of the company
Products and services offered
Operations, Holdings, Subsidiaries (JV) etc.
Employees, CSR activities
Section B: Management and process disclosures 
Section B contains questions related to policy and
management
processes,
governance,
leadership
and
oversight.
Section C: Principle-wise performance disclosures
Under Section C the Companies are required to report
upon KPIs in alignment with the nine principles of the
NGRBC. The section classifies KPIs into two sub-
categories that companies are required to report upon:
Essential indicators (mandatory)
Leadership indicators (voluntary)

Our USP
Coal remains the predominant energy source in
the country. The energy security of the country
is intricately linked to coal. What makes coal the
preferred choice of fuel is its abundance,
availability and affordability. Currently, 55% of
India’s installed power capacity is coal-based.
CIL produces around 80% of India’s overall coal
production. India’s energy demand is expected
to increase in the coming years, most of which is
expected to come from coal. The share of coal in
the overall energy mix is expected to remain high
at 48-54% even beyond 2030. Despite the
penetration of the renewables, the demand for
coal
is
expected
to
grow
steadily.
CIL
is
committed
to
1
BT
(billion
tons)
of
coal
production by FY 2024-25.
As per IEA’s India Energy Outlook 2021, coal’s
share in India’s total primary energy demand will
steadily decline from 44% in 2019 to 34% in
2040. However, demand for coal will still grow
by 31% over the same period.
The geological resources of coal in India are
more than approximately 344 Billion Tons,
making it the most abundant fossil fuel available
in India. Today India is the 2nd largest coal
producer in the world with a production of about
777.31 MT (Provisional) of coal in 2021-22. Coal
India Limited (CIL), with its seven wholly-owned
coal-producing
subsidiaries
and
one
mine
planning and Consultancy Company, is the single
largest coal-producing company in the world,
with a total production of about 623 (Mt) during
fiscal 2021-22. This is about 80% of the country’s
total coal production.

Non-Coking 
Coal
The coals without coking properties.
•
Mainly used as thermal grade coal for 
power  Generation 
•
Also used for cement, fertilizer, glass, 
ceramic, paper, chemical and brick 
manufacturing and for other heating 
purposes
The coal, when heated in the absence of air, forms 
coherent beads, free from volatiles, with a strong 
and porous mass, called coke.

These have coking properties

Mainly used in steel making and 
metallurgical industries

Also used for hard coke manufacturing
Semi-Coking 
Coal
NLW Coking 
Coal
The coal, when heated in the absence of air, form coherent 
beads not strong enough to be directly fed into the blast 
furnace. Such coal is blended with coking coal in adequate 
proportion to make coke.
These have comparatively less coking properties than coking 
coal
Mainly used as blend-able coal in steel making, merchant coke 
manufacturing and other metallurgical industries
The coal that has undergone the process of coal 
washing or coal beneficiation, resulting in value 
addition of coal due to reduction in ash 
percentage.

Used in manufacturing of hard coke for 
steel making

Beneficiated and washed non-coking coal is 
used mainly for power generation

Beneficiated non-coking coal is used by 
cement, sponge iron and other industrial 
plants
Middlings are by-products of the 
three-stage coal 
washing/beneficiation process, as a 
fraction of feed raw coal.
•
Used for power generation
•
Also used by domestic fuel plants, 
brick manufacturing units, cement 
plants, industrial plants, etc.
Coal is not used in metallurgical 
industries because of its higher 
ash content. This coal is mainly 
used by power utilities and non-
core sector consumers.
Rejects are the products of the coal 
beneficiation process after separation of 
cleans and/or middlings, as a fraction of 
feed raw coal.
•
Used for Fluidized Bed Combustion 
(FBC) Boilers for power generation, 
road repairs, briquette (domestic fuel) 
making, landfilling, etc.

The process of materiality assessment enables us to understand the sustainability challenges and
opportunities gauged from the stakeholder engagement process, which are relevant to our business as well as
to our stakeholders. The material topics identified are the foundation of our ESG report, reflecting our vision,
strategy, action plans, goals and performance for each material topic.
During the reporting period, we conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment based on the GRI
Standards and addressed the topics throughout the report. Initially, an exhaustive list of material topics was
identified and compiled through extensive research of topics reported by peer groups, GRI sectoral guidelines,
SASB sectoral guidelines and topics identified by CIL’s sustainability team. We interacted with internal
stakeholders from legal, procurement, EHS, sustainability, marketing, corporate governance and Human
Resource Departments from all subsidiaries and our operating locations to collate their inputs and prioritize
material topics into these categories, major, significant and moderate based on the criticality of the identified
topic. The topics were then reviewed and finalized by the sustainability team and senior management.
We narrowed down 26 material topics critical to our stakeholders and our organization's success. This report
includes a Disclosure on Management Approach (DMA) for each material topic identified under all three
categories major, significant and moderate. The matrix below represents the outcome of our materiality
assessment.

Defining Relevance of Material Topics
Once we identify our material sustainable topics that matter most to our business and stakeholders, we
ensure the development of an adequate management system and design strategies around each of these
aspects. The aim is to to minimize its impacts on the interest of our stakeholders or business in terms of
growth, cost and risk. Our approach to each of the identified sustainability topics is described below:
Material Topic
Relevance
Water Management 
(Consumption and 
Discharge)
Water is an integral part of our sustainability vision. We ensure effective water
management and conservation is aligned with our business strategy and is
implemented at all our operating locations. The objective of CIL is to maximize the
utilization of treated Mine Water for industrial and community purposes. CIL has
adopted advanced pisciculture techniques to convert local ponds and closed surface
mines into pisciculture centres that act as income generators for the local populace.
Energy Efficiency / Energy 
Management
The linkage between energy consumption and climate change is a significant business
concern. Coal Mining operations are energy-intensive and involve the use of a high
amount of fuel and electricity. Hence, we identify opportunities for improving energy
efficiency. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Energy
Efficiency Service Limited (EESL) for building energy efficiency programs.
Renewable Energy and 
clean energy
Coal continues to be the preferred energy fuel in India due to its abundance,
availability and affordability, however, the future holds challenges for coal as an
energy fuel. In line with India`s commitment at COP2 to achieve net-zero emissions
by 2070, increasing the share of renewable energy is the focus area of CIL. This will
enable us to manage our energy needs sustainably and improve energy efficiency.
Waste Management
Managing waste from coal extraction and ancillary operations requires intensive
handling and disposal mechanisms. We believe that effective waste management is
essential for environmental protection and we are committed to reducing, effectively
managing and complying with hazardous and non-hazardous waste regulations.

GHG Emissions / 
Climate Change
The impact of climate change has increased in frequency and severity over the years and
has become an emerging global risk. We are focusing on the importance of GHG reduction
and effective utilization of energy by selecting appropriate environmentally friendly
technologies. In line with our FY commitment to achieve a carbon offset of over 60,000
Tons, by the end of FY 2022, we have achieved 1,13,232.23 tons worth of carbon offset
(73,634.88 Ton CO2 from plantations projects + 12187.35 Ton CO2 reduction from solar
PV installation + 27,410 Tons /Year from various energy efficiency-related projects
implemented across the operations of CIL). Additionally, we are offsetting carbon through
diesel saving in our FMC projects.
Air Emissions
The emissions of SOx, NOx, SPM and particulate matter have become severe health issues
across India's urban landscape. We monitor our Sox, Nox and most predominantly the
SPM emissions. We have systems in place to control the air pollutants emitted into the
atmosphere and comply with the applicable laws and regulations.
Biodiversity and land 
management
We are committed to minimizing our impacts on flora and fauna and have integrated 
biodiversity management and ecological restoration into our action plans. We planted 
30.42 Lakh saplings over a land area of 1468.45 Ha in FY 2021-22 that reflects our 
commitment to protecting and restoring ecosystem. This is a growth of 70% over last year.
Environmental and 
Regulatory Compliance
We are aware of the sectoral and location-specific rules and regulations and ensure
compliance with them to prevent any unintentional negative impacts on the environment.
Mechanization of mines
Mine mechanization aims to develop new capabilities and improve safety, profitability and 
sustainability in mine design, operation and closure activities. 
Reducing environmental 
impacts during 
transportation, 
packaging and dispatch
CIL has taken effective steps to upgrade the mechanized coal transportation and loading
system under the 'First Mile Connectivity' projects. This will help increase mechanized
evacuation from 151 MTPA to 622.5 MTPA by FY25. Over the last three years, CIL has
substantially increased its rail portfolio as a preferred mode of transport. Around 71% of
our coal got transported through non-road mode.
Employee Inclusion and 
Diversity
We believe that a diverse workplace is essential for organizational growth since it 
acknowledges individual strength and the skills they bring to the workplace.
Employee Development 
& well-being / Training 
& Education
We understand that employees equipped with industry knowledge and skills required for 
their jobs are critical for the long-term sustenance of the organization. Hence, we make 
significant efforts to build employee skills that lead to professional and personal growth.
Occupational Health & 
Safety
Providing a safe workplace to our employees is a vital responsibility. We constantly strive 
to provide and maintain safe premises, machinery, systems and processes at our 
operating locations.
Labour Conditions / 
Human Rights 
Assessment
We are committed to the global principles and charters on human rights and acknowledge 
the importance of a discrimination-free workplace. CIL provides the right to freedom and 
collective bargaining to all employees and no child labor or forced / compulsory labor is 
tolerated.
Community 
Engagement
The local community’s well-being is vital to us and we ensure that their concerns, views 
and expectations are integrated into the decision-making process. Our social investments 
align with the outcome of effective engagements and a thorough understanding of their 
most pressing needs.
Socio-Economic 
Compliance (Providing 
equal and fair wages)
We believe in an inclusive work environment and all our employees receive the same 
remuneration across the same level irrespective of gender or region of operations.

Land Acquisition & Rehabilitation
Fair determination of compensation for land acquisition and other assets
is ensured by the company’s Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy,
which is framed as per the Government Approved Guidelines. This is
achieved through employment against the land, cash compensation
against land value, shifting allowances for rehab sites, or lumpsum
compensation.
Upholding Rights of Indigenous 
People
We understand the local issues by engaging with indigenous people
through village meetings, interaction with SHGs and celebrating important
cultural festivities of the community. For promoting good relationships
with the local populace, we prioritize CSR activities in and around the
mining areas.
Mine Closure
CIL’s objective is to achieve its coal production target sustainably,
undertaking mine closure activities and making the land suitable for
utilization for future generations. During FY22, INR 109.93 Crore was
reimbursed from escrow fund for mine closure activities.
Regulatory Compliance / Anti-
Corruption
We have developed a Corruption Risk Mitigation Policy which Vigilance
Division implements. We do not tolerate bribery, corruption or improper
activities. We have established a "Whistle Blower Policy" to build and
strengthen a culture of transparency and trust in the organization and
provide employees with a framework/procedure for responsible and
secure reporting of such activities.
Business Ethics and Corporate 
Governance
We strongly believe and commit to our values, ethics and business
conduct. We have a robust governance structure wherein clear roles and
responsibilities are defined for unbiased decision making across the
organization.
Business Risk Management 
We have established a robust risk management system consisting of a
mechanism
for
defining,
prioritizing
and
formulating
contingency
strategies for risks. A Risk Management team headed by Chief Risk Officer
(CRO) in consultation with HoDs and under the guidance of the Risk
Management Committee implements the governance process envisaged
in the Risk Management Framework along with formulation of Risk
Mitigation plans.
Financial Performance and Growth
Economic growth is material to us for overall sustainability. During the
reporting period, CIL has achieved an aggregate Pre-Tax Profit of INR
23,616.28 Crore and a post-tax profit of INR 17,378.42 Crore.
Disaster Management
Disaster Management & Relief is one of our key CSR focus areas. During
the reporting period, CIL had spent INR 244 Crore on COVID-19-related
projects/activities which is approx. 42% of total spend for the year.
Business continuity / Long-term 
Business sustainability
A business continuity plan is necessary to avoid and mitigate risks
associated with a disruption of operations
Grievance Redressal Management 
System
We believe in value creation for stakeholders and understand the varying
perspectives of each stakeholder group.
We ensure an open channel of communication among all stakeholders
through multiple avenues.
We have developed an integrated Centralized Public Grievance Redressal
and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), which is a web-based solution run by
the
Department
of
Administrative
Reforms
&
Public
Grievances,
Government of India, to resolve Public Grievances. All the grievances from
employees, customers & other stakeholders are resolved using CPGRAMS.

discriminate based on race, gender, or religion and
upholds values of equality, tolerance and respect for
others. Our code of business conduct sets the
principles that enhance the ethical and transparent
process of managing the company’s affairs. We have
institutionalized
strong
internal
procedures
to
contain and curb corrupt practices in the company’s
operations. It also provides reporting mechanisms for

Avoidance of Conflict of Interest
Code of Integrity for Public Procurement (CIPP)
CIL has further implemented the Code of Integrity for
Public
Procurement
(CIPP)
to
ensure
purchasing
agencies, bidders, vendors, contractors and consultants
proactively report any preexisting or future conflicts of
interest in any procurement or contract execution
process. According to the code, a bidder must declare
any prior infringement of the CIPP with any entity in
any country during the last three years or if being
debarred by any other procuring entity. Failure to do
so by any party is considered a violation of this code.
CIL promotes local suppliers who play an important
role in developing the local economy. CIL ensures that
suppliers and contractors are screened as per statutory
labor practices.
E- tendering Procurement Mechanism
CIL believes in fair, equitable and transparent tendering
procedures and has initiated e-tender procurement
proceedings. All the procurement procedures are done
after confirmation of eligibility criteria as per technical
bid. This mechanism allows supply to be made directly
to the subsidiary companies as per their requirement
from time to time. Vendor selection is done when the
party meets the eligibility criteria and accepts the
commercial terms & conditions of the NIT. CIL also
undertakes various vendor engagement initiatives such
as Pre-bid meetings where vendors are invited for their
active participation. Also, the buyer-seller meetings are
held
from
time
to
time
for
awareness
of
the
Procurement System.
Policies - an integral part of the governance
structure
Since its inception, CIL has upheld transparency,
integrity
and
accountability
which
have
been
integrated into our vision and mission. To this end, CIL
has formulated and uploaded policies/codes on its
website in line with the Companies Act, 2013 and the
Listing Regulations, like the Code of Business Conduct,
Corruption Risk Mitigation Policy, IT Policy, CSR Policy,
Sustainable development policy, Whistle-Blower policy,
to list a few.
The Board not only institutionalizes and reviews
policies but also focuses on overall organizational
practices,
awareness
creation
and
monitoring
associated with each of these policies and its impact
on organizational culture. A complete list of policies
can be referred to through our corporate website
https://www.coalindia.in/policies/.
Vigilance Mechanism
The Vigilance Division within CIL is an integral part
of the management and is the nodal division for
handling all vigilance-related matters. CIL believes
that through best practices, adequate control and
transparency in place, decisions will be professional,
effective
and
consistent,
leading
to
corporate
excellence. CVO heads the Vigilance Division at Coal
India. The role of the CVO is practical vigilance
administration which functions as an extension of
the
CVC
in
the
company.
All

Risks
Management Approach/ Mitigation Measures taken by CIL
1
Climate Risk 
Assessment
Mines of CIL operate in remote regions vulnerable to climate change and fragile environment.
The extensive product transportation network and complex supply chain are carried out in these
regions. This exposes us to climate change risks and we have assessed its impact on our
operations.
CIL implements specific measures for dealing with climate-related risks and their potential impact.
As part of the climate risk management strategy, the risks have been evaluated and a mitigation
strategy has been laid out for dealing with each of these risks through technological innovation,
identification of new market opportunities and collaborative initiatives that address the changing
needs of business and communities affected by climate change.
As an environmentally responsible company, CIL is committed to becoming a Net Zero Energy
Company and is in the process of implementing a 3 GW solar power program. CIL has already
installed 9.54 MW of solar power plants.
2
Resettlement & 
Rehabilitation 
(R&R)
Coal mining is based on geographical factors and is site-specific. Owing to this aspect, it involves
the acquisition of large tracts of land, which leads to involuntary displacement of inhabitants
(Project Affected People – PAPs) who are native/residents of the area. Rehabilitation and
resettlement plays a major role in CIL’s long-term business goals and thus necessitated on
creating a bond / cordial relationship with the local society. We are sensitive to the needs and
aspirations of the PAPs and have always tried for the best possible R&R package. Our people-
friendly R&R policy provides greater flexibility in resettling and rehabilitating people affected by
coal mining projects. Our compensation plan is accorded as per CIL’s R&R Policy-2012 and is in
line with the statutory requirement. 2150 land oustees were employed at CIL during FY 2021-22 .
3
Regulatory 
compliance
CIL being a Government CPSU, regulatory compliance is mandatory and non-negotiable. All our
operations comply with regulatory bodies' legal, environmental and social requisites. Before
operationalizing any new/expansion project, CIL ensures that necessary clearances (including
environmental and forest clearances) have been obtained.
Further, we have well-established systems, procedures and review mechanisms to identify and
comply with the laws and regulations concerning our business operations.
4
Supply of 
quality Coal 
Maintaining the quality and efficiency in delivery of coal is of paramount importance to CIL. We
have a robust system to ensure customers receive quality coal. We have partnered with two
globally renowned Third-Party Sampling (TPS) and Testing companies (in addition to the three
existing TPS agencies), COTECNA Inspection India Private Limited and SGS India Private Limited, to
strengthen the sampling and analysis of coal delivered. Additionally, CIL currently has 58 coal
testing laboratories across the subsidiary companies, out of which 56 laboratories are NABL
accredited and the accreditation process is underway in respect of another 02 laboratories.
According
to
third-party
sample
analysis,
CIL's
resolve
to
provide
better-quality
coal
demonstrated a positive leap, with grade conformance improving to 66 % in FY'22 from 63 % the
previous year.
5
Customer 
satisfaction
To ensure consumer satisfaction and resolve consumer complaints, particular emphasis has been
given to quality management and redressal of consumer complaints. Online filing and redressal of
complaints have been implemented in CIL. Zero pending grievances were carried forward from FY
2021-22 for redressal. During the reporting period, 55 fresh grievances were received. All the 55
grievances (100%) were resolved within the stipulated timeframe. The average time it takes to
resolve a complaint is seven days.
Precautionary approach
CIL has strong internal control system and processes
for managing compliances as part of the precautionary
approach to prevent non-compliance. To ensure that
all checks and balances are in place and all internal
control systems are in order, internal audits are
conducted by experienced firms of accountants in
close coordination with the Company’s Internal
Audit Department. The overall framework ensures
smooth and efficient business conduct by the
relevant laws and regulations.

Energy Management
The energy demand of India is projected to
increase manifold in the coming decades. For a
country where coal accounts for 55% of the total
energy generated, the effects of GHG emissions on
environment
cannot
be
overlooked.
Industry
leaders
across
the
world
acknowledge
the
importance of low carbon economic development.
Reducing the environmental impact of mining
activities
is
a
key
component
of
low-carbon
economic development.
Therefore, it is vital to study mining efficiency and
sustainable development strategies for the mining
industry.
Being
an
environment-conscious
organization, CIL has adopted various strategies to
ensure
environmental
sustainability
across
its
operations.
In collaboration with CMPDI and other institutions,
CIL has worked on implementing various low
carbon strategies and R&D projects related to coal
mine environmental management.
Coal mining is a highly energy-intensive activity that
necessitates using large quantities of fuel and
power. While most of the fuel used is for heavy
earth moving machines (HEMMs), transportation,
ventilation and pumping, a small amount is also
utilized for DG sets. To lower its carbon footprint in
its operational area, CIL has placed a strong
emphasis on energy efficiency measures and is
moving forward with several carbon-offsetting
initiatives.
Extraction of coal shall be planned prudently to meet 
national requirement in a planned way
Use of more environmentally friendly technologies and 
equipment with optimal capacity and improve the 
existing technologies
All mine planning and design must be environmentally 
acceptable and comply to the environmental standards
Voluntary energy audits for corrective action to reduce 
carbon footprint.
CIL’s environment focused strategies
Initiative towards Energy Efficiency
CIL remains committed towards identification and
deployment of energy efficiency opportunities
across its subsidiary and operations. Continuing
with the achievements of last year, subsidiary
companies have maintained Power Factor as high
as 95% or more during 2021-22.
During FY 21-22, coal production increased by
4.4% compared to 2020-21, with an overall
increase in the excavation of combined coal & OB.
Electricity consumption in CIL in F.Y. 2021-22 was
4571.4 million units in comparison to 4689.67
million units in 2021-22. The total amount paid for
the energy bill was INR 3557.12 Crore which was
only 1.1% more than the last years energy bill
despite high growth in coal production and OB
removal.
CIL
across
its
subsidiaries
has implemented various projects for Carbon
reduction,
including
a
decentralized
Solar
Program (rooftop and ground-mounted) at its
sites.
During 2021-22 due to the implementation of

CIL, in association with CSIR- National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, conducted an
assessment study for benefits of the mechanized conveyor belt and silo loading system in coal loading &
transport.
The study covered the issues of Environmental, Social and Potential Economic benefits in two of the major
mines under 'The First Mile Connectivity Project’. The study revealed that implementation of 16 MT coal
dispatch through CHP and Silo at Lingaraj OCP will result into reduction in tipper movement and savings of
INR 50.19 Crore by reduction of 58,38,309 liters diesel consumption per year. Also, a reduction in CO by
72.2%, Hydro-Carbon by 70.8%, NOx by 76.8%, PM10 by 72.3% and PM 2.5 by 71.8% was estimated.
Also, a saving of 26,95,736 liters of diesel per year is estimated from 10 MTY coal dispatch through CHP &
SILO in Gevra OC. The cumulative monetary saving is expected to be INR 23.08 Crore annually. Similarly, a
reduction in CO by 83.7%, Hydro-Carbon by 83.3%, NOx by 85.3%, PM10 by 84.1% and PM 2.5 by 83.8%
was estimated in Gevra OC
Railway lines for coal evacuation
In order to have a seamless evacuation system for the projected production, an action plan to enhance
and strengthen the infrastructure of coal evacuation for existing, ongoing and future projects of
subsidiary companies was envisioned in the previous financial year. A total of 7 Railway Projects for
evacuation of coal were identified, out of which CIL funded 3 on a deposit basis and 4 through JVs/SPVs
by CIL.
During 2021-22, a total quantity of
481.19 MT of coal was transported

Over the last three years, CIL has substantially
increased its rail portfolio as a preferred mode of
transport. More than 72% of our coal got transported
through non-road mode (conveyor belt, MGR &
railways) in the F.Y. 21-22. The multiple advantages of
it were reduced traffic congestion, lesser road
accidents and reduced impact on air quality post-coal
production and before consumption/usage.

Moving towards cleaner energy - Diversification of Business & Creation of New Verticals
Coal is used extensively as a fuel in most parts of the world. According to a report by World Nuclear
Association, the burning of coal produces about 15 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year. To address this
problem, CIL has taken various initiatives like promoting "clean coal" technologies and diversification of
business towards cleaner technologies so that the coal resources can be utilized for future generations
without contributing to global warming.
Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Limited (HURL), one of our Joint Venture companies,
moving away from coal has set up three natural-gas based 1.27 MTPA urea plants,
one each at Gorakhpur (U.P.), Sindri (Jharkhand) and Barauni (Bihar). These coveted
projects of national importance are being implemented at an estimated aggregate
cost of around INR 25,000 Crore. The first plant was commissioned on Dec 07, 2021,
rest two units are also near completion and scheduled to be commissioned shortly.
The commercial urea production from all three plants will commence in F.Y. 2022-
23.

foundation for the coal gasification sector in the country. In this project, high ash
coal blended with pet-coke up to 25% shall be gasified to produce a syngas which
shall be converted into neem-coated urea. The project is being implemented on a
Partial Lump Sum Turn Key (LSTK) basis at an estimated cost of INR 13,277 Crore,
which will be financed by a debt-equity structure of 72:28. TFL has successfully
achieved the Financial Closure by obtaining Final Sanctions of the target debt
amount. As of March 2022, the project's overall progress stands at around 22%. The
plant is expected to come into operation in F.Y. 2024-25.
Setting up of Coal to Methanol plant: Pre-feasibility studies completed for setting up
integrated Coal-to-Chemical (C2C) plants utilizing low-ash coal to be located near
the mine head at three of our subsidiaries, ECL, SECL and WCL, to produce
methanol, Ammonia and Ammonium Nitrate. These initiatives are now in various
stages of implementation. Additionally, for setting up a C2C plant utilizing high ash
coal, CIL has initiated a pre-feasibility study to produce Ammonium Nitrate at a
strategic location to cater to the requirement of coal producing subsidiaries.

CIL Board has approved for the submission of the application to acquire prospecting
license and mining leasehold of Bauxite mine(s) in Odisha through the Allocation
route of MM(D&R) Act, 1957. A pre-feasibility report was prepared for the
Integrated Greenfield Aluminum Project to be undertaken by CIL through MCL.
Under the single-window clearance system, we have already received 'in-principle'
approval from the High-Level Clearance Authority (HCLA) for our proposal to set up
a 1MTPA refinery, 0.5 MTPA Aluminum Smelter and 1400 MW CPP.
Thermal Power 
Generation
Through our subsidiary South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), CIL is exploring
opportunities to partner with MPPGCL to form a J.V. for setting up 1x660 M.W.
expansion project at Amarkantak Thermal Power Station (ATPS). Coal to the said
plant will be supplied from SECL through a new linkage (to be applied by JVC). 'In-
principle' approval from MoC, DIPAM & NITI Aayog has been obtained. As the
next step, MoU between SECL and MPPGCL will be executed.

Focus on Renewable energy
To minimize the carbon footprint from mining operations in an endeavor to achieve carbon neutrality, one
of our strategies is to increase renewable energy portfolio. As a green energy source, solar power
generation lists on our diversification. We are venturing to set up solar power generation projects of 3,000
MW capacity by FY'24. As of 2021-22, the total installed capacity of Solar Power Projects in CIL is 9.54 MW,
of which the rooftop solar capacity added during 2021-22 stands at 4.279 MWp. A total of 40 Lakh units of
solar energy had been generated from all the Solar Projects. Work has been awarded for installing a total of
240 MW capacities of ground-mounted solar plants in different subsidiaries which are under different
stages of implementation.

Water Management
Water security is a global priority. Managing water
resources is a major challenge for the world
economies
including
mining
industries
and
surrounding communities.
People in the proximity of mining areas are
concerned about water-related issues resulting from
mining activities. New approaches toward water
management
are
being
sought
across
the
organization to address ongoing and long-term
water-related risks and challenges.
Adhering to its commitment toward preservation of
bio-diversity and natural resources (water being one
of them), CIL ensures preliminary assessments
through Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
and
Environmental
Management
Plan
(EMPs).
Water-related issues that can potentially
impact the well-being of our stakeholders, including
employees, contractors and local communities from
our operations, are constantly being identified.
Potential identified risks that emerge from mining
operations include fluctuations in the groundwater
levels, water flows and water quality. These risks
could also occur within the immediate area of the
operation or in the surrounding catchment area.
CIL ensures that all mines have dedicated
sumps with water harvesting structures
and initial settling tanks for the removal of
effluent waste. All opencast mines have
commissioned effluent treatment plants to
treat wastewater, garland drains to collect
runoff water and siltation ponds to settle
sediments
in
mine
water.
Acid
mine
drainage has only been reported in a few
mines. When such a report is received, CIL
takes
steps
to
neutralize
the
acidic
component
(as
per
CPCB
Guidelines)
before using or disposing of the effluents.

Pisciculture and Agriculture
As a commitment to support lives and
livelihood, CIL took several initiatives. One
among them is the conversion of the closed
mines
into
pisciculture
projects.
Several
capacity-building workshops and programs
were conducted in association with state
fisheries departments. CIL over the years has
funded programs for the overall development
of surrounding areas of the abandoned
mines.
Such programs have not been limited to the
abandoned mines but have expanded beyond
the mine premises to the nearby villages and
communities. Several initiatives like ground
water
recharging
through
rainwater
harvesting, digging of ponds, developments
of lagoons, de-silting existing ponds and
tanks have been undertaken/ funded by CIL.
Discharged mine water is used for irrigation
purposes benefiting thousands of villagers.

Paddy cultivation on overburden 
Paddy cultivation on an overburden dump was done on a trial basis by BCCL in 2014-15. Since then, the
CIL subsidiary has been cultivating various crops on experimental basis dispelling the general perception
of mining wasteland. CIL transformed various patches of land on overburden dumps and successfully
cultivated various crops season over season.
A pilot project was conducted in Kaunda, where BCCL could harvest 3-4 Kg of rice in the first season over
a patch of 10 feet by 10 feet land. The area under cultivation was increased and in 2016, 50kg of rice
was harvested from a patch of 30 feet x 30 feet land. The only manure used during the cultivation was
cow dung and the seedlings used were also raised at the site only. The cultivation of Rice (Dhan) was
done in the year 2016 (and 2020), followed by wheat (genhu) in the year 2017 and Lemon grass in the
year 2022. The crop cultivations’ purpose was to see if the site is capable of average growth and
cultivation. No heavy metals were detected in the soil used for harvesting, thus making harvested rice
over mined out degraded land safe to consume.

Land Reclamation 
This success of BCCL towards the enhancement of biodiversity received much recognition.
Kusunda ecological restoration team has established and maintained this site for which training
was provided by FRI, Dehradun. This project is being supervised and monitored by the ecological
restoration team of the Environment Department, HQ, Koyla Nagar, BCCL. The whole
management team of Kusunda strives to find new ways in which the degraded land can be
ecologically enriched and established for other economic activities.
As part of bio-reclamation initiatives of MCL, a reclamation drive using crop cover over external OB
dump on an area of 75 Ha was carried out during FY 2021-22. The grassing/cropping was carried
out by planting and sprinkling red grams bamboo seeds over the OB dump of Bhubaneswari OCP.
The exercise of crop cover also helped to enrich the soil and replenish the supplements to the soil,
enhancing the water seepage and air circulation.

Over Burden (OB) to Sand
Sand is the second most-consumed natural resource
next to water. Considering the increasing demand for
sand, CIL, in a novel move has started segregating
sand from overburden formations. Currently, the only
sources of sand are mining, dredging from water
courses of rivers, or imports from various countries.
This initiative of CIL has opened new possibilities; in
not only making cheaper sand available to the
surrounding areas but the overall impact on the
environmental pollution due to sand mining was
reduced. Also, these sand segregation plants will
improve the riverine ecosystem, flow, groundwater
recharge potential and water quality in their courses.
Currently, two OB to sand plants are operational in
WCL.
The sand segregated from O.B. formations is being
provided to agencies implementing housing under
government schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas
Yojana (PMAY) and the like.
Seven OB to Sand project proposals have already
been prepared and are under different stages of
implementation.

Waste and Effluent Management
Waste Management has emerged as one of the key
challenges for industrial operations. The increasing focus on
the way industries manage, dispose and reuse waste is under
constant scanner from various stakeholders, NGOs and other
investors.
CIL
recognizes
the
importance
of
waste
management and continues to work on innovative ways to
reduce and reuse waste in the best possible manner as a
responsible organization.
One significant waste generated from our operations
remains the overburden, followed by the mine water,
process waste, used oil and sludge. CIL has worked out
various ways to extract sand from the overburden. Similarly,
the mine water, considered a waste, is being reused for
industrial and domestic use (internal consumption) and the
consumption of nearby communities for drinking and
irrigation purposes.
Our non-hazardous waste comprises scrap material like High-
Density Polyethylene (HDPE) drums, metal scrap, plastic
barrels and other process wastes. During the reporting
period, we disposed of all hazardous and non-hazardous
waste to authorized vendors. The procedure for managing
waste is as per Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management
and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2015. We transport
our hazardous waste generated to the authorized vendor,
where waste is disposed of through appropriate methods in
line with the stipulated law of the land and required
documents are submitted to the regulator State Pollution
Control Board (SPCB).
Further, keeping in mind the importance of disposing of e-
waste, CIL has a dedicated e-Waste Policy framed in 2019 to
dispose of e-waste efficiently and in an eco-friendly manner.

CIL has not had any incidence of coal or oil 
spillage during the year 2021-22. 
Waste-water Management
CIL ensures that mine water and other effluents
are treated by statutory discharge standards. To
achieve maximum water conservation, treated
effluent
is
used
to
the
extent
possible.
Additionally, Oil & Grease Traps remove the oil
and
grease
from
the
effluents
for
proper
disposal. Effluent treatment facilities for mine,
workshop, CHP effluents, such as oil and grease
traps, sedimentation ponds and storage and
reuse of treated water, have been provided in all
major projects. CIL has also established domestic
sewage treatment plants to treat domestic
effluents. CIL is currently operating over 45
sewage
treatment
plants
and
123
Effluent
Treatment plants across its operations.
Noise has been considered a problem in the
mining industry for many years and the
gradual growth in mechanization over the last
few decades has increased noise levels in
many
sectors.
Within
our
operational
boundary, noise pollution arises due to the
operation of Heavy Earth Moving Machinery
(HEMM) deployed in mines, activities of
Workshops, Coal Handling Plants (CHPs) and
blasting operations. CIL has taken various
steps to manage, control and reduce the noise
pollution created due to the said activities at
CIL mining sites, as mentioned below:
Blast free technology for extraction of 
coal is adopted in big opencast mines
Blasting with delay detonators

Air Emission - Control and Management
At
regular
intervals,
the
ambient
air
quality
monitoring equipment tracks air pollutants at all
locations. Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Oxides
(NOx), Particulate Matter (PM) and Suspended
Particulate Matter (SPM) are some of the air
emission parameters that are monitored. Emissions
are within the norms prescribed by the regulatory
authorities.
CIL uses mobile sprinklers, stationary sprinklers &
fog canons on haul roads and other dust-generating
sites in all its mines to effectively control dust. The
blacktopping of highways, mandatory covering of
coal transport vehicles, avenue plantations and
afforestation of all unoccupied places are other
priority
areas
that
CIL
is
focusing
on.
CIL’s
subsidiaries are also installing conveyors to carry
coal from mines to dispatch locations to minimize
dust emissions produced during transportation.

Biodiversity Management
Biodiversity conservation and management have become a
buzzword in natural resource development, particularly in
the mining industry. As people became more conscious of
environmental
challenges,
the
focus
of
sustainable
development has shifted in recent years, particularly on
environment and communities in the proximity of the
mining areas. Because of the increased awareness of
biodiversity
conservation
within
the
ecosystem,
stakeholders such as local communities, NGOs, investors
and the media
are scrutinizing the mining sector's
biodiversity conservation performance closely.
Long-term
development
requires
commitment
to
biodiversity management and conservation. Through a
coordinated
and
comprehensive
program
of
impact
avoidance, minimization and mitigation, CIL is committed
to promote the preservation of regional biodiversity and
the habitat on which it depends.
Management approach towards biodiversity
conservation
CIL is strongly committed to ensure biodiversity protection
at all locations. For all of our mines, whether greenfield or
expansion, we conduct a complete environmental impact
assessment (EIA) that considers pre- and post-mining
operations. Environment Management Plans are prepared
with the help of NABET acrrediated agencies and then
discussed in-depth with the Expert Appraisal Committee
(EAC) under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and
Climate Change. EAC proposes that MoEF&CC award
Environmental Clearance for the projects based on the
discussions.
CIL makes sure that all operations across its subsidiaries
adhere to all project terms and conditions. A compliance
report is submitted to MOEF&CC and SPCB every six
months to ensure compliance with the EC conditions.
CIL's goal is to meet its coal production target sustainably
by completing mine closures and ensuring land usage for
future generations. Environmental problems are taken into
consideration in CIL's mining activities and operating
choices.

Monitoring of Biological Reclamation
CIL’s
land
reclamation
performance
is
closely
monitored by satellite surveillance. Seventy-six major
open cast projects (OCPs), producing more than 5 Mm³
Coal + O.B. annually, are monitored yearly and the
remaining OCPs, which produce less than 5 Mm³ Coal +
O.B. annually, are monitored once every three years. In
addition, CIL is conducting vegetation cover mapping
through satellite surveillance every three years. Details
of satellite imagery studies have also been uploaded on
CIL’s website.
The Satellite Surveillance study reveals that 76
major OCPs have reclaimed area of 62.53% and
active mining area is limited to only 37.47 % of
the total excavated area.
We have deployed drones to monitor mining areas
such as land reclamation, mine closure monitoring
and the generation of a digital terrain model for
monitoring mining operations. The drones are also
used to measure in-situ excavated volume and coal
stock through the DTM-to-DTM method using its
LiDAR sensor.

Eco Restoration and Development of Eco Parks
Reclamation of the mined-out areas and the external OB dumps is a major environmental mitigatory activity
taken up by Coal India.
In all new mines reclamation of mined-out areas are being done as per the Environmental Management Plan
and Mine Closure Plan which are approved by MoEF&CC. Concurrent reclamation and rehabilitation of mined-
out areas (subject to technical feasibility as per geo-mining conditions) are undertaken for gainful land use.
For gainful land use, concurrent reclamation and restoration of mined-out regions are done (subject to technical
feasibility and geo-mining conditions). Scientific research is carried out to determine suitable plant species for
each coalfield and a sustainable restoration sequence through three-tier plantations for effective Bio-
reclamation of disturbed land.
As of 31st March 2022, through its various subsidiaries, CIL has commissioned 27 Eco-restoration, Eco Parks and
Eco-Tourism Projects covering an area of approx. 225 Ha, with an expenditure of more than INR 32 Crore.
59
Many of the commissioned eco-Parks and eco-restoration projects of CIL have recorded footfall as high as
10,000-11,000 and are expected to double in the near future. These eco-parks, on average, provide direct &
indirect employment to 20-25 local people and with increasing footfall, the indirect employment numbers shall
also rise. Coal India is currently exploring possibilities of Mine-Tourism, which shall help increase the footfall in
these eco-parks manifold.
Special attention was given to the tourist amenities while developing these Eco-Parks and provisions like Jetty 
& Boat rides, parking facilities, canteen & cafeterias and several other amenities for children were also installed 
in these parks. Bird watching points, hiking trails and similar other provisions have also been developed at 
specific locations to cater to the needs of the tourists. 
As of 31st March 2022, NCL has funded the development of three Eco-Parks, Modwani Dam Eco-park
(Jayant Mines), Nigahi Eco Park (Bareja Pond) and CS Azad Eco Park (Bina OC), with total funding of INR
16.60 Crore under CSR.
The parks cover an area of 23.91 Ha. The Modwani Dam & Nigahi Eco Parks are already been completed and
are open to the public. Chandra Sekhar Azad Eco-Park is scheduled to be commissioned by December 2022.
These Eco-Parks have started to attract migratory birds like Black Winged Stilt and many similar species are 
expected to make these parks their home.

To promote mine tourism and create a tourism-based source of income for the local
communities around the identified Eco-Tourism parks, NCL, a subsidiary of CIL, signed a MoU
with Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation (MPSTDC) in August 2021. The
main objective of this collaborative initiative was to link all bio-diversity hotspots of the Singrauli
region (i.e., Son-Ghariyal Sanctuary, Bagdara Sanctuary, Sanjay Dubri Tiger Reserve, Mada caves,
etc.) mine tourism, village tourism, with both state and national tourism bodies. Through such
initiatives, CIL endeavors to create awareness for the conservation of Biodiversity and create
new job opportunities in the Singrauli region.
Since the signing of the MoU, the “Singrauli Eco-Tourism Circuit” has emerged as a new tourist
attraction in Central India. On an average of 1000-1200 persons per month visit these sites of
this circuit.
Not only for regular tourists, these mines are also becoming popular among students of various
age groups. Prominent institutions like IITs and NIT have shown interest in organizing
educational tours and trips to these Eco-Tourism Parks with visits to closed mines and
surrounding reclaimed land as part of the academic curriculum.
CIL is also planning to launch a dedicated portal for Singrauli Eco-Tourism Circuit and run 
capacity building programs for the nearby communities and local tribes for the homestays, in 
association with State Forest Dept. as well as MPSTDC. The dedicated portal is expected to be 
launched in the second quarter of 2022.

concept. To
achieve
India's commitments
to
meet
the
Paris
Agreement through
decarbonization of coal regions, MoC, in assistance of World Bank, has introduced the design
and implementation of transition strategies for coal regions, in mitigating and managing
impacts to direct / indirect workers, communities and providers of goods & services along a
complex value chain from mine to power plant.
The assistance envisages:
-
Coal Mine Closures, including new technical standards for decommissioning mines 
that enable post- closure re-purposing and mitigate public health & safety legacy 
issues.
-
Strengthen policies/laws and institutional capacities at the central, state and coal
region levels to ensure good social and environmental performance necessary for a
Just Transition for All approach.
-
Mitigation of social impacts from loss of direct and indirect jobs shifts towards longer-
term reskilling and re-educating members of the remaining workforce and the broader
community to access jobs of the future

CIL has implemented an appropriate and well-balanced compensation structure for all employee categories,
including fixed and variable components. Performance of all the executives below Board level up to E7 grade is
assessed through a balanced Score Card based Performance Management System (PMS) called 'Performance
Report for Individual Development of Executives’ (PRIDE). The performance of E8 and above grade executives
is assessed through a PAR-based system governed by DPE guidelines. The performance of all executives is
assessed based on PMS, in which all the short-term and long-term targets are assigned through mutual
discussions. Based on the account, a variable component pay called performance-related pay (PRP) is being
given every year to all the executives at the Board level and below. In FY 21-22, 100% of employees
underwent a performance appraisal process. During the financial year 2021-22,

Given the exorbitant expense of the treatment, an employee like Satish could not afford to purchase an
injection at such a high rate. CIL management opted to cover the entire cost of the injection, which had to be
imported, due to the situation and the urgency of the therapy required.
Coal India Limited (CIL) established an exceptional example for other PSUs
and organizations who believe that their actual wealth is their people's
resources and their families and that saving their lives at all costs is the first
and foremost job.
SECL, a subsidiary of CIL, covered the entire cost of INR 16 Crore for treating
a two-year-old child of one of its coal miners suffering from Spinal Muscular
Atrophy, a rare ailment (SMA). Srishti Rani, the daughter of Satish Kumar
Ravi, an overman working in the Dipka Area, had SMA, a genetic condition.
A person suffering from SMA loses control of muscle movement due to the
loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem. Srishti has prescribed
the Zolgensma injection, which costs INR 16 Crore. She was last treated
at AIIMS, Delhi.
Anti Sexual Harassment
The executives of CIL are covered under CDA Rules for Anti Sexual Harassment and the staff adheres to the
standing order of the Government of India for Anti Sexual Harassment. Any instances of such actions are
reported to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) set up at every subsidiary and office of CIL to redress
complaints regarding sexual harassment. All women employees (permanent, contractual, temporary, trainees)
are covered under this policy. During the reporting year FY2021-22, no sexual harassment complaint was
reported.

Occupational Health and Safety
Our employees' health and safety is of utmost importance to us. We encourage our employees to observe all
safety rules & practices and notify potential health & safety hazards in the work environment. We are dedicated
to maintain a productive workplace by minimizing the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health risks. All
employees and contractors demonstrate commitment to safety in their everyday behaviors and decisions. We
ensure that all operational facilities adhere to health and safety rules and regulations. As a first step towards our
commitment, we have framed a well-defined safety policy. We have established a multi-disciplinary internal
safety organization (ISO) in all subsidiaries to implement the same. The Safety Head reviews the policies and
practices pertaining to workplace safety regularly. Each of our operational units monitors the major & minor
incidents, including near-misses and corrective & preventive actions about health and safety. Employees
undergo initial and periodic fire prevention and management training and drills with the operational areas to
enhance their safety consciousness and emergency responses. CIL maintains a well-established Rescue
Organization at strategic locations spreading across different Subsidiaries to cater to emergencies on a 24X7
basis.

Safety at Workplace
During 2021-22 in a testimony of CIL’s commitment to safety, lowest number of fatalities were reported since the
company’s inception. 24 no. of fatalities (14 departmental employees and 10 Contractual Workers) were reported in
various incidents during FY2021-22. However, CIL is cognizant that each life is valuable and it pursues safety with all
the importance that it deserves.
In each instance a thorough investigation is conducted to identify the safety lapses and share lessons learned across
our operations to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.
A thorough investigation was conducted for all the reported incidents across the various mine locations to identify the
safety lapses and share lessons learned across our operations to prevent a repeat of similar incidents.
In FY 2021-22, CIL recorded 152 operational injuries, a decrease of 4.4% from 159 in FY 2020-21. Although we saw an
increase of 11.9% in recordable work-related injuries, we managed to reduce the serious work-related injuries by
22.6% year on year. Our total Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) ) decreased by 10.7% to 0.25 (FY 2020-21: 0.28).
At the same time, our total recordable injury frequency rate (TRCFR) also decreased by 17% to 0.29 (FY 2020-21: 0.35).
This decrease in numbers signifies a year-on-year improvement in our safety standards and our strong emphasis on the
safety and security of our employees.
Various initiatives are taken continuously at all levels to translate the vision of “Zero Harm Potential (ZHP)” into a
reality. Few of the measures implemented at the site include developing a code of practice for HEMM Operators,
Maintenance Crew & others, implementation of eco-friendly surface miners for blast-free mining and avoidance of
associated risks, installation of Automatic Fire Detection & Suppression System (AFDSS), installation of indigenous built
solar power based real-time dump monitoring device and slope stability radar for giving early warning in case of
movement slopes of mine and OB dump and GPS based Operator Independent Truck Dispatch System (OITDS) in large
OCPs for tracking movement of HEMMs inside OC mine.
Apart from key initiatives, we also undertake measures to prevent accidents, work-related illnesses and occupational
diseases. Accident investigation, emergency response, ergonomics, hazard identification and risk assessment, wellness
and continual workplace inspections are core aspects of our safety program. Our operational locations underwent
regular external and internal safety audits during the reporting period. Adequate funds have been allocated for safety
which does not suffer for want of funds. CIL, in FY 22, has spent over INR 48.66 Crore for safety precautionary
measures and safety preparedness.
In line with our policy of compassionate employment for employees who passed away before retirement, CIL has
provided jobs to 2174 dependents' family members, including 14 dependents of the employees who lost life in mine-
related accidents. Special relief (ex-gratia) of Rupees Fifteen Lakh has also been provided to the families of employees,
including contractual employees who lost life in mine-related accidents. The special ex-gratia was
in addition to
statutory compensation.

Learning and Development
Learning and development are an integral part of our business culture. Our highly competent and productive
workforce is one of our most significant assets. Therefore, we significantly invest in training our employees to
equip them with the requisite skills and capacity. Our approach to human capital development is in tandem with
the Government of India’s initiatives such as the Skill India Mission and Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission.
The Human Resource Development Department is responsible for identifying the training needs and conducting
training sessions. Our training programs range from classroom sessions to online learnings and external training
and focus on leadership development, health & safety, mine safety, ERP management, new-hire training,
functional training, refresher training and knowledge transfer. We believe in creating an engaged workforce
capable of excelling in their current roles and equipping them with skills for future roles.
Our primary objective is to develop leadership skills linked to our business strategy and priorities among all
employees. Our operational managers have the skills to engage with their teams and motivate individuals to
perform at their best.
In the reporting period, the average training hours per Employee (executives and non-executives) was 16.95
hours. Thirty-four thousand four hundred twenty-seven contract employees were trained on different need-
based skills.

In FY22, we invested in learning and development, focusing on Environment Health & Safety (EHS), leadership
and technical and personal skills. For the second year in a row due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a
decrease in several training imparted. However, we recorded an increase of 24% or 3.25 hours worth of training
per employee though we lagged behind in our average per employee training hours due to the pandemic
situation. We continue to monitor the improving COVID-19 situation in India and follow the various guidelines
issued by the Government of India in this regard. We at CIL believe continuous learning and development of
employees will support the business strategy, providing employees with the necessary skills, knowledge and
behaviours to meet the business objectives.
In addition to in-house training, employees were trained at reputed training institutes, mainly through virtual
mode, within the country in their respective operations fields to supplement in-house training efforts. During
2021-22, 61,268 employees were trained in-house; out of this, 13,292 were executives and 47,976 were
non-executives. In addition, 3,240 employees were sent outside for training, of which 3101 were executives
and 139 were non-executives. During the FY 21-22, more than 5,26,755 training person-days were achieved
for executives and non-executives, an increase of 18% from the previous FY that stood at 4,43,084 training
person-days. Only three foreign training were conducted in FY 21-22 due to Government restrictions.

Engaging with Communities
Corporate Social Responsibility as an instrument of societal
service assumes greater importance in Coal India than it
does for any other Corporate. Unlike other industries mining
sector
is
always
on
the
move.
Land
acquisition,
displacement, rehabilitation and resettlement are necessary
and eternal processes in coal mines. Considering such
events, CIL keeps interacting with the community offering
their land for their country’s energy needs.
The focus of CSR activities in CIL's subsidiaries is on the
areas that fall within a radius of 25 km (in and around the
mines/project sites). The CSR interventions are decided
based on detailed discussions with the community and
their local leaders or representatives or the district
authorities and the need assessment of the community’s
requirements.
The
CSR
initiatives
of
Coal
India
emphasize
the
community’s most vulnerable members and aim to
increase their ability, knowledge and sense of action to
make decisions that will benefit them economically,
environmentally and socially. Moreover, requests from
public representatives or the district authorities are taken
into consideration for areas that need some development
intervention.
CIL and its subsidiaries focus mainly on basic infrastructure
services such as Healthcare, Education, Sanitation, Water
Supply, etc., in peripheral areas. This helps provide a
conducive environment for the local people to become
productive members of the economy.
The community around the mining area is primarily
rural and around the head offices of CIL and our
subsidiaries are predominantly urban. The primary
needs of these communities include resources, health,
education and other basic amenities. Still, the main
challenge is that the infrastructure and the socio-
economic development are not up to the desired levels.
Mining activities of any kind impact the community’s
surroundings in a particular manner, which applies to
CIL’s coal mining activities too. However, CIL, through
its various policies such as Welfare, Rehabilitation, CSR
and environmental initiatives, tries to minimize this
effect on the local communities and the surrounding
ecosystem.
Mining
is
commenced
only
after
ascertaining its impact on the community and social
fabric. Efforts are made to mitigate the harmful
impacts of mining. CSR is one of the tools to provide a
more significant share of benefits to the local
community from the revenue generated by mining
activities. Impact assessment of CSR projects is also
undertaken to measure their effectiveness in meeting
the community’s needs and to better align CSR
strategy to the company's mission and vision.
CIL focuses on sustainable development and aims to
achieve the following Sustainable Development Goals
through its CSR activities.

CIL's healing touch for a new life:
Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes a
body to have less hemoglobin than normal. It is a rare
burdensome disease requiring lifelong repeated blood
transfusion and other expensive medical interventions
for survival. Aplastic Anemia is a condition that occurs
when the body stops producing enough new blood cells.
It is estimated that more than
10,000 Thalassemia
children are born annually in India. Similarly, 9400 people
are diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia every year. These
diseases pose an emotional, psychological and economic
burden on the affected families, especially those from
rural
and
poor
backgrounds,
besides
placing
a
tremendous burden on healthcare services.
Hematopoietic Stem
Cell
Transplantation (HSCT),
a
permanent cure for these ailments lies in Stem Cell
Transplants, also known as Bone Marrow Transplantation
(BMT). Further, it is found that the treatment is more
successful if BMT is done at an early age.
Considering the challenges stated above, Coal India Limited has come up with the unique CSR initiative
“Thalassemia Bal Sewa Yojana” of supporting the treatment of children affected by these two diseases. The
overall guidance for the scheme is provided by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India.
CIL is the first PSU to take up such a unique CSR project which supports the curative treatment of orphan
genetic diseases like Thalassemia & Aplastic Anemia. Under the project, assistance up to INR 10 Lakh is
provided for Bone Marrow transplants on eligible patients in nine prominent hospitals across the country.
Till now, more than 192 successful transplants have been done.
We have eligibility criteria, where every request is reviewed based on age, family income and matching 
donor. For thalassemia patients, the age and family income has been capped at  12 years and  Rs 5 lakh per 
annum respectively. On the other hand, Aplastic Anemia patient’s age has been capped at 18 years old with a 
family income of  Rs 8 lakh per annum. In both cases, Aplastic Anemia & Thalassemia, the donor must be a 
related person. 
There are specific other clinical requirements for the transfusion that the doctors and medical departments 
have laid down to ensure the safety and health of the donor & patient. The following are the clinical 
requirements: 
For Thalassemia:
•
Patient should have transfusion-dependent Thalassemia
•
Patient should have 100% HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) matched related donor.
•
Such patients must be other than Class III B patients, liver size of the patient to be less than 5 cms below 
the coastal margin.

One cluster in each identified district has been established, covering various villages 10-15 km from the
cluster office. Each cluster has five cattle development centers and one center entrusted with other
activities. Families in 40 villages in Angul, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur and Sundargarh have benefited from the
programs. Now, these rural households have long-term livelihood options to improve their economic
condition.
CCDP – Utthan was established to provide opportunities for gainful self-employment for poor rural
families, particularly the most vulnerable and to ensure their long-term survival. Various sectors,
including cattle breeding, goat breeding, poultry farming, capacity building and agriculture, were
identified and studied for their relevance to tribal people. Based on the findings of the foundational work,
a broad scope of work was developed around the identified sectors for community upliftment.

Community Marriages
Dhuku, or living together, is a standard practice in the Khunti district and several other districts across
Jharkhand. Both men and women enjoy equal rights in tribal societies, including the opportunity to
choose a life mate. A woman can have a live-in relationship (known as a Dhuku marriage) with her male
partner without getting married. A complicated network of socio-legal-economic pressure forces many
destitute tribal women with little or no education to live with their male partners and give birth to
children outside marriage. Due to a lack of societal acknowledgement of their relationship, these women
(known as Dhukni in Jharkhand) generally lack legal rights to property and other assets.
Dhuku marriage is forced, not voluntary and tribals have been denied fundamental social recognition and
respect for decades due to poverty. Taking the view of this CIL and its Ranchi-based subsidiary, the
Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), NGO Nimitta and various district administrations
organized community marriages for couples living together under the Dhuku custom, with 263 couples
marrying according to their religious traditions.
There have been occasions where a family's three generations were never married because they lacked
the financial means to marry and give a village feast. The villagers forbid a grandson's marriage since his
grandfather refused to give a wedding feast and instead chose to enter a live-in relationship.
Impact:
We at Coal India sincerely believe economic deprivation is the root cause of social discrimination. We
expect this small contribution to bring meaningful changes in the lives of women covered under the
project. The intervention does not end with marriage; in collaboration with Nimitta, CIL is also working
on programs to provide skill training to the couples to enable their economic empowerment.

Paschim Bardhaman district is a predominantly urban mining-industrial district in West Bengal. The district's
headquarters is Asansol and falls within the command area of ECL. As a socially responsible corporate, ECL, a
CIL subsidiary, through this initiative in the district, has made a positive impact by enhancing the safety of
the villagers, especially women and children residing in the adjoining villages. The project is one of the
largest high-investment, high-impact rural development projects of CIL under CSR. Eastern Coalfields Limited
is always committed to delivering sustainable CSR projects to bring a better outcome to the nearby society
and environment. Recently, the Company has undertaken various sustainable CSR projects at its nearby
localities.
127 Villager 
Covered
Before undertaking the CSR project, a need assessment
study
was
conducted
at
127
villages
with
the
consultation of local administration. In the study, it was
found that there are no provisions for streetlights in
these villages. Snake Bites, Theft and anti-social
activities were common in the streets of these villages.
It was difficult for women and children to access the
road during evening hours. The need was further
endorsed by the request letter received from the Gram
Panchayats to ECL for illuminating the roads through
the installation of streetlights.
The said CSR initiative has covered 127 villages in West Bengal's Paschim Bardhaman District, with
approximately 2518 solar streetlights installed. We have gone one step further and considered the budget
for the upkeep of the installed streetlights. The total project cost, including the maintenance plan, is
estimated to be INR 3.12 Crore.
The streetlight project illuminated the village roads, increasing working hours for daily wage earners,
providing safety for women and children, lowering the percentage of road accidents at night, especially
during rainy seasons and reaping various other benefits. Installing streetlights has increased trade and
commerce in the community, as shopkeepers are now open until late. Theft and anti-social behaviour are
now less prevalent than when the streets were dark.
More villages are being identified and the project is being replicated so that such rural development
initiatives can also benefit remote villages near the ECL mine.

The ‘Singrauli Women Small Holders Poultry Project’ is a poultry farm project in which 584 units of poultry farms
have been established as one entity, i.e., Singrauli Women Poultry Producers Company Limited. Each unit is
attached to a family the headwomen owns and takes care of the poultry farm for chicken production. This
project has enabled each unit to produce approximately 500 chickens every month with earnings of INR 3000-
INR 3500 per month.
Presently 584 units have been constructed, while 166 beneficiaries have been identified for inclusion. It is
operational in 16 villages of Singrauli district namely: Dummatola, Kanhud, Bachnar, Laliyabodar, Viktha,
Bagaiyya, Ajgudh, Birkuniya, Thengarwa,
Barihwa, Mainihwa,
Gwardehi, Sirgudi, Supakoni, badgad and
Rahrethwa. The project is self-sustainable and does not require any outside financial support for the business's
operation.
Impact of the Project:
i.
Beneficiary can earn at least INR 36000.00
to INR
42000.00 per annum depending on the number of
chickens, weight of the chickens, etc., which will
enhance their standard of living.
ii.
Earlier, most of the time the beneficiary women were
consumed in wood picking/cutting in the nearby forest,
which provided meagre and irregular income. Now,
these women can devote more time to household work
and caring for children and provide better health and
educational facilities to their family members.
iii.
It has empowered the tribe women by making them
self-reliant as they become the owners of these poultry
farms.
iv.
Inspired by women's hard work, male family members
have also started contributing to family upliftment and
many have also left the habit of drinking.
v.
After the completion of the project, the women
beneficiaries have gained confidence and are more
competent to support their family needs.
vi.
More and more families of the communities are
interested in joining this project after seeing the
beneficiary families' lifestyle change.
vii.
The community is aware of the benefits of regular
employment and is also trying to get such benefits by
trying other means of employment.

Research & Development
The Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coal India
Limited (CIL) acts as the Nodal agency for coordination of research activities in CIL . In 1972, a collaborative
study group with Polish professionals created and presented CMPDI as a comprehensive planning set-up
under one roof for the whole Indian mining industry, which was then functioning on a rudimentary
planning system. This was also when the Indian coal industry was nationalized to support the high
expansion of the energy sector essential for the country's rapid industrial growth in the future years. On
1st November 1975, CMAL was merged to form Coal India Limited and CMPDI attained the status of a
public limited company under CIL with a declared scope of its business under its Memorandum of
Association broadly in line with its original proposal.
The Government of India, through its Coal Science & Technology (S&T) Plan and Coal India Limited (CIL),
through its R&D Board, have been promoting R&D activities in the coal and lignite sectors for improvement
in production, productivity, safety, quality, coal beneficiation & utilization, environmental & ecological
protection, clean coal technology, waste to wealth, innovation and indigenization (under the Make in India
concept) and allied fields. The Ministry of Coal and the CIL R&D Board spent significant money each year to
research the above topics.
The R&D projects are covered under five thematic areas viz. improvement in production, productivity &
safety in coal mines, coal beneficiation, coal utilization, protection of environment & ecology and clean
coal technology. The role of CMPDI involves in identification of ‘Thrust Areas’ for research activities,
identification of agencies that can take up the research work in the identified fields, processing the
proposals for Government approval, preparation of budget estimates, disbursement of the fund,
monitoring the progress & implementation of the projects, etc.
During its meeting on March 24, 2008, the CIL Board entrusted extensive powers to the CIL R&D Board and
the R&D Board's Apex Committee to strengthen CIL's R&D basis in command areas. The Apex Committee
has the authority to sanction individual R&D projects up to a value of INR 5.0 Crore with a limit of INR 25.0
Crore per annum when all projects are considered together. In contrast, the CIL R&D Board has the
authority to approve individual R&D projects up to INR 50 Crore.
Eight research projects have been completed in FY 21-22, whereas several other projects continue to be
worked upon. INR 38.74 Crore was spent on various research and development projects.

Rehabilitation and Resettlement 
Coal mining is based on geographical factors and is site-specific. By this aspect, it involves the acquisition of
large tracts of land, which leads to the involuntary displacement of inhabitants (Project Affected People –
PAPs) who are native/residents of the area. Our rehabilitation strategy outlines the requirements for our open-
cut operations to integrate rehabilitation into their planning processes. The CIL`s R&R Policy 2012 guides how
to implement the rehabilitation by setting out in greater detail our expectations about concurrent
rehabilitation. Our compensation plan is accorded as per CIL’s R&R Policy-2012 and is in line with the statutory
requirement.
The CIL`s R&R Policy 2012 is designed to be integrated into our crucial business planning processes – Resource
Development Plans, Life of Asset Planning and the Sustainable Mining Plan – to reduce our disturbance
footprint and generate value for us and our stakeholders. Our robust R&R policy provides greater flexibility in
resetting and rehabilitating coal mining projects.
We require operations to develop and implement five-year rehabilitation plans that outline targets,
monitoring, maintenance and management programs to drive towards relinquishment. Additionally, we
include rehabilitation performance – reshaping and seeding completion against targets – as a performance
measure on the chief executive’s technology and sustainability scorecards. In line with our commitment to the
various displaced people, 1545 land oustees were employed at CIL during FY 2021-22.

Looking forward
Strategic focus of the Company
Coal India’s future is sound and secure for next three decades, at least, with coal continuing to be the country’s main
engine of growth in the energy sector. Beyond that, coal’s percentage share in the energy basket may shrink with
renewables and cleaner energy sources making inroads but in volume terms coal’s contribution will be higher.
The ever-expanding demand for energy, as we are currently witnessing globally, brings to the fore the importance of
coal. Many countries which have migrated away coal are relooking to trace back their path toward coal.
In India, CIL will continue to retain its pivotal role due to coal’s abundance, availability and affordability. Expunging an
energy fuel from the system that meets around 55% of the primary commercial energy requirement of the country
without alternative options, may upset the entire energy balance. It has to be a just transition - from fossil fuel to new
and renewables.
However, CIL is keen on commitment in minimizing the carbon footprint of its operations and taking care of
environment. The company would also continue to fulfill societal aspirations through its CSR initiatives. In an effort to
become a net zero entity CIL is aiming at installing 3,000 MW Solar Projects by FY 24. Work orders for 240 MW have
been awarded in FY’22. These would be scaled up sizably in the coming years.
Adoption of environment-friendly technologies, increased mechanization of operations, diversification into clean coal
technologies, and improvement in safety standards would remain the focus areas.
Adapting digitization and automation of processes is not a choice but a need to compete in the market, increase
transparency, and cut down operational costs. In CIL, we look at digitization across three verticals – capital equipment,
supply chain, and operations. We are going in for fully automated and environment-friendly coal loading by setting up
Coal Handling Plants and Silos. CIL has implemented a host of digital initiatives to make internal processes IT driven.
CIL looks forward to retain its energy leadership through increased production, quantitative and qualitative supplies, at
the same time, being a socially and environmentally responsible corporate citizen.
