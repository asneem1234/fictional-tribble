5. Specific commitments, goals and targets set by the entity 
with defined timelines, if any.
DBSIL is committed to develop a strategy to move forward towards 
becoming water positive and improving the soil carbon content. 
Currently, half of the land in our catchment area has low Organic 
Carbon content (< 0.5%). We aim to increase and maintain the soil 
Organic Carbon in medium range (0.5% - 0.75% ) by 2030. We aim 
to increase soil carbon content through use of recommended 
doses of organic manures / compost and Intervention through 
animal husbandry programme for domestic animals. We also plan 
to use green manure crops, do crop rotation and no crop residue 
burning to be done by us.
The water table in our catchment area in UP has depleted by 2 
meters in last 10 years. To address this concern, we aim to become 
10x water positive by 2025.To ensure this we will work with 2 lakh 
sugarcane cultivators in reducing their annual Ground water 
consumption by 500 KL per Ha by 2030 which has a potential of 
annual conservation of 25 billion litres.
Soil carbon content and Water are the two most critical elements 
for Sustainable Sugarcane Cultivation. By addressing both the 
critical elements DBSIL is also ensuring sustainable livelihood and 
income for the farmers.
6. Performance of the entity against the specific commitments, 
goals and targets along-with reasons in case the same are not

environment, we ensure responsibility and commitment towards 
the needs of society by creating, maintaining and ensuring a safe

business ecosystem. Our approach to sustainability is earmarked 
by the efforts that we carry out under different aspects of 
water conservation, energy use reduction, resource efficiency, 
waste minimization, impacting lives and conducting business 
responsibly.
Keeping Sustainability as the main driving force, we have 
identified 34 material aspects which are categorized under our 
sustainability pillars of responsible consumption, responsible 
growth & business ethics, sustainable farming practices and 
empowering people. We have identified our material topics 
under each of our pillars and have derived short, medium and 
long terms goals for each of them ensuring full coverage of all ESG 
related aspects. We have a sustainability policy that spells out the 
company’s philosophy towards the sustainability commitments 
and lays down the approach to manage environmental, social 
and governance aspects guidelines, framework and mechanism 
for effective planning, implementation and monitoring of our 
sustainability initiatives.
We have also identified our ESG policy requirements and are 
working progressively towards developing our ESG policy with 
the main focus to ensure sustainable sugarcane production which 
creates value for farmers and the community while sustaining 
the business ecosystem. We are also in process of developing 
continuous performance monitoring mechanism for all aspects

9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.
Our environment component ensures that we consume environmentally responsible resources, utilise an optimal quantum of finite 
fossil fuels, recycle waste, moderate our carbon footprint and build resistance to climate change.
We ensure that raw material is efficiently converted into products. Our distilleries and co-generation business units generate additional 
revenue while adding value to by-products from the sugar production process. We ensure bio-composting at our distilleries from 
the waste generated after juice extraction from sugarcane. This bio-compost is a soil-friendly manure provided to farmers. Press-mud 
is converted to compost and sold to farmers for agricultural purposes. The hazardous waste generated at our plants is disposed in 
accordance with statutory requirements. Non-hazardous waste consists of polypropylene bags used in packaging and plastic containers, 
disposed through authorised recyclers.
There are multiple waste management strategies adopted at DBSIL to ensure the waste is being managed adequately. Following are the 
practices adopted at DBSIL-
Zero Liquid Discharge-
	
100 % treatment of effluent as per statutory requirement
	
Maximum recycling
	
90% reduction in ground water widrawl per ton of product
	
100% reuse
Zero Waste Approach-
	
Reduction in packaging material
	
Bulk transportation wherever feasible
	
Compliance of EPR
Waste to Wealth-
	
Creating various project for waste conversion into usable product like; Ash brick, Bio manure and generation of bio CNG
	
Rich potash based manure generated and distributed amongs the farmers.
Change in process-

In terms of the Companies (Corpoate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014, as amended from time to time, every company having 
average CSR obligation of ten crore rupees or more in pursuance of subsection (5) of section 135 of the Act, in the three immediately 
preceding financial years, needs to undertake impact assessment, through an independent agency, of their CSR projects having outlays 
of one crore rupees or more, and which have been completed not less than one year before undertaking the impact study. Such impact 
assessment reports needs to be placed before the Board and shall be annexed to the annual report on CSR.
Accordingly, impact assessment through independent agency is not applicable on the Company. However, we do internally undertake 
impact assessment of our initiatives and also take regular community feedback for our projects. We had recently engaged Ernst & Young 
for undertaking an impact assessment on a voluntary basis of our projects in livelihood through DIKSHa (Dalmia Institute for Skills and 
Knowledge Harnessing) centres and the climate action vertical on water related initiatives.

All plants of the Company are proximate to the cane growing area. Almost all the raw materials are procured sustainably. Since the raw 
materials are procured from sources close to the units, it enables the Company to minimize transportation costs. A significant proportion 
of the cane is supplied by small and medium-scale farmers through bullock-driven carts due to the distance, reducing pollution.
The Company strives to procure materials and services from local suppliers. Majority of the sugarcane is purchased from local 
farmers (including small and medium scale-farmers) based in the units allotted to the respective areas by the Cane Commissioner. 
All transportation services and stationery items, printing materials, electrical goods, sanitizers and civil items are procured from local 
markets.
