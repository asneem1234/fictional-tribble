Occupational 
health 
and safety
Risk
Managing safety and health is an inherent risk and an 
integral part of managing a business. Businesses need 
to do a risk assessment to find out about the hazards 
and risks in their workplace and put measures in place to 
effectively control them.
Company is further strengthening its health 
and safety protocol. The Company has been 
accredited and certified for ISO 14001:2015 
(Environmental Management System) and 
ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health & 
Safety Management System) for one of its

Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
Opportunity Increasing number of regulations focused on GHG-
emission management, incentives for energy efficiency 
and renewable energy—are promoting a transition from 
conventional electricity sources to alternative sources.
All the manufacturing sites are aligned to ISO 50001 and 
has renewable energy portfolio of 2.8 MW (Wind + Solar). 
The renewable energy generated contributes to 7.2% of 
total electricity needs and helps organization in avoiding 
2079 tCO2e in FY22. And on regular basis organization is 
implementing various energy saving initiatives to reduce 
the energy consumption and emission footprint.
-
Positive
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Opportunity Water is a scarce resource, and its management is 
the activity of planning, developing, distributing, and 
managing it with optimum usage. Availability of water 
and its use has an impact on Environment and Society.
GMM Pfaudler’ s operational areas don’t fall under water 
stress zones and they strictly follow the standards set 
by pollution control board. The Company installed STPs 
across its manufacturing facilities to treat and reuse the 
wastewater generated in the process, thereby reducing 
the impact on freshwater requirements.
Positive
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste minimization coupled with reuse and recycling 
is important for conservation of resources. There must 
be efficient processes for segregation, collection, 
and disposal of waste. In view of growing landfills and 
dumpsites that further impacts air, soil and water, waste 
management policies have become critical as it would 
ensure proper reuse, recycle and disposal.
GMM Pfaudler have undertaken measures to
reduce waste generation at every stage 
of the manufacturing cycle and generate 
minimal quantities of waste. The waste 
generated is sent to TSDF (Transport, 
Storage and Disposal Facility) for disposal 
to ensure compliance with all the legal 
requirements and without any adverse 
impacts on the natural environment and the 
Company prohibits usage of single-use, non-
biodegradable plastics within our premises.

products, processes and technologies. Suppliers shall ensure the safe and compliant handling, storage, 
transportation, disposal, recycling, reuse and management of waste, air emissions and wastewater

The company did not calculate this data for the financial year 2021-22. This data will be available from the 
next financial year.
3.	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Given the nature of our business, the products we manufacture has a life of 10-15 years. After the end of the 
life the customer may give the metal & glass scrap to the authorized recycler. From a broader perspective 
the end-of-life related waste from our products will be recycled and then used as raw material for other 
processes or products.
	
The Company’s manufactures capital equipment, which does not lend itself to recycling. However, the 
Company offers reconditioning service to ensure that the equipment works smoothly during the life of the 
equipment. All waste that has no commercial value is disposed of through agencies authorized by the 
State and Central Pollution Control Boards. The steel scrap is sold to dealers who in turn further process 
the scrap for steel manufacture. Water used for hydro-testing is recycled and stored in large tanks. The 
Sewage from the plant is treated in Sewage Treatment Plants and the water from the plants is used for 
gardening. The Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) has been installed in the Factory, which purifies 80,000 liters 
of water and is then used for maintaining 5,000 sq. mtrs. greenfield area. This STP is tested by the Gujarat 
State Pollution Control Board (GPCB) on a monthly basis. During the year, the Company has installed two 
Rainwater Harvesting Wells having the capacity of 40 KL & 65 KL to improve ground water level. Single use 
and non-biodegradable plastic are banned within the premises. The Company hands over its waste to a 
Common Transport Storage and Disposal Facility to ensure waste disposal is in accordance with the GPCB 
guidelines. Hence, the Company has been strictly following the guidelines stipulated under the Pollution 
Control Act and alert about the proper disposal of industrial waste without harming the environment and 
people.
4.	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes,
