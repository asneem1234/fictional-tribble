This cover ‘Committed to Grow Responsibly’, 
represents a micro view of a standalone entity 
that acts and will aggregate and circle up to the 
overarching goal of ‘Being Responsive and Being 
Responsible’ of the Group theme. The visual is of a 
pair of experienced hands, that have seen the test 
of time and understands the nuances of sowing the 
seeds with utmost care to reap its benefits later, a 
man planting a tree and being responsible for its 
growth is symbolic of its role as one of the most 
diversified and leading NBFCs in the Indian market 
and yet undeterred to charter newer territories for 
future organic growth but in a thought through 
manner and not abruptly.

ESG initiatives
Statutory reporting
In today’s ever-changing world, ESG is a gateway to new 
frontiers of transformation. The transition from individual 
to community has prompted businesses to reconsider their 
business strategies, and the core of these strategies revolve 
around innovation, awareness, and sustainable processes. 
Hence, ESG has become the foundation of our sustainable 
and long-term growth charter. 
Guided by the philanthropic spirit of Shri Jamnalalji Bajaj, 
our Group’s founding father, and strengthened by the 
legacy of our Chairman Emeritus, Late Rahul Bajaj, this 
all-encompassing new value system has motivated us to 
enhance the legacy of inclusive growth. We have mapped 
our business responsibility strategy towards the realisation 
of this vision, that inspires us to grow responsibly and 
commit towards effectively implementing our ESG goals.
We have embarked on a journey where the nation’s 
sustainable development and its people’s comprehensive 
growth is a big part of our responsibility framework. We 
remain committed to positively impacting the lives of our 
consumers and the community at large. As an organisation, 
we have been leveraging the boon of digital technologies 
to simplify and deliver easily accessible, affordable and

comprehensive financial services solutions to all segments 
of society. And, we continue to focus on balancing our goals 
of sustainable profitability and long-term value creation with 
our overarching commitment to responsible growth, as an 
organisation and as a responsible corporate citizen. 
As a company, our constant endeavour is to identify and 
invest in areas that will help deliver a sustainable future for 
our consumers and the society at large. For instance, first-
time borrowers and women borrowers is one such area that 
leads to inclusive development of the society and brings 
forth newer growth opportunities for the nation. 
We remain committed to simplify financial services for all 
our consumers by bridging the gap between their emerging 
financial needs and making financial services available 
through our various omni-channel options. This also aligns 
with our vision of becoming an omnipresent financial 
services company. 
In FY2022, we took big, bold steps to enhance our 
customer experience by forming teams to analyse root 
cause of customer concerns and create  solutions to solve 
their problems. As a proactive measure, we constituted 
a Customer Service Committee of the Board with a view 
to enhance customer experience, engagement, and 
monitoring of service processes.
We understand the critical need of  driving consumer 
awareness programmes to help them better understand 
financial products and services, and not be exposed to any 
kind of vulnerability, online or offline. Our ‘Savdhaan Rahein. 
Safe Rahein.’ campaign which started off as a proactive and 
preventive digital initiative in FY2021 has grown by leaps 
and bounds to spread awareness on various vulnerabilities 
which consumers may be exposed to. 
We also understand the growing expectations of our 
consumers to access financial services in a personalised, 
intuitive and frictionless manner. We are deeply committed 
to make financial services easier and accessible for all our 
consumers, anytime anywhere. This aptly ties into our 
broader strategy of becoming an omnipresent financial 
services company to engage, transact and be serviced 
anytime, anywhere, across channels in a frictionless 
manner. 
Our rural financial services initiative, which aims to bring 
the country’s unbanked and under banked segments into 
the fold of organised financial services is well aligned to 
our focus of financial inclusion for all. To enhance local 
capabilities and create a virtuous economic cycle in 
small towns and villages of India, we helped generate 
employment opportunities across the length and breadth 
of the country in FY2022. Towards that, even in a COVID-19 
year, we added 516 new locations and increased our 
employee strength from 28,546 to 35,425. 
We are focused on providing equal opportunities for the 
learning and development needs of all our employees in 
a non-discriminatory manner, and remain committed to 
conducting our business with the highest standards of 
integrity, going beyond the regulatory and legal necessities, 
and yet delivering sustainable and long-term value for all 
our stakeholders.
We, as an organisation, are more resolute than ever, 
to embed our ESG priorities into the DNA of our core 
operations across people, practices and processes because 
real sustainability for us lies in staying committed to 
responsible growth for all, for now and tomorrow.

Governance 
Ensuring Responsible Growth 
through Robust Corporate 
Governance
At BFL, we believe integrity and 
ethical behaviour to be at the 
heart of a successful business. 
We have built the foundations of 
the organisation on these timeless 
principles. As a part of the Bajaj 
Group, whose roots go back to 
India’s freedom struggle, we are 
imbued with its philosophy. The Bajaj 
Group’s commitment to the highest 
standards of corporate governance 
practices predates the provisions 
of the SEBI Listing Regulations and 
Clause 49 of the erstwhile Listing 
Agreement. 
This is the representative image of our DNA - Code 
of Ethics and Personal Conduct
Details of Our ESG 
Initiatives
ESG initiatives
Statutory reporting
We strive to combine the Bajaj Group’s 
historical values with modern best-
in-class business practices. Led by 
the Bajaj Group’s ethos, BFL is imbued 
with the values of ethics, transparency, 
accountability and responsible 
business conduct. We committedly 
practice these values in our day-to-
day operations. We strive proactively 
to adopt the highest standards of 
corporate governance, while adhering 
to all regulatory guidelines with 
transparent disclosures about our 
performance and business.
Pursuing a Philosophy 
Rooted in Ethics:
	A key driver of our corporate 
governance philosophy is our focus 
on ethics. Our Board approved “Code 
of Ethics and Personal Conduct” 
(CoEPC) encompasses a good 
working culture and integrity norms. 
It includes ‘disciplinary action policy’ 
and ‘whistle blower policy’, enabling 
its directors, employees, business/
vendor partners, their employees 
or any other person including 
contractors, sub-contractors, 
consultants and any other third 
party to escalate grievances of any 
nature, including harassment, fraud, 
unethical behaviour and process/ 
policy violation to the designated 
personnel in the Company and its 
subsidiaries. 
	To ensure continuous monitoring 
of such ethical behaviour, we 
have constituted a ‘Disciplinary 
Action Committee’ (DAC), which 
reports substantial incidents to the 
Managing Director (MD)  periodically. 
Among the important tenets of 
our CoEPC, are our unwavering 
commitment to health, safety 
and environment, along with 
focus on elimination of waste and 
conservation of resources, with zero 
tolerance towards non-compliance.
	For adherence to ethical norms and 
behaviour by the top leadership, we 
have a separate Code of Conduct 
(CoC) for Directors and Senior 
Management. The CoC provides that 
‘Directors and Senior Management 
shall observe the highest standards 
of ethical conduct and integrity 
and shall work to the best of their 
ability and judgement’. A declaration 
from the Directors, and the Senior 
Management’s affirmation to the 
said CoC, is communicated to all 
stakeholders by the MD, through the 
Annual Report.
	BFL and its subsidiaries have 
zero tolerance towards unethical 
business practices. We ensure strict 
compliance of CoEPC with respect 
to anti-bribery, conflict of interest, 
protecting assets and information 
of the Company including customer 
information and necessary policies 
with respect to human rights, 
prevention of insider trading, 
prevention of money laundering, 
prevention of sexual harassment 
at workplace, and related-party 
transactions.
	We ensure complete adherence 
to the Code of Practices and 
Procedures for Fair Disclosure 
of Unpublished Price Sensitive 
Information (UPSI) at BFL and at 
our subsidiaries. Pursuant to SEBI 
(Prohibition of Insider Trading) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended, 
the CoC for regulation of trades 
by designated persons covers all 
concerned employees of BFL, its 
parent company, subsidiaries and 
other group companies. It protects 
an employee against victimisation 
in cases where insider trading is 
reported by him/her. Periodic review 
and updation of the policies is done, 
as required. The Board takes non-
compliance seriously and initiates 
action commensurate with proven 
violations.
	In compliance with the provisions 
of the SEBI Listing Regulations, the 
Board through its Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC) has 
devised a policy on Board Diversity. 
The board comprises of adequate 
number of members with diverse 
experience and skills, such that it 
best serves the governance and 
strategic needs of the Company. The 
present composition broadly meets 
this objective. The directors are 
persons of eminence in areas such 
as profession, business, industry, 
finance, law, administration, 
research, banking, etc. and bring 
with them experience/skills which 
add value to the performance 
of the Board. The directors are 
selected purely based on merit with 
no discrimination on race, colour, 
religion, gender, or nationality. Core 
skills/expertise/competencies of the 
Board is available on the website 
of the Company at https://www.
bajajfinserv.in/finance-board-of-
directors.
The Company, through its Parent 
Company i.e. Bajaj Finserv Limited 
(BFS), has signed charters of 
Confederation of Indian Industry (‘CII’):
i.	 	 Model code of conduct for ethical 
business practices, 
ii.		 Charter on fair and responsible 
workplace guidelines for 
collaborative employee relations, 
and
iii.	 Charter on fair and responsible 
workplace guidelines for contract 
labour.
	During FY2022, all employee 
complaints linked to CoEPC (earlier 
CoC) adherence were suitably 
resolved, except for 4 complaints 
pending as on 31 March 2022, 
however these complaints have 
been suitably resolved subsequently.
Imbued with a Culture of 
Transparency
	At BFL Group, adherence to 
transparency and fairness in 
dealings with customers is 
maintained in letter as well as 
We strive to combine 
the Bajaj Group’s 
historical values with 
modern best-in-class 
business practices.

Other Governance 
Practices
Internal Controls
	We have set up a robust internal 
controls system across all process, 
units and functions which are 
driven by various well-formulated 
procedures and policies that are 
reviewed and tested periodically. Our 
risk and credit teams have in-built 
processes to identify and measure 
the existing and probable risks, 
and to mitigate the identified risks. 
Our various committees, including 
Risk Management Committee and 
the Asset and Liability Committee, 
review and oversee critical aspects 
of the Company’s operations. The 
committees have members from 
various functions.
	Our internal controls mechanism 
consists of three lines of defence:
a.	First Line of Defence - Internal 
Operation Management and 
Management Control.
b.	Second Line of Defence – Risk and 
Compliance function; and
c.	Third Line of Defence - Internal Audit 
function.  
Risk Management
	We believe that the primary role 
of risk management is to protect 
customers, business, human capital, 
shareholders, and the communities 
that it serves, while ensuring support 
towards strategy and paving the 
path for sustainable growth. 
	We use a comprehensive risk 
management framework across the 
organisation and across all risks. 
This outlines the key principles, 
policies, and practices for managing 
material risks, both financial and 
non-financial. The framework fosters 
continual monitoring, promotes risk 
awareness, and encourages sound 
operational and strategic decision 
making. It also ensures a consistent 
approach to identifying, assessing, 
managing, and reporting the risks we 
accept and incur in our activities. 
	At the highest level, the Board 
of Directors have established a 
Risk Management Committee 
(RMC), which assists the Board 
in maintaining oversight and 
implementation of the Risk 
Management policy. The Risk 
Management Policy outlines the 
programme implemented by the 
Company to ensure appropriate risk 
management within its systems 
and culture. This is enabled by 
robust risk measurement and review 
mechanisms, which include monthly 
reviews at senior management level 
and quarterly reviews at a higher 
level. The RMC met six times in 
FY2022.
Debt Management
	BFL actively focuses on a debt 
management strategy to ensure that 
its delinquent debt portfolio is kept 
at minimal levels. It accords debt 
management an important place in 
its portfolio management strategy;  
BFL continues to invest in its debt 
management service structure, 
service organisation, processes, 
training of employees and agencies, 
with strict adherence of compliance 
requirements and controllership by 
leveraging technology to follow a 
non-intrusive collection mechanism. 
We follow a strong governance 
model for debt management 
services’ practices and ensure strict 
adherence to the regulatory and 
internal policies, code of conduct 
and fair practice code.
	In an endeavour to follow non-
intrusive debt management practice, 
BFL collects an electronic clearing 
mandate from its customers. In case 
of dishonour of bank instrument, 
BFL provides customers with over 
22 different payment options, such 
as NEFT, RTGS, Bharat Bill Payment 
Service (BBPS), Unified Payment 
Interface (UPI), CC Avenue, Wallets, 
Google Pay, Payment Banks etc. 
These digital channels, along 
with branch walk-ins, account for 
approximately 51% of our collections 
volume.
Two meetings of ESG 
committee members were 
held during the year and 
a presentation to Board 
of directors of group 
companies was made on 
overall ESG strategy.

Steering Sustainable 
Growth through Prudent 
Business Conduct
	The focus at Bajaj Group is on 
building long-term businesses, while 
ensuring sustainable growth and 
returns for its stakeholders. Aligning 
themselves to this approach, BFL 
and its subsidiaries have also made 
adoption and pursuance of high 
standards of governance, along 
with adoption of prudent business 
practices central to their value 
proposition. They believe such 
practices to be vital to ensuring 
that businesses are not exposed to 
undue risks.
	Drawing from its experience of 
FY2021 and the fact that  lockdowns 
were curtailed in FY2022, the 
Company and its subsidiaries 
remained open for business with 
a nuanced strategy on acquisition 
and underwriting across all its 
businesses throughout the year.
	As a result, BFL recorded a 29% 
growth in AUM (core AUM growth 
is 26%) and 59% growth in profit 
after tax on a consolidated basis 
in FY2022 as against a 4% growth 
in AUM and 16% degrowth in profit 
after tax in FY2021. Return on 
average assets (ROAA) and return on 
average equity (ROAE) for FY2022 
was 4.2% and 17.4% respectively on a 
consolidated basis. This performance 
was despite the continued disruption 
in business and debt management 
services in the first half of the year, 
elevated level of credit costs and 
higher liquidity buffers.
Some of the prudent business 
practices we follow include:
	BFL and its subsidiaries not just 
fulfil but often exceed the applicable 
norms and standards laid down by 
the financial regulator relating to 
the recognition and provisioning 
of non-performing assets, capital 
adequacy, statutory liquidity ratio, 
liquidity coverage ratio, etc. The table 
	We maintain low leverage levels and raise equity capital only upon reaching 6 to 7 times, which is much more conservative 
than the regulatory stipulation. 
	On the back of improved stage-2 assets, gross NPA at 1.60% and net NPA at 0.68%, representing pre-covid metrics and 
strong macro and management overlay provision of ` 1,060 crore, BFL has entered FY2023 with healthy risk metrics.

Lending, (iii) Commercial Lending, (iv) 
Rural Lending, (v) Deposits; and (vi)

Happy Story
A child in Gaudgaon village, was identified as severe underweight as at the 
age of 4 years 7 month, the child’s weight was 11 kg and height 90 cm in 
Sept 2014. As a first step, the parents were counselled about the child’s 
situation, what precautions were required and information on health and 
nutrition. With regular meetings, they were made aware through different 
methods – the ways to combat malnutrition. They were informed about 
nutritious diet and how to pay attention to the care and feeding of the child. 
They were also supported with protein/ vitamins supplements necessary 
for the child followed by parent participation in awareness drives in the 
village. This was followed by regular visits for monitoring and tracking the 
child’s condition. The parents responded positively to the support and as 
a result in the month of October the child came out of severe malnutrition 
and his weight was 14.5 kg and height 92 cm.

Our People Strategies
We are committed to the creation of an 
inclusive workplace for our employees 
and take steps to ensure that these 
commitments are embedded in our 
policies and practices. We always 
seek to provide opportunities to our 
employees to learn, grow and develop 
professionally.  The Company  has 
strategically moved to digital learning 
models; in addition significant number 
of our training are conducted by 
internally certified trainers. This has 
resulted in more relevant and aligned 
training of the employees.
In line with its business transformation 
strategy, the Company has made 
significant changes to its HR policies 
and practices. We along with our 
subsidiaries have adopted a twin 
lens approach in its human resource 
practices: one that caters to the needs 
of its large-distributed employee base 
across its offices, and the second 
which focuses on rapidly scaling its 
talent pool across critical domains, 
such as technology, analytics and data 
science. 
This transformation aims to build 
future-focused, employee-centric 
and technology-enabled practices 
and processes. The core of this 
transformation is structured around 
empowerment of managers to chart 
out the career progression of their 
teams. The manager is enabled and 
empowered with data and technology 
platforms that help him take on this 
responsibility. The HR function takes 
the responsibility of enablement, 
governance and assisting the cultural 
shift.  
COVID-19 created an unprecedented 
health crisis, especially during the 
Delta wave. We at, BFL Group took 
multiple initiatives to ensure the safety 
and well-being of employees and their 
families and extended financial and 
logistical support towards diagnosis 
and treatment. These include a 
dedicated 24x7 helpline to track the 
health of our employees, assistance 
for doctor consultation and financial 
aid.  We committedly focused on the 
safety of our employees by giving 
them an option of working from home 
and enabling COVID–19 related safety 
measures at the workplace. 
Our people strategies are crafted 
under four categories viz i) fair, 
safe and transparent workplace; ii) 
pay, rewards and benefits; iii) talent 
development and retention; and iv) 
ethics and compliance.
i.	Fair, safe and transparent 
workplace:

is fair, open and transparent, and 
where employees can openly 
share their views. We transparently 
communicate our policies and 
practices, such as company 
plans, compensation approach, 
performance metrics, performance 
pay grids and calculation, career 
enhancements, compliance and 
other processes. Some of our 
practices along with the practices of 
our subsidiaries wherever applicable, 
under this umbrella are as follows.
	Our commitment to employees 
is enshrined in our ‘Employee 
Charter – Human Rights Statement, 
which sets out what employees 
can reasonably expect from the 
Company (Employee Rights), and 
the responsibilities and qualities 
that are expected from them 
while performing their duties 
(Employee Responsibilities). It also 
lays down the principles of equal 
opportunity and non-discrimination, 
anti-corruption and bribery, 
prohibition of forced and child 
labour, transparency, safe, healthy 
and harassment-free workplace, 
amongst others.
	We have 14 cultural anchors which

(‘BRSR’) disclosures (the ‘Report’) which shall form part of the Company’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report FY 2022 in its digital/online format. The disclosures in this Report have been prepared based on the 
requirements of SEBI Circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD-2/P/CIR/2021/562 dated May 10, 2021, prescribing format of 
the BRSR and the guidance notes and the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business 
Conduct, 2019 (‘NGRBC’) of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. The intended user of this 
assurance statement is the Management of Bajaj Finance (‘the Management’) and its stakeholders. Our assurance 
engagement was planned and carried out during March 2022 – June 2022 covering the Company’s non-
financial/sustainability performance during 1st April 2021 - 31st March 2022. We performed a limited level of 
assurance based on our assurance methodology, VeriSustainTM1. 
Responsibilities of the Management of Bajaj Finance and of the Assurance Provider 
The Management has the sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report and are responsible for all information 
disclosed in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analyzing and reporting the information presented in 
the Report. Bajaj Finance is also responsible for ensuring the maintenance and integrity of its website and any 
referenced disclosures on sustainability performance. In performing this assurance work, DNV’s responsibility is to 
the Management of Bajaj Finance; however, this statement represents our independent opinion and is intended to 
inform the outcome of the assurance to the stakeholders of Bajaj Finance. 
We do not provide any services to Bajaj Finance which in our opinion constitutes a conflict of interest with this 
assurance work. Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided 
by the Company to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith and are free from material 
misstatements. 
Scope, Boundary and Limitations 
The reporting scope and boundary encompasses economic, environmental, social and governance performance of 
Bajaj Finance in India covering the financial and insurance services-related operations of Bajaj Finance Limited and 
its subsidiaries – (i) Bajaj Housing Finance Limited (BHFL) and (ii) Bajaj Financial Securities Limited (BFinsec) as 
brought out in Section A: General Disclosures of the BRSR.  
The 
assurance 
engagement 
considers 
an 
uncertainty 
of 
±5% 
based 
on 
materiality 
threshold 
for 
estimation/measurement errors and omissions. We did not engage with any external stakeholders as part of this 
assurance engagement.  
During the assurance process, we did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance 
engagement. The reported data on economic performance, expenditure towards Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) activities, and other financial data are based on financial statements prepared by Bajaj Finance and audited 
by its statutory auditors which is subject to a separate audit process. We were not involved in the review of 
financial information within the Report. 
Basis of our Opinion 
As part of the assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability specialists performed assurance work 
for selected sample sites of Bajaj Finance. We adopted a risk-based approach, that is, we concentrated our 
assurance efforts on the issues of high material relevance to Bajaj Finance’s business and its key stakeholders. We 
carried out the following activities:  
• 
Reviewed the approach to stakeholder engagement and materiality determination process and its outcomes 
as brought out in the Report. 
• 
Conducted interviews with selected representatives responsible for management of sustainability issues 
and implementation of the NGRBC Principles and carried out reviews of selected evidence to support topics 
 
1 The VeriSustain protocol is based on the principles of various assurance standards including International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) Revised (Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information) and the 
GRI Principles for Defining Report Content and Quality, international best practices in verification and our professional experience; and is

and claims disclosed in the Report. We were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those with overall 
responsibility to deliver Bajaj Finance’s overall sustainability objectives. 
• 
Carried out remote verification of sustainability performance data and sample evidence related to the 
sampled offices of Bajaj Finance Limited and its subsidiaries – BHFL and BFSL to review the processes and 
systems for aggregating site-level sustainability information, as well as overall aggregation and 
consolidation of data from sites by the sustainability team at the Corporate Office at Pune in Maharashtra. 
• 
Reviewed the process of reporting on BRSR requirements including Section A: General Disclosures, Section 
B: Management and Process Disclosures, and Section C: Principle-wise Performance Disclosures. 
• 
Carried out an assessment of the processes for gathering and consolidating performance data related to the 
NGRBC Principles and, for a sample, checked the processes of data consolidation to assess the Reliability 
and Accuracy of performance disclosures reported based on BRSR requirements. 
• 
Verification of the data consolidation of reported performance disclosures in context to the Principle of 
Completeness as per VeriSustain for a limited level of verification. 
• 
An independent assessment of the reports non-financial information against the requirements of BRSR and 
the guidance notes  
Opinion and Observations 
Based on the verification undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report together with 
referenced information does not adhere to the requirements of BRSR including the General Disclosures, 
Management and Process Disclosures, and Principle-wise Performance Disclosures. 
 
Without affecting our assurance opinion, we provide the following observations against the principles of VeriSustain:  
 
Materiality 
The process of determining the issues that is most relevant to an organization and its stakeholders. 
The Report brings out the broad range of issues which the Company has identified as being material to its business 
which are mapped as risks and opportunities, along with the rationale for considering the issue as being material. 
The Company may strengthen its process of materiality identification and prioritisation of material topics through 
engagement and feedback with internal and external stakeholders. 
Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to 
the Principle of Materiality. 
Stakeholder Inclusiveness 
The participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to 
Sustainability. 
The Report brings out the key stakeholder groups identified by Bajaj Finance, that is, shareholders and investors, 
customers, government and regulators, value chain partners, employees, and society. The formal and informal 
modes of engagement with these stakeholder groups as well as the key topics and concerns which have come out 
from these engagement channels are brought out within the Report. 
Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to 
the Principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness. 
Responsiveness 
The extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues. 
The Report brings out the approaches adopted by the Company to adapt and/or mitigate impacts related to its 
identified material issues, as well as responses to key stakeholder concerns. The disclosures bring out the 
descriptions of structures, policies and processes implemented by Bajaj Finance towards adopting and reviewing the 
NGRBC Principles, as well as performance data, and processes for governance.  
Nothing has come to our attention to believe that the Report does not meet the requirements related to 
the Principle of Responsiveness.  
Reliability  
The accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report, as well as the quality of underlying data 
management systems. 
The Report brings out the processes that Bajaj Finance has established towards capturing and reporting its 
sustainability performance related to each Principle of NGRBC. The majority of the data and information verified 
through our remote assessments with the Company’s management teams and data owners at the operations 
sampled by us as part of our assurance engagement were found to be fairly accurate and reliable. Some of the data 
inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to transcription, interpretation

and aggregation errors. These data inaccuracies have been communicated for correction and the related disclosures 
were reviewed for correctness.  
Nothing has come to our attention to believe that the Report does not meet the principle of Reliability.  
 
Completeness 
How much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organisation and its stakeholders is 
reported?  
The Report brings out the Company’s performance during FY 2021-22 related to economic, environmental, social 
and governance-related aspects of the BRSR and covering the operations of Bajaj Finance Limited and its 
subsidiaries, covering the performance related to the nine NGRBC Principles. Bajaj Finance may further strengthen 
its processes towards capturing and reporting information and data related to Essential and certain Leadership 
Indicators of Principle-wise Performance Disclosures in future reporting periods.  
Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the Principle of 
Completeness with respect to scope, boundary and time. 
Neutrality 
The extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organization’s performance, delivered in a neutral 
tone. 
The Report brings out Bajaj Finance’s sustainability performance during the reporting period in a neutral tone in 
terms of content along with descriptions of key risks and opportunities during the reporting period.  
Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to 
the Principle of Neutrality.

17021:2015 - Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management

Customer 
Experience 
Risk
Given that BFL Group 
provides financial 
products and services 
to millions of customers, 
any undesirable customer 
experience could result in 
loss of customers or even 
reputational loss.
Listening to customers and driving 
continuous transformation to provide 
them a frictionless experience is 
what BFL Group has always strived 
for. Ethics, transparency, and 
accountability are deeply ingrained 
and practiced in daily operations, 
including in dealing with customers. 
For a better customer experience, BFL 
Group appropriately addresses their 
grievances. Customer experience is 
enhanced by offering products and

Loss of reputation 
can result in loss of

services which meet the needs of 
customers, as well as adaptation of 
innovative technology solutions to 
provide a seamless and an “on the go” 
customer journey through its digital 
platforms. Some of the illustrative 
initiatives in this regard are:
1.	
A dedicated customer complaint 
reduction unit has been instituted 
to identify the root cause of 
customer complaints and taking 
corrective actions to modify 
the processes, to avoid such 
grievances.
2.	 A separate team has been setup 
to monitor customer queries 
and grievances on various social 
media channels and provide quick 
resolution.
3.	 BFL Group runs various awareness 
campaigns for the public at 
large making them aware about 
fraudsters, scam schemes, etc.
2.
Financial 
inclusion
Opportunity
The reach of financial 
products and services 
is still shallow in India, 
especially in the mass 
segment and semi-urban 
/ rural parts of India.
BFL Group’s customer reach is 
achieved through distribution networks, 
adaptation of innovative technology 
solutions to provide a seamless 
customer journey through its digital 
platforms and customized product 
offering.
BFL has opened 50 financial inclusion 
branches in unbanked rural centers in 
FY2022 and FY2023.  For FY2023 it 
proposes to open further 50 financial 
inclusion branches. 
Positive
BFL has created deep 
distribution in medium 
and small towns, and 
villages across the 
country thereby taking 
financial solutions 
closer to society. Such 
distribution creates 
opportunity for BFL.

Risk and

Risks
The end use of finance

through its commercial

adverse impact on the 
environment, society and 
governance.
Reputational risk in 
case BFL is not able to 
meet the stakeholder 
expectations on climate 
related  disclosures and 
initiatives.
BFL, through its environmental policy, 
has identified certain exclusions for its 
lending activities. 
BFL’s ESG reporting is now beyond 
the minimum statutory reporting and 
is being enhanced year on year. For 
example, disclosures on GHG emissions 
and voluntary early adoption of BRSR 
in FY2022.
Negative
Conforming with 
environment related 
standards could result 
in increased expenses 
/ loss of business 
which would have 
been underwritten.
Positive
Being relatively newer 
class of assets, BFL’s 
experience and 
depth of balance 
sheets could allow 
it to harness these 
opportunities.

(website / mobile apps), agents / intermediaries etc. Depending on the type of product, information / applications are 
obtained from the customer either physically or electronically.
	
Underwriting: The Company has robust underwriting practices and continuous risk monitoring which ensure that 
portfolios stay within acceptable risk levels. The Company has also deeply invested in business specific underwriting 
units.  All loans products go through an underwriting mechanism, where eligibility of the customer, validation of 
the documents provided, genuineness of the transaction, compliance with applicable regulations like anti-money 
laundering, KYC, etc., are verified. 
	
Depending on the type of product, customer profile and other parameters, the underwriting can either be completely 
automated or may require manual intervention. Upon satisfaction with the above, including adherence to internal risk 
parameters, the loan is approved for the customer.
	
Servicing: After granting of loan, there can be various reasons for which a customer may need servicing. Collecting 
instalments is one of the critical part of customer servicing. However, there can be many more instances when a 
customer can reach out such as requesting change in personal information, adding / changing nominees, grievance 
redressal etc. We believe in enhancing customer experience and have a number of digital tools where the customer 
can self-service or in the alternate, can also reach out at our offices / branches, write to / call us etc. 
	
Deposits:  The Company offers deposit schemes to the customers as well. This begins with sourcing of the deposit 
which could be directly by the customer or through a deposit agent / partner, branches, distributor, online portal, 
mobile apps, etc. The requisite KYC checks and other information details of customers are collected and reviewed 
to ensure compliance with extant regulations. Post this, a deposit certificate is issued to the customer. Periodic 
intimations are sent to customers and upon maturity, the deposits are either renewed or repaid to the customer.

Introduction  
DNV Business Assurance India Private Limited (‘DNV’) has been commissioned by the management of Bajaj Finance 
Limited (‘the Company’ or ‘Bajaj Finance Limited’, Corporate Identification Number: L65910MH1987PLC042961) to carry 
out an independent verification of Bajaj Finance Limited’s Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (the 
‘GHG Emissions’) data in spreadsheets and for its two (2) subsidiaries for the period 1st April 2020 – 31st March 2021 and 
1st April 2021 – 31st March 2022. This verification has been carried out as part of the overall work of assurance of Bajaj 
Finance Limited's Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting for FY 2021-22 and other disclosures as applicable.  
 
The Company has prepared its GHG emissions based on the requirements set out in Greenhouse Gas Protocol – A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised edition) published by World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) and World Resources Institute (WRI) to calculate its GHG emissions and reported in the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting as mandated under the SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015. The verification provides a limited level of customized engagement as per DNV’s VeriSustainTM1 
protocol, which is based on our professional experience, international assurance best practice including International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) Revised* for Defining Report Content and Quality. This verification 
applies a ±5% uncertainty threshold towards errors and omissions.  
  
Bajaj Finance Limited is responsible for the collection, analysis, aggregation, preparation (conversion factors, assumptions, 
methodology, calculations) and presentation of GHG Emissions as part of its sustainability disclosures. Our responsibility of 
performing this work is to the management of Company and in accordance with terms of reference agreed with the 
Company. The verification engagement is based on the assumption that the data provided to us is complete, sufficient, 
true and free from material misstatements. DNV disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or 
entity would make based on this verification statement. The verification was carried out from March 2022 to May 2022 by 
a team of qualified sustainability and GHG assessors.  
 
Scope, Boundary and Limitations of Verification  
The scope of work agreed upon with Company includes verification of its GHG emissions as below:  
• 
Scope 1 emissions arising from stationary and mobile combustion of fossil fuels – Diesel and Petrol. Fugitive 
emissions from the leakage of refrigerants  
• 
Scope 2 emissions arising from consumption of purchased electricity from the grid.  
• 
Scope 3 emissions arising from employee commute, business travel (air, train and road), shared diesel generators, 
freight goods and hotel stay. 
 
The operational boundary selected for reporting and the consolidation approach is based on operational control criterion 
adopted by Bajaj Finance Limited and includes the following two subsidiaries in India:  
• 
Bajaj Housing Finance Limited 
• 
Bajaj Financial Securities Limited 
We did not come across any limitations to the agreed scope of work except the use of default values to calculate GHG 
emissions.  
 
Verification Methodology  
The verification was conducted by DNV in accordance with the requirements as set out in VeriSustain for a limited level of 
verification while adopting a risk-based approach and selection of samples. We carried out the following activities: 
• 
Desk review of the Company’s emissions data for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 provided in spreadsheets.   
• 
Review of activity data and related evidence maintained in corresponding dashboard systems.  
• 
Interaction with key managers and data owners to review data consolidation systems of the Company and sampled 
operational sites including reviews of emission factors and assumptions used for calculations.  
• 
Remote verification of activity data and sample evidence related to the sampled offices of Bajaj Finance Limited 
(Consumer finance & Auto finance) 
• 
Review of the consolidated GHG emissions data in order to calculate the total emission of Bajaj Finance Limited and its 
subsidiaries with the corresponding environment and sustainability teams.  
 
Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions, we carried out remote assessments 
following DNV’s remote audit methodology, as one-to-one discussions and onsite location audits were not feasible.  
 
Conclusion  
On the basis of our verification methodology and scope of work agreed upon, nothing has come to our attention to believe 
that the GHG data (absolute emissions) as below are not a correct representation of Bajaj Finance Limited’s and its 
subsidiaries GHG emissions profile during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-2022:
