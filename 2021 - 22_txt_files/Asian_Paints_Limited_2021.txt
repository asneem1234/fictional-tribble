PRINCIPLE 2
BUSINESSES SHOULD PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES 
IN A MANNER THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND SAFE
Essential Indicators:
1.	
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) 
investments in specific technologies to improve 
the environmental and social impacts of product 
and processes to total R&D and capex investments 
made by the entity, respectively.
	
Environmental and Social impact assessment is one 
of the key inputs for the new product development/
process changes. Capital expenditure and R&D spends 
incurred by the Company embeds cost incurred to 
mitigate environmental & social hazards. These are 
inseparable cost of the projects and hence separately 
identifying such cost is not feasible.
	
Increasing share of renewable energy in overall energy 
portfolio is a flagship initiative which demonstrated 
our commitment towards sourcing clean energy and 
transition to low carbon operation having a direct 
impact on the environment.
2.	
 a. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, the Company focuses on eliminating/
minimizing restricted raw materials from 
their products. The aim is not just to make 
the world more beautiful, but also safer, 
through a systematic approach to paints and 
painting services.
	
	
The Company has a strong process to control 
the entry of hazardous material into products. 
The Company had created a green roadmap in 
2011, where it had been decided to eliminate all 
the raw materials that are classified as Group 1 
carcinogens, mutagens and reproductive toxins. 
The Company has also listed all the materials 
which are classified as highly hazardous materials 
and created a roadmap to eliminate them in two 
years. By 2013, the Company had eliminated 
crystalline silica from the products and restricted 
Group 1 carcinogens, mutagens and reproductive 
toxins. Restriction on heavy metals was further 
strengthened by putting controls to know the 
presence of heavy metals as contaminants. 
	
	
The Company has created a strong system and 
screening protocols for raw material introduction 
and integrated them into an IT platform. Each 
raw material in system parlance is treated as 
a new project and various stage gates and 
accountabilities have been designed for any raw 
material development. The new raw material 
development process including various screening 
stages has been discussed in the product 
stewardship section of Natural Capital section of 
this Annual Report.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were 
sourced sustainably?
	
	
All architectural paints which we produce are 
lead and heavy metal free since the year 2008, 
and subsequently free from added Respirable 
Crystalline Silica ("RCS") since the year 2013, 
which was well before mandated by regulation.
	
	
Further, the Company has been continuously 
making efforts to increase the use of renewable 
feedstock such as enhanced use of sorbitol and 
starch-based polymers for architectural paints. 
This is exemplified through our renewable 
content share in three large-volume products 
viz. Ace Exterior Emulsion, Tractor Emulsion 
Advanced, and Apcolite Enamel. The renewable 
content in these products has been increased 
from 20% to 60% from the earlier levels 
in last 2 years.

3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim 
your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life.
	
By virtue of being a paint industry, our products, 
in general, get completely utilized once it reaches 
consumers. However, we are focused on reducing the 
generation of dead, damaged, and defective materials 
on the inventory management front. These stocks 
are collected back, reprocessed, and utilized to the 
maximum extent possible.
	
(a) 	 Plastics (including packaging): The primary 
product of the Company is paint which is applied 
to surfaces however plastic is the predominant 
packaging material. Ensuring compliance with the 
Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules 2016, 
the Company follows the Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) approach to manage its 
downstream operations' plastic packaging waste. 
Further, the Company has increased the use of 
recycled plastic in a host of product packaging. 
The total quantity of recycled plastic used in 
its packaging was 3,647 tonnes in financial 
year 2021-22. This accounts for 5.4% of total 
plastic packaging.
	
(b)	 E-waste: Not Applicable
	
(c)	 Hazardous waste: Not Applicable
	
(d)	 Other Waste: Not Applicable
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line 
with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, 
provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, EPR is applicable to the Company. As a leading 
manufacturer in the paints industry, it is a business 
imperative that the Company ensures safe disposal 
of the pre-consumer and post-consumer packaging. 
The Company has been ensuring the collection and 
safe disposal of its packaging waste through the 
EPR approach since 2018. In financial year 2021-22, 
the Company collected and recycled off, or safely 
disposed off over 3,400 tonnes and 8,800 tonnes 
of flexible plastic waste and rigid plastic waste, 
respectively, across 23 states. 
	
Leadership Indicators:
	
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle 
Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of 
its products (for manufacturing industry) or 
for its services (for service industry)? If yes, 
provide details in the following format?
	
	
The Company has conducted LCA for its 9 leading 
products through an independent external 
agency. The Environment Product Declarations 
("EPD") covers all the 9 paint products of 
Asian Paints out of which 7 are water-based 
(4 of which are exterior paint and 3 are 
interior paint products), 1 is solvent based and 
1 is distemper.
	
	
The LCA was achieved through conducting the 
‘Life Cycle Assessment’ as per ISO 14040/44 
standard. The LCA is conducted in accordance 
with Product Category Rules (PCR) UN CPC 
3511. The PCR is for the assessment of the 
environmental performance of UN CPC 3511 
- Paints and varnishes and related products. 
This PCR complies and has been developed in 
accordance with the General Program Instruction 
of the International EPD System, version 2.01 
dated 18th September, 2013. It is based on the 
requirements and guidelines given in “PCR 
Basic Module, CPC Division 35: Other chemical 
products; manmade fibers”, version 1.0, dated 
30th November, 2010.
	
	
The LCA model for Company represents a cradle-
to-Grave system. The scope covers the ecological 
information to be divided into Production Phase, 
Use Phase and End-of-Life Phase. The production 
phase includes the raw material extraction, 
production of the raw materials, auxiliary 
material production, upstream transportation, 
manufacturing process of the final product and 
its packaging. The use phase includes the dilution 
water consumption during its application on 
the wall and the Volatile Organic Compounds 
("VOCs") emissions to air after the application 
of paint on wall surface. The End-of-Life phase 
includes the incineration of packaging waste/
materials after use, with energy recovery.
	
2. 
If there are any significant social or 
environmental concerns and/or risks arising 
from production or disposal of your products 
/ services, as identified in the Life Cycle 
Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through 
any other means, briefly describe the same 
along-with action taken to mitigate the same.
	
	
The Company has constantly set standards to 
remain a leader in product stewardship arena and 
invest in unprecedented innovation that offers 
unique value to consumers while enhancing 
product safety and sustainability. The theme of 
product stewardship has evolved over the years 
and continuous efforts of the Company have 
enabled to make positive environmental impacts 
through its product innovation techniques. The 
efforts are aided by LCA studies of products 
that enable us to identify hotspots and thus 
opportunities for improvement. Some of 
the key initiatives undertaken in this regard 
are as follows:
	
	
I.	
Rutile grade of titanium dioxide is a 
key contributor to the cradle-to-grave 
product carbon footprint. Over the years, 
the Company has focused on improving 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (Contd.)
12
the scattering efficiency of the rutile 
through multiple formulation and process 
innovations. There were continued efforts 
to enhance spacing of rutile in paint film and 
use of effective dispersion and stabilization 
techniques. All these efforts helped to 
avoid 17,700 metric tonnes of CO2 in the 
financial year.
	
	
II.	
The Company is constantly changing and 
improving its paint formulations to offer 
low-VOC paints that ensure health and 
environmental benefits while providing 
higher performance levels. Further, Green 
Seal and Green Assure products are low VOC 
products as VOC is one of the important 
criteria to comply with these certification 
standards. Details related to Green Assure 
and Green Seal products are provided 
in the product stewardship section of 
Natural Capital of this Annual Report. This 
section also includes details of GreenPro 
certification which assess the product at 
different life cycle stages.
	
	
III.	
The Company is  focusing on sustainability 
through increasing the durability of its 
products. SmartCare waterproofing 
and Ultima Protek range demonstrates 
our efforts in this direction wherein the 
durability of these products are more than 
10 years. Further, the Company has a host 
of products with the durability of more than 
5 years such as Apex Advance Dust Proof, 
Apex Dust proof, Apex Shyne Dust proof, 
Aspira, Smartcare Damp proof & Smartcare 
Damp proof Advance.
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material 
to total material (by value) used in production (for 
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for 
service industry).
	
Resource efficiency forms an integral part of our 
environmental strategy. Through our continuous 
efforts, we strive to meet the needs of our customers. 
In doing so, we optimise our resource management 
approach to efficiently utilise the raw materials and 
minimise material waste. To ensure the availability of 
raw materials required for our business operations, 
we make optimum use of our resources and adopt 
ways to reuse, recycle and reintroduce excess material 
in our production process without compromising 
the quality of our products and solutions. This is 
illustrated as follows:
	
I.	
Wash water: During water-based paint 
processing, significant amount of wash water is 
produced while cleaning the processing vessels 
and liquid material transfer lines. If left unused, 
these contribute to waste sludge generation 
during treatment in our Effluent Treatment 
Plant. The Company upgrades and automated its 
wastewater handling systems to have capability 
of re-using these in specific paint processing 
steps. In financial year 2021-22, the Company 
utilized 28763 MT of wash water in the products, 
resulting in avoidance of freshwater consumption 
and generation of waste sludge through 
such wash waters.
	
II.	
Waste solvent reuse: The Company has been 
successfully able to recover and reuse waste 
solvent in the products. To reduce the need 
for distillation and hence sludge generation, 
the Company has started ensuring shade-wise 
segregation of waste solvent from product 
streams. This helped the Company to ensure 
the utilization of waste solvent in products 
after necessary quality checks in place of fresh 
solvents. In financial year 2021-22, the Company 
was able to reuse 716 MT of solvent in products. 
In addition to this, the Company also used 
recovered solvent for cleaning purposes.	
	
III.	 Economy Grade Paint: In case of materials where 
source segregation or development of reuse 
scheme is not possible, the Company collects and 
uses these materials in producing an economy 
grade paint. Such materials include material from 
strainer cleanings, retention samples, transfer 
pump seal or gland leakages and intermediaries 
generated at different sources etc.  The Company 
has been able to segregate, reprocess and 
produce 1282 MT of Economy Grade Paint in  
financial year 2021-22 compared to 929 MT in 
financial year 2020-21.

then provide details.
	
Aligning emissions management strategy with the 
global goals of minimizing carbon footprint and 
mitigating climate change risks, the Company has 
streamlined its processes to move closer to this 
common goal. Reducing GHG emissions is not only a 
business imperative for Asian Paints, but also forms a 
vital part of its environmental strategy going forward. 
With the use of Renewable Energy sources, alternate 
fuel, and energy efficiency efforts, the Company has 
been able to reduce emissions.
	
Reduction in electricity consumption:
	
The Company is committed to energy conservation 
and ensure efficient energy usage at all its 
operational facilities. Energy management forms 
a vital part of the Company's approach towards 
sustainable operations. Facilities operate with an 
aim to reduce energy consumption in the processes 
which has a direct impact on carbon emissions. These 
efforts have resulted in 37% reduction in specific 
electricity consumption compared to the baseline of 
financial year 2013-14.
	
Renewable Electricity: 
	
Renewable electricity generation is one of the 
identified focus areas and several investments have 
been made in this space over the years. While we 
face many policy related uncertainties in this area, 
renewable electricity now accounts for 61.1% of the 
total electricity consumption in financial year 2021-22. 
	
Process Improvement: 
	
Cycle time reduction
	
Process efficiency at Asian Paints is one of the key 
focus areas to achieving overall sustainability agenda. 
21
In line with this, the Company has been putting 
efforts into freeing up the capacity through cycle 
time reduction across intermediate and product 
streams. Cycle time reduction in the manufacturing of 
paints and intermediates translates to lower energy 
consumption. Several cross-functional initiatives 
were taken up this year to reduce cycle time in water-
based and solvent-based paints, emulsion polymers, 
resins and colourants. These initiatives were largely 
around reaction engineering at lower temperature/
heat, functional additives that reduce processing 
time, optimizing the reaction conditions, use of 
alternate raw materials and optimizing the testing 
time. Through these efforts, the Company was able
