7.	
Statement by Director responsible for the report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets and achievements
	
Dear Stakeholders,
	
I hope this letter finds you and your family safe and well. 
	
As I write this letter, I find myself observing an interesting trend - that of conscious consumerism. The trend indicates 
that customers today are ready to take a step back and compromise their own needs in terms of affordability, luxury 
or inclination while preferring brands that take a rather positive stance towards the environment and the society as a 
whole. As we enter this era of conscious consumerism, companies across the globe have been forced to relook at their 
products, operations and resource consumption. 
	
Having learnt several lessons from the past couple of years, investors are looking at ESG as one of the key determining 
factors of an organisation’s health and ability to sustainably deliver higher risk-adjusted returns. With many parallels 
being drawn between the uncertainties of a global pandemic and the potential risks of climate change, ESG now serves 
as a symbol of stability for investors and stakeholders. 
	
We, at ICICI Lombard, are actively adopting a holistic approach that takes Environmental, Social and Governance aspects 
into consideration whilst formulating all our business plans and goals. We hold an unwavering belief in the greater good 
amidst a growing necessity to adopt sustainable practices. Given India’s recent commitment to Net-Zero by 2070, we 
realise our responsibility and role in contributing to this mission, as a company that touches and impacts thousands of 
lives across the nation. 
	
Focus on Sustainable Operations 
	
At ICICI Lombard, sustainability is at the core of our growth strategy. With Board oversight on organisation-wide ESG 
initiatives, we promote best practices across functions. We are already making operational changes that facilitate 
decarbonisation to arrest the effects of climate change. Accordingly, we have started tracking GHG emissions more 
efficiently in order to take corrective actions wherever necessary.
	
Technology continues to play a pivotal role in our environmental efforts. By leveraging technology, digitising data and 
automating several processes, we have been able to significantly reduce paper consumption. We have also been able 
to cut down on unnecessary travel across all facets of operations. 
	
Our Company has become an avid promoter of green energy through our recent solar and electric vehicle insurance 
solutions. Furthermore, our growing emphasis on responsible consumption of resources encourages a ‘go-green’ 
modus operandi across all our departments. 
	
Responsible Work Culture 
	
Responsible work culture is the cornerstone for any sustainability-focussed initiative that an organisation undertakes. 
Our employees have faith in the Company’s long-term vision for a better tomorrow. At ICICI Lombard, we empower 
our employees through continuous skill and capability development, along with awareness building around 
best practices. 
	
We firmly believe that diversity and inclusivity are the hallmarks of a progressive enterprise. Accordingly, we seek 
to provide an excellent work culture that promotes a diverse and inclusive workforce with flexible and modern 
work policies.  
	
Better Customer Experience
	
Customer-centricity is at the heart of our organisational philosophy. We strive to cater to the individual needs of our 
diverse clients by providing a wide range of customisable insurance solutions. In order to enhance approachability, we 
also offer the facility of using WhatsApp for direct communication. Similarly, by leveraging modern advancements such

as AI, ML and Chatbots, we aim to make seamless communication easier for all our stakeholders. In March 2022, the 
straight-through processing of motor break-in on our Self Inspection app was 84.6% vis-à-vis 73.9% in March 2021. We 
are also pleased to have one of the most efficient grievance resolution mechanisms with 99.0% of complaints getting

all our customers. The solution goes beyond just insurance claims and settlements and is aimed at positively influencing 
the lifestyle of our customers. The app is a one-stop solution for the health, motor, travel insurance & wellness needs 
of our policyholders. Moreover, access to features like diet and exercise tracker, step count & sleep hour tracker, online 
chat with nutritionists, teleconsultation with doctors and more make it a truly unique solution in the insurance space. 
	
Inclusive Development, Health and Wellness
	
An organisation’s success can only be defined by what it gives back to the community. We believe it is our duty to help 
our communities and contribute towards benefiting them. 
	
One of our significant community initiative Caring Hands focusses on employee volunteering to support visually 
impaired children and empower them to lead better lives. Similarly, under our Ride to Safety and Niranjali initiatives, 
we have been undertaking dedicated programmes promoting road safety, health and hygiene and overall wellness of 
citizens respectively. We have covered over 0.4 million lives through our CSR initiatives in FY2022. Further, we launched 
a pilot environmental sustainability programme involving the installation of solar panels in the schools in line with 
India’s net-zero ambitions. Through this project, we installed solar panels in 10 schools in Mumbai in FY2022.
	
Effective Governance
	
For any change to be meaningful, it has to be effectively executed and continuously tracked. The internal policies 
governing ICICI Lombard are designed to create and promote transparency with a strong focus on disclosures and 
ethical practices across our various departments. 
	
Our organisation has an uncompromising zero-tolerance approach towards any form of fraud and corruption 
with policies such as Prohibition of Insider Trading and Anti-Money Laundering in full effect. With robust policies 
surrounding cyber security and data privacy, we ensure the protection of all sensitive organisational and client 
information. Moreover, in order to manage the core risks of our Company, we have a sound ERM framework in place 
that incorporates risks related to ESG. 
	
The Board has already taken a massive leap in making ESG as one of the main agendas to drive the business forward 
towards a brighter future. Effective oversight over ESG is to be handled by the CSR & Sustainability Board Committee 
within our organisation. We adopted BRSR in FY2022 even before the SEBI mandate for FY2023 to promote company-
wide sustainability and remain committed to enhance reporting and disclosures in the coming years. 
	
At ICICI Lombard, our goal is to work towards a better tomorrow, eventually triggering positive, long-lasting changes 
in the world that we live in. ESG for us is much more than following a checklist. It is about making an impact by turning 
theory into action. 
	
By creating an environmentally and socially aware foundation, we are doing our bit for the coming generations.
	
Thank you for being a part of this wonderful journey.
