This has enabled us to comply with necessary applicable environmental laws and mandates during the manufacturing and 
commercial activities. Additionally, Good Manufacturing Practices are strictly followed during the manufacturing of the products. 
During this year, we have considered the usage of renewable energy for the conversion of boilers to biomass and photovoltaic 
solar power systems in the manufacturing units to reduce environmental impacts.
	
Globally, GSK has set two ambitious goals: a net-zero impact on carbon and a net positive impact on nature by 2030. We 
strongly believe in our path toward the goals set forth and we reaffirm our aspirations to integrate sustainability into the core of 
our business and manufacture products.
