BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
2021-22
1
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented disruption to lives and livelihood. In these 
challenging and deeply distressing times, we made every effort to uphold our core purpose of 
providing financial protection to the families of our customers with sensitivity and standing by them 
in their hour of need.
The pandemic also accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and existing processes were 
re-configured in line with customer needs, preferences and expectations. The disruption also 
upended the way work is conducted and in the process, transformed the nature of the workplace 
and the workforce. The pandemic demanded an agile and flexible response to emerging realities and 
reinforced the need to build resilience and sustainability in business operations. 
Our vision of building an enduring organisation is built on the ethos of sustainability. We adopted the 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework to integrate sustainable practices across 
our business operations. We believe that embracing ESG is of vital significance for long-term value 
creation for all stakeholders and goes beyond profits to encompass people, purpose and the planet. 
Initiatives under the ESG framework are monitored at the highest level by the ESG Committee 
comprising members of the Company’s Management Committee. It is our commitment to make 
every effort to make our Company and the planet a better place for the next generation. 
The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as the regulator of capital markets in India has put 
in place the Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework which requires 
listed companies to disclose quantitative and substantive information under the nine principles of 
the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct. 
The BRSR disclosure is voluntary for FY2022 and shall become mandatory from FY2023 onwards for 
the top 1,000 Indian listed companies by market capitalisation. For ICICI Prudential Life Insurance 
Company, it is a conscious and a collective decision to adopt the BRSR framework ahead of schedule 
and thereby reiterate our commitment to transparency in disclosures and promote a culture that 
embraces sustainability and goes beyond goals and targets by integrating best in class sustainability 
practices with our business processes.

ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the environmental 
and social impact of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the Company. 
	
Considering the Company’s nature of business, R&D outlay and capital expenditure were confined to investments in information 
technology. Accordingly, investments were made by way of addition to capital assets in the form of IT infrastructure like equipment, 
software and communication networks to give impetus to the Company’s digital initiatives. The share of investments in R&D and 
capex on account of information technology was 85.6% (82.8% in FY2021) of total addition to fixed assets by the Company.
	
The new technology additions expanded the scope of digital operations, introduced greater process efficiency as well as reduced 
the total consumption of paper across the Company departments. For environmental sustainability, we have initiated investment on 
energy efficient equipment deployment (Variable Refrigerant Flow/5 Star rated Air Conditioners), LED lighting, LED signage, waterless 
urinals, sensor based taps and aerators fitted taps. For improving air quality, Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) lights and High 
efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in AHU and air purifiers were installed at a total outlay of `.65.5 million for FY2022. 
2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
	
The nature of the Company’s business is to provide insurance and pension. Therefore, consumption of resources is limited to running 
its operations.

Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
As a financial services Company, there is limited scope for using recycled material as inputs for various business processes. 
Nonetheless, the Company continually seeks out opportunities to recycle waste. 
	
E-waste such as computers, printers, switches, scanners have been the primary e-waste generated in the Company. Nearly 8,447 kgs 
of e-waste generated has been disposed through authorised recyclers since FY2019 and 450 kgs in FY2022. Re-cycling certificates 
have been received from selected government authorised e-waste vendors.
	
The Company has e-waste collection bins at 50 branches pan India for employees and visitors to deposit their e-waste so it can be 
disposed through certified E-waste vendors. 
	
The Company has taken multiple initiatives for minimising usage of single-use plastic water bottles, which have been replaced with 
reusable water jars and glasses, across our offices. The Company has also replaced plastic garbage bags with bio-degradable bags 
and plastic dustbins with steel ones. Re-usable plates are used at the cafeteria in the corporate and back office which house the 
largest number of employees to promote sustainability.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Has the Company conducted Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for its services? 
	
The primary business of the Company is providing life insurance and pension coverage. The customer life cycle in life insurance starts 
with origination or sourcing of policies, followed by underwriting and issuance of policies and thereafter, servicing of the policy based 
on customer needs and requirements and finally, by way of payment at the time of policy maturity or claim settlement. Details are 
elucidated as below:
	
Sourcing of Insurance policies
	
Insurance policies are sourced through multiple channels and each channel and sourcing intermediary is expected to stringently 
adhere to regulatory and Company guidelines. Policies may be sourced by individual licensed advisors, sales representatives, affiliated 
banks, financial entities acting as brokers and corporate agents. Customers can also opt to purchase policies online through brokers, 
web aggregators and digital platforms and websites of partners. The sourcing and servicing framework is enabled in both physical 
and digital formats and customers have the option to choose based on their individual preference or need. 
	
The majority of applications are processed digitally and 95% of the applications are through the digital platform. The digital process 
eliminates the requirement of paper flow and paper consumption as the application process that earlier involved filling in multiple 
forms and submission of various documents as proof of disclosure by the customer is now no longer required.
	
Digitalisation has not only made the process faster but also easier and environment friendly. The hassle of handling, storing and 
retrieval of physical documents is also significantly reduced.
	
Application Processing
	
Policy Issuance and Underwriting
	
The Company has a well-defined risk management process to determine the risk involved in insuring a particular life. Based on various 
demographic, financial and health parameters disclosed by the customer, the life insurance company first determines whether the life 
proposed to be insured poses an acceptable risk and, if so, it calculates a fair price for the coverage or demands further requirements 
like income documents, medical tests etc. to ascertain the quality of life of the individual seeking coverage. The underwriting process 
determines the eligibility based on the information provided, documents submitted and disclosures made during tele-underwriting or 
medical underwriting. Various checks and scrutiny is done to ensure the authenticity and genuineness of the disclosures made. The 
underwriting process at the Company is digitally enabled. The system supports the decision-making process based on logic built into 
the system itself. Adoption of technology has helped the Company scale and process insurance applications quicker and cheaper.
	
Post conclusion of underwriting and scrutiny of all relevant documents against the disclosures made, policies are issued as per the 
underwriting decision. The policy kit is made available to the customers in both electronic and physical format. The introduction of 
electronic insurance accounts where the insurance policy is stored digitally eliminates the need for printing and despatching of the 
physical policy document.
	
Policy Servicing
	
The servicing stage involves various transactions including renewing the contract through payment of renewal premiums, financial 
transactions such as switching of funds in unit linked products or servicing requests from policyholders such as address change, 
nominee change etc.
	
As life insurance is a long-term contract, the Company strives to be connected with the customer through the policy life cycle and 
service the various needs that customers may have from time to time. Apart from the servicing option available at the Company’s 
branches, the Company provides end to end digital solutions for policy servicing through its website, mobile app or platforms of 
its partners and web-aggregators. Through the initiative of Insta-insure, instant policy issuance is offered without the need for a 
customer to travel to respective branches. Self-help modules have been developed so customers can be serviced anytime, anywhere 
24/7. To the extent permitted, the Company also communicates with customers via SMS and emails to reduce the use of paper. 
The Company provides 24/7 customer service through a Chatbot named LiGo which has responded to customer queries with 91% 
accuracy. With Artificial Intelligence, the Company has increased productivity by reducing the time taken for business activities 
including underwriting. The customer usage of self-help digital options percentage stood at 91.5% for this year.
23
	
The Company actively participates in the ‘Digital India’ initiative and makes every effort in providing all its services digitally so 
customers do not need to travel or engage physically. These digital solutions not only reduce solid waste through avoidance of paper 
but also reduces carbon emission by avoiding the need to travel to branches/offices.
	
Maturity, Surrender and Claims Settlement
	
Depending on the nature and design of the product and policy terms and conditions, an insurance policy may be closed on maturity 
or on surrender by the policyholder or on settlement of the claim in the event of death of the person insured. An insurance policy may 
also terminate on specific events as specified in the terms and conditions of the contract. In the event of such closures, payment as 
per the terms and conditions are made in lieu of termination of the contract. A communication with the details of the payment is sent 
to the policyholder or the claimant or the nominee as the case may be.
	
Maturity refers to termination of the contract at the end of the premium payment period or the period of the contract for which it 
was drawn. During policy surrender, the customer however voluntarily chooses to terminate the policy before the completion of 
the contract period. In the case of a maturity claim, benefits are passed on to the customer as per the terms and conditions of the 
insurance product at the end of the maturity period. The same process is applicable for policy surrender as per policy terms and 
conditions but in this case the pay-out is made before the maturity period or the expiry of the contract. The Company promotes 
electronic payments as it is efficient and hassle-free as compared with the conventional method of cheque printing and dispatch. 
Customers are encouraged to opt for receiving online payment.
	
Claims settlement is the most important “moment of truth” fulfilled by an insurance company. In the event of illness, hospitalisation or 
death of the insured, claims are processed in accordance with the product terms and conditions. Policyholders/claimants may register 
their claims physically at the branches or through the distribution partner or on the website or mobile application. Post receipt of the 
requisite documents and after ascertaining the eligibility of the claim, the claim is processed electronically or where bank account 
details are unavailable, the payment is made through cheque.
	
Grievance Redressal Mechanism 
	
We have implemented a robust grievance redressal framework to resolve complaints from customers. This system works on standard 
operating procedures that involves receipt of the complaint followed by prompt action to ensure effective resolution of the grievance. 
Grievances are usually handled through the call centre or the branch and prompt response is provided to the customer through email 
communication. 
	
A dedicated and independent grievance management team ensures that all customer grievances are addressed in a timely manner 
with appropriate resolution. The Company strictly adheres to regulatory guidelines in ensuring fair, efficient and timely resolution of 
customer complaints. 
	
The summary of grievances are reviewed by the Board Customer Service and Policyholders’ Protection Committee and reported to 
the Board.

All employees of the Company undergo an annual performance appraisal process as determined by the Company. The Company has an established performance and 
talent management framework. The objectives of this framework are three-fold: a) To ensure alignment to the Company’s KPIs as set out by the Board and ensure clarity 
of purpose across levels b) To create a talent pipeline by nurturing high potential talent c) To enable differentiated rewards and capability development to help ring fence 
talent for the future. The Company has a structured performance management process aligned to the Company KPIs as set out by the Board.  These are then cascaded 
in the form of functional KPIs through the Balanced Scorecard process and further as individual KPIs based on the nature of role and responsibilities.
27
	
The Company has a well-defined succession planning process to facilitate the development and career planning of high potential talent, mitigate vacancy risk arising 
from attrition and ensure business continuity. A framework is in place for identifying key roles and measuring the depth of leadership cover for each role by identifying 
successors who can move to the role either immediately or over a period of time or by restructuring the role to mitigate vacancy risk and ensure business continuity, 
where successors are not immediately available to fill the vacancy. Based on the number of successors identified, their readiness to move to the next level role and the 
feasibility of conducting restructuring in the event of the role holder’s exit, a score called the Leadership Cover Index (LCI) is derived for each key role. An annual exercise 
is carried out to identify the LCI for each key role along with the talent development actions, and is reviewed annually by the Board Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee.

With regards to internal mechanisms centered around the policies, the Company has constituted the Governance team as a part of 
the Human Resources function to ensure that all employee related grievances are suitably investigated and action is taken as per due 
process stipulated in the Employee Service Rules. Employees are encouraged to register any grievance that they may have against 
any employee, agent, partner and customer or report any breach of the Code or any of the Company policies. The Company has 
instituted “egov” portal on the Company’s intranet for employees to record and register their grievance. The egov portal serves as 
the repository of all relevant information pertaining to each grievance and for purpose of monitoring and tracking of all grievances for 
timely resolution. Employees may also write their grievance over email to employeeassist@iciciprulife.com or raise their grievance 
through their line hierarchy or Human Resources. Anonymous grievances are also recorded in the egov portal. On receipt of the 
grievance, the Governance team examines the nature and type of the grievance and accordingly, classifies the same under five 
categories – Fraud, Behavior, Other Code violation, Policy or Process violation and Sexual Harassment. For grievances pertaining to 
sexual harassment, the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is constituted in line with the provisions of The Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, 2013 to investigate the case.
	
We have a Board approved Grievance redressal policy for customers that includes the redressal framework for ensuring prompt and 
effective resolution of grievances. Our service recovery team is responsible for investigating, evaluating and deciding on the resolution 
of grievances. The service recovery team operates as an independent central grievance redressal unit to ensure that the resolution 
provided for each and every grievance is done in a fair and impartial manner. We offer multiple channels to report grievances such 
as branches, e-mail/letter, website/mobile app, contact centre, sourcing intermediary and social media. Our approach to grievance 
resolution includes a thorough review of the profile and concerns of the customer, the product offered, fact-finding and evidence 
gathering both from the customer and sourcing intermediary (as maybe applicable). We aim to offer the best possible solution to the 
customer after taking into account the findings of the investigation and extant policies, rules and guidelines. In case of dissatisfaction 
with the resolution, the customer has the option to escalate to the next level for redressal.
	
The Company’s CSR policy is our commitment to provide resources and support activities focused on enhancing economic and social 
development by supporting programmes around the focus areas of education, skill development and sustainable livelihood, health 
care for the under-privileged, encouraging employee volunteering and extending support for disaster relief and rehabilitation. The 
Company contributes 70% of its annual CSR budget to ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth (ICICI Foundation) which undertakes CSR 
initiatives for the ICICI group and the balance 30% of the CSR funds is deployed to directly undertake various initiatives to serve the 
underserved.

customer’s concern and investigation through fact-finding and evidence. We offer the best possible solution after a review of 
the customer’s profile and product offered after taking feedback from the sourcing intermediary (as applicable). If a customer
