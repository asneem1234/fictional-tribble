Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
its diverse and expanding portfolio of businesses, 
prioritises embedding sustainability and building 
resilience in the supply chain as part of its Sustainability 
2.0 vision.
Farmers constitute a vital part of ITC’s supply chain, and 
the close linkages between ITC’s Businesses and Indian 
agriculture provides a unique opportunity to engage 
with farmers across the country and help address 
some of the sustainability challenges confronting them, 
and at the same time create sustainable and resilient 
Agri-value chains for ITC’s Agri, FMCG and Paper 
Businesses.
Leveraging the Company’s enterprise strengths and its 
large presence in rural communities, ITC has, over the 
years designed and implemented large scale programmes 
on sustainable agriculture. The focus of these interventions 
has been largely around improving farmer livelihoods, 
increasing agricultural productivity, strengthening regional 
water security and addressing the challenge of climate 
change and enhancing Agri-resilience.
Note: For more details on ITC’s sustainable sourcing 
practices pertaining to key Agri value chains and key 
value chain partners like third party manufacturers, 
refer to ‘Next-Generation Agriculture’ and ‘Inclusive 
Value Chains’ sections of ITC Sustainability & Integrated 
Report 2022.
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced
sustainably?
The supply chains of most ITC’s Businesses are 
vertically integrated, which facilitate optimum 
utilisation of raw materials, recycling of waste as well 
as efficient logistics operations. Farmers constitute 
a vital part of ITC’s supply chain. Accordingly, the 
Company focuses extensively on enhancing the 
sustainability of its Agri-based supply chain. During FY 
2021-22, ITC processed around 2,500 kilo tonnes of raw 
materials, out of which nearly 97% were sourced from 
Agro/Forestry based renewable sources. 
ITC’s leading Agri value chains are also certified as per 
renowned global standards like Rainforest Alliance 
(RFA), Global G.A.P Certification, Fairtrade, USDA 
Organic and India Organic.
Note: For more details on ITC’s sustainable sourcing 
practices, refer to the ‘Next-Generation Agriculture’, 
‘Inclusive Value Chains’ and ‘Certifications’ sections of 
ITC Sustainability & Integrated Report 2022.
3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim
your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) 
E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
ITC has achieved Plastic Neutrality in FY 2021-
22 by implementing an integrated solid waste 
management programme that incorporates unique and 
multidimensional initiatives. The Company collected 
and sustainably managed more than 54,000 tonnes of 
plastic waste across 35 States and Union Territories. 
The amount of plastic waste managed exceeded the 
amount of plastic packaging utilised by ITC during the 
year, enabling the Company to achieve the milestone of 
Plastic Neutrality.
For more than a decade, the Company has been running 
a holistic 360° solid waste management programme 
that is based on the principles of a circular economy and 
encompasses the entire waste value chain.
ITC has adopted a multipronged approach to reduce 
plastic in the Company’s operations spanning FMCG, 
Hotels, Paperboards and Packaging. This includes 
creating robust next generation environment friendly 
packaging solutions, mega-scale waste collection 
programmes under its flagship waste management 
initiative ‘ITC WOW – Well Being Out of Waste’ as well 
as focused interventions in rural areas; a culture of 
plastic-free operations - in line with its philosophy 
of ‘Responsible Luxury’ to eliminate single use 
plastic usage in ITC Hotels; and innovative models 
for sustainability which have plastic reduction and 
management at their core. Within its operations, ITC 
has been recycling more than 99% of the solid waste for 
more than a decade.
For further details, refer to the ‘Sustainably Managing 
Waste’ and ‘Mission Sunehra Kal for Sustainable & 
Inclusive Growth’ sections of ITC Sustainability & 
Integrated Report 2022.
4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan

ITC is in compliance with the requirements of Plastic 
Waste Management Rules, 2016 and subsequent 
amendments.
Leadership Indicators
1.	 Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/ 
Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)?
The Company has initiated Life Cycle Assessments 
(LCA) of its products and services since 2010 with an 
XIV
REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022
Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
objective to evaluate the impacts and identify areas 
for improvement in the value chain. So far, LCAs have 
been carried out for key product categories from 
Paperboards and Specialty Papers Business (Carte 
Lumina, Safire Graphik, Liquid Packaging Board etc.), 
Personal Care Products Business (Superia Soap) and 
Branded Packaged Foods Businesses (Bingo! Potato 
chips). LCA studies will continue to be used as a tool for 
assessing environmental footprint of products/services 
going forward.
2. If there are any significant social or environmental
concerns and/or risks arising from production or
disposal of your products/services, as identified in the
Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through
any other means, briefly describe the same along with
action taken to mitigate the same.
The Company has put in place robust guidelines and 
standards, that are benchmarked against international 
best practices, with defined Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) for identifying and mitigating both 
social and environmental risks. LCA studies have 
also been carried out for some of the Company’s key 
products for identifying additional opportunities to 
reduce environmental impact across the value chain. 
These assessments have enabled identification of 
concrete solutions towards more efficient packaging 
designs, loading efficiencies in transportation. Studies 
conducted on the selected products also provided 
valuable insights which are duly considered for new 
product development and design. Several sustainable 
products were developed during the year. For example, 
Savlon Pichkiao (easy-squeeze pack), an innovative 
pump-free format that is completely reusable, refillable 
and easy to carry, and made with 22% less plastic 
compared to ordinary pump pack was launched last 
year. The pack also bagged the prestigious ‘Diamond 
Finalist Award’ at the Dow Packaging Innovation Awards 
2021, demonstrating excellence across all the three 
criteria of the award – Sustainability, Technological 
Advancement and Enhanced User Experience.
3. Percentage of recycled or reused input material
to total material (by value) used in production (for
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for
service industry).
Nearly 97% of ITC’s input material is sourced from 
renewable sources consisting primarily of pulpwood 
and other Agri products. During FY 2021-22, the Kovai 
Unit of ITC’s Paperboards & Specialty Papers Business 
sourced over 85,000 tonnes of waste paper from 
external sources, which constituted over 75% of the 
Unit’s total input materials.

and safely disposed.
During FY 2021-22, ITC expanded its plastic waste management programme across the country covering all plastic 
waste categories including rigids, flexibles and Tetra Pak packaging waste. The Company collected and sustainably 
managed more than 54,000 tonnes of plastic waste across 35 States and Union Territories. The amount of plastic 
waste managed exceeded the amount of plastic packaging utilised by ITC during the year, enabling the Company to 
achieve the milestone of Plastic Neutrality.  In FY 2020-21, more than 31,000 tonnes of post-consumer plastic waste 
from 24 States and Union Territories was collected and sustainably managed, which was equivalent to more than 80% 
of plastic packaging films (flexibles) utilised by ITC during FY 2020-21. 
The Company also has mechanisms to recover expired, damaged and discarded products from the market. Depending 
on the product, both the product and the packaging material waste are sustainably recycled/safely disposed.

management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage such system?
Yes, ITC has implemented occupational health and 
safety management system.
The Company believes that a safe and healthy work 
environment is a pre-requisite for employee well-being, 
and the adoption of best practices in occupational 
health and safety have a direct impact on its overall 
performance. It helps in attracting and retaining quality 
talent, besides being the duty of the Company as a 
responsible corporate citizen.
ITC endeavours that Environment, Health & Safety 
(EHS) standards at all its units are ahead of applicable 
legislation and regulations, and Standards and Codes, 
and are benchmarked against international best 
practices across sectors in which it operates. ITC’s 
approach to occupational health & safety standards 
is articulated in the Board approved Environment, 
Health and Safety Policy. It is based on an EHS 
management system that emphasises on enhancing 
EHS performance by setting objectives and targets and 
continually monitoring key performance indicators. 
Further, it promotes a culture of safety through 
behaviour change programmes and by providing 
appropriate training to employees as well as service 
providers’ employees, while continually investing in 
state-of-the-art technology and in developing 
human capital.
EHS requirements are integrated at the design stage for 
all new investments. Compliance with EHS standards 
during the construction phase as well as in operation 
phase of ITC units, Hotels, Warehouses and Offices is 
ensured by implementing project EHS management 
systems and through established EHS management 
systems with designated roles and responsibilities for 
competent resources respectively.
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
ITC has identified the EHS Risk Management framework 
as one of the integral steps towards building a robust 
safety management system. This framework entails 
a set of processes for continual risk identification, 
assessment and mitigation, with active participation 
of the workforce in each of its facilities. Shop floor 
processes in this regard include hazard spotting tours, 
suggestion schemes, daily briefings and periodic EHS 
committee meetings in which employees participate. In 
addition, all ITC Units undergo periodic Environment, 
Health & Safety audits at the Business as well as 
Corporate level to verify compliance with standards.

stakeholder groups of the entity.
In line with the Board approved policy on stakeholder 
engagement, ITC has evolved structured framework for 
engaging with its stakeholders and fostering enduring 
relationships with each one of them. ITC’s engagement 
approach is anchored on the principles of materiality,

For more details on consultation mechanisms and key 
issues discussed with the stakeholder groups, refer to 
‘Stakeholder Engagement’ section of ITC Sustainability 
& Integrated Report 2022. 
Leadership Indicators
1.	 Provide the processes for consultation 
between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations 
provided to the Board.
ITC believes that an effective stakeholder engagement 
process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal 
of inclusive growth. In this context, the Company has 
laid down a four layered mechanism to deal with the 
aspect of stakeholder engagement. 
The Board, through the CSR and Sustainability 
Committee, inter alia, reviews, monitors and provides 
strategic direction to the Company’s CSR and 
sustainability practices towards fulfilling its Triple 
Bottom Line objectives. Half-yearly reports on the 
progress made by the Company in this regard are 
placed by the CMC before the CSR and Sustainability 
Committee. The CMC in turn has constituted the 
Sustainability Compliance Review Committee (SCRC), 
comprising senior members of management, which 
evaluates and monitors compliance with the Policy 
formulated in this connection. The SCRC places a 
quarterly report on the subject before the CMC. 
2.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used 
to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, 
provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
The Company believes that an effective stakeholder 
engagement process is necessary for achieving its 
sustainability goal of inclusive growth. Accordingly, 
it anchors stakeholder engagement on the following 
principles:
a)	 Materiality – Prioritised consideration of the 
economic, environmental and social impacts 
identified to be important to the stakeholders as 
well as the organisation.
b)	 Completeness – Understanding key concerns of 
stakeholders and their expectations.
c)	 Responsiveness – Responding coherently and 
transparently to such issues and concerns.
The Company has put in place systems and procedures 
to identify, prioritise and address the needs and 
concerns of its stakeholders across businesses and 
units in a continuous, consistent and systematic 
manner. It has implemented mechanisms to facilitate 
effective dialogue with all stakeholders across 
businesses, identify material concerns and their 
resolution in an equitable and transparent manner. 
These measures have helped the Company develop 
strong relationships, which have stood the test of 
time. Select examples of how stakeholder inputs have 
been incorporated into ITC policies and activities are 
presented below:
1.	 Investors: In addition to its ongoing interactions 
with analysts representing institutional equity 
investors on a regular basis post-results, the Company 
has, over the last two years, been supplementing 
its quarterly earnings press releases with detailed 
investor presentations. This is but one example of how 
the Company has refined its processes emanating 
from interactions with them. This year, the Company 
organised its first-ever ‘Institutional Investors and 
Financial Analysts Day’ for institutional investors, a 
well attended programme that drew participation from 
domestic as well as global investors, to provide deeper 
insights into ITC’s Corporate Strategy and operating 
segments including, inter alia, their competitive 
strengths, unique value propositions and key drivers 
of growth and profitability. These initiatives have been 
much appreciated by the investor community. The 
Company is well-recognised for its ESG credentials, 
and is acknowledged as one of the pioneers of adopting 
the Triple Bottom Line philosophy in India. Recognising 
the growing investor interest in this area and factoring 
in feedback from investor interactions, the Company 
also periodically reviews, refines and updates its ESG 
policies on the Company’s portal, as it progresses 
towards its clearly-defined 2030 goals.
2.	 Customers & Value Chain Partners: Customers, 
Consumers and Value Chain Partners are some of ITC’s 
core stakeholders. Various tech-enabled avenues have 
been constructed to constantly receive feedback and 
ideas from these stakeholders. 
 XXII
REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022
Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
A portal called Aikyam, captures ideas and feedback 
provided by our partners, which are evaluated and taken 
forward by the business. This has enabled both product 
enhancements and process efficiencies.
Rapidly evolving consumer needs are constantly 
being monitored through social listening, in-depth 
immersions and are being carefully synthesised to 
transform into relevant solutions. Some examples are 
mentioned below:
•	 Launching of products like ITC Masterchef’s 
‘IncrEdible’ Plant-based range, a sustainable 
alternative to meat. This range supports consumers 
with vegan preferences, and also helps in reducing 
carbon footprint.
•	 Providing choices to consumers with specific needs 
like –
	
-	 Aashirvaad Svasti Milk for lactose intolerant 
consumers.
	
-	 Aashirvaad’s Organic Range and Nature’s Super 
Foods Range for consumers looking for healthier 
options.
•	 YiPPee! A Better World programme for children that 
entails a series of workshops for creating awareness 
on segregation at source, and arts and crafts 
sessions for teaching them how to make useful 
objects out of waste materials available at home. 
3.	 Employees: ITC is committed to creating an 
inclusive, equitable and diverse workplace where 
every employee feels valued and included. This 
requires continuous engagement with employees and 
understand their experiences. This understanding 
enables ITC to refresh its policies, and ensures that the 
important enablers of inclusion, such as 
work-life balance, flexibility in work and benefits are 
addressed in a relevant, timely and effective fashion. 
A series of focused group discussions were conducted 
to understand the employee experiences whilst 
framing the policies on Gender Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion. More than 150 employees (around 10% of 
the target population) were part of the discussions. 
The discussions gave rich insight about the priority 
issues such as flexible work arrangements and 
employee benefits across various life stages such as 
maternity. Such nuanced insights enabled the policies 
to effectively address the requirements of employees.
4.	 Community: A comprehensive stakeholder 
engagement exercise was first undertaken in 2015-
16, wherein core areas were defined and needs of the 
communities residing in these areas, that is, factory 
and agri-catchments were identified and prioritised. It 
emerged that one of the overarching problems faced 
by the communities were related to lack of sustainable 
livelihoods today and tomorrow. Based on this, Core 
Area Perspective Plan (CAPP) was conceptualised and 
Two Horizons approach to address the needs of the 
community was developed and adopted. 
During FY 2021-22, changes in emerging needs and 
priorities of communities was revisited through CAPP 
2.0 by carrying out an exploratory exercise across 
3,718 villages in 21 factory and 7 agri-catchments 
with following objectives:
•	 To revisit coverage and community needs in the 
changed context;
•	 To assess reasons for not achieving the earlier 
planned outcomes (if any); and
•	 To re-strategise ITC’S Social Investments 
Programme (SIP) themes and approach based on 
the findings.
The CAPP 2.0 exercise was carried out by involving 
third party organisations and NGO partners under close 
supervision of SIP’s state teams who were present 
during the data collection exercise. The assessment 
involved primary and secondary data collection using 
quantitative and qualitative tools through 
6,771 Household Surveys, 169 Key Informant 
Interviews, 656 Focus Group Discussions and 
168 Participatory Rural Appraisal Exercises.
The above process ensures that stakeholder 
inputs, suggestions and needs are appropriately 
incorporated in SIP’s interventions. For example, 
SIP’s water stewardship programme initially focused 
on supply side augmentation through watershed 
development. However, it emerged during the 
interactions with stakeholders and through studies 
that a more comprehensive approach is required 
for drought proofing agriculture and achieving 
positive water balance. To address the issue, river 
basin level interventions were planned and demand 
side management of water use in agriculture was 
incorporated in the programme. Similarly, in SIP’s 
Vocational Training programme, the trades are decided 
based on regular community feedback and market 
demand in specific geographical regions. For instance, 
demand for bedside nursing increased during the 
pandemic, hence training on bedside nursing trade 
was amplified. Similarly, based on the feedback 
received from students placed in various organisations, 
post-placement assistance was incorporated in the 
Vocational Training programme.
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement 
with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/marginalised stakeholder groups.
ITC’s SIP adopts a bottom-up approach to identify and 
address the emerging needs of the community. Presented

hereunder are a few instances wherein changing 
community needs in unprecedented pandemic situation 
were addressed through modifications in ongoing 
programme components as well as through introducing 
entirely new activities under the programmes.
•	
Digitalisation Activities: The unprecedented situation 
created by the pandemic posed several challenges for 
SIP operations and necessitated a rethink and redesign 
of some interventions. The SIP team proactively 
addressed these challenges through contextual 
solutions and actions planned in consultation with 
key stakeholders. Currently, there are several tools in 
practice for Learning Management and for enablement 
of programme implementation.
a.	 Learning Management Systems have been 
developed in the form of web portal for training 
of teachers in West Bengal, vocational training of 
students in Assam, Karnataka and West Bengal, 
and training of Urban Local Bodies on Solid Waste 
Management in Uttar Pradesh.
b.	 Digital Platforms for Enabling Programme 
Implementation: Application (App) based training of 
Anganwadi workers on Mother & Child Healthcare 
in Assam and West Bengal, App for command 
area in Maharashtra, App for crop survey in Tamil 
Nadu, App for Soil and Moisture Conservation, and 
Swachh Mitra App for collection and reporting of 
daily waste data in Uttarakhand.
•	
Smart Mom Intervention: ITC’s education 
programme adopted remote engagement activities 
with children after the first wave of COVID 19 
pandemic that continued this year too. “Catch 
Up Campaign” was initiated where mohalla level 
learning camps were organised to build/rebuild 
foundational reading and math skills. Subsequently, 
when schools started re-opening, “Readiness 
campaign” was initiated to help children of grade 
1 and 2, to get ready for school by leveraging 
community support of mothers. For this, mothers’ 
groups were formed who were trained on Activity 
Based Learning method. Since the mothers 
required support for continuing Activity Based 
Learning at home, active women from these groups 
were selected as “Smart Moms” and were trained 
on the pedagogy to help other group members 
conduct learning activities for their children. This 
helped in continuing learning activities for children 
under Read India Programme despite disturbances 
of frequent lockdowns and school closures. 
•	
Small Ruminants Programme: Diversification 
of livelihoods to build resilience as well as to 
support family income emerged as one of the 
prominent needs during engagement with rural 
women. Hence, a programme was initiated to 
build capacity of rural poor women for providing 
health assistance to small ruminants like goats. 
The programme not only provided a sustainable 
livelihood option to participating women, but also 
provided opportunities for living a dignified life, and 
contribute towards household income.
Businesses should respect and promote human rights.

7.	 Does the entity have any project related to 
reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then 
provide details. 
ITC has undertaken a target of 50% reduction in Specific 
GHG Emissions (% Reduction in GHG Emissions (Scope 
1, 2) per Unit of Production) by 2030 as part of its 
Sustainability 2.0 ambitions.  Accordingly, actions are 
being undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
by investing in energy efficiency and increasing share of 
renewable energy.
Energy efficiency:
ITC Units are focusing on energy efficiency through process 
improvements and investing in new technologies. Over 
the years, ITC has implemented measures like installation 
of Vapour Absorption Machines (VAM), Automation in 
tube cleaning system of Heating, Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning (HVAC), and installation of energy efficient 
equipment such as chillers, AHUs, motors, fans, pumps, 
agitators. In FY 2021-22, the investments in energy 
conservation equipment has resulted in energy savings of 
about 87 TJ, which is equivalent to around 10,900 tonnes of 
GHG emissions.
In line with ITC’s focus on accelerating digitalisation 
across Businesses, ITC’s Paperboards and 
Specialty Papers Business is implementing several 
transformative projects leveraging Industry 4.0 
technologies across key business areas, to enhance 
productivity, reduce carbon footprint, achieve strategic 
cost efficiencies and superior product performance.
Some of the major projects undertaken by ITC’s 
Paperboards and Specialty Papers Business as part of 
its Digital Transformation Programme include process 
debottlenecking and throughput improvement for 
productivity and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), 
process capability improvement leading to reduction in 
defects and resource optimisation.
Renewable energy:
ITC has invested in renewable energy projects such as 
rooftop and offsite solar power, wind energy, and biomass 
power for meeting its energy requirements. These 
investments have helped ITC to achieve around 42% of its 
energy requirements from renewable sources.
In FY 2021-22, ITC commissioned 14.9 MW offsite solar 
project in Tamil Nadu that will cater to the electricity 
requirements for ITC’s Hotels and manufacturing Units 
of Branded Packaged Foods Businesses, Paperboards 
& Specialty Papers Business and Packaging and 
Printing Business. This project will supply about 22 
Million kWh and help ITC Units in Tamil Nadu to reach 
about 90% of its grid electricity requirements from 
renewables. Apart from supplying green electricity, 
it also includes a rainwater harvesting system that 
recharges about 2 million litres of water annually.

ITC’s Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Service 
Providers enshrines the Company’s unwavering focus 
on fair treatment, human rights, good labour practices, 
environmental conservation, health and safety. The 
Code is shared and accepted by all supply chain 
partners and service providers.
The company has been progressively increasing the coverage of its Scope 3 emissions by including more Supply 
Chain partners in its reporting boundary. The scope of coverage for Scope 3 emission is mentioned in ‘Building 
Climate Resilience’ section of ITC Sustainability & Integrated Report 2022.
While working towards reducing its emissions and greening its energy portfolio, ITC seeks to increase 
carbon sequestration by expanding forestry projects on wastelands. The Farm Forestry programme by ITC’s 
Paperboards & Specialty Papers Business was started for promoting sustainable forests management 
practices in the value chain, and securing the supply of pulpwood for its paper mills. ITC’s Social and Farm 
Forestry initiative has greened over 950,000 acres till date, with 76,608 acres of plantation added in 
FY 2021-22 resulting in 6,182 kilo tonnes of CO2 getting sequestered during the year, which is equivalent to 
more than 2 times the amount of CO2 emissions from ITC’s operations.
ITC’s Greenhouse Gas emissions (Scope 3) have been assured at the ‘Reasonable level’ by M/s Deloitte Haskins 
and Sells LLP. For more details, refer to ‘Building Climate Resilience’ section of ITC Sustainability & Integrated 
Report 2022.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022
Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
ITC has a robust process of evaluating its Suppliers 
and Service Providers before engaging with them, 
proactively making them aware of its expectations/
requirements, and seeking commitment for compliance 
through contractual agreements. ITC reserves the right 
to verify compliance with this Code at any time through 
appropriate audit and assessment mechanisms, 
including self-certification. ITC is also committed 
to reinforcing awareness of this Code amongst the 
Suppliers and Service Providers and to support them in 
this endeavour.
ITC has identified material environmental impacts 
across its value chain, and has deployed various 
mitigation and adaptation strategies.
For example, managing hazardous chemicals is not only 
important within ITC factories but also in the supply 
chain. Within the supply chain, farmers working with 
hazardous pesticides is an area of special attention. 
ITC’s approach is to eliminate or reduce the use of 
hazardous pesticides. Intensive training is conducted 
on Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which helps 
adopt a holistic approach in reducing pesticide usage 
as well as substituting such pesticides with nature-
based solutions. The training programmes also cover 
the safe handling of pesticides used and the responsible 
management of wastes generated.
For more details, refer to ‘Next-Generation Agriculture’ 
section of ITC Sustainability & Integrated Report 2022.
9.	 Percentage of value chain partners (by value of 
business done with such partners) that were assessed 
for environmental impacts.
ITC is guided by a comprehensive set of Board 
approved Sustainability Policies. The Policies outline 
the Company’s commitment to high standards on 
environment and provide the necessary framework to 
address the direct environmental impacts of Company’s 
own operations as well as progressively extend the 
efforts to its supply chain.
Key value chain partners like third party manufacturers 
are encouraged to adopt management practices 
detailed under International Standards such as ISO 
9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ITC’s Environment, 
Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. Contract 
manufacturing agreements provide for compliance 
with accepted standards on issues related to EHS, 
human rights and labour practices, and third party 
manufacturers are periodically assessed to ensure 
compliance.
Farmers constitute a major portion of ITC’s value 
chain, and accordingly the Company has deployed large 
scale programmes to both assess and address the 
environmental impacts across its key agri value chains. 
For example, ITC’s leaf tobacco value chain is assessed 
as part of the global Sustainable Tobacco Programme 
(STP 2.0) which focuses on Water, Human Rights, Crop, 
Soil, Climate Change, Natural Habitats, Livelihoods 
and Governance. For more details, refer to the ‘Next-
Generation Agriculture’ section of ITC Sustainability & 
Integrated Report 2022.
As a part of reporting for supply chain, ITC has 
instituted systems to report environmental data for 
key Third Party Manufacturing (TPM) units and plans 
to progressively expand its reporting boundary. ITC 
also supports its TPM units by providing knowledge 
support in specific areas like energy, water and waste 
management. Through monitoring and reporting of 
environmental related data, and through sharing of 
good practices, ITC aims to positively influence the 
performance of its supply chain partners.
Businesses, when engaging in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a manner that is 
responsible and transparent.

Do you have a preferential procurement policy 
where you give preference to purchase from suppliers 
comprising marginalised/vulnerable groups? (Yes/No): 
The Board approved Policy on Sustainable Supply Chain 
and Responsible Sourcing defines the supply chain 
which includes farmers. ITC is committed to collaborate 
with farmers to make them more sustainable and help 
build their adaptive capacity and resilience to emerging 
risks like climate change and water stress and other 
extreme weather events. It is also working towards

The Social Forestry programme focuses on creating 
commercially viable land use options for small landholder 
farmers through tree-based farming to diversify income 
from land while ensuring food, fodder and fuelwood 
security. Till date, ITC’s Social and Farm Forestry 
programme has together greened over 950,000 acres, 
generating about 173 million-person-days of employment.
Till date, ITC has received Forest Stewardship Council® 
- Forest Management (FSC®-FM) certification for over 
1.25 lakh acres of plantations involving over 30,000 
farmers. During FY 2021-22, over 320,000 tonnes of 
FSC® certified wood were procured from these certified 
plantations.
ITC encourages competency development among 
local vendors and its vendor base includes medium 
and small-scale enterprises that are proximate to its 
manufacturing locations. These initiatives are aligned 
to national priorities of ‘Make in India’, ‘Atmanirbhar 
Bharat’ as well. ITC also works in close partnership 
with small-scale units in businesses such as Safety 
Matches, and Education and Stationery Products. 
These partnerships have significantly enhanced 
capabilities and competitiveness of a number of units 
in these sectors.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2022
Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
In the social sector, the two most important stakeholders of ITC are:
•	
Rural communities with whom the Company’s agri-businesses have forged long and enduring partnerships 
through crop development and procurement activities; and  
•	
Communities residing in close proximity to our manufacturing units, situated in urban and semi-rural locations.
The beneficiaries of ITC’s CSR programmes from the stakeholder communities belong to the under privileged 
sections of the society, and are primarily small & marginal farmers who face the challenge of securing sustainable 
livelihoods. The challenge of securing sustainable livelihoods is addressed through the Two Horizon approach of 
making today’s dominant source(s) of livelihoods sustainable; and creating capabilities for wealth generation and 
employment for tomorrow.
The Two Horizon strategy has necessitated an integrated approach to development involving several interventions. 
Presented below are the number of beneficiaries for key interventions and proportion of beneficiaries belonging to
