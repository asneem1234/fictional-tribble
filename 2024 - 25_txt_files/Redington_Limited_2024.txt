Directors also submit an annual declaration under the Company’s Code of Conduct, which requires that Directors avoid any 
activity that could create a conflict of interest between the personal interest of the Director and the business interests of the 
Company,affirming their commitment to act in the best interests of the Company and avoid situations that may lead to a conflict 
of interest. Senior Management is also required to confirm annually that they have not entered into any material, financial, or 
commercial transactions that could potentially conflict with the interests of the Company. During Board meetings, Directors 
abstain from deliberation and voting on matters in which they are concerned or interested. To facilitate ongoing monitoring, the 
Corporate Secretarial team maintains a comprehensive database of the interests disclosed by the Directors and KMPs. This 
database is shared with the Finance department, which flags the relevant parties in the financial system to ensure effective 
tracking of any transactions involving them.
