8- Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and  
harassment cases.
The Company is committed to ensuring the safety, dignity, and rights of all employees and has established 
robust mechanisms to protect complainants in cases of discrimination and harassment. Strict confidentiality is 
maintained throughout the grievance resolution process, and any attempt to intimidate, retaliate against, or 
victimize the complainant is treated as a serious violation of the Company’s Code of Conduct and is subject to 
disciplinary action.
The following procedures are adhered to:
• All complaints are addressed in a timely, sensitive, and impartial manner.
• Upon the request of the aggrieved employee, the matter may be resolved through mutual conciliation prior to 
the initiation of a formal inquiry. It is explicitly ensured that no monetary settlement shall form the basis for such 
conciliation.
• If a reconciliation is successfully reached, the Internal Committee prepares a formal written agreement reflecting 
the terms of the settlement. This agreement is signed by both parties and witnessed by the Committee and 
STATUTORY REPORTS
107
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
subsequently submitted to the management for record and implementation.
• The Committee ensures that copies of the settlement agreement—marked as unclassified, restricted, protected, 
or confidential as appropriate—are shared with both the complainant and the respondent.
• Once a settlement through conciliation is achieved, no further inquiry into the complaint shall be conducted.
These measures reflect the Company’s unwavering commitment to fostering a safe, inclusive, and respectful work 
environment where employees feel empowered to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.
