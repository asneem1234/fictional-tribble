BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a 
company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, 
social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

(Indicate

implications)
1
Strategic 
and Business 
Decision
R
This risk arises from poor decision-
making, misaligned investments, and 
inefficient resource allocation, which 
can negatively affect the Company’s 
long-term success and sustainability. 
Additionally, delays, insufficient team 
capabilities, and inadequate oversight 
can lead to increased costs and errors 
in project execution.
Ensured timely approval and 
alignment of the annual strategic 
plan with the Board, followed 
by the creation of a detailed 
execution plan with clear 
milestones and timelines. 
Regular monitoring through 
monthly reviews, along with a 
robust reporting mechanism, will 
track performance and enable 
swift corrective actions.
Additionally, ongoing 
assessment of industry trends 
and competitor activities will 
inform necessary adjustments 
to strategies, while ensuring 
the organisational structure 
and processes are optimised 
to support the achievement of 
strategic goals.

2
Competition 
and Market 
Saturation
R
Intense competition and market 
saturation pose major challenges, 
driving pricing pressure, reduced 
market share, and limited growth 
opportunities. With most customers 
already served, companies must 
constantly innovate or enter new 
markets to stay competitive and 
profitable.
To enhance competitiveness 
have strengthen brand 
positioning with distinct 
messaging and continuously 
monitor market trends and 
competitor activities. 
Leverage insights from new 
hires, benchmark emerging 
technologies with the I-Tech 
team, and use a centralised 
platform supported by 
advanced analytical tools to 
collect and analyse intelligence 
effectively.
Negative
3
Intellectual 
Property 
Infringement
R
Inadequate protection or infringement 
of intellectual property rights can lead 
to legal disputes, financial losses, and 
damage to the Company's competitive 
advantage and reputation.
3i Infotech has established 
procedures to manage 
intellectual property effectively, 
including employee training and 
ongoing evaluations to ensure 
compliance.
Negative
4
Regulatory 
Compliance
R
Non-compliance with new legislation 
in certain jurisdictions can lead to 
penalties, damage to one’s reputation, 
and potential criminal consequences.
By implementing a 
comprehensive monitoring 
system, 3i Infotech can enable 
efficient global compliance 
oversight.
Moreover, by engaging external 
consulting firms, the Company 
can ensure the continual 
updating of Compliance 
Obligation Registers with the 
latest regulations.
Negative
5
Third-Party 
Risk
R
Inadequate management of third-party 
risks can result in service disruptions, 
data breaches, and potential legal and 
financial liabilities for the Company.
3i Infotech conducts due 
diligence on third-party 
vendors and has established 
contingency plans to manage 
disruptions. 
Clear SLA is defined to outline 
performance expectations and 
security standards. Regular 
audits and performance 
assessments are carried out to 
manage such risks.
Negative
6
Key 
Management 
Personnel 
(KMP) and 
Senior 
Management 
Risk
R
The sudden exit of key management 
personnel without a ready successor 
can disrupt leadership, hinder decision-
making, and weaken stakeholder 
confidence. This risk is amplified by 
SEBI’s LODR mandate to fill such 
roles within three months, with non-
compliance leading to penalties and 
reputational damage. Additionally, a 
KMP lacking a strong supporting team 
can further stall operations, worsen 
inefficiencies, and impact long-term 
organisational stability.
A structured succession plan 
supported by a centralised talent 
repository is created to ensure 
timely filling of critical roles. 
Focused on retaining key 
talent through engagement 
and growth initiatives, while 
developing replacement 
plans and role benchmarks to 
maintain leadership continuity.

7
Human 
Resource 
Management
R
Challenges in hiring top talent, poor 
lifecycle management, high employee 
turnover, and skill gaps, which can lead 
to vacancies, decreased productivity, 
increased costs, project delays, and 
reduced organisational agility, hindering 
growth and competitiveness.
Hiring channels have been 
strengthened through strategic 
subscriptions to premium job 
portals and talent platforms. 
Referral programmes and 
internal job postings have been 
enhanced, while compensation 
has been aligned with market 
benchmarks to retain top talent. 
Investments in platforms 
like Coursera and Udemy 
have supported upskilling, 
with structured learning 
plans addressing individual 
development needs. 
The ESOP policy has been 
revamped to reward high 
performers, and leadership 
development has been 
prioritised. 
Proactive hiring efforts include 
building strong talent pipelines 
and reviving the Management 
Trainee programme.
Negative
8
Cyber Security
R
Improper access controls, non-
standardised security protocols, and 
unsecured mobile communication 
platforms increase cybersecurity risks, 
leading to potential data breaches, 
regulatory non-compliance, and legal or 
reputational damage.
VAPT testing is performed 
on software, with Role-Based 
Access Control, restricted 
Bluetooth and USB access, 
limited external mail access, 
no Wi-Fi access on company 
cell phones, and email flows 
monitored through a security 
gateway.
Negative
9
Data Privacy
R
Data privacy risks arises from 
unauthorised access to sensitive 
information due to weak security, data 
breaches, or mishandling, and are 
heightened when third-party vendors 
lack proper protocols, potentially 
leading to legal penalties and loss of 
client trust.
Security is enhanced through 
encryption, multi-factor 
authentication, and secure 
storage, while ensuring vendor 
compliance, upgrading servers 
for data integrity, implementing 
a privacy policy, training 
employees, and adhering to 
legal regulation.
Negative
10
Country
R
Country risk involves potential financial 
losses due to political, economic, or 
social instability, impacting businesses 
with international operations. It includes 
threats like asset expropriation, trade 
restrictions, or currency devaluation, 
which can disrupt markets and erode 
investor confidence. For IT companies, 
outsourcing to foreign countries adds 
exposure to such risks, especially amid 
policy changes or economic uncertainty 
in the host nation.
Expert consultants have been 
assigned in each country to 
manage local compliance. 
Regular assessment is done with 
respect to business practices 
and investments have been 
diversified across multiple 
markets.

responsive to stakeholder concerns and feedback.)
Essential Indicators

stakeholders refer to individuals within the organisation or team with whom the Company maintains frequent interactions and 
greater accessibility, thereby exerting more influence. External stakeholders, conversely, are those outside the organisation with 
whom the Company maintains business relationships, though with relatively less direct control.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The process for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics begins with the 
development of a stakeholder engagement plan. This plan specifies the frequency of communication, the relevant individuals from 
both sides in each business segment, and the modes of engagement, such as questionnaires, interviews, periodic meetings, and 
mailers. It also outlines the decisions and approvals required from decision-makers.
	
Once consultations are delegated, feedback is compiled and presented to the Board, ensuring that regular and accurate interactions 
with stakeholders take place. This bi-directional communication includes collecting feedback, suggestions, and complaints, as well 
as providing updates on how their concerns are addressed. It is essential that stakeholders, regardless of race, gender, culture, or 
language, have an open channel to express their opinions.
2. 	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes/No).	
	
Yes
	
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity. 
	
The satisfaction and performance of stakeholders play a crucial role in the organisation’s success, requiring continuous monitoring. 
Periodic assessments, through methods such as public surveys, audits, and evaluations, are vital. When necessary, corrective 
actions should be implemented to achieve desired outcomes or fulfil stakeholder expectations. Moreover, it is essential to provide 
stakeholders with updates on the status of commitments made to them.
