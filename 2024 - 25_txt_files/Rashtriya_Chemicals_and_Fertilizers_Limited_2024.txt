The Company is running Two Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STPs) at Trombay Unit with each plant having 
capacity to treat around 22.75 million Litres per 
Day (MLD) of sewage received from MCGM which 
otherwise would have been drained into the sea 
after preliminary treatment. The STP plants treat 
waste sewage generated in the city and convert it 
into treated water. Both plants together generate 
about 30 MLD of treated water which is being used 
in our plants as process water. Both STP plants of the 
Company are of great value to residents of Mumbai 
and Society at large besides improving reliability of 
operations of RCF Trombay Unit. During the year 
2024-25, about 7983 Million litres of treated water 
was generated at both STP plants. The Company has 
signed MoU with M/s BPCL on 14th January 2025 for 
supply of additional 2 MLD of treated water from RCF 
STP to BPCL Mumbai Refinery. The Company has also 
signed MoU with M/s HPCL on 31st January 2025 for 
supply of 4 MLD treated water from RCF STP to HPCL 
Mumbai Refinery.  
The Company is setting up Briquette Fired Boiler at 
RCF Thal. The low-cost steam shall help in reducing 
the variable cost of chemicals. Briquette (Biomass) or 
‘White Coal’ is made-up from agriculture and forest 
natural waste. It can be efficiently used to replace fossil 
fuel. Use of Briquettes for steam generation will reduce 
the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The project has 
been commissioned in May 2025.
As part of achieving ecologically sustainable growth, 
Company has forayed into solar power generation. 
The Company has set up a 2 MWp ground mounted 
Photovoltaic Solar power plant in Trombay Unit. In 
addition to this, the Company has commissioned 
solar rooftop facilities at Thal and Trombay with 
an aggregate capacity of 2.25 MWp. The power 
generated is used for captive consumption, thereby 
reducing Company’s power import to the equivalent 
extent. The green power generated by solar plants 
replaces the conventional power generated through 
burning of fossil fuels leading to reduction in overall 
Greenhouse gas emissions. During the year 2024-25, 
4745 MWh of solar power was generated.
During the year 2024-25, 2431 no. of Solar Renewable 
Energy Certificates (RECs) were generated.

GTG-HSRG project at Trombay and Thal has been commissioned leading to reduction of CO2, emission by 
28%. RCF has installed Gas Turbines Generators (GTG) with Heat Recovering Steam Generators each, at 
Trombay and Thal Unit. GTGs with co-generation of steam, have better efficiency compared to conventional 
turbo generator used for captive power generation and hence shall result in reduction in CO2 emission by 
around 28%.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.83
	
3R strategy (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) is employed in the different processes for effective implementation of 
waste management system at RCF. In the course of Fertilizer and Chemical manufacturing, the wastes generated 
from process and from other activities are taken care with proper planning for storage, recycle and disposal.
	
Extensive work is being done in RCF for management of waste by R&D activities and through improvement plans 
for reduction in waste generation, selection of suitable raw material for minimizing waste, R&D on waste for 
recycling and its sale as a valuable product for the end users.
	
At Trombay unit, the sludge generated from ETP contains certain amount of phosphates. It is recycled for 
manufacture of complex fertilizer Suphala (NPK15:15:15) as a source of P2O5. Sulphur sludge is generated in 
Sulphuric Acid plant is recycled to complex fertilizer plant Suphala (15:15:15) as a source of “S” in the form of 
secondary nutrient. Also, recycling of off grade/spoiled Suphala from Silo and converting it into saleable product.
	
At both units of RCF, 100% of swept urea generated in Urea Bagging plants which are collected from floor & 
equipment cleaning is recycled back in Urea manufacturing.
	
Hazardous Wastes (HW) being generated in our industry are used catalyst, spent oil, and resin. As per HW rules, 
authorization has been taken for storage and disposal. Further HW storage has been clearly marked and all the 
storage of HW (till disposal) is done as per HW rules. Total monitoring of HW material is carried out and the same

Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STPs)
RCF is operating Two Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STPs) at Trombay Unit each plant having 
capacity to treat around 22.75 Million Litres per 
Day (MLD) of sewage received from Municipal 
Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) which 
otherwise would have been drained into the sea 
after preliminary treatment. The plant serves 
as a dual purpose, it not only solves the issue 
of treatment and disposal of sewage, but also 
relieves MCGM from the obligation of supply 
of 30 MLD of industrial water and making 
equivalent amount of water available for the 
local community.
Treating 45.5 MLD of 
sewage to generate 30 
MLD treated water, helps 
in conserving important 
natural resource i.e. Water 
there by reducing waste 
water.

Annexure – ESG Materiality Assessment FY 2024-25
Setting the ESG priorities:
ESG Material Assessment identifies key Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) factors that could impact business 
and stakeholders. RCF has considered a double materiality assessment, under which ESG factor is evaluated based on 
importance to the organization and its expected influence on business success, as well as the significance of the issue 
to stakeholders and their likely impact on business success based on the organization’s efforts (or lack thereof) on this 
issue.
RCF has performed its First ESG Materiality Assessment in FY2024-25 and has identified 14 material topics which are 
important to the business and stakeholders. 
The Materiality Assessment has been done by factoring global ESG standards and framework including GRI, SASB and 
MSCI and BRSR, benchmarking against peer materiality matrix across the chemical and fertilizer sector and inputs 
from extant government regulations. 
All the ESG materiality topics identified after inputs from above sources were shared to key stakeholders through an 
online survey for determining importance to stakeholders. The stakeholder group for the survey consisted of employees 
(management and non-management), customers, dealers & distributors, and domestic and international suppliers and 
contractors.
The material topics important to the business were identified by means of engagement through senior management 
of RCF, peer analysis and inputs from methodology used by ESG Rating Agencies.
The highest material topics so identified have been specified as risk or opportunity and RCF is envisaging actions to 
mitigate the risk and leverage on the opportunities identified.
