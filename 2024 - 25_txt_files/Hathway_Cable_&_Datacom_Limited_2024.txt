Climate 
Change Action
Risk
Climate change poses significant 
threats to business continuity, 
with extreme weather events 
leading 
to 
supply 
chain 
disruptions, increased operational 
costs, and potential damage 
to 
infrastructure. 
Additionally, 
regulatory 
frameworks 
are 
evolving 
to 
enforce 
stricter 
environmental 
standards, 
making compliance essential to 
avoid legal repercussions and 
reputational damage.
The 
Company 
actively 
implements 
sustainable 
practices 
and 
assesses 
climate change impacts on 
its operations. Emphasizing 
transparency and stakeholder 
engagement, we strengthen 
our ESG Policy to guide our 
activities. 
This 
concerted 
effort 
aims 
to 
create 
sustainable 
value 
amidst 
climate challenges.
Negative
Energy 
usage and 
management
Risk
Inefficient energy management 
can lead to inflated operational 
costs 
and 
increased 
carbon 
emissions, which not only harm the 
environment but also expose the 
Company to regulatory scrutiny 
and potential penalties. As energy 
prices fluctuate, reliance on non-
renewable sources can create 
financial 
instability, 
impacting 
long-term sustainability goals.
The Company focuses on 
implementing energy-efficient 
technologies and strategizing 
the adoption of renewable 
energy sources, enhancing 
operational 
resilience 
and 
reducing 
costs. 
Building 
capacity for energy efficiency 
measures 
is 
integral 
to 
optimizing 
practices 
and 
ensuring long-term viability.
Negative
Electronic 
Waste 
Management 
and Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
The growing volume of electronic 
waste 
presents 
a 
unique 
opportunity for Hathway to lead in 
sustainability by adopting circular 
economy principles. By effectively 
managing electronic waste, the 
Company can not only reduce 
environmental impact but also tap 
into new revenue streams through 
recycling 
and 
refurbishment, 
enhancing its market position as 
a responsible business.
Hathway 
is 
establishing 
partnerships 
with 
recycling 
firms, investing in advanced 
recycling technologies, and 
developing product designs 
focused 
on 
reuse 
and 
recyclability. We implement 
take-back 
programs 
and 
educate 
consumers 
on 
responsible 
disposal 
to 
maximize value extraction.

Employee 
well-being and 
growth
Opportunity
Prioritising employee well-being 
is essential for cultivating a 
motivated workforce. A focus 
on mental health, professional 
development, 
and 
work-life 
balance can lead to higher 
productivity, lower turnover rates, 
and 
an 
enhanced 
employer 
brand. Investing in employees 
not only drives innovation but 
also 
positions 
the 
Company 
as an attractive employer in a 
competitive job market.
Hathway 
implements 
comprehensive 
wellness 
programs, 
offering 
professional 
development 
opportunities and creating a 
supportive work environment. 
We prioritize training to equip 
employees with relevant skills 
for career advancement.
Positive
Workplace 
diversity
Opportunity
Embracing diversity within the 
workplace is crucial for driving 
innovation 
and 
improving 
decision-making 
processes. 
A 
diverse 
workforce 
brings 
varied 
perspectives 
that 
can 
enhance 
problem-solving 
and 
creativity, ultimately leading to 
better business outcomes. By 
prioritising diversity, Hathway can 
also strengthen its reputation and 
appeal to a broader customer 
base.
The Company seeks to hire 
more females to balance 
the 
workforce’s 
gender 
ratio. By celebrating unique 
perspectives, we accelerate 
innovation and broaden equal 
opportunities for employee 
growth.
Positive
Health and 
Safety
Risk
The health and safety of employees 
are 
paramount 
to 
maintaining 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
productivity. 
Neglecting 
these 
aspects can lead to workplace 
accidents, legal liabilities, and a 
decline in employee morale. A 
strong commitment to health and 
safety not only protects employees 
but also enhances the Company’s 
reputation 
as 
a 
responsible 
employer.
Our employee welfare policy 
prioritizes health and safety, 
guiding efforts to provide 
safe and hygienic working 
conditions. 
A 
conducive 
workplace is essential for 
employee 
satisfaction 
and 
organizational success.
Negative
Human Rights
Risk
Upholding 
human 
rights 
is 
fundamental to maintaining a 
positive workplace culture and 
avoiding disruptions in operations. 
Failure to address human rights 
issues can lead to reputational 
damage, legal challenges, and 
a loss of stakeholder trust. By 
prioritising human rights, the 
Company can ensure a stable 
and motivated workforce, which is 
essential for long-term success.	
The Company has a human 
rights policy that outlines 
acceptable 
workplace 
behaviour, 
ensuring 
the 
protection of employee rights 
and preventing forced or child 
labour. 
Awareness-building 
programs 
and 
grievance 
channels 
reinforce 
our 
commitment.

Establishing

responding 
to 
customer 
needs, Hathway can differentiate 
itself in a competitive market, 
leading to increased customer 
retention and positive word-of-
mouth referrals. A customer-
centric approach is essential for

proposition and unparalleled 
customer 
experience. 
Our 
Responsible Marketing policy 
ensures fair treatment and 
open

Positive
Responsible 
value chain 
Risk
Ensuring 
ethical 
practices 
throughout the value chain is 
critical for maintaining quality and 
safety standards. Any lapses can 
lead to reputational damage, legal 
issues, and disruptions in supply. 
By addressing these concerns, 
the Company can enhance its 
credibility 
and 
build 
stronger 
relationships with stakeholders, 
ultimately 
driving 
sustainable 
growth.
Our policy on related party 
transactions and ESG Policy 
ensures 
accountability 
among value chain partners, 
promoting transparency and 
ethical conduct. A vetting 
process 
and 
contractual 
agreements 
uphold 
fair 
practices.
Negative
Community 
Welfare and 
Development
Opportunity
Engaging in community welfare 
initiatives not only enhances the 
Company’s reputation but also 
contributes 
to 
social 
stability 
and economic development. By 
investing in local communities, 
Hathway can create a positive 
impact, strengthen stakeholder 
relationships, 
and 
align 
its 
operations with broader societal 
goals, 
leading 
to 
long-term 
sustainability.
The Company implements 
developmental programmes 
that 
foster 
community 
upliftment 
and 
generate 
sustainable 
socioeconomic 
benefits. 
Our 
EHS

Sustainable

and Control 
Opportunity
Establishing clear governance 
structures 
is 
essential 
for 
ensuring 
accountability

transparency 
at 
the

levels of the organisation. A well-
defined board ownership and

confidence, 
ultimately 
contributing 
to 
the 
Company’s long-term success.

essential for sustainable business

Protecting 
data 
privacy 
and

reputational 
damage, and legal liabilities. 
By prioritising data protection, 
the Company can safeguard its 
operations and maintain the trust 
of customers and stakeholders.
The Company enforces a

risks 
and

PRINCIPLE 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
  
  
Hathway recognises the growing urgency of addressing climate change and other environmental challenges that pose risks to both 
present and future generations. The Company has articulated its commitment to sustainability through a defined ESG Policy, which 
sets the direction for integrating environmental considerations into its operational and strategic decisions. With a focus on minimising 
its environmental footprint, the Company seeks to contribute towards a cleaner environment and a safer, more resilient society. This is 
pursued by adopting technologies and practices that are safe, resource-efficient, and designed to reduce emissions and waste arising 
from its operations. The Company also encourages the integration of similar principles across its supply chain, fostering responsible 
production and consumption practices among its partners. Hathway views sustainability not only as an environmental imperative 
but also to enhance quality of life and preserve natural resources. Through continuous improvements and responsible choices, the 
Company aims to embed sustainable thinking within the broader business ecosystem it operates in.

2.	
a.	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
		
No, the Company does not currently have a formal procedure dedicated exclusively to sustainable sourcing. However, a 
Code of Conduct for business associates is in place, which outlines the expectations for ethical, responsible, and legally 
compliant behaviour when engaging in business with the Company. This Code also highlights the importance of sustainable 
practices, with references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.
	
	
While a structured sustainable sourcing policy is yet to be adopted, the Company actively encourages its suppliers and 
partners to align with responsible business conduct. Compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements is 
monitored on a regular basis. In addition, the Company provides support to its partners in their efforts to incorporate more 
sustainable practices within their own operations.
	
	
Looking ahead, the Company intends to formalise a sustainable sourcing framework that will further promote the adoption of 
voluntary, ESG-aligned practices across a wider segment of its vendor base. These future initiatives are expected to foster 
a stronger culture of sustainability across the supply chain and enhance the Company’s contribution to environmental and 
societal well-being.

E-Waste
Hathway operates primarily as a service provider and does not engage in manufacturing 
activities. However, in the course of its operations, certain hardware components, such as 
Optical Network Units (ONUs), may reach end-of-life or become faulty and unusable. To 
manage such e-waste responsibly, the Company has instituted a defined process for safe 
disposal through government-authorised and certified e-waste recyclers, in compliance 
with all applicable environmental regulations.
In addition to responsible disposal, the Company promotes resource efficiency by 
prioritising the reuse of functional equipment. ONUs recovered from customer premises are 
collected through the Company’s network of local connection offices. These units undergo 
a refurbishment process and are redeployed wherever feasible, thereby extending their 
lifecycle and reducing the generation of avoidable e-waste.
This dual approach i.e. combining regulated disposal with refurbishment and reuse, reflects 
Hathway’s efforts to contribute to a circular economy and minimise its environmental impact.

partner, the Company requires verification and validation of payment challans as part of its due diligence process.
	
A comprehensive compliance assessment is carried out, which includes a thorough review of relevant licences, registrations, 
and statutory filings. Particular attention is paid to obligations under the Provident Fund (PF) and Employee State Insurance 
Corporation (ESIC), along with verification that applicable taxes have been deducted and deposited with the appropriate 
government authorities.
	
Documented proof of compliance is mandated from value chain partners prior to the release of any payments. This robust 
process not only ensures adherence to legal requirements but also reinforces the Company’s commitment to ethical business 
practices and fosters confidence among stakeholders, including government bodies, employees, and business associates.

The Company adopts a holistic and inclusive approach to identify and engage with its stakeholder ecosystem. This includes 
individuals and entities with whom Hathway has direct relationships, as well as those whose actions and interests may 
indirectly influence the Company’s operations, reputation, or long-term performance. Hathway has categorised its stakeholders 
into internal and external groups, based on the degree of interaction and the potential impact they have on the business. 
Internal stakeholders primarily comprise the Company’s employees who play a crucial role in operational execution and cultural 
alignment. External stakeholders include shareholders and investors, customers, suppliers, contractors, regulators, media, and 
the community at large.
	
The identification of stakeholders is guided by their relevance to the business, their influence on decision-making processes, and 
their ability to impact or be impacted by the Company’s strategic objectives. These groups are considered essential partners in 
the value creation process providing capital, co-developing and delivering services, ensuring regulatory compliance, enhancing 
brand perception, and contributing to community development. By cultivating a nuanced understanding of its stakeholders’ 
expectations, Hathway reinforces its commitment to transparent, responsible, and mutually respectful engagement. This approach 
supports informed decision-making and contributes meaningfully to the Company’s sustainable growth and long-term resilience.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Consultation with stakeholders forms a foundational element of the Company’s strategic and operational decision-making 
processes, particularly in relation to economic, environmental, and social topics. The Company engages with stakeholders 
through a variety of channels such as virtual platforms, in-person meetings, and social media. These engagements occur at 
predetermined intervals or on a need basis, ensuring continuous value creation for stakeholders while striving to minimise 
environmental impact.
	
To manage these interactions effectively, designated heads of departments oversee engagement with relevant stakeholder 
groups. For instance, employee feedback on material issues (as outlined in Section A – Q26) is initially assessed by departmental 
heads. These recommendations are then escalated to the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), who is authorised by the 
Board to make decisions on a wide range of organisational matters.
	
The CHRO acts as a direct link between stakeholder feedback and the Board. Where required, the CHRO consults with 
the Board on key business objectives and strategic matters. This structured process ensures that stakeholder concerns and 
suggestions are duly considered at the highest level, thereby reinforcing the Company's commitment to transparent and 
responsive governance.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics

Yes, stakeholder consultation is actively used to support the identification and management of environmental and social topics. 
Stakeholder engagement plays a critical role in helping the Company identify material concerns and shape relevant policies and 
initiatives to address them. Feedback gathered through these engagements is used to enhance operational efficiency, promote 
inclusivity, and advance the Company’s broader sustainability objectives.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
	
The Company embeds Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) principles within its core business objectives, acknowledging 
its role in addressing the needs of vulnerable and marginalised stakeholder groups. In alignment with applicable statutory 
requirements, a dedicated CSR Committee has been constituted to steer and oversee all CSR initiatives.
	
This Committee identifies relevant focus areas through structured internal consultations and collaborations with external partners 
to understand the evolving needs of disadvantaged communities. Based on these engagements, the Company prioritised a 
Sustainable Livelihood Programme during the reporting year, aimed at empowering individuals from marginalised backgrounds 
by enhancing their income-generating capacities and improving their long-term socio-economic resilience.
