RESPONSIBILITY AND 
SUSTAINABILITY 
REPORT
Aditya Birla Real Estate Ltd. (also referred to as ‘ABREL’ 
or ‘The Company’) is pleased to release its Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for 
FY 2024-25. In line with the requirements of Regulation 
34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, the Company hereby 
submits the BRSR for FY 2024-25, along with Independent 
Assurance Statement provided by TUV India Private 
Limited. 
As part of ABREL’s commitment to responsible and 
sustainable business practices, aligned with the nine 
National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct 
(NGRBC) Principles, this document presents a transparent 
account of its performance and impacts. It also reaffirms 
the Company’s efforts towards achieving net-zero 
emissions by 2050 in line with the Aditya Birla Group’s 
(ABG) sustainability ambition.  
Additionally, it underscores the Company’s commitment 
to sustainability objectives deeply entrenched within its 
corporate responsibilities. Where applicable, it also details 
collaborative endeavours among value chain partners, 
reflecting ABREL’s focus on attaining commendable 
sustainability benchmarks. Moreover, the Company has 
undergone assurance, as detailed in the Independent 
Assurance Report, and has gone the extra mile in ensuring 
transparent and accountable reporting practices.
ABREL commenced operations in the year 1897. Despite 
several market fluctuations, the Company has remained 
dedicated to ethical operations. Operating in two distinct 
segments, ABREL has undertaken all feasible measures 
to stand out as a leader in each segment. Research and 
development (R&D), along with technical innovations 
integrated into business operations, form the foundation 
of ABREL’s success in each field. 
The Company has conducted several initiatives to protect 
the environment. Efforts for this cause are aimed at 
reducing emissions that harm the environment and the 
communities around business operations. To ensure this, 
the Company has undertaken stringent measures from the 
initial stages, including the design stage in the Real Estate 
segment.

This report outlines the strategic 
initiatives undertaken by ABREL to drive 
sustainable expansion and facilitate 
substantial value generation for all 
stakeholders.

All the residential projects of ABREL 
have been certified as Green Buildings.
The flagship project, Birla Niyaara, is in the process 
of 
obtaining 
the 
Building 
Research 
Establishment 
Environmental 
Assessment 
Methodology 
(BREEAM) 
certification. The commercial buildings operate majorly on 
renewable energy. Furthermore, there are several energy 
efficiency measures in other business segments which 
have resulted in approximately 50% reduction in Scope 2 
emissions.
To further reduce its environmental impact, the Company 
has implemented proactive measures to effectively 
manage waste. By-products are recycled, repurposed for 
energy generation, or vended to third parties. 
Social responsibility is equally prioritised. To this end, 
the Company maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards 
human rights violations, ensuring safe workplaces for all.
This BRSR highlights ABREL’s 
achievements and acknowledges its 
journey ahead.
Furthermore, by aligning with global frameworks like 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN 
SDGs) and ABG’s net-zero ambition, the Company remains 
committed to transparent, accountable, and innovative 
practices that benefit both people and the planet.

Rationale for identifying the risk/opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the risk or opportunity (indicate positive or negative implications)
In an era of heightened regulatory scrutiny, AI-driven oversight, and growing stakeholder activism, maintaining ethical business 
practices is essential for regulatory compliance, investor confidence, and long-term trust. As ESG expectations rise and governance 
norms tighten, transparency and integrity have become indispensable. Any lapse, be it fraud, corruption, or workplace misconduct, 
can lead to legal consequences, reputational damage, and financial penalties.
ABREL has instituted a comprehensive governance framework to ensure strict adherence to ethical standards:
Code of Conduct
•	
Outlining ethical expectations and compliance requirements for employees, leadership, and business associates.
Training and Awareness Programmes
•	
Conducting regular sessions to reinforce ethical decision-making and compliance with regulations.
Whistleblower Mechanism and Grievance Redressal
•	
Maintaining secure channels for reporting concerns while ensuring confidentiality and protection against retaliation.
Independent Compliance Oversight
•	
Conducting periodic reviews, internal audits, and risk assessments through dedicated teams to proactively address ethical 
risks.
Stakeholder Engagement and Policy Updates
•	
Ensuring continuous alignment with evolving industry standards and governance best practices.
Non-compliance with ethical standards can result in regulatory fines, legal liabilities, operational restrictions, loss of investor 
confidence, and reputational harm. These may negatively impact market positioning and long-term financial performance.

Rationale for identifying the risk/opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the risk or opportunity (indicate positive or negative implications)
With increasing digitisation in real estate operations, including customer data management, financial transactions, and smart 
infrastructure, cybersecurity risks have become more pronounced. Against this backdrop, threats such as data breaches, ransomware 
attacks, and phishing scams can lead to unauthorised access to sensitive business information, operational disruptions, legal 
liabilities, and reputational damage. Additionally, evolving data protection regulations and rising stakeholder expectations necessitate 
stronger security frameworks to mitigate risks.
ABREL mitigates this risk by:
•	
Conducting regular employee training on cybersecurity risks like phishing and malware.
•	
Upgrading IT infrastructure with enhanced firewalls and the latest security patches.
•	
Maintaining a solid cybersecurity system to monitor, detect, and respond to potential threats.
Cybersecurity breaches can lead to regulatory fines, legal liabilities, operational disruptions, and reputational harm. Investing in 
strong IT security infrastructure and best practices incurs significant costs but is essential for business continuity and risk mitigation.

Financial implications of the risk or opportunity (indicate positive or negative implications)
Inadequate health and safety procedures can result in accidents, injuries, and fatalities, negatively impacting workforce morale, 
increasing turnover, and reducing productivity. With intensifying regulatory oversight, evolving safety standards, and rising ESG 
expectations, robust safety management has become more important. Failure to uphold high safety standards can result in legal 
liabilities, compensation claims, regulatory fines, higher insurance costs, and reputational damage.
ABREL prioritises fostering a zero-incident culture through structured systems and proactive measures, including:
•	
Securing an ISO 45001:2018-certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS), certified for the Pulp & 
Paper division and underway for Real Estate.
•	
Undertaking regular safety training and awareness initiatives to reinforce safe work practices.
•	
Holding daily toolbox meetings in Real Estate operations to discuss potential hazards and preventive measures.
•	
Carrying out quarterly internal safety audits and annual external assessments to ensure compliance and continuous 
improvement.
•	
Implementing Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), and Behaviour-Based Safety

Corporate governance serves as the foundation for ethical, transparent, and responsible business operations. Weak governance 
frameworks such as lack of Board diversity, inadequate oversight, or ineffective risk management can result in reputational harm, regulatory 
non-compliance, and poor strategic decision-making. With increasing investor focus on ESG metrics and heightened regulatory scrutiny, 
ensuring strong governance practices is critical to maintaining stakeholder confidence and long-term business sustainability.
Non-compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, particularly concerning ESG standards, can result in legal penalties, 
reputational damage, and loss of stakeholder confidence. With tightening ESG disclosure norms, stricter environmental regulations, 
and increasing investor scrutiny, adherence to evolving laws is critical to maintaining business continuity and corporate credibility.
ABREL is committed to best-in-class corporate governance by:
•	
Maintaining a strong and independent Board of Directors, with a focus on diversity and unbiased decision-making.
•	
Implementing robust risk management frameworks to proactively identify and mitigate potential governance-related risks.
•	
Ensuring transparent communication with investors, employees, and communities to uphold accountability.
•	
Strengthening Board oversight on environmental, social, and financial performance. 
•	
Ensuring alignment with sustainability and regulatory requirements through dedicated board committees.
•	
Regularly assessing market trends and corporate governance best practices to refine policies and decision-making frameworks.
ABREL has established a strong compliance framework that ensures adherence to all legal and regulatory requirements by:
•	
Revising compliance checklists periodically  to incorporate evolving regulatory demands and industry best practices.
•	
Conducting concurrent audits and process monitoring during project execution to proactively identify compliance gaps.
•	
Developing segment-specific regulatory checklists in the Real Estate business, verified by relevant stakeholders.
•	
Documenting and reviewing compliance data quarterly at the Head Office, with discussions at the Audit Committee and Board 
level to ensure top-level oversight.
Weak corporate governance can result in legal penalties, loss of investor confidence, operational inefficiencies, and reputational 
damage. These factors may contribute to financial losses, reduced shareholder value, and increased regulatory scrutiny, impacting 
long-term growth and market positioning.
Regulatory violations can lead to substantial fines, legal penalties, project delays, and reputational risks. Non-compliance may also 
impact market positioning, investor confidence, and long-term financial stability.

As ESG regulations tighten across the globe, failure to manage environmental, social, or governance risks can lead to regulatory 
penalties, reputational damage, and financial setbacks. Environmental issues such as non-compliance with sustainability mandates, 
social concerns like labour disputes and community conflicts, and governance lapses, including data mismanagement or unethical 
practices, can disrupt operations and erode stakeholder trust. In response, investors and financial institutions are increasingly 
factoring ESG performance into investment decisions, making robust ESG risk management critical for business endurance and 
long-term growth.
ABREL has instituted a comprehensive ESG risk management framework that integrates risk identification, impact assessment, and 
mitigation strategies across business verticals. Key measures include:
•	
Overseeing ESG risks and compliance through the Risk Management Committee, comprising Board members and senior 
executives.
•	
Identifying and escalating risks proactively within each business unit to enable timely intervention.
•	
Aligning with evolving ESG regulations, including SEBI BRSR Core and international sustainability standards.
•	
Engaging stakeholders to address community concerns and strengthen social responsibility.
•	
Conducting regular ESG audits and disclosures to uphold transparency and boost investor confidence, which has contributed 
to a marked improvement in our GRESB score for the Real Estate division compared to last year.
•	
Implementing an ISO 14001:2015-certified Environmental Management System in the Pulp & Paper division, with the Real 
Estate division currently pursuing certification.
Inadequate ESG risk management can lead to regulatory fines, increased compliance costs, reputational damage, and operational 
disruptions. These impacts can increase borrowing costs, erode investor confidence, and undermine market positioning. Conversely, 
strong ESG governance enhances brand value, improves access to capital, and strengthens long-term competitiveness.

In an era of heightened regulatory scrutiny, AI-driven oversight, and growing stakeholder activism, maintaining ethical business 
practices is essential for regulatory compliance, investor confidence, and long-term trust. As ESG expectations rise and governance 
norms tighten, transparency and integrity have become indispensable. Any lapse, be it fraud, corruption, or workplace misconduct, 
can lead to legal consequences, reputational damage, and financial penalties.
To address these challenges, the Company has implemented a comprehensive decarbonisation strategy, including:
•	
Aligning with ABG’s Net-Zero 2050 target
Climate Risk and Assessment
Real Estate
•	
Conducting climate risk assessments for several of the projects to identify potential climate-related risks like extreme weather

Efficient water management is vital for business continuity and regulatory compliance, particularly in water-intensive sectors like 
Pulp & Paper, and during construction in Real Estate. Poor management can result in higher operational costs, regulatory penalties, 
and reputational risks. Additionally, increasing regulatory scrutiny and environmental concerns necessitate responsible water use 
and wastewater treatment to ensure compliance and sustainable operations.
ABREL mitigates this risk by implementing sustainable water management practices across its business segments and their 
operations:
Real Estate 
•	
Integrating water-efficient technologies and wastewater recycling systems to reduce the water footprint during construction 
and in completed projects.
Pulp & Paper
•	
Focussing on reducing water consumption and enhancing water recycling through process optimisations and wastewater 
treatment improvements.
Regulatory Compliance 
•	
Ensuring strict adherence to water usage and discharge norms through continuous monitoring and audits.
Inefficient water management can increase operational costs, result in fines for non-compliance, and impact project timelines and 
profitability.

Improper waste management can cause environmental pollution, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. With 
increasing regulatory oversight and sustainability expectations, companies must embrace circular economy practices to minimise 
waste generation, improve resource efficiency, and lower reliance on landfills.
ABREL addresses this risk through sustainable waste management initiatives across its business segments:
Real Estate
•	
Deploying organic waste converters at commercial sites and provisions for residential sites to convert organic waste into 
manure. 
•	
Using recycled concrete aggregates to minimise construction waste and repurposing demolition waste into paver blocks for 
onsite use.
Pulp & Paper
•	
Adopting a circular economy approach, where:
	
o	
Organic solid waste is utilised as boiler fuel.
	
o	
Fly ash, a major by-product, is sold to the cement industry.
	
o	
Sludge from the effluent treatment plant (ETP) is reused in board manufacturing.
	
o	
Precipitated calcium carbonate is produced from captured CO2 during manufacturing.
Compliance and Monitoring 
•	
Conducting regular audits and ensuring adherence to waste disposal and recycling regulations to prevent legal and 
environmental risks.
Poor waste management can lead to regulatory fines, increased operational costs, and legal liabilities, impacting overall profitability 
and sustainability efforts.

Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner 
that is sustainable and safe. 
This principle emphasises safety and 
resource efficiency in product design and 
manufacturing. To create value, a business 
must minimise and mitigate its negative 
effects on the environment and society at 
every stage of the product’s life cycle, from 
design to final disposal.
At ABREL, integrating sustainability 
into operations remains a core priority, 
guaranteeing that its products and services 
are environmentally and socially responsible. 
This commitment extends across the 
supply chain, where the Company prioritises 
sustainable raw materials and collaborates 
with partners aiming for net-zero emissions. 
In the coming fiscal year, ABREL plans 
to implement sustainable supply chain 
assessments to better monitor its progress. 
Moreover, by aligning with NGRBC’s Principle 
2, ABREL is dedicated to advancing several 
UN SDGs, including sustainable cities, 
responsible consumption, climate action, 
and clean water and sanitation.

ABREL 
has 
implemented 
procedures 
for 
sustainable sourcing across its businesses.
	
In the Real Estate segment, the Company promotes 
sustainability by working with ISO-certified suppliers 
who have established environmental targets. A 
significant initiative in this area is the innovative use 
of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) in 
concrete, which helps lower carbon emissions and 
manage waste efficiently.
	
At the same time, within the Pulp & Paper segment, 
ABREL supports sustainability by utilising FSC-
certified raw materials where required and promoting 
social forestry initiatives. In addition, the Company 
consistently evaluates and adjusts its sourcing 
policies to maintain its commitment to environmental 
objectives and ethical business practices.

(b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Under its Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
initiative, ABREL has established procedures for 
reclaiming its plastic packaging materials at the end of 
their lifecycle. To accomplish this, ABREL collaborates 
with a third-party agency to reclaim and recycle these 
materials. Other types of waste, including e-waste, 
hazardous waste, and general waste, are disposed 
of in full compliance with relevant regulations and 
guidelines.

whether the waste collection plan is in line with 
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide 
steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes. ABREL is registered with the Central Pollution 
Control Board (CPCB) as an entity subject to EPR 
regulations for plastic waste. The Company falls under 
Plastic EPR categories 1 and 2, classified among 
Producers, Importers, and Brand Owners (PIBO). 
The Company acknowledges its duty to manage the 
environmental impact of its packaging.
	
ABREL has established a waste collection plan in 
accordance with the EPR requirements set by the 
CPCB. This plan ensures the appropriate collection, 
recycling, and disposal of packaging waste linked to 
the PIBO classification. Demonstrating environmental 
responsibility, the Company also adheres to the Plastic 
Waste Management (PWM) Rules of 2016.

Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of 
all employees, including those in their value chains.
This principle mandates businesses to 
implement policies and procedures that 
ensure fairness, respect, and welfare of all 
workers involved in a company or its supply 
chain. This must be done without bias and 
in a manner that fosters diversity. Moreover, 
the principle acknowledges that the welfare 
of employees’ families is also a part of a 
company’s overall welfare.
The Company recognises the crucial 
role its employees play in business 
operations and prioritises their well-being. 
As part of the ABG, ABREL emphasises 
diversity and offers equal opportunities 
and inclusivity for all, including minority 
groups, in every aspect of its operations. 
Its comprehensive Human Rights Policy 
adheres to international standards like the 
International Labour Organisation (ILO) 
and the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC), ensuring no employee experiences 
any physical or mental harassment. 
Furthermore, ABREL’s dedication to 
Principle 3 is closely linked to SDGs such 
as promoting good health and well-being, 
decent work, reducing inequalities, and 
achieving gender equality. With this focus, 
the Company aims to uphold a supportive 
work environment that meets all necessary 
requirements and contributes to the overall 
welfare of the Company’s employees.

respectful workplace. These measures are further strengthened by the appointment of 
a dedicated Ethics and Vigilance Officer, who manages all complaints with sensitivity 
and confidentiality.
Simultaneously, ABREL maintains a meticulous focus on safety across all its segments. 
In the Pulp & Paper division, employees are equipped with emergency contact cards, 
and safety regulations are rigorously enforced. Similarly, in the Real Estate segment, 
the Company enforces stringent safety standards, where non-compliance may lead 
to penalties or termination, underscoring the Company’s commitment to a safe and 
secure working environment.
Together, these comprehensive systems ensure that all employees and workers have 
access to a solid grievance redressal framework. Through this, ABREL maintains a 
supportive and secure workplace.

Note: At ABREL, all permanent employees are covered under an annual performance and career development review cycle that aligns with the 
company’s financial year (April to March). Employees who joined between January and March 2025 were not included in the current review 
cycle but will be assessed in the subsequent cycle, ensuring full inclusion over a 12-month period.
R#In the case of permanent workers, the company has undertaken a review of its disclosure methodology. Unlike employees, career development 
assessments for permanent workers are not conducted on a fixed annual basis, but rather on an ad-hoc basis aligned with internal promotion 
and retirement policies. These assessments are driven by predefined parameters such as attendance, educational qualifications, department-
level performance, and retirement-linked succession requirements. Accordingly, the data previously reported for FY 2023–24 has been restated 
to reflect this clarified approach and have been denoted with R# where applicable.
10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety manage-
ment system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/No). If yes, what is the coverage of such a 
system?
	
Yes, ABREL has established robust Occupational 
Health and Safety Management Systems (OHSMS) that 
are certified under ISO 45001:2018. This certification 
underscores ABREL’s commitment to employee 
protection, encompassing both direct employees and 
contract workers.
	
The system ensures that occupational health and 
safety protocols are thoroughly implemented and 
continuously monitored throughout the organisation, 
creating a secure and conducive working environment. 
With a focus on preventive measures and ongoing 
safety audits, ABREL prioritises the well-being of its 
workforce, affirming its dedication to maintaining high 
standards of safety and health across all operational 
levels.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-re-
lated hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
	
ABREL consistently implements its comprehensive 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedures 
(SOPs) 
across 
all business segments, systematically identifying 
workplace hazards and evaluating risks. Integral to 
its ISO 45001:2018 certification for OHSMS, ABREL 
has meticulously documented procedures aimed at 
thoroughly evaluating work-related hazards and risks. 
These measures ensure a proactive approach to safety 
and highlight ABREL’s focus on maintaining a secure 
and healthy working environment for employees. Key 
initiatives include:
	
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): 
ABREL actively engages with the working personnel to 
identify risks and analyse potential dangers, applying 
suitable controls to mitigate them. In addition, the 
inclusion of air quality monitoring devices support 
ABREL’s 
approach 
to 
mitigating 
environmental 
hazards associated with air pollution.
328
ADITYA BIRLA REAL ESTATE LTD.
	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA): Each job task is analysed 
at an activity level to assess risks and implement 
mitigation 
strategies 
before 
critical 
operations 
commence. Proactive measures such as real-time 
monitoring of air pollution control systems via CCTV, 
exemplify the level of detail involved in JSA.
	
Behaviour-Based Safety Operations (BBSO): The 
BBSO system identifies risks associated with unsafe 
behaviours. The Company extends this proactive 
safety culture with training programmes, as illustrated 
in the images, such as BBS training, encouraging 
employees to voluntarily adhere to safety practices 
and report unsafe conditions.
	
Incident Investigation: ABREL’s solid mechanism 
for investigating incidents helps identify risks and 
hazards. Deployment of anti-smog guns and regular 
ambient air monitoring, as illustrated in the images, 
further enhance the Company’s capability to control 
air quality-related incidents.
	
Safety Audits: Regular audits, both internal and 
external, ensure compliance with safety standards. 
This is supported by extensive training programmes, 
as shown in the images, including IMS and CIDC 
training, which prepare employees to uphold these 
safety norms.
	
Together, 
these 
measures 
highlight 
ABREL’s 
commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy work 
environment for all employees and workers.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report 
the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks.
	
ABREL ensures that all workers and employees receive 
thorough training in hazard identification and are well-
versed in risk reporting protocols. To facilitate this, 
the Company has established multiple channels for 
reporting potential job-related dangers. These include 
specialised written forms, direct communication with 
managers, and interactions with the Company’s health 
and safety department. Furthermore, the Whistle 
Blower Policy allows for the anonymous reporting of 
potential or actual risks.
	
Upon identifying a hazard, employees are empowered 
to promptly vacate the danger zone, notify their 
managers, and adhere to established evacuation 
protocols. These measures ensure timely reporting 
and proactive involvement in maintaining a safe 
workplace.
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access 
to non-occupational medical and healthcare ser-
vices?
	
Yes, ABREL is committed to providing comprehensive 
healthcare services that prioritise the well-being 
of employees and their families, extending beyond 
occupational health to address broader medical 
needs. The benefits include health insurance that 
covers Outpatient Department (OPD) consultations, 
and hospitalisations for all employees and their 
immediate family members. This helps employees with 
medical expenses and ensures access to emergency 
treatment, proving invaluable for non-work-related 
medical conditions.
	
In addition to medical care, ABREL places significant 
emphasis on mental and physical health. Pertaining 
to this, a variety of wellness programmes and routine 
health check-ups form a core part of the Company’s 
approach to preventative care.
	
In the Real Estate segment, ABREL has partnered with 
Mpower to enhance mental health support, certifying 
25 employees as wellness ambassadors. Through 
this collaboration, employees benefit from structured 
mental health sessions. Also, a dedicated group of 
counsellors remains readily available for consultation, 
providing crucial support to employees and their 
family members whenever needed. This multifaceted 
approach underscores ABREL’s dedication to creating 
a healthy, supportive, and nurturing environment for its 
workforce.

15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or 
underway to address safety-related incidents (if 
any) and on significant risks/concerns arising 
from assessments of health & safety practices and 
working conditions. 
	
ABREL’s meticulous assessment of health and safety 
practices, alongside working conditions, has identified 
key risk areas across its various business segments. 
To enhance this process, the Company has deployed 
a high-risk team dedicated to identifying major risk 
factors in each segment and implementing targeted 
mitigation strategies. As part of this process, the 
team conducts regular safety patrols, audits project 
sites, and compiles detailed reports to maintain 
comprehensive oversight. Additionally, a Strengths, 
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) 
analysis provides further support to this framework.
	
The high-risk focus team has identified electrical 
hazards and working at height as critical risks to health 
and safety. To manage electrical risks effectively, the 
segment’s electrical head carries out frequent audits, 
while Electrical Lockout Tagout (LOTO) procedures 
are strictly enforced. This is further reinforced by the 
adoption of IP65-rated equipment, ensuring adherence 
to high safety standards. 
	
Furthermore, in the real estate sector, where high-rise 
developments are prevalent, the risk associated with 
working at elevated heights is addressed through the 
deployment of fall-resistant equipment, ensuring the 
utmost safety for workers. This proactive approach 
underscores ABREL’s commitment to creating a safe 
and secure work environment across all its operations.

regulatory compliance. This selection criterion 
is essential to maintaining adherence across all

•	
Mandatory Documentation: Contractors and 
third parties are required to submit copies of 
challans for Provident Fund (PF) and Employees’ 
State Insurance (ESI) contributions made on 
behalf of their employees. This ensures all 
statutory payments are processed correctly.
	
• 
Digital Compliance Verification: The Company 
conducts online checks to verify the PF, ESI, 
and Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns filed 
by contractors and third parties. These digital 
verifications enable effective oversight and 
reinforce compliance across the supply chain.
	
Through these diligent practices, ABREL exemplifies its 
commitment to maintaining operational integrity and 
ensuring all partners adhere to the highest standards 
of compliance and governance.

ensuring accountability and continuous improvement 
of partnerships.

operations on stakeholders.
ABREL recognises the essential role 
that stakeholders play in its business 
operations and is committed to fostering 
an environment that aligns with their needs. 
Beyond this assessment, ABREL maintains 
regular communication with stakeholders 
to ensure their concerns are addressed

To begin with, ABREL defines stakeholders as 
individuals, groups, or entities either impacted 
by its activities, products, or services, or capable 
of influencing or holding a vested interest in its 
operations. Accordingly, the process of stakeholder 
identification and prioritisation involves mapping and 
assessing each stakeholder’s relevance based on their 
impact, influence, and importance to the Company. 
	
Furthermore, 
to 
ensure 
thorough 
stakeholder 
engagement, ABREL employs surveys and feedback

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between 
stakeholders 
and 
the 
Board 
on 
economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations 
provided to the Board.
	
Through a well-rounded stakeholder engagement 
process, ABREL gathers diverse perspectives and 
insights on critical economic, environmental, and social 
issues impacting its business operations. During the 
board review process, any identified gaps or valuable 
insights are communicated to senior management to 
enable timely corrective action. 
	
Furthermore, the Company diligently keeps the 
board informed on the progress of the solutions 
implemented to address these gaps and observations. 
This systematic approach underscores ABREL’s 
commitment to sustained improvement, transparency, 
and responsive corporate governance.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support 
the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details 
of instances as to how the inputs received from 
stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Yes, ABREL considers stakeholder consultations 
as a crucial element in identifying and addressing 
environmental and social issues. On this front, the 
Company actively seeks feedback from pertinent 
parties, seamlessly integrating their insights into its 
operational practices and strategic procedures. By 
doing so, it ensures a sharp focus on substantive 
topics identified during these engagements. 
	
By aligning its initiatives with stakeholder expectations, 
ABREL enhances operational sustainability and 
advances its strategic objectives. This ongoing 
dialogue reflects ABREL’s dedication to encouraging 
collaboration and delivering sustainable value across 
all its operations.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and 
actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/
marginalised stakeholder groups.
	
ABREL actively addresses the needs of vulnerable and 
marginalised stakeholder groups across its business 
segments. The Company’s initiatives are designed to 
empower these communities by providing access to 
opportunities and essential services. A key aspect of its 
efforts involves collaboration with local stakeholders 
and authorities to prevent environmental hazards and 
promote sustainability. For instance, the Pulp & Paper 
segment partners with the Forest Department of 
Nainital to collect and utilise dried leaves from forests, 
mitigating the risk of forest fires during the summer. 
Besides protecting the environment, this initiative 
reduces reliance on non-renewable energy sources.
	
Simultaneously, 
ABREL’s 
CSR 
initiatives 
are 
strategically designed to meet the distinct needs 
of marginalised communities. Through various 
healthcare initiatives, including medical camps, the 
Company enhances access to medical services 
and upgrades local hospital infrastructure, directly 
benefiting hundreds. Furthermore, ABREL emphasises 
sanitation and hygiene through regular cleaning and 
garbage removal, mosquito fumigation, and awareness 
programmes, which collectively enhance public health 
and prevent disease outbreaks.
	
Infrastructure development remains a pivotal aspect 
of the Company’s community support, with significant 
efforts like the construction of toilets in areas like 
Bindukhatta and Shantipuri, which enhance living 
standards and contribute to overall dignity. To assist 
vulnerable families during colder months, ABREL 
distributes blankets as part of its support initiatives. 
Importantly, women’s empowerment remains a core 
priority, with skill development centres in the mentioned 
regions providing vocational training that enables 
women and girls to build sustainable livelihoods.
	
Additionally, promoting educational opportunities 
for disadvantaged groups is crucial to ABREL’s 
strategy. Furthering this commitment, the Company 
constructs classrooms and supports skill-building 
programmes that uplift communities and enable long-
term economic development.  ABREL also integrates 
environmental activities into its CSR initiatives to 
maintain a suitable environment around its operations.

Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and 
restore the environment.

the negative effects of their operations and 
supply chain.
ABREL understands the intrinsic link 
between business operations and the 
environment. The Company embraces its 
duty to respect, protect, and restore the 
environment, knowing that the success

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero 
Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation. 
	
Yes, Birla Centurion, one of the Company’s key sites, 
is a ZLD facility. While ZLD mechanism has not been 
implemented across all locations, the Company 
recognises water as an important environmental 
resource. Therefore, it has undertaken necessary 
initiatives to conserve, recycle, and reuse water across 
both the Real Estate and Pulp & Paper divisions. 
	
To support these efforts, efficient wastewater 
treatment systems like sewage treatment plants 
(STPs) and ETPs are installed to treat wastewater 
that is used for other operational and non-operational 
activities like flushing and gardening within the 
premises.
	
Furthermore, all projects in the Real Estate segment 
feature rainwater harvesting systems as a part of 
sustainable water management practices. This

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing 
Greenhouse Gas emissions? If yes, then provide 
details. 
	
Yes, the Company undertook multiple projects in 
FY 2024-25 aimed at reducing GHG emissions across 
its Real Estate and Pulp & Paper divisions. Several of 
these initiatives represent significant enhancements 
over previous years.
	
Real Estate
	
In FY 2024-25, the Real Estate division advanced its 
decarbonisation strategy through focussed efforts 
in embodied carbon reduction, operational energy 
efficiency, and increasing the use of renewable energy. 
As part of its low-carbon construction approach, the 
division initiated an embodied carbon assessment 
for flagship projects such as Birla Niyaara and 
began integrating climate-positive materials. Across 
its projects, the Company replaced conventional 
materials with approximately 5,725 MT of Ground 
Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), 11,121 MT of 
Fly Ash, 3,150 MT of Fly Ash bricks and 1,656 MT of 
secondary steel, enabling a measurable reduction in 
construction-related emissions.
	
On the operational front, the business recorded 
over 200% YoY increase in renewable electricity 
consumption, with green power now accounting for 
~43% of its total electricity use and ~32% of its total 
energy use. Commercial assets like Birla Aurora and 
Birla Centurion transitioned entirely to renewable 
electricity for all areas under the Company’s control. 
Moreover, Birla Aurora was awarded the IGBC Net-Zero 
Energy Certification, and a new 140 kW rooftop solar 
installation was commissioned at Birla Centurion. 
These transitions enabled a 16% reduction in Scope 2 
emissions across the Real Estate portfolio.
	
Energy efficiency measures further contributed to 
GHG emission reductions. Key initiatives included:
	
•	
VFD installations on HVAC systems improved 
cooling efficiency
	
•	
APFC 
panel 
modifications 
and 
capacitor 
upgrades reduced energy losses
	
•	
LED lighting retrofits and motion sensor-based 
lighting controls were implemented across 
commercial spaces and labour camps
	
•	
Timer and daylight sensor installations for 
staircase and peripheral lights enabled automatic 
shut-off after sunrise
	
•	
Motion-sensor and automated lighting controls 
were introduced to reduce energy consumption 
during non-peak hours
	
•	
Passive architectural features such as natural 
daylighting and cross-ventilation were embedded 
into 
project 
design, 
reducing 
long-term 
operational energy demand
	
All new projects comply with IGBC Gold or related 
certifications. Notably, Birla Niyaara is on track to 
become India’s first BREEAM-certified development, 
underscoring the Company’s commitment to climate-
resilient design and construction.
	
Pulp & Paper
	
The Pulp & Paper division intensified its decarbonisation 
journey in FY 2024-25 through integrated energy 
efficiency upgrades, renewable fuel substitution, and 
internal clean energy generation. The division’s diverse 
energy mix, combining grid power, captive renewable 
electricity, and thermal energy from bio-based sources, 
enabled measurable gains in both emission avoidance 
and energy performance.
	
To reduce dependence on fossil fuels, the division 
significantly scaled up the use of biomass fuels 
such as black liquor, bagasse, pith, bark, wood dust, 
and Perul, many of which are by-products of internal 
operations. This initiative enabled the consumption 
of 5,930,113 GJ of renewable thermal energy. Without 
this substitution, the equivalent energy would have 
been generated using coal, resulting in substantially 
higher Scope 1 emissions. The shift reduced ABREL’s 
reliance on fossil fuels and advanced its transition to 
circular, low-emission energy systems.
	
The facility also continued to operate its in-house 
biomethanation plant, which converts effluent water 
from bagasse processing into Compressed Methane 
Gas (CMG), a renewable fuel used in place of LPG for 
steam generation. During the year, 387.44 MT of CMG 
was generated, delivering 17,994 GJ of clean thermal 
energy and further reducing fossil fuel dependence.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 349
	
A series of energy efficiency initiatives were 
implemented across the plant, resulting in annual 
electricity savings of ~3,54,553 kWh:
	
•	
VFD installations across key pumps, agitators, 
depithers, and rewinder systems saved ~2,86,516 
kWh
	
•	
LED 
retrofits 
in 
production, 
utilities, 
and 
warehouses saved ~1,53,582 kWh
	
•	
Blower and pump upgrades, including ARC boiler 
feed pump replacements and optimised flow 
systems, saved ~9,31,800 kWh
	
•	
Pulp consistency improvement at one of the 
Board Lines led to ~3,40,591 kWh savings and 
reduced energy intensity
	
•	
Compressor optimisation, including installation 
of a high-efficiency centrifugal compressor and 
operational restructuring, saved ~1.4 million kWh 
annually and improved system stability (4.9 bar 
to 5.5 bar)
	
•	
Cooling tower fan blade upgrades saved an 
additional ~2,42,064 kWh 
	
•	
A boiler thermal efficiency upgrade, achieved 
by feedwater pre-heating through MP heater 
commissioning, resulted in 30,240 MT of steam 
savings, lowering thermal load and fuel use
	
Collectively, these actions enabled the division to offset 
the emissions associated with higher production 
volumes. While absolute emissions rose marginally, 
emission intensity remained stable due to greater use 
of renewable power and energy efficiency. The division 
also expanded its social forestry initiative, planting 
1.11 Crore saplings over 5,000 hectares, supporting 
long-term carbon sequestration and sustainable fibre 
sourcing.
	
This combination of energy-efficient operations, 
renewable thermal energy, process waste utilisation, 
and plantation to support carbon sequestration reflects 
a mature and multi-dimensional approach to climate 
action aligned with ABREL’s broader Natural Capital 
goals and the ABG’s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage 
of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes. 
	
ABREL follows the principles of a circular economy 
and the ‘3R’ strategy: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. 
These principles are applied across operations to 
manage waste responsibly and reduce environmental 
impact. All waste disposal practices are conducted in 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations. 
Notably, 95% of our total waste generated is diverted 
from disposal through internal reuse and recycling 
through verified vendors and handlers.
	
Real Estate:
	
The 
Real 
Estate 
segment 
integrates 
waste 
minimisation practices across design, construction, 
and occupancy stages. Dedicated on-site storage 
areas have been developed at active project sites to 
manage material flow between multiple contractors. 
Dry and wet waste are segregated, and organic waste 
converters are installed at commercial properties to 
process food and biodegradable waste into compost. 
These systems are also being commissioned at 
residential sites after occupancy. 
	
Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste, which saw 
an increase this year due to more projects, is either 
reused on-site where possible or sent to authorised 
sites 
for 
disposal. 
BEPL 
monitors 
contractor 
compliance to ensure disposal is in line with the 
waste management framework and applicable laws. 
Additionally, the division uses recycled materials like 
glass and fly ash, and GGBS (used prominently at 
Birla Niyaara, Trimaya, and Tisya) as a substitute for 
cement, helping reduce landfill burden. To further 
mitigate chemical exposure, fly ash is used at the 
Niyaara and Navya sites and low-VOC and green-
certified materials are used across construction and 
fit-out stages.

Pulp & Paper:
	
The Pulp & Paper division of ABREL adopts a circular, 
process-integrated approach to waste management, 
prioritising 
reuse, 
reduction, 
and 
regulatory 
compliance. Most of the waste generated, including 
biogenic materials such as bark, dry pith, wet pith, 
fly ash, and lime sludge, is reused internally as fuel 
in boilers or as raw material in board manufacturing. 
Sludge from the ETP and DIP is similarly redirected 
for in-house reuse. Fly ash is supplied to the cement 
industry under authorised recovery agreements, and 
hazardous wastes like used oil in lime kilns are either 
reused within plant operations or disposed through 
certified channels.
	
Plastic waste is tracked daily by the store department 
and managed in compliance with the CPCB’s Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines. Battery 
waste is returned to the original manufacturers, and 
biomedical waste is disposed of via deep burial as per 
the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016. No 
e-waste or radioactive waste was generated during 
the reporting period.
	
To minimise the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals, 
the division continues to optimise its production 
processes. Key interventions include improved pH 
control, tighter chemical dosing, and reduced chlorine 
dioxide consumption in pulp bleaching. These changes 
have not only enhanced operational safety but also 
lowered the chemical load in effluent streams. The 
unit also treats and reuses a significant portion of its 
effluent water within the plant, supporting both waste 
and water minimisation goals under a closed-loop 
system approach.

outcome of the initiative 
1
Targeted energy savings 
and avoided emissions in 
Pulp & Paper operations
The   Pulp & Paper division undertook a 
structured set of energy efficiency measures 
across FY 2024–25. Key initiatives included 
installing Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) 
on Depither Screws, Hypo Pumps, and 
White Liquor Pumps; replacing HPMV and 
halogen lamps with energy-efficient LEDs; 
and upgrading pumps, blowers, and ARC-
enhanced boiler feed pumps. The division 
also optimised the compressor system with 
a high-efficiency centrifugal unit, retrofitted 
aerodynamically designed cooling tower 
fans, improved pulp consistency control, 
and enhanced boiler thermal performance 
through MP Heater-based feedwater pre-
heating.
These 
initiatives 
enhanced 
throughput 
and reliability, reduced auxiliary energy 
loads, stabilised air pressure systems, 
and delivered annual electrical savings of 
approximately 33,54,553 kWh and thermal 
energy savings equivalent to 30,240 MT of 
steam. Collectively, they contributed to a 
meaningful reduction in indirect emissions 
and improved the plant’s overall energy 
intensity and operational sustainability.
In terms of avoided emissions, 5,820.4 
MTCO2e 
were 
avoided 
through 
these 
efficiency initiatives while steam savings 
also resulted in additional overall avoided 
emissions during the reporting period.
2
Circular thermal energy 
through biomethanation 
of process waste in the 
Pulp & Paper segment
An in-house bio-methanation plant was 
operated 
throughout 
FY 
2024–25 
to 
convert 
high-organic-content 
effluent 
water from bagasse-based pulp processing 
into methane-rich biogas. This biogas 
was compressed to produce Compressed 
Methane Gas (CMG), which was directly used 
in boilers as a renewable fuel. It replaced 
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and partially 
reduced coal consumption. The process 
is fully integrated within operations, using 
anaerobic digestion for energy recovery and 
internal circularity.
The initiative generated 387.44 MT of CMG, 
producing 17,994 GJ of renewable energy, 
significantly reducing reliance on fossil-
based thermal fuels. It helped lower Scope 
1 emissions, increased the renewable share 
of the thermal energy mix, and exemplified 
ABREL’s commitment to circular resource 
use. At the same time, it reduced waste 
and strengthened the division’s low-carbon 
manufacturing strategy.
3
Biomass fuel integration 
for thermal energy
The Pulp & Paper division scaled up the use 
of biomass-derived fuels, including black 
liquor, bagasse, wood bark, pith, and perul, 
across its boiler operations to replace fossil 
fuels like coal and LPG. These fuels were 
sourced internally from pulping and fibre 
processing by-products or through local 
agri-based supply chains, creating a circular 
and locally embedded thermal energy model 
that improves fuel resilience and reduces 
dependence on external fossil sources.
The initiative enabled the consumption 
of 5,930,113 GJ of renewable thermal 
energy derived from biomass fuels such as 
wood bark, bagasse, black liquor, and pith. 
Without these, an equal amount of thermal 
energy would have come from coal, causing 
substantially higher Scope 1 emissions. 
This substitution reduced dependence on

Renewable electricity 
adoption across business 
divisions
During FY 2024-25, ABREL significantly 
expanded its renewable electricity usage 
across the organisation, making clean energy 
sourcing a central part of its decarbonisation 
strategy. Within the Real Estate division, 
there was a more than 200% YoY increase 
in renewable electricity sourcing, allowing 
the Company to achieve 100% renewable 
electricity use across all commercial assets 
under operational control, including Birla 
Aurora and Birla Centurion. Meanwhile, on-
site solar photovoltaic installation began at 
Birla Centurion and will be commissioned 
in the next reporting period, marking a key 
milestone in self-generated clean energy 
capacity.
The Company procured 23,804.20 GJ of 
renewable electricity across its business 
divisions. The Real Estate division alone 
accounted for 9,857.11 GJ of this renewable 
electricity, entirely replacing conventional 
grid power for its commercial footprint 
under operational control. These efforts 
helped eliminate Scope 2 emissions in key 
real estate activities, advanced progress 
towards Net Zero targets, and strengthened 
resilience against energy market volatility.
Through 
these 
renewable 
energy 
interventions, ABREL avoided Scope 2 
emissions associated with grid electricity, 
based on CEA emission factors. 
At Birla Tisya labour colony, renewable 
energy is generated and utilised via on-site 
solar systems.
5
Use of climate-friendly 
materials in Real Estate 
projects
The Real Estate division advanced its 
decarbonisation 
strategy 
by 
targeting 
embodied 
emissions 
in 
construction. 
Flagship projects such as Birla Niyaara, 
Trimaya, and Tisya adopted low-carbon 
material substitution practices, prominently 
using Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag 
(GGBS), fly ash, fly ash bricks and secondary 
steel to reduce dependence on conventional 
cement, clinker, and virgin steel.
GGBS, a by-product of iron manufacturing, 
served as a partial cement substitute to 
reduce hydration heat and minimise thermal 
cracking. It also helped improve long-term 
durability. Additionally, the division initiated 
embodied carbon assessments for projects 
such as Birla Niyaara to systematise carbon 
footprint reduction during construction.
A total of 5,725 MT of GGBS, 11,121 MT of 
fly ash, 1,656 MT of secondary steel and 
3,150 MT of fly ash bricks were used across 
key real estate projects. These materials 
directly replaced emission-intensive primary 
materials,  leading to measurable reductions 
in construction-phase carbon emissions. 
The initiative also lowered primary energy 
consumption and diverted industrial by-
products from landfills. Furthermore, it aids 
value chain emission cuts, supports circular 
economy 
outcomes, 
and 
strengthens 
the sustainability performance of new 
developments under the Company’s low-
carbon building strategy.

Reduction in transport 
emissions through on-
site concrete batching
At Birla Niyaara, a large-scale residential 
development, the Real Estate division 
commissioned a dedicated on-site concrete 
batching plant to reduce emissions from 
transport logistics and improve construction 
efficiency. This intervention was designed to 
minimise the diesel-intensive transportation 
of ready-mix concrete from external plants, 
which typically contributes significantly 
to indirect (Scope 3) emissions during the 
construction phase. By localising batching 
operations at the project site, the initiative 
enhanced control over material handling, 
reduced idle time, and improved energy 
and inventory management throughout the 
execution phase.
The initiative led to a reduction in fuel 
consumption 
and 
transport-related 
emissions, enabled faster and more energy-
efficient construction cycles, and improved 
material utilisation. It also contributed to the 
Real Estate division’s broader strategy of 
reducing embedded carbon in construction. 
During the reporting period, the Company 
was able to avoid emissions through this 
on-site batching approach, demonstrating 
the impact of early-stage planning in low-
carbon construction.

Achievement of Net Zero 
energy building at Birla 
Aurora
Birla Aurora, a flagship commercial property 
under the Real Estate division, was awarded 
Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) certification 
by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). 
This recognition places it among the most 
energy-efficient commercial assets in the 
Company’s portfolio. The milestone was 
enabled through the adoption of a holistic set 
of energy optimisation measures, including, 
100% renewable electricity sourcing, and 
Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) 
panel upgrades with capacitor replacements 
and automation. The division also installed 
Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) on HVAC 
cooling towers to dynamically 
adjust 
speed based on ambient temperature, and 
retrofitted LED lighting across building 
zones.
These initiatives delivered a measurable 
improvement in energy performance, with 
approximately 2,300 MT of CO2 emissions 
avoided annually through green energy use 
and operational efficiency. Moreover, the 
building achieved a reduction in energy loss 
through APFC optimisation and achieved 
energy savings in HVAC systems during 
non-peak months. 
Birla Aurora’s certification reinforces the 
division’s leadership in sustainable real 
estate and sets a precedent for future-ready, 
low-carbon commercial infrastructure.

Water efficiency and 
wastewater circularity 
across the Real Estate 
portfolio
The 
Real 
Estate 
division 
embedded 
water stewardship principles across both 
operational and construction phases of its 
developments in FY 2024-25. All projects 
are designed to meet or exceed IGBC Gold 
certification standards, with water efficiency 
forming a core pillar from the design stage.
Across residential and commercial assets, 
the Company standardised the use of low 
flow 
plumbing 
fixtures, 
dual-plumbing 
systems, and rainwater harvesting (RWH) 
infrastructure. Flagship assets like Birla 
Aurora and Birla Centurion feature 100% 
reuse of treated water from on-site STPs for 
flushing, irrigation, and HVAC cooling.
Additionally, Birla Centurion incorporates 
an 850 kL rainwater tank, recharge pits, and 
a ZLD system, making it a benchmark for 
decentralised water circularity. 
Construction-phase water circularity was 
also scaled, with sites like Birla Tisya in 
Bengaluru reusing treated sewage for curing, 
dust suppression, and other applications 
through decentralised STP setups at labour 
camps.
The water stewardship initiatives led to 
significant potable water savings ranging 
from 30% to 56% across both new and legacy 
projects by using water-efficient fixtures. 
Birla Aurora achieved a 35.3% annual 
reduction in water demand through aerator 
retrofits, while Birla Vanya recorded 48.77% 
water savings, amounting to 217,784 litres 
annually. At Birla Tisya in Bengaluru, the 
division reused 4.3 million litres of treated 
water for construction purposes.
Birla Centurion reused 36,673 kL of treated 
water for flushing, HVAC, and landscaping 
during FY 2024–25. Its rainwater harvesting 
systems capture over 126.6 m³/day and 
manage 100% peak runoff, setting a high 
standard for water circularity. Key sites 
received full   IGBC water efficiency credits, 
with 
some 
recognised 
for 
exemplary 
performance in water management and 
sustainability.
9
Scale-up of water reuse 
and effluent reduction 
through 55 water-saving 
initiatives
As part of its commitment to circular 
water management, the Century Pulp & 
Paper division expanded its plant-wide 
reuse programme during FY 2024-25 
by implementing 55 water reuse and 
conservation initiatives, up from 49 in the 
previous year. These initiatives spanned 
eight thematic categories, including clarified 
and backwater reuse, condensate and 
effluent recirculation, gland and sealing 
water recovery, shower and spray water 
optimisation, and soft water loop integration. 
The reuse interventions were deployed 
across all major operations like pulp mill, 
board plant, WPP, tissue line, and chemical 
recovery units with decentralised  recovery 
loops engineered for site-specific flows 
such as hood cleaning, log washing, ash belt 
reuse, and plantation irrigation.
These 55 initiatives enabled the internal 
reuse 
or 
recovery 
of 
approximately 
2,252 
m³/hour 
of 
water, 
significantly 
reducing the plant’s reliance on freshwater 
intake and minimising effluent discharge 
volumes. 
These 
programmes 
enhanced 
water 
efficiency 
across 
process 
streams, 
improved operational stability, and reduced 
stress on the central ETP, contributing to 
long-term water security and circularity at 
the divisional level.

Dynamic waste 
management across Real 
Estate construction and 
operations
In FY 2024–25, the Real Estate division 
implemented a lifecycle-driven approach to 
waste management, tailored to the evolving 
realities of active construction sites and 
operational commercial assets. Recognising 
that 98% of total waste generated was 
linked to Construction and Demolition (C&D) 
activities, project-level strategies focussed 
on minimising waste at source through 
material 
optimisation 
and 
sequencing 
during the design stage. At the execution 
level, reclaimed aggregates from excavation 
and demolition were reused on-site for 
internal road construction, PCC works, water 
barricades, and site levelling, particularly at 
Birla Trimaya and Birla Niyaara. For non-
reusable materials, disposal was managed 
via authorised facilities in full compliance 
with C&D Waste Management Rules.
In commercial assets like Birla Centurion, 
legacy vermi-pits were replaced with a 
high-efficiency Organic Waste Converter 
(OWC), capable of processing 1,100 kg/day 
of food and landscaping waste. Residential 
and commercial projects also integrated 
in situ OWCs to treat organic waste and 
reduce 
landfill 
dependency. 
Additional 
measures included segregated tracking 
and safe disposal of hazardous waste like 
used oil, filters, contaminated cotton, and 
100% recycling of plastic and battery waste 
through certified vendors under EPR and 
Battery Waste Management Rules.
As a result, 67 MT of organic waste was 
processed 
into 
compost 
for 
internal 
landscaping, eliminating the need for 
chemical fertilisers. At the same time, 0.11% 
(15.5 MT) of construction and demolition 
waste was reused on-site, while the 
remaining volume was disposed of through 
landfilling in line with regulatory norms. 
Additionally, 
the 
upgraded 
composting 
system at Birla Aurora increased organic 
waste treatment capacity by 350 kg per day.
Furthermore, the division maintained 100% 
compliance with plastic and battery waste 
recycling mandates, reinforcing circularity 
across 
operational 
sites. 
Parallelly, 
mechanised waste-to-manure conversion 
enhanced hygiene, speed, and compost 
yield at commercial locations.
These interventions helped the division 
reduce 
environmental 
impact 
across 
construction and operational stages while 
embedding circularity, compliance, and 
material recovery across its real estate 
portfolio.

Near-Zero waste 
diversion through circular 
waste management in 
the Pulp & Paper division
The Pulp & Paper division implemented a 
circular waste management framework in 
FY 2024–25, focussing on maximising reuse 
and minimising landfill disposal across both 
hazardous and non-hazardous streams. 
Among non-hazardous waste, biogenic by-
products such as wet and dry pith, sawdust, 
and bark constituted 86% of total waste 
generated and were reused almost entirely 
within internal production processes. 
For hazardous waste, ETP and DIP sludge 
was reused in various manufacturing 
stages, while trace waste such as used 
oil, oil filters, and diesel barrels was safely 
recycled or incinerated in full compliance 
with regulatory norms. 
Plastic 
waste 
generated 
across 
CPP 
operations was 100% recycled through 
authorised vendors, following Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) rules. In 
addition, 100% of battery waste was 
disposed through certified channels.
As a result, 99.89% of biogenic non-
hazardous waste was reused in production, 
while 99.98% of hazardous waste was 
diverted from disposal through in-process 
reuse and authorised treatment.
Furthermore, 100% of plastic and battery 
waste was recycled in line with applicable 
regulations. These efforts led to an overall 
waste diversion rate of nearly 100%, 
reflecting high levels of circularity in 
industrial waste management. The outcome 
underscores the division’s commitment 
to sustainable manufacturing, regulatory 
compliance, and material circularity at scale.

Businesses should engage with and provide value to their 
consumers in a responsible manner.
This principle is founded on the idea that a 
company’s primary goal should be offering 
its customers safe, easy-to-use products 
and services that can be disposed of safely 
and in a way that benefits both parties.
ABREL recognises the pivotal role of 
customers as vital stakeholders, catering 
to both Business-to-Business (B2B) and 
Business-to-Customer (B2C) segments. 
To deepen the understanding of customer 
needs and enhance product development, 
the Company has implemented a range 
of feedback mechanisms, including Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) surveys. These 
tools provide valuable insights that drive 
innovation, enabling ABREL to design 
products that both meet customer 
expectations and expand market presence.
Aligned with Principle 9 of the NGRBC, 
these initiatives also resonate with SDGs, 
including responsible consumption, peace, 
justice, and strong institutions. By utilising 
customer feedback, ABREL not only fosters 
sustainable product innovation but also 
strengthens its commitment to ethical 
practices and societal contributions, 
building a robust foundation for long-term 
growth and customer satisfaction.
