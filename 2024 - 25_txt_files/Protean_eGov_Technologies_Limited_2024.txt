Digital India. We will continue to innovate with purpose—turning today’s challenges into lasting progress for society

Green power 
procurement
Conscious efforts towards procurement 
of green power. Over 21 lakhs units of 
green power consumed. Our premises are 
powered with 83% of Green energy, thus 
reducing GHG emission to that extent.
1548 tCO2e emissions averted in FY 
2024-25.
2.
Energy efficiency efforts
Adopting VRV Air-conditioning system, LED 
Lighting and Occupancy sensors across 
offices to enable energy savings.
With conscious efforts of energy 
conservation and usage of VRV 
technology in Air-conditioning 
across premises, energy 
performance Index has been 
improved. Energy intensity per 
employee reduced for its corporate 
office from 1685 kwh/employee in 
FY 2022-23 to 1490 kwh/employee 
in FY 2024-25.

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
To ensure effective and timely redressal of consumer complaints and feedback, dedicated mechanisms have been 
put in place based on the nature of the grievance. Operational grievances are addressed by a Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) team through a dedicated call center, while technical issues are handled separately by the 
respective technical teams.
	
For online subscriber services, an integrated grievance management system has been implemented. This system 
allows users to raise complaints against service providers or associated offices. Complaints received in physical form, 
such as letters, are also logged into the system to ensure consistency in tracking and resolution. Upon registering 
a complaint, a unique token number is generated, enabling users to track the status and access the resolution 
provided.
	
Students using education-related scholarship portals can report grievances or seek clarifications through dedicated 
call centers. Additionally, grievance redressal options are available online via user login or through designated help 
desk email addresses.
	
For financial services users, grievances can be reported via specific help desk email contacts. Likewise, users of 
licensing and certification services, as well as other regulatory or support platforms, can submit service requests or 
grievances either through dedicated call centers or by emailing the respective help desk teams.
	
These structured processes aim to enhance user experience by ensuring that all grievances are addressed promptly 
and transparently by designated support teams.
