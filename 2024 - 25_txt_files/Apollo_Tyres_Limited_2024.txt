1.
Climate 
change
Risk
Climate-related risks include both 
physical risks, arising from the 
direct impacts of climate change 
(such as extreme weather events) 
and transition risks, associated 
with the shift towards a low-carbon 
economy (such as carbon pricing, 
future government policies and 
regulations). 
If 
not 
proactively 
managed, these risks can result in 
substantial business impacts.
Mitigation Approach: To manage transition 
risks, Apollo Tyres is prioritizing the 
reduction of its environmental footprint 
through initiatives such as Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) emissions reduction, improvements 
in energy efficiency and an increased 
reliance on renewable energy sources. 
These efforts are aligned with Apollo 
Tyres’ commitment to achieving Net Zero 
emissions by 2050. 
Adaptation Approach: To address physical 
risks associated with the impacts of climate 
change—such as extreme weather events, 
rising temperatures and water scarcity—
Apollo Tyres is enhancing the resilience of its 
operations and supply chains. This includes 
investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, 
conducting regular climate risk assessments 
and incorporating

Additionally, this fiscal year, Apollo Tyres 
has commenced climate scenario analysis 
to revalidate physical and transition climate 
risks relevant to the Company.
2.
Business 
conduct
Risk
Business 
Conduct 
is 
vital 
for 
maintaining 
stakeholder 
trust, 
protecting 
the 
Company’s 
reputation and ensuring long-term 
sustainability. 
Operating 
across 
diverse markets, it is important for 
Apollo Tyres to protect its brand 
and reputation against unethical 
practices, corruption, legal non-
compliance and unfair competition. 
Strong business conduct practices 
help mitigate legal, financial and 
reputational risks, while fostering 
an 
ethical 
corporate 
culture 
and supporting the Company’s 
commitment 
to 
responsible 
operations and stakeholder value.
Mitigation Approach: Apollo Tyres has 
implemented a comprehensive Code of 
Conduct, which included anti-corruption, 
anti-harassment and the prevention of 
insider trading and conflicts of interest etc. 
It applies to all employees and business 
partners to ensure ethical standards across 
the organization. To promote a culture of 
ethics and compliance, regular training 
and awareness programs are conducted 
for employees at all levels, focusing on 
responsible 
business 
practices. 
Apollo 
Tyres has also established whistleblower 
mechanisms 
and 
grievance 
redressal 
systems that allow confidential reporting 
and resolution of concerns.

3.
Economic 
Performance
Risk
Rapid changes in industry trends, 
consumer behavior, raw material 
costs, supply chain disruptions and 
geopolitical 
factors 
significantly 
impact the economic performance 
of Apollo Tyres. These factors 
pose direct risks by increasing 
operational costs, disrupting supply 
chains and influencing consumer 
demand, all of which can reduce 
profitability 
and 
affect 
market 
competitiveness. Fluctuating raw 
material prices, for instance, can 
directly escalate production costs, 
while geopolitical uncertainties can 
hinder market access and disrupt 
global supply chains.
Mitigation 
Approach: 
Guided 
by 
its 
commitment to the triple bottom line—
social, 
environmental 
and 
financial 
sustainability—Apollo Tyres diligently seeks 
to create value for every stakeholder. By 
embedding economic risk management into 
its decision-making processes, the Company 
ensures that investments in people, planet 
and profit reinforce one another, thereby 
safeguarding long-term enterprise value.
Adaptation Approach: To remain resilient 
amid evolving industry dynamics, raw-
material price swings and supply-chain 
disruptions, Apollo Tyres 
continuously 
refines its operations. Through relentless 
innovation 
in 
product 
development, 
targeted enhancements in manufacturing 
efficiency and rigorous cost-optimization 
measures, the Company bolsters its capacity 
to absorb shocks and capitalize on emerging 
opportunities—all while preserving robust 
economic performance.

5.
Resource Use 
and Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
Increasing 
the 
use of circular 
materials directly contributes to 
reducing the extraction of finite 
natural resources and mitigating 
associated environmental impacts. 
By prioritizing the use of recycled 
and renewable materials, Apollo 
Tyres aims to lower its resource 
consumption, 
minimize 
waste 
generation and decrease carbon 
emissions, supporting the transition 
towards a more sustainable and 
circular economy.

Apollo Tyres stay ahead in a 
resource-constrained future.

Varying road conditions underline 
the importance of safe and reliable 
tires with efficient performance on

and market competitiveness. It

The company has developed two distinct policies to guide procurement processes: the Apollo Tyres Sustainable Procurement 
Policy (ATSPP) for sourcing raw materials other than natural rubber and the Apollo Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy (ASNRP) for 
managing the supply chain of natural rubber. These policies outline specific guidelines for suppliers, emphasizing compliance with 
sustainability standards and fostering ethical practices.
	
Apollo Tyres incorporates social, ethical and environmental performance factors into its supplier selection process. This approach 
is aligned with the ISO 20400:2017 standard for sustainable procurement, which provides guidance on integrating sustainability 
into procurement practices. As part of its commitment to sustainability, Apollo Tyres ensures that 100% of new supplier screenings 
include assessments of these performance factors. This rigorous evaluation system ensures that suppliers meet the company's 
sustainability criteria during the selection process.
	
The company actively monitors the sourcing of raw materials from organizations certified under ISO 14001 (Environmental 
Management Systems) and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems). These certifications demonstrate 
suppliers' adherence to high standards in environmental management and workplace safety. In the financial year 2024-25, Apollo 
Tyres sourced 71% of raw materials by value from ISO 14001-certified suppliers, while 55% of raw materials by value came from 
ISO 45001-certified suppliers.

a continuous basis before settling the invoice payment.

Apollo Supplier Code of Conduct and adherence to its sustainable procurement policies:
	
ATSPP (Section III: Labor Practices): Suppliers are required to comply with wage laws, including minimum wages, overtime, piece 
rates and legally mandated benefits as per local or international laws.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
	
At Apollo Tyres, stakeholder engagement is rooted in the belief that understanding and responding to the perspectives of those 
who influence or are influenced by the Company operations is essential for sustainable value creation. The identification of key 
stakeholder groups comprising consumers, supply chain partners, communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), business 
associates and investors is carried out through a structured, materiality-driven process. Stakeholders are systematically mapped 
and prioritized based on their level of influence on business decisions and their dependency on the Company’s operations.

strategy and continues to foster trust-based, long-term relationships. Continuous engagement through dialogue, surveys and 
materiality assessments enables Apollo Tyres to stay attuned to evolving stakeholder expectations and align its actions with both

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
	
Apollo Tyres places stakeholder engagement at the core of its sustainability approach. The Company recognizes that continuous 
and transparent dialogue with customers, suppliers, employees, communities and investors is essential to identify emerging 
priorities across environmental, social and economic dimensions, thereby guiding its long-term sustainability strategy. Our Board, 
through the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Committee (BRSC), plays a key role in steering this dialogue. The BRSC 
provides strategic oversight and ensures that insights from stakeholder consultations—gathered through surveys, partnerships, 
forums and community engagement—are channeled into our decision-making processes.
	
Regular updates on ESG initiatives, risks and progress are shared with the Board. These inputs guide our sustainability strategy 
and are transparently communicated through our annual BRSR and Sustainability Report, which are made available to all 
stakeholders. This integrated approach helps us stay aligned with global standards, drive continuous improvement and create long-
term value for all.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and social 
topic? (Yes/No) 
	
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies 
and activities of the entity.  
	
The Company maintains regular and proactive engagement with key stakeholders to effectively gather their input on business 
matters. Additionally, through materiality assessments, the Company works with stakeholders to identify and prioritize key 
economic, environmental and social issues. These material topics, reflecting stakeholder interests and expectations, are integral 
to the Company's strategic decision-making and help shape ESG-related targets and action plans. For further details, please refer 
Sustainability Report FY25.
3.	
Provide detail of instances of engagement with and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.  
	
Apollo Tyres’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework is anchored in its vision of “continuously enhancing stakeholder 
value,” which extends beyond business stakeholders to include vulnerable and marginalized sections of society. The Company’s 
CSR policy integrates the principles of sustainability, inclusive growth and self-reliance, ensuring that its community engagement 
initiatives are both impactful and aligned with national development priorities. For instance, key actions taken by Apollo Tyres’ CSR 
initiatives are:
	
Engagement with Rural Women:
	
Apollo Tyres has implemented targeted interventions to support rural women, who often face systemic challenges in accessing 
livelihood opportunities, markets and financial services. In Baroda, the Company has facilitated the formation of over 864 Self-
Help Groups (SHGs), offering training in income-generating activities, financial literacy and entrepreneurship. To enhance access 
to institutional support, the Company has supported the establishment of a Credit Cooperative Society and an Organic Farming 
Cooperative and Marketing Society. These interventions have connected over 21,000 women to relevant government schemes and 
financial institutions, fostering long-term socio-economic empowerment and self-reliance.

Engagement with the Trucking Community:
	
Recognizing the limited healthcare access to the trucking community—largely due to their mobile work patterns—Apollo Tyres 
has established dedicated healthcare centers along major transport routes. These centres provide free and convenient access to 
primary healthcare services, vision care and awareness programs. The initiative ensures continuity of care through referrals and 
linkages to government health schemes. These efforts directly address the healthcare vulnerabilities of this critical yet underserved 
stakeholder group.
Principle 5: Businesses should respect and promote human rights.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web-link.  
	
The Company ensures swift recognition of the of risks, leading to the development and periodic monitoring of appropriate 
mitigation action plans to foster sustainable growth through a comprehensive risk management framework. As a conscientious 
Company, we have developed the business continuity and emergency plan as part of crucial risk management strategies, details of 
which are given below. 
	
Business Continuity Plan- The Business Continuity Plan which includes all facets of the operations has been developed. Apollo 
Tyres firmly believes in establishing robust processes and plans including prevention and recovery systems to address potential 
threats in order to enable the company to maintain product or service delivery at acceptable levels even after disruptive incidents. 
The objective of the plan is to restore Information Technology (IT) systems at an alternative location and provide user access within 
a response time of 48 hours. The procedures outlined in this document serve as guidance for responding to incidents, ensuring 
that business operations can continue in a limited capacity until IT systems are fully restored. Information security controls remain 
in place to safeguard classified information. The plan is periodically tested based on contingency test plan and audited periodically 
by internal and external audit agencies.
	
Emergency Management Plan- An emergency management plan has been established across all the Plants of Apollo Tyres, 
considering a range of emergency scenarios related to both operational incidents and natural disasters. We have assigned 
dedicated teams at all the plants to respond in emergency scenarios and they undergo recurrent training on the Emergency Plan. 
The plan is subject to regular testing and review, including frequent emergency mock drills, to guarantee readiness. Moreover, the 
Company has established a robust risk management framework to identify and evaluate business risks and opportunities promptly. 
This framework ensures that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigation action plans are developed and periodically 
monitored to drive sustainable growth.
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.  
	
Apollo Tyres, a member of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), collaborates with stakeholders to promote 
sustainability in the natural rubber supply chain. GPSNR, initiated by the  (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) 
WBCSD’s Tire Industry Project, addresses socio-economic, environmental and governance issues, including biodiversity loss, 
deforestation and human rights violations.
	
To mitigate environmental impacts, Apollo Tyres has introduced the Apollo Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy (ASNRP), aligned with 
GPSNR’s policy framework. This policy includes commitments to identify and manage risks related to deforestation, biodiversity 
degradation and conservation of High Conservation Value and High Carbon Stock areas. The ASNRP has been shared with all 
natural rubber suppliers, who have formally accepted its guidelines.
	
No significant adverse impacts have been identified so far.
7.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental 
impacts.   
	
Apollo Tyres conducts periodic audits of all suppliers (100% covered as per supplier audit plan of FY25), assessing their 
environmental impacts using a standardized audit checklist and predefined criteria. The audit includes a dedicated Health, Safety 
and Environment (HSE) section, which verifies suppliers' environmental management systems.
	
During these audits, Apollo Tyres evaluates suppliers' waste management practices, including initiatives to reduce, reuse and 
recycle waste. The audits also examine systems for waste collection, segregation and disposal across manufacturing plants 
and office premises. This process helps minimize environmental impacts by ensuring suppliers adhere to responsible waste 
management practices.
Principle 7: Businesses, when engaging in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a manner 
that is responsible and transparent.

Baroda and Chinnapanduru plants and built community toilets at key transshipment hubs in Delhi 
and Agra, significantly enhancing access to hygienic sanitation services.

As part of its circular economy initiatives, Apollo Tyres creatively repurposes used tyres into 
playground equipment through the End-of-Life Tyre Playgrounds project. This not only extends 
the lifecycle of tyres but also educates children on recycling and sustainability. In FY 2024–25, 
the Company renovated existing ELT playgrounds to enhance their utility and impact.

Livelihood for Rural Women: Navya, Apollo Tyres’ flagship initiative, is designed to economically, 
socially and emotionally empower underprivileged rural women. The programme facilitates doorstep 
income-generation opportunities while also addressing gender discrimination and promoting 
awareness of gender rights. 
The programme also provides the livelihood and skill building training and opportunity to the youth 
and male farmer in the community.
Key Activities
1.	 Self-Help Groups (SHGs)
	
SHGs serve as a powerful vehicle for women’s empowerment by fostering collective strength 
and financial independence. Under Navya, Apollo Tyres adopts a dual approach—strengthening 
existing SHGs and creating new ones. These groups encourage regular savings and provide 
training in financial literacy, bookkeeping and documentation. Beneficiaries are also educated on 
addressing social issues such as domestic violence and gender inequality.
2.	 Livelihood Training and Income Generation
	
The programme offers targeted skill development to enhance economic self-reliance through 
both farm and non-farm-based training modules. Women are trained in a variety of income-
generating activities, including livestock care and management, to broaden livelihood avenues.
3.	 Linkages with Government Schemes and Markets
	
Navya enables beneficiaries to access government welfare schemes and establishes market 
linkages that strengthen entrepreneurship. While government schemes offer financial support, 
market and service sector connections help scale their income-generating activities, creating a 
multiplier effect on the women’s socio-economic upliftment.

Biodiversity Conservation: Biodiversity conservation is a key pillar of Apollo Tyres’ global sustainability 
strategy, with initiatives spanning India, Hungary and the Netherlands. In India, mangrove restoration

projects across multiple locations. In Tamil Nadu, 350,000 teak trees are being maintained, while in 
Gujarat, 10,000 trees have been planted and are actively nurtured under the Miyawaki model. In FY 
25, the Company further expanded its green footprint by planting 25,000 trees in the Tirupati district 
of Andhra Pradesh. These efforts are complemented by engagement with local farming communities 
to enhance soil productivity through sustainable agricultural interventions.

Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (the “LODR Regulations”). 
This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team 
including assurance practitioners and specialists.
Identified Sustainability Information 
2.	
The Identified Sustainability Information for the year 
ended March 31, 2025 is BRSR Core (sub-set of BRSR), 
the attributes of which are summarised in Appendix 1 
to this report. The Reporting Boundary for BRSR is on 
standalone basis as disclosed under Question No. 13, 
Section A of the BRSR.
3.	
Our reasonable assurance engagement (BRSR Core) was 
with respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information 
only the attributes of which are summarised in Appendix 1 to 
this report and we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in 
the BRSR (i.e. non- BRSR Core attributes) and, therefore, do 
not express any opinion thereon. 
Criteria
4.	
The Criteria used by the company to prepare the Identified 
Sustainability Information is as under:

per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/
CIR/2024/177 dated December 20, 2024.
Management’s Responsibility 
5.	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or 
establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified 
Sustainability 
Information 
including 
the 
reporting 
boundary of BRSR, disclosing environmental information 
basis operational control approach, taking into account 
applicable laws and regulations including the SEBI circular, 
related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability 
Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the 
Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation 
and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the 
preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of 
Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The 
Management and the Board of Directors of the Company are 
also responsible for overseeing the Company’s compliance 
with the requirements of LODR Regulations and the SEBI 
Circular in relation to the BRSR Core.
Inherent limitations 
6.	
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and this can affect 
comparability between entities.
7.	
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core attributes, 
some of which are estimates, is subject to inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, 
water footprint, energy footprint, embracing circularity 
(waste management). Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the 
uncertainty in the amounts and attributes. 
Our Independence and Quality Control
