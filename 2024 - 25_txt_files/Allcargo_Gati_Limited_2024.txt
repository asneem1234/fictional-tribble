Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity
1.
Energy
Opportunity
As a logistics company, efficient 
energy management is crucial 
to ensure that we reduce our 
dependency on non-renewable 
energy sources and transition 
to options such as green fuels 
and route optimization. While 
adopting better technology to 
reduce our energy consumption 
can have a significant initial 
investment, this will ensure 
transition to cleaner fuels and 
reduce emissions in the process.
-
Positive 
implications
2.
Energy
Risk
•	
Transitioning 
towards 
renewable sources of energy 
such as solar, wind or green 
hydrogen comes with a 
significant investment. 
•	
Further, 
appropriate 
infrastructure for Alternate 
Fuel 
Vehicles 
(AFVs), 
including Electric Vehicles 
(EVs) may not be available in 
remote locations. 
•	
We are largely dependent 
on our business vendors 
such as business associates 
for being able to transition 
towards 
alternate 
energy 
sources.
•	
AllcargoGATI 
is 
investing 
in 
solar 
plant installations on 
an OpEx model, thus 
reducing the initial cost 
of capital.
•	
AllcargoGATI 
is 
currently focusing on 
geographies that has 
infrastructure to adopt 
Alternate Fuel Vehicles 
(AFVs), including EVs 
with 
ease 
and 
will 
slowly 
expand 
over 
other 
geographies 
depending 
upon 
availability.
Negative 
implications
3.
Emissions
Risk
The 
principal 
source 
of 
emissions for AllcargoGATI is 
its road transportation segment 
which is operated via third-party 
business partners. Additionally 
non-management of emissions 
can 
lead 
to 
damage 
to 
AllcargoGATI’s brand value and 
reputation.
AllcargoGATI 
is 
working with third-party 
aggregators 
to 
include 
alternate 
fuel 
vehicles, 
including EVs, CNG and 
LNG vehicles in the first 
and 
last 
mile 
delivery 
segment.
Negative 
implications
4.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
As 
a 
logistics 
company, 
AllcargoGATI is also exposed to 
the risk of road accidents which 
can lead to permanent injuries 
or loss of life. Unsafe working 
conditions can lead to work-
related injuries. Failure to meet 
regulatory 
requirements 
can 
also lead to heavy penalization.
AllcargoGATI has a Health 
and Safety Policy with a 
commitment to conducting 
business activities, with 
zero injury to employees, 
sub-contractors and third-
party organizations.
Negative 
implications
5.
Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion
Opportunity
Bias and discrimination at work 
hinders 
healthy 
professional 
relationships and can hamper 
professional development. The 
physical work environment and 
geographic locations of the 
industry can increase entrance 
of 
individuals 
with 
diverse 
backgrounds/ geographies also 
increasing inclusion of women 
in the workforce, thus providing 
access to a wider talent pool.

Labour Practice 
and Human 
Rights
Risk
Human rights violations and 
abuse can adversely impact 
employees 
and 
contractual 
labour workforce and bear a risk 
of litigation. Such violations can 
also cause reputational damage 
to the company.
AllcargoGATI 
has 
a 
Human Rights Policy with 
commitments such as zero 
tolerance towards human 
trafficking, child labour, and 
forced labour, freedom of 
association, discrimination 
among others. A formal 
grievance 
redressal 
mechanism is set in place 
wherein all employees can 
report on employeefirst@
a l l c a r g o l o g i s t i c s .
com 
and 
contractual 
workers can report any 
grievances 
through 
the 
whistleblower mechanism 
as well via whistleblower@
allcargologistics.com
Negative 
Implications
7.
Community 
Development
Opportunity
Community 
development 
is essential for obtaining a 
social 
license 
to 
operate. 
AllcargoGATI’s 
presence 
is 
widespread 
with 
operations 
all over India and thus can 
impact 
many 
communities. 
Corporate social responsibility 
can also lead to increased 
investor interest and brand value 
recognition.
-
Positive 
implications
8.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Providing sustainable logistics 
solutions can attract and retain 
customers as many commercial 
customers 
are 
looking 
for 
ways to make their supply 
chain 
sustainable. 
Ensuring 
that customer grievances and 
feedback are redressed, which 
can boost customer loyalty and 
increase retention.
-
Positive 
Implication
9.
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Ensuring good governance and 
transparent practices can help 
securing stakeholder interest, 
a higher reputation, reduced 
risks and improved financial 
performance.
-
Positive 
Implications
10.
Cybersecurity
Risk
Data breaches and cybersecurity 
threats 
have 
increased 
over the past decade. With 
cloud computing and online 
marketplace 
and 
payments, 
maintaining 
the 
privacy 
of 
customer or employee data 
is 
crucial 
for 
AllcargoGATI. 
Cyber-attacks can have several 
impacts on the functioning of the 
organization such as operational 
cost and reputational damage.
AllcargoGATI 
has 
a 
Cybersecurity policy and is 
ISO 27001:2022 certified to 
ensure utmost compliance 
and better customer data 
privacy. 
Compliance 
to 
such high standards of 
cybersecurity has helped 
us achieve a high rating in 
our third-party IT audit from 
BitSight with a score of 780 
and rated “Advanced”

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Opportunity
Adopting a sustainable supply 
chain can help minimize supply 
disruption risks and emerging 
regulatory 
risks. 
Ensuring 
that 
suppliers 
also 
meet 
AllcargoGATI’s ESG expectations 
can contribute to supporting 
local businesses, reduce implied 
environmental 
impacts, 
and 
promote good governance.

Positive

Supply chain 
disruptions
Risk
Disruptions in the supply chain 
can further hamper processes 
and 
create 
a 
ripple 
effect 
throughout AllcargoGATI’s value 
chain. Such disruptions can also 
delay deliveries and damage 
brand reputation subsequently 
leading to financial losses.
AllcargoGATI 
has 
established 
a 
Supplier 
Code of Conduct including 
coverage 
of 
human 
rights, 
environmental 
performance, 
community 
development, 
business 
ethics and transparency 
and whistleblowing.
AllcargoGATI 
has 
also 
adopted 
a 
sustainable 
procurement policy for its 
suppliers with guidelines to 
procure from sustainable 
and local sources.
