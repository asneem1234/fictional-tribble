Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Alicon Group has established a dedicated ESG Committee at the management level, which serves as the primary 
channel for consultation on economic, environmental, and social matters. The Committee is responsible for regularly 
updating the Board on relevant developments, presenting stakeholder concerns, and seeking guidance from the 
Directors. Feedback from ongoing stakeholder engagements is consolidated, assessed, and communicated to the 
Board, enabling informed decision-making and ensuring that the Company’s strategies remain aligned with ESG 
priorities and stakeholder expectations.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. Alicon Group maintains regular, proactive engagement with its key stakeholders to inform and strengthen its 
ESG strategies while ensuring transparency in outcomes. Inputs gathered through these consultations—such as 
feedback on regulatory changes, environmental practices, and social initiatives—are reviewed and incorporated into 
policy updates, operational improvements, and new programme development. Periodic evaluations are conducted 
to ensure policies remain relevant, compliant, and responsive to stakeholder expectations.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
To address the concerns of vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups, the Entity begins the process by 
identifying target areas and assessing their needs through surveys, visits, and evaluations to determine whether 
these needs are project-relevant or aspirational. Following this, a thorough Needs Assessment is conducted to identify 
specific communities that would benefit most from the Entity’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) interventions. 
The Entity then collaborates with the local community to finalize projects, ensuring alignment with the identified 
needs and aspirations. On-ground mobilization strategies are implemented to effectively engage stakeholders and 
the community in CSR initiatives, ensuring that the projects not only address their concerns but also empower 
them through active participation. This holistic approach ensures that the Entity’s actions are inclusive and have a 
meaningful impact on the most vulnerable groups within the community.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused 
or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. Alicon Group has established a dedicated Human Rights Policy that enables employees to raise complaints 
or grievances directly with the Human Resources Department or Senior Management. To address such matters, a 
designated committee may be formed or delegated to investigate reported issues, evaluate their impact, and ensure 
timely resolution. The process guarantees protection against retaliation for individuals raising concerns, and the 
committee works in collaboration with Senior Management to recommend and implement appropriate corrective 
actions.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Alicon Group fully acknowledges the vital and non-negotiable importance of protecting and promoting human rights 
across all aspects of its business operations. The Company is deeply committed to upholding and safeguarding the 
fundamental rights and dignity of all its stakeholders, including employees, local communities, contractors, business 
partners, and suppliers. This commitment is rooted in and guided by internationally recognized human rights 
frameworks and standards, such as the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s 
(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Global Compact principles. 
These foundational documents form the basis of Alicon Group’s approach to responsible business conduct and 
ethical practices.
88
Alicon Castalloy Limited
	
To translate this commitment into effective action, the Company has established a robust and comprehensive 
Human Rights Policy. This policy is designed not only to promote awareness and respect for human rights within the 
organization but also to ensure that any violations or concerns are proactively identified and addressed. The Human 
Rights Policy is implemented in close coordination with the Company’s Grievance Policy, creating an integrated 
framework that enables employees and other stakeholders to voice concerns, report grievances, or raise issues in a 
safe, structured, and confidential manner. The Company is committed to ensuring that such concerns are reviewed, 
investigated, and resolved promptly, fairly, and transparently, with appropriate corrective measures where necessary.
	
The process is structured as follows:
	
Employees and affiliates are encouraged to raise any complaints, concerns, or reports of misconduct directly with 
the Human Resources department or Senior Management. The Company strictly prohibits any form of retaliation or 
disciplinary action against individuals who voice concerns in good faith under this policy.
	
Furthermore, the Company routinely carries out human rights due diligence activities to monitor the implementation 
of the policy, ensure ongoing compliance, and identify areas requiring corrective action or further improvement.

Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Alicon Group has robust mechanisms in place to protect complainants in cases of discrimination and harassment.
	
While handling complaints under the grievance redressal mechanism, every effort is made to ensure that the inquiry 
is conducted in a calm and respectful manner to prevent any undue stress for those involved. The entire process is 
strictly confidential.
	
The Company’s Grievance Policy outlines that all members of the Grievance Committee, individuals responsible for 
maintaining records, and any staff member involved in or questioned during the proceedings are obligated to always 
maintain confidentiality. All documents and information shared during the process must be kept private.
	
Any form of harsh, disrespectful, or insulting behavior by anyone involved in or conducting the grievance proceedings 
is strictly prohibited. Such conduct will be treated as misconduct under the Company’s disciplinary policies and will 
result in appropriate and firm disciplinary action.
