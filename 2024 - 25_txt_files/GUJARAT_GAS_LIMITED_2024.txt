Risk
Rationale for 
identifying the risk / 
opportunity
Employees & workers are 
the most important 
resources at GGL.
Owing to the nature of 
business staff health and 
safety is critical for the 
Company.
It is important for the 
Company to provide a safe 
working environment to its 
employees and workers to 
retain and enhance 
employee & worker 
confidence and morale. 
O- Natural Gas combustion 
emits fewer pollutants and 
GHGs as compared to coal  
or other polluting fuel 
combustion. As a result, GGL 
has a significant opportunity 
as it expands operations to 
deliver Natural Gas, an 
environment friendly fuel.
Government/ Authority 
regulations on non-usage of 
polluting fuel can also have a 
positive impact on business 
operations.
R - Emission of Natural Gas 
directly into atmosphere 
from pipeline damage / 
equipment or as part of 
project & maintenance 
activities since Natural Gas is 
predominantly methane 
which is a GHG.
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate 
• GGL has a comprehensive 
Health safety policy and 
places a high priority on 
implementation of the 
same.
• Robust OHS Management 
system with HSE specific 
SOPs & Guidelines to 
prevent Health & Safety 
related incidents    
• All critical activities are 
carried out after detailed 
risk assessment & 
mitigations are 
implemented in line with 
OHS risk registers.
NA
• Effective coordination with 
digging agencies to prevent 
network damages.
• Prompt emergency 
response for quick isolation 
of the damaged section.
• Isolation valves at 
regulator-defined 
distances to reduce 
emissions after isolation.
• Strengthening Gas leak 
detection systems & 
process.
• Effective preventive 
maintenance plan & 
adherence to reduce 
breakdown instances
• Efficient commissioning 
SOP to reduce Natural Gas 
emissions, among other 
things.
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Negative, As Loss of Life 
or Loss of Working days 
due to work-related 
illness and injury, which 
may impede the work or 
supply and will involve 
compensations and 
other financials impacts.
Positive, increase in 
operations will lead to 
reduction of carbon 
emissions as compared to 
polluting fuels & increase 
in the overall profitability 
of the Company.
Negative, 
Damages/failure of 
pipeline /equipment or 
planned release of gases 
as part of operation will 
lead to lost product 
(Natural Gas) into the 
atmosphere may lead to 
financial loss in terms of 
lost unbilled gas.

operations and will plan to 
and take necessary 
mitigating and adapting 
steps to combat such 
climate change risk.

carries out health and safety 
campaigns among 
customers, and communities 
to address the risk. 
Risk management is done for 
all GGL critical assets – 
pipelines, CGS, CNG Stations 
through safety engineering 
studies tools like below to 
ensure risks are under 
ALARP (As Low As 
Reasonably Practicable):-
• Hazard Operability study 
(HAZOP)
• Quantitative Risk 
Assessment (QRA)
• Escape Muster Evacuation 
& Rescue Analysis

• Hazardous Area 
Classification (HAC)
The Company also complies 
with the international safety 
standards and local laws and 
regulations.

Improving energy efficiency 
throughout its business 
operations is a key 
component of GGL’s Energy 
Strategy. GGL is working on 
Increasing the percentage of 
renewable power for 
combatting emissions. 
GGL has taken the following 
steps to combat the risk:
• Use of renewable sources 
of energy 
• Switching to Gas based 
vehicles from traditional 
fuels like petrol and diesel
• Optimum utilization of 
resources 
• Timely & effective 
preventive maintenance to 
ensure efficient energy 
utilization
• Reducing water 
consumption 
proportionately
• Ensuring authorized 
disposal/treatment of 
hazardous waste such as 
Used Oil for re-refining
Positive, Shifting towards 
renewable energy might 
reduce overall 
maintenance costs. It 
also contributes to a 
cleaner and greener

operational areas to use compressed natural gas as a clean 
automotive fuel through various campaigns. GGL has made it 
a priority to expand CNG transportation and dispensing 
infrastructure and facilities. CNG is a popular alternative fuel 
because of its clean burning characteristics and low carbon 
emission in air. Natural gas helps to reduce the environmental 
impact of vehicular emissions caused by use of other polluting 
fuels such as petrol and diesel.
 Goal: In FY 2025-26, GGL plans to set up 47 new CNG 
stations across GGL operational areas. GGL also plans to

PRINCIPLE 3: Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their value chains
This principle is focused on equity, dignity, and quality of life of the organization employees as well as 
employees of value chain partners. Entities must comply with the regulatory and statutory Requirements, and 
further provide equal opportunity to all the employees.
GGL places great emphasis on employee growth and well-being because these factors boost output, morale, 
and reduce attrition rates. Workers are an organization's most valuable asset since they not only act as a 
conduit between the Company and its consumers, but they also significantly contribute to the overall success 
of the Company. GGL has a sharp focus on inclusion and diversity, health and wellbeing and continuous 
learning and development of its employees and workers. The Company’s redressal mechanisms enable workers to report issues 
from across the organization, allowing them to be addressed rapidly and effectively.

PRINCIPLE 5: Businesses should respect and promote human rights
The core belief of this principle is based on the idea that every human being has inherent rights that cannot be compromised in any 
way for the benefit of business. According to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, businesses are also held 
accountable for any violations of human rights and must take reasonable measures to prevent such violations from occurring as a 
result of their operations.
GGL social responsibility initiatives are focused on providing decent working conditions in all our offices, sites, and other locations 
where the company operates, as well as ensuring the protection of all our stakeholders' human rights. GGL is committed towards 
continuous improvement and has begun taking steps to effectively incorporate human rights into its business operations.

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
Reduction of Natural Gas emission in Operational & Maintenance Activities:
GGL strives to lower the emissions of natural gas from its operations, either as part of a planned release or because of an 
unplanned leakage. The majority of these emissions are the result of unintentional releases brought on by third-party network 
damage, but certain emissions are the result of network failure itself. A smaller portion of these emissions are also the result of 
planned releases, which often occur during preventive maintenance or network / equipment commissioning activities.
1. GGL carries out various educational programs, utility coordination meetings, and campaigns such as dial before dig (detailed 
below) for third parties working in the same area as GGL with an aim to reduce these emissions. 
2. Leak detection program including Lock pressure Test / leak detection survey to identify small leaks in network on a quarterly 
basis
3. Installation of Open Path leak detection and alarm system at all GGL CGS and Zero point Filtering, metering & Odorization 
stations (Tap-off stations) to identify and minimize leakages
4. Installation of Gas detectors at District Regulating station to identify and minimize leakages
5. Prompt emergency response to reported damage cases for fast isolation of the damaged section.
6. Isolation valves at regulator-defined distances to reduce emissions after isolation.
7. Effective patrolling of GGL pipeline network daily to prevent damages during third party excavation
8. Preventive maintenance plan and adherence to the same to reduce breakdown instances  
9. An efficient commissioning procedure to reduce natural gas emissions, among other things.
GGL tracks Natural Gas emissions per 10,000 scm of gas purchased cumulatively on a monthly basis in comparison to the 
previous fiscal year.
Green Hydrogen Blending in PNG Network:
GGL along with M/s NTPC had commissioned in 2023 India’s first Green H  blending (5%) and further increased to 8% in 
2
PNG distribution network at Kawas, Hazira and is successfully running. Hydrogen blended in Natural Gas is supporting 
de-carbonization since green hydrogen is not a GHG and hence volume of Methane replaced by hydrogen directly reduces 
GHG emission. This pilot project supplies blended gas to domestic & commercial connections of NTPC township. The project is 
also supporting to verify the feasibility assumptions and impact related to hydrogen blending such as safety, asset 
health/integrity, blending homogeneity, combustion and odorization etc. in PNG network. 
Solar Group Captive Project:
GGL has planned to install around 15 MW of Solar Group Captive project to use the generated electricity for the Company 
Owned CNG stations in phase #1.  An open tender was published and we have received good response from the bidders. This 
project is expected to bring estimated reduction in Scope-2 CO  emission since Solar energy is environmental friendly power 
2
generation and don’t produce greenhouse gases or emit carbon emissions during electricity generation. 
Upgradation of Daughter to Online Stations:
GGL in this FY has upgraded 20 Daughter & Daughter Booster CNG stations into Online stations which will now be supplied gas 
through pipeline and therefore ultimately reducing 30 Mobile Cascade Vehicles & related fuel consumption,  earlier required for 
transportation of gas from Mother CNG stations to these stations and also reducing electricity consumption to 4000 units per 
day  ultimately leading to energy conservation.
Set-up of small scale LCNG Station: 
New LCNG station has been set up and commissioned at Nalasopara, Thane GA. The station has daily average CNG Sales of 
around 23000 Kg/Day, and therefore has helped to reduce CNG MCV transportation trips. Commissioning this LCNG station 
has reduced around 63,000 Kms per month of truck/trailer movement and fuel consumption to achieve this sales volume 
compared to CNG Booster Stations which would otherwise be fed by Boisar Mother CNG Station.  
Use of light weight composite cylinders:
Instead of steel cascade cylinder (3000/4500WLC capacity), GGL is using light weight composite cylinder (Type-III) 
(8800WLC/6600WLC – 353 nos.) for transportation of higher volume CNG from mother to daughter stations. Due to 
introduction of high volume MEGC cascade per station MCV vehicle requirement has reduced from 2.2 to 1.8.
Switching to less polluting fuel:
GGL through various outsourced agencies are running around 815 CNG Mobile Cascade Vehicle (MCV) for transporting CNG 
from Mother CNG stations to Daughter / Daughter booster CNG stations. All MCVs are now being run on CNG as fuel instead of 
Diesel hence reducing GHG.

Promoting Natural Gas as Cleaner Environment Friendly fuel
PNG: GGL's business is the distribution of natural gas as a cleaner, more environmentally friendly fuel for domestic, industrial, 
and commercial use. GGL supplies natural gas to industries via its pipeline infrastructure as a cleaner alternative fuel to polluting 
fuels such as coal. GGL by virtue of its Natural Gas sales to industrial consumers reduces the burning of approximately 13499 
Metric Tons of coal per day in FY 2024-25.
CNG: GGL is influencing automobile users in its operational areas to use compressed Natural Gas as a clean automotive fuel 
through various campaigns. With the goal of promoting CNG, F-DODO scheme was also launched for developing CNG station 
infrastructure through Public-Private Partnership model (PPP) to provide potent solution to green mobility challenge. GGL has 
made it a priority to expand CNG transportation and dispensing infrastructure and facilities. In FY 2024-25,17 new CNG 
stations have been commissioned across GGL operational areas, and 49 stations have been upgraded to increase capacity. 
CNG is a popular alternative fuel because of its clean burning characteristics and low carbon emission in air. Natural gas helps to 
reduce the environmental impact of vehicular emissions caused by the use of other polluting fuels such as petrol and diesel. 
GGL by virtue of its CNG sales reduces the consumption of approximately 3029 Kilolitres of petrol per day in FY 2024-25. 
GGL recognizes and understands the various global challenges and risks related to environmental degradation and climate 
change as a responsible organization. Building awareness about these challenges and risks among employees and the 
community is an effective way to address them.

of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and 
remediation activities. 
Environmental Impact Assessment, Environmental Management Plan, Risk Assessment & Disaster Management Plan for 
Natural Gas Distribution pipeline network in UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Virar Pipeline & Dahanu pipeline networks:
There are no direct or indirect biological impacts of high significance rating related to GGL project, however direct or indirect 
biological impacts of moderate significance along with their prevention and remediation actions are explained below:
1. Removal of vegetation along the pipeline ROU
2. Removal of orchards along the Pipeline ROU
Prevention & Remediation activities related to Environmental Impact
Proposed pipeline will be laid along the existing road RoW under Public Works Department authority and will not pass through 
any dense forest area which is conducive for the existence of significant wildlife in such an area. As far as possible, minimum 
numbers of trees will be cut while laying pipeline. Removing vegetation outside ROU will be strictly prohibited. 10 times the 
number of trees for every tree cut planted as per guidelines the Ministry of Environment & Forests.
If the entity has undertaken any specific initiatives or used innovative technology or solutions to improve resource 
efficiency, or reduce impact due to emissions / effluent discharge / waste generated, please provide details of the 
same as well as outcome of such initiatives, as per the following format:

Stations to 
Online 
GGL conducted assessments & tests on testing 
riser w.r.t. 15% H  blending (without exposing the 
2
customers to increased blending). The tests 
included Homogeneity Test of Blended gas, Burner 
behavior Test, Odor concentration Test etc. 
Results were satisfactory with no areas of 
concern. Quantitative risk assessment (desktop 
study) was done for PNG pipeline network with 
upto 15% H  blending to understand the risks 
2
involved due to higher blending levels for which 
the results were found within ALARP (As Low As 
Reasonably Practicable) levels. Material testing 
were also done for various network assets to 
establish any deteriorating effects on network 
health due to blended hydrogen exposure. All test 
results were satisfactory and same was also 
presented to industry regulator with proposal to 
increase blending%.
GGL has kick-started the operation of off-taking 
supply of Biogas from Bio-gas suppliers into GGL 
PNG/CNG system at three new locations - Indore 
(UDI GA), Gurdaspur (H&G GA), Hoshiarpur (H&G 
GA) in this Financial year, taking the total tally of 
bio-gas off-take to seven.
GGL has upgraded 20 Daughter & Daughter 
Booster CNG stations into Online stations which 
will now be supplied gas through pipeline instead 
of Mobile Cascade Vehicle (MCV)
This pilot project also provides learnings to the 
industry and act as case model for future projects 
of H  blending in PNG

Hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas (GHG), nor 
does it produce GHGs when burned, making it a 
potential substitute for reducing the carbon 
intensity or pollution of some energy or fuel 
applications. 
Since Bio Gas is produced in the agricultural / food 
waste transformation process developed 
indigenously, this contributes to waste 
management and reduction of soil, air pollution & 
also provides boost to entrepreneurship, rural 
economy while supporting national commitment 
by reducing country’s dependency on imported fuel.
Upgradation of these CNG stations has reduced 
movement of MCVs earlier required for 
transportation of gas from Mother CNG stations 
to these stations ultimately leading to energy 
conservation & reduction in environmental 
emissions

we have received good response from the bidders. 
This project is expected to bring estimated 
reduction in Scope-2 Co  emission by 2.1 lakh

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
In accordance with the PNGRB ERDMP regulations, 2010, amended in 2020, GGL has created ERDMP documents for each of 
its operational geographic areas, which cover scenarios where undesirable events can be foreseen or suspected. This is carried 
out to make GGL ready to respond appropriately to any unforeseen and unintentional accidents. The PNGRB empaneled Third 
Party Agency has audited and certified these documents, and GGL’s Board of Directors has duly approved them. GGL carries 
out testing of effectiveness of ERDMP through mock-drills covering various types of anticipated emergency scenarios.
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard 
GGL is engaged in “Natural Gas” distribution to Domestic, Commercial, Industrial and Transport Consumers. Natural Gas being 
inherently a cleaner fuel is an environment friendly fuel. 
GGL products do not have any major adverse environmental impacts, however GGL has identified and assessed Environmental 
aspects related to each of its significant business activities / processes – pipeline construction, maintenance, natural gas 
compression etc. Further, GGL has taken adequate mitigation measures to minimize residual risks to as low as reasonably 
practicable or acceptable levels.
