In case of risk, approach

Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1
Responsible 
Sourcing of 
Materials
Opportunity
The responsible sourcing of raw 
materials, including the selective use 
of recycled materials where feasible, 
supports resource conservation 
and helps the Company minimize 
its environmental impact. Ethical 
sourcing also fosters stronger supplier 
relationships and reinforces customer 
confidence in the brand.
The Company aims to progressively enhance its 
sourcing practices by encouraging the use of recycled 
and responsibly sourced materials, wherever feasible, 
with the objective of reducing reliance on finite 
resources.
Positive implications- 
Enhances supplier 
relationships, brand 
trust, and may 
optimize sourcing 
costs.
2.
Customer
satisfaction
Opportunity
In a highly competitive jewellery 
market, a customer-centric approach 
supports brand loyalty, encourages 
repeat business, and strengthens the 
Company’s market reputation.
The Company emphasizes personalized customer 
engagement, equips frontline employees through 
regular training, and utilizes customer relationship tools 
and feedback mechanisms to address queries and 
concerns in a timely manner.
Positive implications- 
Supports customer 
retention, repeat 
business, and 
revenue stability.
3.
Ethical
Governance
and
Compliance
Opportunity
Effective governance frameworks 
enhance transparency, strengthen 
stakeholder confidence, support 
regulatory compliance, and contribute 
to sustainable long-term business 
performance
The Company maintains Board-level oversight on key 
governance matters, supported by regular training 
initiatives and robust audit and review mechanisms.
Positive implications- 
Lowers regulatory 
and reputational risks; 
supports long-term 
financial health.
4.
GHG
Emissions
and Energy
Management
Risk
Risk: Energy consumption in 
manufacturing and retail operations 
affects operational costs and 
contributes to indirect greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions — notably 
Scope 2 emissions from purchased 
electricity and Scope 3 emissions 
from transportation and supply chain 
activities
The Company continues to adopt energy-efficient 
practices such as LED lighting, optimized HVAC 
systems, and monitors energy usage across 
operations. Opportunities for low-emission transport 
and alternative energy sources are also being 
evaluated.
Negative 
Implications 
Increases 
operational costs; 
energy efficiency 
measures may partly 
offset.
5.
Water
Stewardship
Risk
Water usage in retail, office, and 
manufacturing operations presents a 
potential operational risk, especially 
in view of emerging climate-related 
water scarcity, which could lead to 
rising costs over time.
The Company promotes water conservation 
through measures such as installing low-flow 
fixtures, monitoring consumption, raising employee 
awareness, and implementing rainwater harvesting 
at select locations. These steps help optimize usage 
and support sustainability goals.
Negative 
Implications

(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such a system? – No
(b)  What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
Senco Gold operates in a relatively low-risk environment, primarily engaged in jewellery crafting and retail
activities. While the nature of work is not manufacturing-intensive, the company has implemented a set of
practical procedures to support safe and efficient operations. For non-routine tasks, teams rely on their
operational experience to plan activities carefully and take necessary safety precautions. Basic safety
measures, such as providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like gloves and masks, are adopted
based on the nature of the task. Additionally, fire protection, detection, and public address (PA) systems
are installed across facilities and are maintained regularly to ensure they remain functional. These safety
practices are aligned with the nature and scale of Senco Gold’s operations and contribute to maintaining a
safe and secure working environment.
(c)  Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves
from such risks. (Y/N) – Yes. At the manufacturing plant and stores, employees are encouraged to promptly
report any work-related hazards to ensure a safe and responsive working environment. Communication
is facilitated through commonly used internal channels that include all relevant team members, allowing
for quick dissemination of information and timely action. In addition to these group-based communication
methods, employees may also reach out directly to concerned personnel via phone or in person, depending

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage
and implementation.
Senco Gold Limited’s in-house manufacturing operations contribute only a small portion of the overall
jewellery production, with the majority of products crafted by external skilled artisans (“Karigars”). As a retail-
focused business, the company does not engage in large-scale industrial processes that result in effluent
generation. Water usage is limited to non-industrial purposes such as sanitation and cleaning, and the
process does not produce any effluent that is hazardous or non-permissible under applicable regulations.
Given the negligible discharge, the implementation of a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system is not required.

Not applicable as jewellery production operations do not involve any kind 
of heavy manufacturing or use of any materials that emit air pollutants.
Additionally, Senco Gold Limited employs advanced air pollution control 
systems within its jewellery manufacturing units, specifically PP FRP 
(polypropylene and fiber-reinforced plastic) scrubbers. These scrubbers 
effectively neutralize and capture over 90% of airborne pollutants—
including particles and acidic gases such as sulfuric, hydrochloric, 
and nitric acid—using neutralizing agents like urea. This highly efficient 
process ensures that the purified exhaust gases meet stringent 
environmental standards before release, resulting in negligible or non-
reportable air emissions from operations.

details.
Senco Gold Limited has undertaken several initiatives to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions,
reflecting its commitment to environmental sustainability. The company has installed Variable Refrigerant Flow
(VRF) air conditioning systems in four of its retail stores—Dehradun, Varanasi, Sonarpur, and Malda—which
reduce the number of outdoor units required, thereby improving energy efficiency and lowering emissions.
To further reduce the environmental impact of its retail operations, Senco is shifting from conventional wall
paints to more sustainable materials such as laminates and veneers for store interiors. The company has also
adopted LED lighting across its facilities, significantly reducing overall energy consumption.
As part of its renewable energy efforts, Senco Gold has installed solar panels with a total capacity of 16.5
kWp at its Jadavpur store. This installation, completed at a cost of C6.45 lakhs, has already generated 8,470
units of electricity—contributing to reduced reliance on conventional energy sources and supporting the
company’s broader GHG emission reduction objectives.
