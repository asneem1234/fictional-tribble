At Ceigall, we are firmly committed to the principles of sustainable development, guided by a vision of long-term 
responsibility and ethical growth. We embed the highest standards of integrity into every facet of our operations and 
continuously strive to adopt the best practices across divisions. Our focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance

well-being, and the delivery of high-impact infrastructure projects. We foster a workplace culture that values diversity 
and inclusion, encouraging all individuals to contribute meaningfully and bring unique perspectives to the table. 
We understand that ESG-related challenges are inherent 
in the infrastructure sector, especially 
in managing 
environmental footprints and ensuring worker safety. Despite these complexities, we remain dedicated to setting 
measurable ESG targets sooner and maintaining transparent reporting frameworks. Our ongoing efforts ensure 
compliance check; and also represent a proactive approach to safeguarding the environment and enhancing social 
outcomes while maintaining robust governance mechanisms. This consistent commitment enhances our operational 
resilience and positions Ceigall as a responsible and forward-thinking industry leader. 
Our strategy rests on aligning internal values with external actions to ensure authentic and impactful progress. 
Through this alignment, we aim to generate lasting value for our stakeholders, through our financial performance 
and responsible conduct and innovation. As we evolve, we believe that ESG integration is central to building trust, 
driving sustainable growth, and reinforcing Ceigall's legacy as a company that contributes to the greater good. We

what is the coverage of such a system? 
The Company has integrated an Occupational Health and Safety Management System into its operational framework, 
reinforcing its commitment to safeguarding the well-being of its workforce. Regular safety inspections and internal audits 
are conducted to proactively identify potential hazards and assess risks, at each of its project sites. Based on these 
assessments, appropriate mitigation measures are implemented to minimize safety-related incidents and promote 
a 
culture of continuous improvement in workplace health and safety. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity? 
The Company has implemented a structured risk management framework aimed at identifying, assessing, and mitigating 
hazards across its project sites and office locations. The process involves active participation from key internal and 
external stakeholders, including contractors, project engineers, supervisors, and workforce teams, to ensure effective risk 
monitoring and control. This collaborative approach supports the creation of a safe and secure working environment and 
reflects the Company's ongoing commitment to health, safety, and operational excellence. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
The Company has established a robust mechanism to ensure continuous monitoring and reporting of work-related hazards 
across all project sites. Designated personnel are appointed at each location to act as single points of contact (SPOCs) for 
addressing safety concerns and resolving on-site issues in a timely manner. Escalations, if any, are handled as a priority, 
with unresolved matters being referred to the Head Office, where the Health & Safety leadership team ensures appropriate 
and prompt action. This structured escalation process reflects the Company's commitment to maintaining a safe and 
responsive working environment.

We implement stringent safety protocols at each site, tailored to the specific type and nature of the project. We ensure 
that all contractors, ground workers, and related parties use well-maintained and certified equipment to uphold the highest

compliance. Regular training programs are conducted for all employees and contractors to reinforce safety awareness, 
alongside timely inspections and audits to identify and address potential risks. We maintain clear communication channels 
to disseminate safety information and updates promptly. All accidents are reported and thoroughly investigated to prevent 
recurrence, and robust emergency preparedness and response plans are in place to efficiently handle any unforeseen 
incidents. Through these efforts, the company is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
The Company operates multiple project sites and has adopted 
a proactive approach to operational continuity and 
risk mitigation. To ensure that isolated incidents do not disrupt overall project timelines, adequate buffer periods are 
incorporated into project planning. Operational procedures are periodically reviewed and revised, where feasible, to 
prevent the replication of issues across locations. 
In the event of a disaster or force majeure situation, the Company 
leverages its geographically distributed sites to ensure continuity of operations. Employees are made aware of these 
contingency protocols, enabling them to coordinate effectively with management and support the swift restoration of 
critical processes, thereby minimizing disruptions to business operations. The leadership team ensures timely interventions 
and gives strategic insights at any such instances of urgency. Furthermore, we are currently under the process of 
implementing a formal business continuity and disaster management plan.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community. 
The Company has put in place an effective and structured mechanism for receiving and addressing grievances from the 
community, primarily facilitated through its CSR implementation partners. These partners operate on the ground and 
maintain direct engagement with local communities, enabling them to act as the first point of contact for identifying 
and resolving issues related to CSR initiatives or other community impacts. Their proximity to and familiarity with the 
community allow for timely recognition of concerns, which are then assessed and addressed in coordination with the 
Companys social responsibility objectives. 
If a grievance raised at the implementation level requires additional support or decision-making, 
it is escalated to the 
Company for further investigation and resolution. This tiered approach ensures that all concerns are addressed 
in 
a 
responsive, transparent, and accountable manner. Moreover, to enhance accessibility and trust, the Company also allows 
community members to directly reach out through written communication, including letters and emails, for submitting 
any grievances or feedback. This integrated mechanism reflects the Company's commitment to inclusive stakeholder 
engagement and its broader goal of fostering long-term, positive community relationships.
