(Indicate Positive or

1
Serving the Bottom 
of the Pyramid at 
affordable price
Opportunity
The cornerstone of our business 
model 
differentiation 
has 
been 
taking medicines closer to the end 
Consumers who are underserved. 
This approach has led to the 
sustained growth of revenues and 
bottom line while also ensuring that 
the ‘bottom of the pyramid’ is served 
well with affordable medicines. 
As we expand into more geographies, 
achieving the same degree of 
closeness to end Consumers that 
we were able to achieve in our 
present markets will present a 
significant opportunity for sustained 
business growth while also ensuring 
that our core value remains intact - 
addressing the needs of the bottom 
of the pyramid in newer markets. 
--
Positive.
Reaching the end Consumers 
who are at the bottom of the 
pyramid in newer markets and 
offering quality medicines at 
affordable price will ensure 
the continuation of the robust 
business growth and, thereby, 
the 
financial 
performance 
that we were able to achieve 
so far. 
2
Promoting Diversity Opportunity
Promoting 
a 
diverse 
workforce 
enhances organizational resilience 
while creating an atmosphere of 
fairness towards underrepresented 
sections of the society. Towards this, 
the Company had recognized the 
importance of ensuring significant 
representation to women in the 
workforce and ensuring that they 
are upskilled and properly equipped 
in performing various roles in our 
manufacturing units. Also, since 
majority of these women are from 
the local area of operations, they 
constitute a pool of committed human 
resource.
--
Positive.
Reduced attrition due to 
creation 
of 
a 
committed 
and well-equipped women 
workforce from the local area 
of operations will optimize 
recruitment costs and avoid 
frequent need for training due 
to higher employee turnover. 
Also, promoting organizational 
resilience will enable the 
Company 
to 
successfully 
navigate adverse events or 
circumstances.

The growing footprint of the group in

Andhra 
Pradesh 
and 
Puducherry presents a significant 
opportunity to engage with the local 
stakeholders and ensure that their 
voices are heard and their concerns 
are incorporated into the Company’s 
strategic planning. 
Some of the projects that involve 
‘red category’ operations under 
the environmental norms requires 
incorporating environmental best 
practices as well as ensuring 
that the Company treats the local 
community and other stakeholders 
fairly. Acceptance of the local 
community enables creation of 
shared value by fostering equity, 
health, education and sustainability.

Risk of Non 
Compliance 
with Regulatory 
requirements
Risk
With the expanding presence of 
our business, the responsibility 
to ensure compliance with the 
applicable laws, that are both 
specific 
to 
the 
Pharmaceutical 
sector as well as the general laws 
applicable to any business, assumes 
utmost significance. 
The 
Company 
implements 
measures to both adapt and 
mitigate risks arising due to 
evolving Compliance requirements.

Non-compliance may have 
detrimental 
effects, 
such 
as financial loss and loss of

(Indicate Positive or

Newer 
requirements 
of 
the 
geographies where we are venturing 
combined with the various local 
statutory requirements presents a 
key risk where any deviance results 
in significant penalties as well as 
reputation loss for the Company.
Adapting is done by evaluating 
the specific actions to be taken 
by the Company to comply with 
the 
requirements 
including 
change in business processes, 
upgrading/ modifying operating 
procedures to meet compliance 
requirements 
and 
evaluating 
Compliance risks as part of 
the Risk Management process 
of 
the 
Company. 
Mitigating 
involves a strategy of identifying 
all 
applicable 
Acts, 
utilising 
technology for managing and 
reporting compliances, obtaining 
assurance of compliance through 
internal sources like internal 
compliance audits/ verifications 
and external sources like Internal 
Audit verifications, drawing down 
an action plan for remedying 
non- compliances and escalating 
significant instances of non- 
compliances to appropriate levels 
for remedial action.

5
Risk of 
engagement 
with value chain 
partners who do 
not share the vision 
of sustainable 
development and 
environmental 
goals
Risk
Due to the nature of business, 
Company needs to engage with 
diverse range of value chain 
partners. To ensure that those who 
form the part of the value chain 
are in line with the manufacturing 
standards, 
environmental 
goals 
and sustainability objectives of the 
Company is a complex task. But, 
the risk of deviation in any part of 
the value chain will have significant 
impact on both the sustainability 
and business performance of the 
Company.
The Company follows a strategy 
of contractually enforcing key 
sustainability 
goals 
through 
its sourcing contracts with the 
value chain partners and also by 
way of reference to the code of 
business ethics in the purchase 
orders issued to vendors. The 
Company is also subject to 
similar covenants in contracts 
with its Customers in regulated 
markets which specify explicit 
measures to be taken to comply 
with the environmental goals 
and 
sustainability 
objectives. 
These covenants are tracked for 
performance to avoid breach.
Negative.
Risk of violation by value 
chain partners will have both 
sustainability and business 
impact. Breach of contractual 
terms with customers may 
lead to claims.
6
Renewable Energy
Opportunity
Renewable energy usage results 
in 
meeting 
the 
sustainability 
objectives of the Company by 
reducing the Company’s carbon 
foot print. It also results in tangible 
financial benefit like cost saving.
--
Positive.
Reduction in overall indirect 
emissions and energy cost.
7
Preventing 
counterfeit 
medicines
Risk
The growing mix of branded generics 
and other products that bear the 
registered trademarks of Caplin 
combined with the geographical 
expansion of our business presents 
a significant risk of proliferation 
of counterfeit products. This not 
only erodes the brand value of 
the products but also presents a 
significant public health risk. 
The Company is actively pursuing 
a 
multi-pronged 
strategy 
of 
registering the key trademarks in 
the respective countries where 
there are plans to expand the 
business, combined with active 
market surveillance and taking 
stringent legal measures wherever 
counterfeiting is identified. 
Negative
Counterfeiting erodes brand 
credibility 
and 
presents 
a 
significant 
downside 
in 
business growth. Also, the 
mitigating measures involve 
significant financial expenditure 
in the form of enforcement and 
legal expenses.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements:
During the year under review, Caplin Group has taken substantial steps to make its operations environmental friendly and to ensure that the 
society at large is positively impacted by its operations. The new unit of COL that was operationalized at the end of 2023-24 had completed its first 
full year of operations and measures like Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) implemented at the facility had seen its full utility. Also, the new projects that 
are ongoing are envisaged in a way that are least intrusive to the environment while adhering to all environmental standards. 
On contributing to the society, the most important initiative of Caplin Group in the form of setting up state-of-the-art Hospital-cum-diagnostic center 
in Gummidipoondi, Chennai (near the CSL unit) under CSR initiative almost reached fruition with operation of the Hospital commencing after 
the end of FY 2025. This Hospital will serve as hallmark of free/affordable healthcare in the region and is expected to cater to the bottom of the 
pyramid, as has been the case with the Group’s business operations as well. 
As a proof that Caplin’s ESG initiatives are not just about ensuring compliance but also about incorporating sustainability in decision making 
process and strategy, the upcoming projects of the Group, which are elaborated in detail elsewhere in the report, will have inbuilt mechanisms 
to ensure zero liquid discharge, best in class energy efficient equipments and machineries and adequate green cover. Regarding our value 
chain, though we continue to extend the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, Whistle Blower mechanism etc. to value chain partners through 
contractual clauses, it has been a challenge to verify implementation, which we plan to address by gradually integrating key value chain partners 
into the ESG reporting framework of Caplin Group.

b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
The Company has a process of contractual enforcement of sustainability principles with key vendors so that the inputs sourced by the Company 
are manufactured by those key vendors adhering to sustainability principles which includes the following:
	 Compliance with all Statutory norms labour, health, safety, environment and ethical standards
	 Zero tolerance towards corruption, fraud, bribery and other unethical conduct
	 Prohibition of Child Labour and protection of human rights
	 Equal opportunities and no discrimination on the basis of gender, race, age, caste etc
	 Protection of environment.
	 Safe and healthy workplace
 The Company uses recyclable packaging materials for all finished products intended for export. This includes the use of paper-based 
cardboard for secondary packaging and recyclable materials such as aluminum blisters and PET bottles for primary packaging. This reduces 
the environmental footprint of the Company’s exported products and aligns with its commitment to sustainable packaging.
3.	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including 
packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
Since exports account for the entire turnover of the Company and the exports are made specifically through the overseas subsidiaries which are 
not part of the BRSR reporting for the current year, specific measures cannot be provided for Plastics and Medical/ Hazardous Wastes generated 
as a result of such exports. However, the following details are available with respect to plastic waste/ e-waste/ hazardous and other wastes that 
are generated and disposed within India:
	
Hazardous waste is disposed of through authorized disposal facilities under long term agreements.
 
E-waste is given for recycling through authorised e-waste Recyclers. Since the quantity of E-waste is not significant, instead of long-term 
agreements, the same is disposed off using authorised vendors on case-to-case basis.
	
Bio-medical waste, which is a critical component of the waste generated, is disposed through authorised recyclers under long term agreements.
	
Plastic Wastes are being disposed under arrangements through recyclers who also handle hazardous and other wastes.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in 
line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
Yes. Since the Company’s significant source of plastic waste generation is through export of products, EPR is not applicable for those wastes. 
However, as an importer of goods/ materials that contain plastic components/ wrapped in plastic materials and also for the negligible quantity of 
plastic wastes that is disposed locally, the Company has obtained EPR registration under the new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment 
on Extended Producer Responsibility for Plastic Waste. COL, which has commenced operations at the end of the year 2023-24 is in the process of 
obtaining EPR Registration as on 31st March, 2025.

5.	 Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
Yes, the new unit of COL has implemented a robust Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system with a capacity of 125 KLD to ensure complete recycling and 
reuse of wastewater within the facility. The effluent generated from various processes is first treated in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), and the 
treated water is used as feed for three-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) units. The permeate from RO-1 is reused in the cooling towers, while its reject is 
passed to RO-2, and RO-2 reject is further treated in RO-3. The final reject from RO-3 is sent to a forced evaporator, where water is evaporated and 
recovered, and the resulting salt is collected and sent to an authorized hazardous waste vendor. This salt is then converted into alternative fuel for 
use in cement plants. Additionally, the sludge from the primary settling tank is sun-dried and also sent to the same authorized vendor for conversion 
into alternative fuel. Meanwhile, the sludge from the secondary settling tank is utilized as bio-manure for gardening within the premises. Through 
this integrated and closed-loop approach, COL ensures zero discharge to the environment and supports sustainable waste and water management.
Similarly, the project under construction in Thervoy Kandigai by COL incorporates full implementation of ZLD mechanism.
In the other units currently under operation, the Company’s water management and treatment practices are meticulously organized across its 
various units, each employing tailored strategies to ensure efficient treatment and reuse of water, thus minimizing environmental impact and 
supporting sustainability goals.
Amaris (CRO)
Source and Collection: Trade effluent from the bio-analytical laboratory is collected in a designated solvent waste storage area. This area is routinely 
inspected to ensure safety and compliance.
Primary Treatment: Involves the removal of suspended solids and organic matter, followed by chemical treatment where lime is used for pH control. 
Chemical coagulants (Alum) and flocculants (polyelectrolytes) are added to facilitate the aggregation and settling of fine particles.
Secondary Treatment: The treated effluent undergoes solar evaporation using concrete solar beds, effectively reducing liquid waste through natural 
processes.
CPL R&D (Ticel Bio-Park)
A centralized treatment plant is operated by TICEL Bio Park to serve the entire building.
