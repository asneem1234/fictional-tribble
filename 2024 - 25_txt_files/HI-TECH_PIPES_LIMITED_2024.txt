Critical in the successful 
running of the 
Company
The Company is dedicated to 
performing business operations 
in accordance with the highest 
standards of ethical, moral, and 
legal conduct. To uphold these 
standards, the company has 
formalized the "Code of Conduct" 
for directors and employees. This 
code delineates the principles 
and standards that govern the 
conduct of employees in the 
course of the company's business 
activities. It encompasses all 
interactions with vendors, 
customers, and other business 
partners.
The Company contributes to the 
global environment by adhering 
to ISO Certification standards, 
specifically ISO 9001: 2015, ISO 
9001, ISO 45001, and ISO 14001, 
within the framework of the 
Integrated Management System 
across all Company processes.
Positive: 
Compliance with 
applicable regulatory 
requirements 
demonstrates the 
Company’s dedication 
to responsible business 
practices.
Negative: Failure to 
comply with regulatory 
requirements could 
adversely influence the 
Company’s reputation 
and jeopardize its long-
term business continuity
2.
Energy
Efficiency of 
operations
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Climate change and 
environmental risks 
have acknowledged 
energy management as 
a vital material concern. 
The threats posed 
by climate change 
and environmental 
issues are discussed 
to emphasize the 
Company's ecological 
consciousness and its 
dedication to climate 
change mitigation 
strategies.
Opportunity: The 
comprehensive 
resource management 
plans, aligned with 
the company's 
environmental strategy, 
will highlight the 
company's dedication 
to environmental 
preservation and its role 
in supporting climate 
change mitigation 
efforts.
The Company concentrates 
on four fundamental domains 
associated with climate 
change: waste minimization, 
renewable energy utilization, 
water conservation, and energy 
efficiency.
Positive Implications:
The company's focus 
on enhancing climate 
change and ESG-specific 
initiatives strengthens 
long-term value creation 
and allows the company 
to effectively meet the 
increasing expectations 
of stakeholders.

3.
Human Rights
Practices
Opportunity
The company's social 
performance, as 
perceived by employees 
and the community, will 
decline in the absence 
of a comprehensive 
Human Rights 
governance framework. 
This framework should 
encompass working 
conditions, child and 
forced labour, equitable 
remuneration, gender 
diversity, sexual 
harassment prevention, 
freedom of association, 
and collective 
bargaining.
The Company affirms the 
human rights of all stakeholders, 
including communities, 
consumers, and marginalized 
groups, both inside and outside 
the workplace. These rights are 
recognized and upheld across 
the Company's operations and 
policies, including dealings 
with vendors, to protect our 
workers' human rights—such 
as their freedom of association, 
non-discrimination, and the 
prohibition of child and forced 
labor—as well as their right to 
collective bargaining. 
It incorporates a comprehensive 
human rights governance 
framework that encompasses the 
freedom of association, human 
rights, and due diligence across all 
business operations, particularly 
concerning suppliers and vendors.
Positive: 
The company's social 
performance is enhanced 
through its meticulous 
alignment with both 
national and international 
human rights standards, 
demonstrating its 
commitment to the 
integration of human 
rights into its corporate 
strategy.
Negative: 
The absence of a human 
rights governance 
framework may 
lead to employee 
dissatisfaction, thereby 
adversely affecting 
workforce productivity 
and the organization’s 
strategic growth 
objectives. Additionally, 
the deficiency of a 
comprehensive redressal 
mechanism could give 
rise to non-compliance 
issues from a regulatory 
standpoint.
4.
Board 
Diversity and 
Independence
Opportunity
Opportunity: 
The Company 
recognizes and values 
the significance of a 
diverse Board in its 
success. We contend 
that a truly diverse 
board will assist us 
in sustaining our 
competitive edge by 
leveraging diversity in 
thought, perspective, 
knowledge, ability, 
industry expertise, age, 
ethnicity, and gender.
Ensure a transparent nomination 
process for directors with diverse 
perspectives, experiences, 
expertise, skills, and a record of 
performance excellence.
Positive:
Consistent efforts 
would lead to a positive 
impact due to improved 
productivity, etc.
5.
Water and
Effluent
Management
Water availability may 
become a concern. As a 
responsible company, it 
is essential to map and 
effectively manage the 
water utilized across its 
operations, ensuring 
that consumption 
is socially equitable 
and environmentally 
sustainable.
The Company has implemented 
advanced technologies 
to decrease freshwater 
consumption, enhance 
recyclability, and minimize 
external discharges.
Dependence on 
freshwater resources, the 
lack of recyclability, and 
excessive discharges may 
influence future resource 
availability and adversely 
affect the environment.

At the core of this system is the Central Grievance Mechanism, which is tasked with receiving, managing,

The Company has implemented a Grievance Mechanism enabling all employees to formally raise concerns 
related to violations of any legal statutes, including human rights and internal corporate policies. Each 
grievance is subject to a thorough and appropriate investigation. Upon concluding the investigation, if 
it is determined that a violation has taken place, corrective measures proportional to the severity of the 
violation are enacted.

DOES THE ENTITY HAVE A BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT PLAN? GIVE DETAILS

At Hi-tech, our commitment to safety goes beyond just theory. We have thoroughly developed onsite 
Emergency Plans that strictly follow the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 
guidelines. These plans are not just static documents but are active, practical strategies designed to protect 
lives, property, and our dedication to responsible operations.
	
Our onsite Emergency Plans act as living guides, outlining precise procedures to follow during unforeseen 
incidents. Based on the OHSAS framework, these plans carefully define protocols for various emergencies, 
including fires and natural disasters. These guidelines are not only regulatory requirements but also our 
deep promise to our employees, community, and the environment.
	
The success of a plan depends on its execution. To stay prepared, we regularly conduct mock drills that 
imitate real emergency situations. These exercises involve key participants such as Incident Controllers, 
Site Controllers, Firefighters, and District Authorities like the District Collector, Police, Fire Brigade, and 
Medical Officers. Our mock drills demonstrate our commitment, showing our dedication to the safety of 
our team, the integrity of our operations, and environmental protection. In line with OHSAS standards, we 
uphold the highest occupational health and safety standards, fostering a culture of readiness, resilience, 
and responsible practices.
