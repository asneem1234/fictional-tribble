Employee 
Retention
Risk
Our need for highly skilled and 
technical employees makes 
recruitment and retention 
challenging. The competitive 
market for such talent increases 
the risk of turnover. To address 
this, we continuously upgrade 
employee skills and strive to 
retain our workforce through 
targeted development programs.
We offer competitive 
compensation packages, 
and foster a supportive 
work environment that 
values career growth and 
employee engagement.

industry, innovation in design 
and development is crucial for 
maintaining a competitive edge. 
Our company’s commitment 
to cutting-edge R&D presents 
a significant opportunity to 
lead the market with advanced 
technologies and solutions. 
By leveraging our expertise in 
design and development, we can

Data Privacy 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk
Handling sensitive data related 
to RF/microwave technologies, 
digital electronics, and 
associated software poses 
significant data privacy and 
cyber security risks. Breaches 
could compromise classified 
information, impact national 
security, and lead to substantial 
financial and reputational 
damage. Despite robust security 
measures, the evolving cyber 
threat landscape requires 
ongoing vigilance and adaptation 
to safeguard our systems and 
data.
We enhance data privacy 
and cyber security by 
deploying advanced security 
measures, conducting 
regular assessments, and 
updating protocols to 
counter emerging threats. 
Ongoing staff training and 
adherence to industry 
standards further safeguard 
our systems and data.
