Governance, leadership, and oversight
7.   Statement by Director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets, 
and achievements:
	
The Company firmly believes that long-term business success is fundamentally linked with social responsibility, 
environmental stewardship, and strong governance. In a year marked by global uncertainties, ranging from inflationary 
pressures to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions, the Organization remained resilient and committed to the 
ESG vision.
	
As responsible corporate citizens, the Company will continue to invest in the future through focused efforts in education, 
youth empowerment and community development. The company also recognizes that strength lies in continuously 
adapting to market dynamics through innovation, advanced technologies and the dedication of our people.
	
The Company’s Board of Directors actively oversees ESG-related risks and opportunities through dedicated Committees 
that guide strategy, performance, and compliance. The Company has established a robust ESG governance structure 
to ensure accountability and strategic alignment and takes pride in having earned recognition such as the EcoVadis 
‘Committed’ badge, and in our pursuit of certifications like ISO 45001 and ISO 27001, which reflect our dedication to 
occupational safety and information security.
	
Environmental sustainability is a key pillar of our operations. Through initiatives like rooftop solar installations, fuel 
conversion to cleaner energy, adoption of electric forklifts, and tree plantation drives, the Company is making tangible 
progress towards reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing biodiversity. On the social front, the Organization is 
expanding support for under-represented groups, increasing womens' participation in the workforce, and delivering high-
impact CSR projects in healthcare, education and rural upliftment.
	
Looking ahead, the Company remains committed to conducting 100% ESG due diligence of the critical suppliers by 
FY 30, achieving a significant share of procurement from MSMEs by FY 28 and maintaining zero fatalities across its 
operations every year. The Company has also engaged third-party assurance providers to validate the GHG emissions, 
reinforcing the credibility of our sustainability reporting.
	
Moving forward, focus will remain on making meaningful progress, fostering inclusive growth and creating long-term 
value for all the Stakeholders.
