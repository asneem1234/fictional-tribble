Corporate Overview
15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks/
concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions. 
	
In response to safety-related incidents or concerns, our organization takes prompt and decisive corrective actions to address 
the root cause and prevent recurrence. Here are details of our approach to addressing such situations:
Whenever a safety-related incident occurs, 
our first priority is to ensure the well-
being of those involved and to mitigate 
any immediate risks. This may involve 
providing medical attention, securing the 
area, and conducting initial investigations 
to understand the circumstances leading to 
the incident.
Immediate Response:
Based on the findings of the root cause 
analysis, 
we 
develop 
and 
implement 
corrective actions to address the identified 
issues effectively. These actions may include 
revising procedures, enhancing training 
programs, repairing or replacing equipment, 
or making physical modifications to the 
work environment.
Corrective Actions
Following any safety incident, we 
conduct thorough root cause analysis 
to identify the underlying factors 
contributing to the event. This analysis 
involves 
examining 
human 
factors, 
equipment failure, procedural lapses, or 
environmental conditions that may have 
played a role.
Root Cause Analysis
We ensure that all employees are 
informed about the incident and any 
corrective actions taken to prevent 
similar occurrences in the future. 
Additionally, targeted training programs 
may be conducted to reinforce safety 
protocols and best practices relevant to 
the incident.
