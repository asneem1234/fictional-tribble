(Indicate positive or

Financing 
properties that 
are either non-
compliant or 
situated in 
inappropriate 
locations, 
potentially 
resulting in 
serious 
environmental, 
social, health, 
and safety 
concerns.
 
Risk
Indicate 
whether 
risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Negative
Financing such 
properties can expose 
the company to legal 
liabilities and risks 
(e.g., demolitions, 
penalties, litigation), 
borrower distress, and 
higher default risk, 
thereby impacting 
asset quality and 
recovery prospects.
HomeFirst 
implements a robust 
property 
assessment 
framework that 
includes location-
speciﬁc 
environmental, 
health, and safety 
checks. These 
criteria are regularly 
accessed and 
communicated to 
internal teams and 
validated by 
independent valuers 
to ensure 
compliance and 
suitability. We also 
have a negative 
exclusion list under 
our ESG policy, 
debarring to fund 
any such properties 
which can cause 
damage either to 
the company's 
proﬁtability or to the 
society.
Properties located 
in environmentally 
or socially sensitive 
areas pose risks of 
legal non-
compliance, 
deteriorating living 
conditions, and in 
extreme cases, life-
threatening 
outcomes. This 
directly aﬀects both 
communities and 
the company's 
collateral quality, 
which can 
signiﬁcantly impact 
the recovery 
prospects in case of 
defaults.
2
Exposure of 
ﬁnanced 
properties to 
climate-related 
risks such as 
ﬂoods, 
droughts, or 
other extreme 
weather events.
 
Risk
Negative
Signiﬁcant property 
damage may aﬀect 
loan recovery value 
and lead to higher 
NPAs. Operational 
costs may also rise due 
to increased due 
diligence and 
compliance overhead.
Use of geo-tagging 
ensuring regional 
classiﬁcation during 
property appraisal. 
Avoidance or higher 
scrutiny in 
vulnerable zones. 
Insurance coverage 
encouraged for all 
properties.
Properties in high-
risk climate zones 
are more prone to 
damage or loss 
during natural 
disasters, aﬀecting 
their value and 
recoverability in 
case of default.

Risk & 
Opportunity
Indicate 
whether 
risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Positive and Negative
Opportunity: Strong 
digital practices helps 
us to maintain the best 
turnaround times and 
operational costs while 
boosting customer 
trust.
Risk: Lapses in data 
privacy and cyber 
security may lead to 
penalties, reputational 
loss, and litigation.
Implementation of 
secure, cloud-based 
loan origination and 
servicing systems. 
Regular audits and 
training for 
employees on data 
protection practices. 
Adoption of focused 
data privacy policy 
and appropriate 
cybersecurity 
standards.
With growing digital 
dependence, data 
breaches or system 
failures could erode 
customer trust and 
attract regulatory 
penalties. However, 
robust systems 
improve customer 
experience and 
operational 
eﬃciency.

Access to 
aﬀordable 
housing ﬁnance 
in informal 
income 
segments with 
limited 
documentation, 
increasing 
ﬁnancial 
inclusion
 
Risk & 
Opportunity
Positive and Negative
Opportunity: 
Expanding credit 
access enhances social 
equity and widens 
HomeFirst's customer 
base in underserved 
emerging geographies.
Risk: Inadequate 
assessment due to 
documentation gaps 
can lead to higher 
delinquencies, 
increasing provisioning 
costs and impacting 
proﬁtability.
HomeFirst has built 
a proprietary tech-
led underwriting 
model that 
integrates ﬁeld-level 
inputs, alternate 
data sources, and 
analytics to evaluate 
borrowers without 
formal 
documentation.
The company 
continuously trains 
its credit teams and 
reﬁnes its 
scorecards to 
reduce subjectivity.
Independent quality 
checks and early 
warning systems are 
in place to identify 
and contain 
portfolio-level risks.
India's large 
underserved 
population lacks 
access to formal 
housing ﬁnance due 
to irregular income 
proﬁles and limited 
credit history.
While this presents 
a signiﬁcant 
business 
opportunity for 
aﬀordable housing 
ﬁnanciers like 
HomeFirst, it also 
poses a credit risk 
due to potential mis 
judgment of 
repayment capacity.
Reliance on 
informal income 
assessment 
increases exposure 
to default risk if 
underwriting is not 
robust.

We are a technologically driven aﬀordable housing ﬁnance company. Our processes are largely digital. 
The expenses incurred on technology and software licenses, helps us create a system which is equipped 
to process a loan with quick turnaround time. We believe these expenses are an investment to stay 
relevant, competitive and eﬃcient in today's digital world. The technology expenses help us to improve 
customer experiences, manage, and analyze large amounts of data. 
2.
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) If yes, what 
    
percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
 
 As a housing ﬁnance company focused on lending, our primary inputs revolve around ﬁnancial 
resources and talent. Given the nature of our business, which predominantly deals with ﬁnancial 
instruments rather than tangible raw materials, the concept of sustainable sourcing, typically 
associated with physical goods, is not directly applicable to our operations. 
 
 Digitization across the Value Chain
 
 Through extensive digitization across the value chain, we have signiﬁcantly minimized the reliance 
on paper-based processes traditionally involved in underwriting and loan servicing. Our Connector 
App enables our connectors to submit leads digitally through a user-friendly interface. The RM Pro 
App allows relationship managers to update customer proﬁles, log visit histories, and track 
collections seamlessly. Our loan origination and management systems operate on a centralized 
digital platform, enabling underwriters to review and approve loan ﬁles without the need for 
physical documentation. Additionally, our loan agreements are executed digitally. Customers are 
also empowered through our mobile app to raise service requests, view loan details, and manage 
repayments conveniently—ensuring transparency, eﬃciency, and reduced environmental 
footprint.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and

 The company is in the business of providing housing loans. Hence, the scope for using recycled 
materials as inputs is limited. Further, we have a tie-up with e-waste handler for disposal of 
electronic waste.
