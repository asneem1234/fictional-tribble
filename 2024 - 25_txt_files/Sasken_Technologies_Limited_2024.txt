enterprise mindset to create impact, not just code.
As we reflected on this legacy and looked ahead, it 
became evident that our next phase of growth required 
sharper focus and scaled ambition. This thinking gave 
rise to our 60x4x3 strategy, a bold, enterprise-wide 
mission to:
Focus and grow at least 60 of our
Marquee customers 
Grow and sustain them to at least $4 Mn each 
and if the potential is larger, then work on 
growing them into even larger accounts
In 3-year timeframe - by FY '27
5
As an Organization, the mission 60x4x3 is the north 
star that has aligned every function and every level of 
the Organization. It has helped us sharpen our focus, 
challenge our limits, and energize our teams with 
clarity of purpose.
Over the past five quarters, we have delivered 
consistent revenue growth, closing FY 2025 with 
₹550.91 crores in consolidated revenues, a 35.6% YoY 
increase. Quarter after quarter, this growth trajectory 
has reaffirmed the choices we’ve made and the 
direction we’ve taken. More importantly, we now see 
17+ of our customers contribute $1 million+ in revenue. 
During the last year, we have seen a steady increase in

and adaptability, the gradual return to our physical 
offices has re-energized our teams. More than a 
logistical shift, this return has reignited informal 
collaboration, strengthened interpersonal 
connections, and reinforced the collective spirit that 
defines Sasken.
A standout marker of this cultural alignment has been 
the lowest quarter-on-quarter attrition of ~8%, in our 
history. This is a direct reflection of the engagement, 
belonging and the trust our employees experience. It is 
also a validation of our ongoing investments in 
employee development, recognition, and well-being.
We firmly believe that our ability to deliver impact for 
customers, partners, and stakeholders is driven by the 
commitment, creativity, and capabilities of our people. 
In FY 2025, we expanded our focus on:
• 
Leadership and learning programs, including 
mentoring initiatives and upskilling efforts
• 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), guided by a 
formal charter and championed across functions
• 
Holistic well-being, from mental health to work-life 
integration
These initiatives are not standalone programs but an 
integral part of our growth strategy, enabling us to 
scale sustainably while staying grounded in purpose 
and people-first values. As we look to FY26 and 
beyond, we remain committed to building a culture 
where every Sasian can thrive, lead, and contribute 
meaningfully. Truly a workplace is defined not only by 
performance, but by purpose.
A THRIVING WORKFORCE
In FY 2025, our workforce grew to 1,894 professionals 
across geographies. Our diverse team brings together a 
wide array of experiences and expertise that fuel our 
culture of innovation. 
We onboarded 634 new employees and welcomed 90 
freshers, reaffirming our commitment to building the 
next generation of talent. Our merger with Anup Silicon 
further expanded our talent pool and capabilities.
Our employer rating on Glassdoor improved from 3.6 
to 3.9 and on AmbitionBox from 3.4 to 3.8, reflecting 
the positive impact of initiatives focused on 
transparency, employee engagement, and leadership 
accessibility. Programs like biannual HR one-on-one 
connects, team outings, and consistent engagement at 
customer locations have further strengthened our 
retention efforts.

INVESTING IN GROWTH AND

At Sasken, continuous learning is integral to building a 
future-ready workforce and delivering on our growth 
strategy. In FY 2025, we deepened our focus on 
upskilling, leadership development, and technical 
readiness across roles and functions.
We launched KenGuide, a structured mentoring 
initiative that fosters personalized career development 
and cross-functional knowledge exchange. KenMap, 
our enterprise-wide learning framework, helped 
identify skill gaps and deliver targeted training for 
engineers in the Growth Pool.
Our Sasken Delivery Management Course (SDMC) 
equipped Program Managers with the tools to lead 
complex, multi-stakeholder projects. We also expanded 
our Technical Competency Building (TCB) 
framework—introducing Data Science certification for 
campus hires and extending coverage to Product 
Security, reinforcing our future-readiness.
Learning interventions were tailored for business units 
and extended to customer locations to ensure 
inclusiveness. Our Shift-Left strategy introduced early 
training for final-semester students, enabling faster 
project integration post-joining.
Our KenMap framework was recognized with the 
HRedge Award for Best Skill Transformation Initiative, 
affirming our commitment to creating a culture of 
learning, performance, and continuous growth.
CHAMPIONING DIVERSITY, EQUITY, 
AND INCLUSION
Diversity is core to our identity. Women represent 27% 
of our workforce, a reflection of our continuous focus 
on inclusion. We launched Kenspire, our DEI platform 
designed to drive awareness, mentorship, and 
policy-led change. A newly constituted Women’s 
Committee provides advocacy, leadership support,   
and community engagement. We also rolled out a 
three-year strategic roadmap to advance women at    
all levels.
Progressive policies, including flexible work models, 
parental support, and tailored development programs, 
continue to foster inclusion across underrepresented 
groups. 
These initiatives are now embedded in our talent 
practices and business operations.
A CULTURE OF WELL-BEING AND 
RECOGNITION
Employee well-being remains a strategic priority. 
Through the KenPal initiative, we hosted over 100 
wellness programs addressing physical, mental, and 
financial health. Recognition programs such as 
Achiever of the Quarter, Spot Awards, and Virtual 
Marbles celebrated over 600 employee achievements 
each quarter, reinforcing our culture of appreciation.
Our people-first culture was recognized externally with 
Great Place to Work® certification, while 69 leaders 
earned GMI certification, contributing to a robust 
leadership pipeline. Accolades such as INfHRA’s 
Corporate Excellence Award and Ecovadis Bronze 
Certification reaffirm our progress in HR and 
sustainability practices.
FUTURE OF WORK: EMBRACING 
INNOVATION
As the workplace evolves, we continue to adapt by 
leveraging AI, automation, and data-driven insights to 
redefine collaboration, enhance flexibility, and increase 
productivity. Our evolving policies support this 
transition, ensuring teams remain connected, engaged, 
and future ready.
As we move into FY26, our commitment remains 
steadfast: to foster a workplace where every Sasian is 
empowered to lead, grow, and contribute meaningfully 
to our collective success. Together, we are building a 
more inclusive, agile, and forward-looking 
organization.

A.	
Energy Conservation - Environmental Management System
	
We are dedicated to responsible energy use and sustainable resource management. By prioritizing conservation, efficiency, and 
cutting-edge innovation, we strive to minimize our environmental footprint while upholding the highest standards of operational 
excellence.
	
78% of our electricity consumption across all India facilities is offset through direct procurement of renewable energy from wind 
/ solar sources. The remaining 22% is balanced through investments in International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs), 
aligning with global sustainability standards. Additionally, our facilities in Chennai and Pune started operating from Green 
Building Council certified premises, reinforcing our commitment to eco-friendly operations.
	
Through these strategic efforts, Sasken continues to lead in sustainable energy management, reducing our carbon footprint and 
contributing to a cleaner and greener future.
B.	
Research & Development
	
We continue our well-defined focus on product engineering and digital services with a recent foray into custom silicon and 
foundry services. Our sectoral focus remains in semiconductors, automotive, industrials, communication networks & devices, 
satellite communications, and transportation sectors. With a technology-first approach embedded in our DNA, we aim to serve 
the entire spectrum from Chip to Cognition.
	
As in previous years, our investments continue to focus on key areas such as Generative AI, 5G, 5G-Advanced, Non-Terrestrial 
Networks, Automotive (including Software Defined Vehicles, Connected Vehicles, Integrated Cockpit, and Electric Vehicles), 
IoT, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. Digital technologies are at the core of every 
aspect of modern life, further solidifying their central role in driving the tech evolution. Your Company is positioned at the 
forefront of this digital revolution, with a robust suite of digital services designed to meet the needs of both existing and new 
customers. Notably, we have embarked on new engagements with next-generation automotive Tier-1 suppliers and global 
OEMs, delivering innovative connected car services, scalable data platforms, cybersecurity consulting, DevSecOps, MLOps, and 
predictive analytics solutions.
C.	
Technology Absorption
	
Our approach to continuous learning is rooted in the belief that innovation thrives when individuals are empowered with the 
right skills. This year, we introduced targeted learning programs tailored to diverse roles from engineers and program managers 
to new campus hires, ensuring relevance and impact at every level. Kenguide, our flagship mentoring initiative, fostered a culture 
of personalized growth and cross-functional knowledge exchange.
	
Through a structured application of KenMap, we identified critical skill gaps and delivered focused training for engineers in 
the growth pool. Initiatives like the Sasken Delivery Management Course (SDMC) equipped managers with tools to navigate 
complex program landscapes. Our TCB framework was expanded to new domains including Data Science and Product Security, 
reinforcing our future-readiness.
	
Our Shift-Left initiative redefined early engagement with final-semester students through pre-onboarding learning, enabling 
smoother integration and accelerated productivity. These efforts culminated in industry recognition, with the HRedge Award for 
Best Skill Transformation Initiative, underscoring our commitment to nurturing a skilled, agile, and future-ready workforce.

Non-resident shareholders are requested to notify at the earliest:
 
• 
Change in their residential status on return to India for permanent settlement;
 
• 
Particulars of their NRE Bank Account with a bank in India, if not furnished earlier;
 
• 
E-mail address, if any, to the Company / RTA.
b)	
In case of loss / misplacement of share certificates, shareholders should immediately lodge an FIR / Complaint with the police 
and inform the Company / RTA along with a copy of FIR / acknowledged copy of complaint seeking the formalities to be complied 
with for issuance of duplicate share certificate.
c)	
Shareholder(s) of the Company who have multiple accounts in identical name(s) or holding more than one Share Certificate in 
the same name under different Ledger Folio(s) are requested to write to the Company for consolidation of such Folio(s) with the 
relevant share certificates. As this would facilitate ease of tracking of all corporate benefits on the shares and would reduce time 
and efforts required to monitor multiple folios / demat accounts.
d)	
Some of the shareholders have not yet exchanged their old share certificates for the new ones, necessitated on the consolidation 
of share capital processed by the Company in July 2004 (i.e., consolidation of two old shares of ` 5 each into one new share of ` 
10). Such shareholders are advised to send the old share certificates immediately to the Company so that new share certificates 
can be sent. Please contact us at investor@sasken.com  or cosec@sasken.com for any assistance required in this behalf or for 
dematerialization of shares. It is needless to mention that the old share certificate(s) cannot be submitted for dematerialization.
e)	
Shareholders are informed that by the operation of the Act, a notice may be sent through e-mail as a text or as an attachment 
to e-mail or as a notification providing electronic link or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for accessing such notice. All future 
communication of the Company to shareholders who have registered their e-mail IDs with their DPs or Company will be sent 
only by way of e-mail. Shareholders are requested to check their e-mails at regular intervals. Such communication will also be 
made available on the Company’s website www.sasken.com.
f)	
Shareholders are also informed that under the Act, the Company’s obligation shall be satisfied when it transmits the e-mail, and 
the Company shall not be held responsible for a failure in transmission beyond its control. If a shareholder entitled to receive 
notice fails to provide or update relevant e-mail address to the Company or to the DP as the case may be, the Company shall not 
be in default for not delivering notice via e-mail.
g)	
We solicit suggestions for improving our investor services.
h)	
Important Information
	
Shareholders may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (the IT Act) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend 
paid or distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of shareholders. The Company shall 
therefore be required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of dividend. To enable us to determine 
the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, shareholders are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below 
paragraphs, in accordance with the provisions of the IT Act.
	
For resident members, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows:
Shareholders having valid PAN and linked to their Folio
10%* or as notified by the Government of India (GoI)
Shareholders not having PAN / valid PAN or it is not linked to their Folio 20% or as notified by the GoI
	
* As per Section 139AA of the IT Act, every person who has been allotted a PAN and who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, shall be required 
to link the PAN with Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative and he 
shall be liable to all consequences under the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as prescribed under the IT Act. 
	
Please note that in case your PAN which was earlier linked with Aadhar gets delinked for any reason and at the time of payment 
of dividend, the status is not linked, then Company will deduct higher TDS. Further, in case PAN gets delinked with Aadhar after 
the payment of dividend, then in that case Company reserve the right to claim shortfall in TDS with interest from the shareholder.
	
However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to resident individual shareholders if the total dividend to be received 
by them during financial year 2025-26 does not exceed ` 10,000, and in cases where shareholders provide Form 15G / Form 15H 
(Form 15H is applicable to resident individual members aged 60 years or more) subject to conditions specified in the IT Act.
	
Resident shareholders may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / Nil withholding of 
tax. PAN is mandatory for shareholders providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above.

For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 and other 
applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20%** (plus applicable surcharge 
and cess) or as notified by the GoI on the amount of dividend payable. However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non-resident 
shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), read with 
Multilateral Instrument (MLI) between India and the country of tax residence of the members, if they are more beneficial to 
them. For this purpose, i.e., to avail the benefits under the DTAA read with MLI, non-resident shareholders should provide the 
following:
 
• 
Copy of the PAN card allotted by the Indian Income Tax authorities duly attested by the shareholder(s) or details as 
prescribed under Rule 37BC of the Income-tax Rules, 1962.
 
• 
Copy of the Tax Residency Certificate for financial year 2025-26 obtained from the revenue or tax authorities of the country 
of tax residence, duly attested by shareholder(s).
 
• 
Electronic Form 10F as per Notification No. 03/2022 dated July 16, 2022 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes

treaty.
 
• 
Self-declaration of beneficial ownership by the non-resident shareholder(s).

Category: Environment
1.
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
An 
IT 
company's 
environmental 
footprint includes energy consumption, 
waste generation, and carbon emissions. 
By 
implementing 
energy-efficient 
technologies, the company contributes 
to environmental conservation while 
demonstrating corporate responsibility. 
Prioritizing 
a 
low 
environmental 
footprint differentiates the company, 
attracting eco-conscious consumers and 
businesses, leading to increased brand 
loyalty and market share. At Sasken, this 
is seen as a strategic opportunity.
-
Positive:
We are committed to clean energy 
expansion 
and 
environmental 
responsibility by integrating wind, 
solar, and i-REC certificates to reduce 
our carbon footprint. This supports 
ESG goals, regulatory compliance, and 
global climate targets while enhancing 
stakeholder trust and sustainability 
ratings. As a result, our Scope 2 GHG 
emissions are significantly reduced.
2.
Effective and 
Sustainable 
practices
Opportunity
At Sasken, operations and work 
culture emphasize a transition to 
renewable energy and proactive waste 
management. By adopting solar and 
wind energy, Sasken has significantly 
reduced 
carbon 
emissions 
and 
dependence on fossil fuels, fostering a 
sustainable energy future. Additionally, 
proactive waste management, including 
recycling and responsible disposal, 
minimizes environmental impact and 
supports the circular economy.
-
Positive:
The financial impact is positive, as 
adopting 
renewable 
energy 
and 
proactive waste management lowers 
operational costs, ensures regulatory 
compliance, attracts eco-conscious 
customers, and enhances brand value 
driving long-term profitability and 
sustainability.

Employee 
engagement, 
reputation and 
retention
Opportunity 
and Risk
Opportunity:
• Sasken 
fosters 
a 
meaningful 
work culture by providing career 
development 
opportunities 
and 
a supportive environment. This 
cultivates a talented, experienced 
workforce, 
strengthening 
brand 
loyalty and customer trust.
Risk:
• Sasken 
prioritizes 
strategically 
navigating the impact of Work 
from Home (WFH) and Work 
from Office (WFO) cultures. A 
hybrid approach that balances 
their benefits while addressing 
challenges 
enhances 
employee 
retention and engagement. Ensuring 
a cohesive work culture requires 
addressing job role-based flexibility, 
open communication, and employee 
well-being.
Our approach includes:
• Skill trainings.
• Promoting 
a 
positive 
work 
environment, periodic meetings – 
small group, functional, business 
update meetings where the state of 
affairs of the business is explained.
• Rewards and recognition.
• Team and Individual achiever of the 
quarter award, etc.
All the efforts help to promote the desired 
objectives to be achieved.
Positive:
The financial implication is identified 
as positive because fostering employee 
engagement, diversity, and inclusion 
enhances 
productivity, 
reduces 
turnover costs, strengthens brand 
reputation, and attracts top talent. 
By 
effectively 
navigating 
hybrid 
work 
culture 
challenges, 
Sasken 
ensures employee satisfaction and 
retention, ultimately driving long-term 
organizational success and profitability.
Negative:
The financial implication is also 
identified as negative as poor employee 
engagement and retention can lead 
to 
high 
attrition 
costs, 
reduced 
productivity, and increased hiring 
expenses. A poorly managed work 
culture may lower morale, impact 
service quality, and create legal risks. 
Negative employer branding can also 
deter talent and affect stakeholder 
confidence, 
leading 
to 
financial 
setbacks.
4.
Community 
Development 
and Relations
Opportunity
Sasken demonstrates its commitment to 
social responsibility through impactful 
community development efforts. By 
investing in sustainable growth and 
fostering positive societal change, the 
Company strengthens its role as a 
responsible corporate citizen. Striving 
to be among India's top sustainable 
organizations, Sasken's initiatives focus 
on Social Responsibility, Environmental 
Sustainability, 
and 
Economic 
Sustainability.
Sasken 
prioritizes 
Community 
Development and Relations, aligning with 
7 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), covering 41%. Its CSR initiatives 
support healthcare, education, women's 
empowerment, the environment, and 
other social causes.
Positive:
The financial impact is positive, as 
Sasken’s commitment to community

Cyber 
Vulnerability 
and Threats
Opportunity 
and Risk
• Cybersecurity 
threats 
pose 
a 
significant risk to organizations 
due to their escalating frequency, 
sophistication, and potential impact.
• A successful cyber-attack can lead 
to the loss of sensitive data, financial 
repercussions, reputational damage, 
and legal consequences.
• As more organizations depend 
on digital technologies, the attack 
surface for cybercriminals expands, 
underscoring the importance of 
proactive measures to prevent, 
detect, and respond to cyber threats. 
Consequently, at Sasken, we have 
identified cybersecurity as a major 
risk and have prioritized initiatives 
to address and mitigate this threat.
• Implementing security policies and 
procedures that are enforced and 
regularly updated.
• Providing security awareness training 
to employees to educate them about 
cyber security best practices and how 
to identify and respond to security 
incidents.
• Deploying security technologies such 
as firewalls, intrusion detection and 
prevention systems, and antivirus / 
anti-malware software.
• Monitoring and logging all network 
activity to detect and respond to 
potential security incidents.
• Developing an incident response 
plan to ensure a timely and effective 
response to security incidents.
• Regularly reviewing and updating the 
cyber security program to ensure it 
remains effective and aligned with the 
organization's business objectives and 
changing threat landscape.
Positive:
The financial impact is positive, as 
proactive 
cybersecurity 
measures 
prevent costly data breaches, legal 
issues, and reputational damage. 
By investing in robust security systems 
and regular training, Sasken minimizes 
risks, ensures business continuity, 
and 
safeguards 
valuable 
assets, 
strengthening financial stability and 
long-term profitability.
Negative:
Cyber threats are evolving with AI-
driven attacks, ransomware, and zero-
day vulnerabilities. Despite strong 
internal security, third-party vendors 
and cloud providers pose indirect risks. 
Human errors, such as phishing, weak 
credentials, and data leaks, remain key 
concerns.
6.
Generative AI
Opportunity 
and Risk
Generative AI drives innovation by 
automating content creation, design, 
and coding, enabling new products and 
services. It boosts efficiency by handling 
repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus 
on creativity. AI also personalizes user 
experiences and reduces costs while 
maintaining quality through proper 
training. However, adoption challenges 
include the need for specialized skills 
and adaptation to existing workflows.
Adopting generative AI at Sasken is 
challenging due to the high demand 
for 
expertise 
in 
machine 
learning, 
deep 
learning, 
and 
NLP. 
Effective 
implementation requires a strong data 
science foundation, necessitating training 
or new talent acquisition. AI models 
also demand significant computational 
resources. 
Integration 
with 
existing 
workflows is complex, requiring cross-
team coordination and legacy system 
compatibility. 
Additionally, 
ethical 
concerns such as bias, privacy, and 
transparency must be carefully managed 
to ensure responsible AI deployment.
Positive:
Generative AI has positive financial 
implications, 
driving 
innovation, 
cost reduction, and efficiency by 
automating tasks. It enhances product 
development, 
personalization, 
and 
revenue opportunities while improving 
output quality. Despite initial adoption 
challenges, optimized operations and 
competitiveness can lead to significant 
long-term ROI.
Negative:
Generative 
AI 
poses 
financial 
and 
operational 
risks 
due 
to 
high 
recruitment, 
training, 
and 
implementation 
costs. 
Challenges 
include 
integration 
with 
legacy 
systems, computational demands, and 
ethical concerns like bias, data privacy, 
and transparency, which may lead to 
regulatory scrutiny and reputational 
risks.

Systemic Risk 
Management
Opportunity
Sasken can lead in risk mitigation 
by 
proactively 
managing 
risks, 
strengthening resilience, and building 
stakeholder 
trust. 
Geographical 
diversification and a broad product 
portfolio 
ensure 
revenue 
stability. 
The shift to green energy supports 
sustainability goals, lowers costs, and 
enhances investor appeal. Regulatory 
compliance further positions Sasken to 
benefit from growing demand for eco-
friendly practices.
-
Positive:
Sasken’s risk management drives cost 
savings, operational stability, and 
energy efficiency. Sustainable practices 
and regulatory compliance mitigate 
risks, enhance market position, and 
attract 
eco-conscious 
customers. 
These efforts reduce liabilities, create 
new revenue streams, and ensure long-
term financial growth.

and

“At Sasken, sustainability is an evolving journey, and we are committed to doing much more 
than we have achieved so far. While we have made significant strides in environmental 
stewardship, social responsibility, and governance, we recognize that there is still much to 
accomplish, and we are accelerating our efforts.
We have already reduced GHG emissions by 86% since 2018-19 and offset 100% of our 
power consumption with green energy. Yet, our ambitions go beyond this. We are actively 
exploring new technologies, increasing renewable energy adoption, and strengthening our 
path to carbon neutrality by 2030.
Beyond environmental impact, we are expanding our social initiatives in education, healthcare, 
and economic empowerment, ensuring lasting change. Aligning with the UN Global 
Compact was just the beginning—we are embedding sustainability deeper into our business, 
strengthening partnerships, and driving inclusive growth.
Governance remains at the core of our ESG efforts. We are enhancing transparency, 
strengthening responsible business practices across our value chain, and evolving our ESG 
reporting to reflect not just our progress but our unwavering commitment to improvement.
At Sasken, we are not just meeting sustainability benchmarks—we are setting new ones. Our 
journey is ongoing, and our efforts will only intensify. Together, we will build a more sustainable, 
inclusive, and responsible future. Thank you for your support.”

the 
waste 
management practices adopted 
in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of 
hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
Sasken prioritizes waste management as a key part of its sustainability roadmap, recognizing 
its environmental, social, and economic impact.
Source Reduction & Waste Minimization
Since 2002, our focus has been on reducing waste at the source by:
• Optimizing processes & improving efficiency to minimize waste.
• Recycling & upcycling wherever possible to reduce environmental impact.
We have established a comprehensive recycling in our management practice. Waste is 
segregated as,:
• Wet Waste-Typically food waste
• Dry Waste-Typically paper, wood etc.
• E-Waste–Electronic Waste, electrical waste, cables, wires, disks, computers etc.
• Hazardous waste- Used oils, oil-soaked cottons, batteries, paint cans etc.
• Sanitary waste
• Medical waste–Cottons, syringes, medicines etc.
• Sewage waste
• Garden Waste
Sasken ensures waste segregation at source using color-coded bins and promotes a circular 
economy through responsible disposal and recycling.
• Recycling & Upcycling:
o	 Partnering with Kadhi Gram Udyog to recycle paper, cardboard, and tissue paper.
o	 Collaborating with Eco-Karigari to upcycle plastic waste.
o	 Using an organic leaf waste composter to prevent burning and ensure eco-friendly 
composting.
o	 Recycling glass and metals, diverting them from landfills.
• Hazardous Waste Disposal:
o	 Oil-soaked cotton waste & used oils from generators are stored in a waste yard and 
disposed of through government-authorized vendors.
o	 Cotton waste is incinerated, and used oils are regenerated per pollution control board 
regulations.
Sanitary & Medical Waste:
• US FDA-certified vendors supply collection boxes for sanitary waste, which is securely 
transported and incinerated per Pollution Control Board guidelines.
• Medical waste is segregated into four bins (sharps, infectious waste, PPE, and hazardous 
waste) and disposed of by authorized vendors.
E-waste & Device Reuse:
• Partnering with certified e-waste recyclers for responsible disposal.
• Refurbishing old computers and donating them to underprivileged schools, extending 
device life by two years.
Food Waste & Bio-Gas:
• A bio-gas plant processes cafeteria waste, generating biogas for heating.
Sustainability Initiatives:
• Employee training programs on sustainable practices.
• Continuous tracking of waste metrics to set reduction targets.
• ISO 14001 certification for environmental management.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Sasken Technologies Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of Sasken Technologies Limited (“the Company”), which comprise 
the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the Statement of Profit and Loss, including Other Comprehensive Income, Statement of 
Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements, including 
material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial 
Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us the aforesaid Standalone Financial 
Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state 
of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025, and profit (including other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash 
flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 
Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code 
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We 
have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matters
How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in our audit
1
Revenue Recognition from Fixed Price Contracts (Refer 
Note 3(c) to the Standalone Financial Statements)
Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized using 
percentage of completion method (“POC”) as per the 
input method prescribed under Ind AS 115 - Revenue 
from contracts with customers (“Ind AS 115”) where 
performance obligations are satisfied over time. The POC 
method involves computation of actual cost incurred till 
date and estimation of total future cost to be incurred 
towards remaining performance obligations over the life 
of the project, which involves following factors requiring 
significant auditor attention:
i. There is an inherent estimation uncertainty relating 
to determination of the progress of each contract, 
cost incurred till date and future cost to complete the 
remaining performance obligation on the contract, given 
the customized nature of the contracts.
Our audit procedures related to estimation of total cost to complete 
the contract for fixed price contracts included but not limited to 
following:
i.	 Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and 
controls implemented by management for recording and 
computing revenue and associated contract assets and contract 
liabilities.
ii.	 Verified the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the internal financial controls implemented by the Company 
with respect to estimation of future cost to completion, 
estimation of provision for onerous contract, measurement of 
contract assets, contract liabilities, total contract revenue on its 
completion, approval and recording of revenue on a test check 
basis.
iii.	 Internal Information Technology (‘IT’) specialists were 
involved to verify the design and operating effectiveness of 
key application controls relating to revenue recognition which, 
included testing of automated controls, system generated 
reports and system reconciliations.

How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in our audit
ii. The estimation of total cost to complete the contract 
involves significant judgement throughout the period 
of contract and is subject to revision as the contract 
progresses based on latest available information and 
also involves critical estimates to make provision for 
onerous contract.
iii. At year end a significant amount of contract assets 
and contract liabilities related to each contract is to 
be identified which involve significant judgement and 
estimation. In view of above, the above matter has been 
identified as a key audit matter.
iv.	 We performed below substantive audit procedures on a test 
check basis for fixed price contract:-
a.	
Verified the contractual terms to identify the performance 
obligation and assessed the basis of revenue recognition 
in accordance with Ind AS 115;
b.	
Compared the status of delivery of the milestones and 
customer acceptances with the agreed timelines as per 
the contract to identify possible delays in achieving the 
milestones which require changes in estimated cost to 
complete the contract;
c.	
Performed inquiries with delivery / project managers to 
corroborate the status of contracts;
d.	
Carried out a retrospective assessment of costs incurred 
with estimated costs to identify any significant variation 
and verified whether those variations have been 
considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete 
the contract;
e.	
Verified that the revenue in foreign currency is recognised 
applying the spot exchange rate between the functional 
currency and the foreign currency at the date of the 
transaction;
f.	
Verified the mathematical accuracy of the calculation 
of revenue using the ratio of actual costs incurred to 
estimated costs;
g.	
Verified the accuracy of the actual cost incurred in respect 
of fixed price contracts;
h.	
Assessed the appropriateness of contract assets 
on Balance Sheet date by evaluating the underlying 
documentation to identify possible changes in estimated 
costs to complete the remaining performance obligations; 
and
i.	
Inspected 
underlying 
documents 
to 
determine 
reasonableness of contract costs.
v.	 On the basis of above procedures, verified that adequate 
provision has been accounted for in respect of onerous contracts.
vi.	 Verified that the adequate disclosure has been made in respect 
of revenue from contracts with customers, contract assets and 
contract liabilities in compliance with the requirements of Ind 
AS 115 - 'Revenue from contracts with customer’.

Evaluation of uncertain tax positions (Direct Tax and 
Indirect Tax)
Refer Note 33 to the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company has ongoing litigations with respect 
to Direct tax and Indirect tax at various levels. There 
are significant matters of interpretation in terms of 
application of tax laws and rules to determine current 
and deferred taxes. The Company’s tax positions are 
challenged by the tax authorities on a range of tax 
matters including indirect tax matters.
Our audit procedures related to evaluation of uncertain tax positions 
included but not limited to following:
i.	
Obtained a detailed understanding of the management’s 
process for determining statutory liabilities, provisions and 
contingent liabilities pertaining to tax claims and disputes.
ii.	 Verified the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness 
of key internal financial controls over review and approval of 
accounting of uncertain tax positions and related disclosures in 
the Standalone Financial Statements.

Key Audit Matters
How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in our audit
This requires the Management to make significant 
judgements and evaluations of the outcome of uncertain 
tax positions that are currently in litigation before various 
tax authorities and thus it may significantly impact the 
recognition of liabilities and contingent liability related 
disclosure as per requirements of ‘Ind AS 37 - Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets’.
In view of the above and significance of the matter, this 
has been identified as a key audit matter.
iii.	 Obtained the details and understood the nature of tax positions 
and litigations pending against the Company by reading the 
minutes of various meetings and discussing the developments 
during the year for litigations with Chief Risk Officer and with 
other Senior Management personnel.
iv.	 Obtained management’s evaluation on outcome of these 
matters, where applicable.
v.	 Read the orders received by the Company from the tax 
authorities.
vi.	 We along with our internal tax experts:
a.	
read and analysed key correspondences and relevant 
legal precedence and other rulings on test check basis;
b.	
evaluated the Company’s key underlying assumptions in 
estimating the tax provisions;
c.	
assessed the Company’s estimate of the possible 
outcome of the disputed cases;
vii.	
Assessed whether the Company’s disclosures in Note 33 to 
the Standalone Financial Statements - contingent liabilities 
and commitments, adequately disclose the relevant facts and 
circumstances of the Company in compliance with Ind AS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and 
Ind AS 12 Income Tax.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Company’s annual 
report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of 
these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in equity 
and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting 
Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.

ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OF SASKEN TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management and Board of Directors.
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management and Board of Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and are therefore, the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

[Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditors’ Report of even date 
to the Members of Sasken Technologies Limited on the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025]
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of Sasken Technologies Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on 
that date.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 
2025, based on the internal control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 
“Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).
Management’s and Board of Director’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based 
on the internal control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed 
to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and 
the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of preparation
	
A. 	
Basis of preparation
	
	
These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, (the ‘Act’) read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act (Ind AS).
	
	
Accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, except for the 
adoption of new accounting standards and amendments to the existing accounting standards, effective as of April 1, 2024.
	
	
The financial statements correspond to the classification provisions contained in Ind AS 1,“Presentation of Financial 
Statements”. For clarity, various items are aggregated in the Statements of Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet. These items 
are disaggregated separately in the Notes to the standalone financial statements, where applicable.
	
	
These standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is also the Company’s functional currency. 
All amounts included in these financial statements are reported in INR (` in lakhs), except share and per share data, unless 
otherwise stated.
	
	
The financial statements have been approved for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 25, 2025.
	
B. 	
Basis of measurement
	
	
These standalone financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis of 
accounting, except for the following material items which have been measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS:
Items
Measurement basis
Derivative financial instruments
Fair value
Investments classified as fair value through profit or loss and OCI Fair value
Net defined benefit (asset) / liability
Fair value of plan assets less present value of defined 
benefit obligations
Share based payment options
Fair value
	
C. 	
Use of estimates and judgments
	
	
In preparing these standalone financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
	
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized 
prospectively.
	
	
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
	
	
Information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that 
have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the standalone financial statements are included in the following 
notes:
	
	
a) 	
Revenue recognition:
	
	
	
The Company uses the percentage of completion i.e. input (cost expended) method to measure progress towards 
completion in respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method accounting relies on estimates of 
total expected contract revenue and costs. This method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates of the 
revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in 
estimating the future costs to complete include estimates of future labor costs and productivity efficiencies. Because 
123
the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of 
these contracts, recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. 
When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes 
probable.
	
	
b) 	
Impairment testing (non-financial assets):
	
	
	
Investments in subsidiaries and intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the asset or cash generating units to which 
these pertain is less than its carrying value. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use 
and fair value less costs to sell. The calculation of value in use of a cash generating unit involves use of significant 
estimates and assumptions which includes growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future cash 
flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market conditions.
	
	
c) 	
Income taxes:
	
	
	
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes including judgment on whether tax 
positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which 
can only be resolved over extended time periods.
	
	
d) 	
Deferred taxes:
	
	
	
Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The ultimate realization 
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those 
temporary differences and tax loss carry forwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal 
of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred 
tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income 
during the carry-forward period are reduced.
	
	
e) 	
Defined benefit plans and compensated absences:
	
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences and the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
are based on remeasurement valuation using the projected unit credit method. An remeasurement valuation involves 
making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination 
of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and fair value of plan assets. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these 
assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
	
f) 	
Expected credit losses on financial assets:
	
	
	
The impairment provisions of financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected timing 
of collection. The Company uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation, based on the Company’s past history, customer’s creditworthiness, existing market conditions as well as 
forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
g) 	
Other estimates:
	
	
	
Fair valuation of derivative hedging instruments designated as cash flow hedges involves significant estimates relating 
to the occurrence of the highly probable cash flow forecast transaction.
	
D. 	
Measurement of fair values:
	
	
Some of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-
financial assets and liabilities.
	
	
Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques 
as follows:
	
	
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
	
	
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); or
	
	
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
	
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. If the 
inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair 
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)
(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
Sasken Annual Report 2024-25
124
value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is 
significant to the entire measurement.
	
	
The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which 
the change has occurred.
3. 	
Summary of material accounting policies
	
(a) 	 Property, plant and equipment (including intangible assets)
	
	
i. 	
Recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation / amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
	
Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-
refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing 
the item to its working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located.
	
	
	
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for 
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
	
	
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use as at each reporting date is disclosed under capital 
work-in-progress.
	
	
	
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss.
	
	
ii. 	
Subsequent expenditure
	
	
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the incremental future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company.
	
	
iii. 	
Depreciation and amortization
	
	
	
Based on an independent assessment, Management has estimated the useful lives of the following classes of assets, 
which are lower than or equal to those indicated in Schedule II of the Act. Management believes this best represents 
the period over which they expect to use these assets. Depreciation is provided using the straight line method (SLM), 
over the estimated useful life of the asset, as follows:
Assets block

Useful life as per Schedule II 
Buildings

Vehicles

15
	
	
	
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of estimated useful life of the assets or the related lease 
term. Freehold land is not depreciated.
	
	
	
Assets with unit value of ` 5,000 or less are depreciated entirely in the year of acquisition.
	
	
	
Intangible assets	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized 
over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. 
The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of 
obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known 
technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows 
from the asset.

The cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in
-progress.
	
(b) Leases
	
	
The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To 
assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
Company as a lessee
	
	
The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components 
of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-
alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.
	
	
The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the 
incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the 
carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made 
and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance 
fixed lease payments.
	
	
The Company measures the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any 
prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the balance sheet immediately before the date of 
initial application. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the date of initial application 
over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are 
determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment 
whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognized 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with 
these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
(c) 	 Revenue
	
	
The Company derives revenues from rendering software services, installation and commissioning services and maintenance 
services.
	
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services.
	
	
i. 	
Time and Material contracts
	
	
	
Revenue and costs relating to time and material contracts are recognized as and when the services are rendered.
	
	
ii. 	
Fixed-price contracts
	
	
	
Revenue from fixed price service contracts and customized technology developments is recognized based on the 
percentage of completion method (POC) of accounting with contract cost incurred determining the degree of 
completion of the performance obligation. Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term 
of the maintenance arrangement.
	
	
	
The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party software. In such cases, revenue for supply 
of such third party software are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the 
principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration when 
it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.
	
	
iii. 	
Others
	
	
	
Revenue from royalty is recognized when the later of the following events occurs; 
	
	
	
a) 	
the subsequent sale or usage occurs; or
	
	
	
b) 	
the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been allocated 
and satisfied (or partially satisfied).

(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
Sasken Annual Report 2024-25
126
	
	
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service 
level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. 
Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.
	
	
Contract assets are recognized when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are 
classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and 
only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
	
	
Deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognized when there is billings in excess of revenues. Advances received for 
services are reported as liabilities until all conditions for revenue recognition are met.
	
	
Interest income is recognized as it accrues in the Statement of Profit and Loss using effective interest rate method. Dividend 
income is recognized when the right to receive the dividend is established.
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognizes an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of 
meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
	
	
Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company 
reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be 
allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the 
event transaction price is revised for existing obligation a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
	
	
The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by geography and nature of services.
	
	
Use of significant judgements in revenue recognition:
	
	
The Company’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer services to a customer. The Company assesses the 
services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct 
performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit 
independently from such deliverables.
	
	
The Company uses judgement to determine an appropriate standalone selling price for a performance obligation. The 
Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling 
price of each distinct service promised in the contract.
	
	
The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over 
a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered 
or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date 
and alternate use of such service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the 
customer, etc.
	
(d) 	 Foreign currency
	
	
(i) 	 Foreign currency transactions
	
	
	
Initial recognition
	
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency by applying to the foreign currency 
amount, the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date, of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
and reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses), net within results of operating activities, except when deferred 
in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
	
	
	
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at 
the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
	
	
(ii) 	 Foreign operations
	
	
	
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into INR, the functional currency of the Company, at the 
exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into INR at the 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at 
the date of the transaction.

(e)	 Financial instruments
	
	
i. 	
Recognition and initial measurement
	
	
	
Trade receivables are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are 
initially recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
	
	
A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit 
and loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
	
	
ii. 	
Classification and subsequent measurement
	
	
	
Financial assets:
	
	
	
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost or fair value through profit and loss 
(FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
	
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Company 
changes its business model for managing financial assets.
	
	
	
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
	
	
	
- 	
the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
	
	
	
- 	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income:
	
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
	
	
	
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all 
derivative financial assets.
Financial assets at FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including 
any interest or dividend income, are recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss.
Financial assets at FVTOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, are 
recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.
Financial assets
at amortized cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses, if any. Interest income, 
foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any 
gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities:
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL 
if it is classified as held‑for‑trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial 
liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized 
in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
iii. 	 Derecognition
	
	
	
Financial assets:
	
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset 
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities:
	
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.
	
	
	
The Company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified 
terms are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair 
value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability 
with modified terms is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.

iv. 	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
	
	
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk from monetary assets, liabilities and forecasted cash flows 
denominated in foreign currencies. The Company limits the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by following 
established risk management policies including the use of derivatives. The Company enters into derivative financial 
instruments where the counterparty is a bank.
	
	
	
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured as described below:
	
	
	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of the derivative is recognized in OCI and accumulated in other equity under cash flow hedging reserve. The effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognized in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair 
value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of 
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated 
or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is 
discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in other equity remains there until, for a hedge of a transaction 
resulting in recognition of a non‑financial item, it is included in the non‑financial item’s cost on its initial recognition 
or, for other cash flow hedges, it is reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period or periods as the 
hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.
	
	
	
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in 
other equity are immediately reclassified to Statement of profit and loss.
	
(f) 	 Impairment
	
	
i. 	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
	
The Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost.
	
	
	
At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit‑impaired. 
A financial asset is ‘credit‑impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
	
	
	
Evidence that a financial asset is credit‑impaired includes the following observable data:
	
	
	
- 	
significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
	
	
	
- 	
a breach of contract such as a default or being past due for 180 days or more;
	
	
	
- 	
the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise
	
	
	
- 	
it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization: or
	
	
	
- 	
the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties
	
	
	
Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. 
Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible defaults over the expected 
life of a financial instrument.
	
	
ii. 	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
	
The Company’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated.
	
	
	
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash-
generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent on the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) 
and its value-in-use (VIU). The VIU of long-lived assets is calculated using projected future cash flows. FVLCD of a 
CGU is computed using turnover and earnings multiples. Impairment losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. Impairment loss recognized in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU (or group of 
CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)
(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
129
	
	
	
If at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the 
recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment losses previously recognized are reversed such that the asset 
is recognized at its recoverable amount but not exceeding written down value which would have been reported if the 
impairment losses had not been recognized initially.
	
	
iii.	
Investment in subsidiaries
	
	
	
Investment in subsidiaries is initially recognized at cost and subsequently at cost less impairment if any
	
	
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that such investments may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the investment. The recoverable 
amount of CGU is higher of VIU and fair value less costs to sell. The calculation of value in use of a CGU involves use of 
significant estimates and assumptions which includes growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future 
cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market conditions. An impairment loss is recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. An assessment is 
also made at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment 
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount and reverses the impairment loss to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation or amortisation) had no impairment loss 
been recognised previously
	
(g) 	 Equity
	
	
i.	
Share capital
	
	
	
The authorized share capital of the Company as on March 31, 2025 is ` 5,500 lakhs i.e. 550 lakh equity shares of ` 10 
each, par value of the equity shares is recorded as share capital. Every holder of the equity shares, as reflected in the 
records of the Company as of the date of the shareholder's meeting shall have one vote in respect of each share held 
for all matters submitted to vote in the shareholder's meeting.
	
	
ii. 	
Capital reserve
	
	
	
Any profit or loss on purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments is transferred to 
capital reserve.
	
	
	
Capital reserve amounting to ` 132 lakhs (March 31, 2024: ` 132 lakhs) is not freely available for distribution.
	
	
iii.

v. 	
Share based payments reserve
	
	
	
Share based payment reserve is used to record the fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with 
employees over the vesting period. This reserve is utilised upon exercise of options.
	
	
	
Share based payments reserve amounting to ` 817.90 lakhs (March 31, 2024: ` 863.02 lakhs ) is not freely available 
for distribution.

Changes in fair value of derivative hedging instruments designated and effective as a cash flow hedge are 
recognized in other comprehensive income (net of taxes), and presented within equity as cash flow hedging 
reserve.
	
	
	
b) 	
Remeasurement gains / losses
	
	
	
	
Remeasurement gains / losses on defined benefit plans are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (net of

(h) 	 Employee benefits
	
	
I) 	
Post-employment and pension plans
	
	
	
The Company's employees participate in various employee benefit plans. Pensions and other post-employment 
benefits are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, 
the Company’s only obligation is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund 
does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. The related remeasurement and investment risks fall on 
the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is recognized as an expense during the period when 
the employee renders service. Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Company’s obligation to provide agreed benefits 
to the employees. The related remeasurement and investment risks fall on the Company. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligations is calculated by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
	
	
	
All remeasurement gains or losses are immediately recognized in OCI, net of taxes and permanently excluded from 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Further, the profit or loss will not include an expected return on plan assets. Instead net 
interest recognized in profit or loss is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit 
obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The actual return on the plan assets above or below the discount 
rate is recognized as part of remeasurement of net defined liability or asset through OCI, net of taxes. The Company 
has the following employee benefit plans:
	
	
	
i. 	
Gratuity
	
	
	
	
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan covering all eligible employees. The plan provides a 
lump sum payment to eligible employees at retirement or on termination of employment based on the salary of 
the respective employee and the years of employment with the Company.
	
	
	
	
The Company contributes to gratuity funds maintained by third parties, such as insurance companies and mutual 
funds. The amount of contribution is determined based upon remeasurement valuations as at the period end 
using the projected unit credit method. Provision is made for the shortfall between the remeasurement valuation 
carried out as at balance sheet date as per projected unit credit method and the fair value of the plan assets with 
the third parties, such as insurance companies and mutual funds.
	
	
	
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise remeasurement gains and losses, the return 
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized 
in OCI, net of taxes. The Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit 
liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the 
beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes 
in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net 
interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.
	
	
	
ii. 	
Provident fund
	
	
	
	
Employees in India are eligible to receive provident fund benefits through a defined benefit plan in which the 
employees and the employer make monthly contributions to the plan. A portion of the contribution is made to 
the approved provident fund trust managed by the Company while the remainder of the contribution is made to 
the Government administered pension fund. The Provident Fund Trust guarantees a specified rate of return on 
such contributions. The contributions made to the trust managed by the Company is accounted for as a defined 
benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in the Trust's assets based on the Government specified 
rate of return. The contributions made to the Government administered Pension Fund is accounted for as a 
defined contribution plan as the Company has no obligation other than to make such contributions.

iii. 	 Pension
	
	
	
	
In case of Germany branch, pension contributions are made as per the local laws and regulations. The Company 
provides for these pension benefits, a defined benefit plan, covering all eligible employees. The plan provides for 
various pension benefits to eligible employees at retirement or on termination of employment based on earnings 
of the respective employee and the years of employment with the Company. The Company contributes to a 
reinsured support fund maintained by an external agency. The contributions made by the employer are charged to 
the Statement of Profit and Loss on accrual basis. Provision is made for the shortfall between the remeasurement 
valuation carried out as at the year end are based on the projected unit credit method and the plan assets.
	
	
	
	
For other overseas branches, social security contributions are made as per the respective local laws and 
regulations. The same is charged to the statement of profit and loss on an accrual basis. There are no obligations 
beyond the respective entity’s contributions.
	
	
	
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise remeasurement gains and losses are 
recognized in OCI.
	
	
II) 	 Superannuation
	
	
	
The Company contributes to a superannuation scheme, a defined contribution plan maintained by an insurance 
company. Such contributions are charged to the statement of profit and loss on an accrual basis. The Company has no 
other obligations beyond its monthly contributions.
	
	
III)	 Short - term employee benefits
	
	
	
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are classified as short term 
employee benefits. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus and ex-gratia. The undiscounted amount of 
short-term employee benefits to be paid in exchange for employee services is recognized as an expense as the related 
service is rendered by employees.
	
	
IV) 	 Compensated absences
	
	
	
The Company's employees are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry forward a portion of 
the unutilized accumulating compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or 
termination of employment. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which 
the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The Company measures the expected cost of 
compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement 
that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Company recognizes accumulated compensated 
absences based on remeasurement valuation using the projected unit credit method. Non-accumulating compensated 
absences are recognized in the period in which the absences occur.
	
	
	
Accumulated leaves, which are expected to be utilized within the next twelve months and not eligible to be carried 
forward to future years, is treated as short term employee benefit. The Company measures the expected cost of such 
absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated 
at the reporting date. These amounts are charged to the statement of profit and loss.
	
(i) 	 Income taxes
	
	
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it 
relates to a business combination or to an item recognized directly in equity or in OCI.
	
	
i. 	
Current tax
	
	
	
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any 
adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best 
estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income 
taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and 
applicable for the period. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off the recognized amounts, and it is intended to realize the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or 
to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
	
ii. 	
Deferred tax
	
	
	
Deferred tax is recognized using the Balance Sheet approach in respect of temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred tax is also recognized in respect of carried forward tax losses and tax credits. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
	
	
	
- 	
Temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)
(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
Sasken Annual Report 2024-25
132
	
	
	
- 	
Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent 
that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
	
	
	
- 	
Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be used.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets, whether unrecognized or recognized, are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognized/ 
reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realized.
	
	
	
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the 
liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
	
	
	
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will 
be realized simultaneously.
	
(j) 	 Earnings per share
	
	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average numbers of equity shares 
outstanding during the year is adjusted for events of bonus issue; bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders; 
share split; and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) and buy back of shares. Shares bought back are considered to 
have been bought back at the beginning of the year, irrespective of the date of buy back.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares, except where the results are anti-dilutive.
	
(k) 	 Provisions and contingencies
	
	
A provision is recognized when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are not 
discounted to their present value and are determined based on best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
	
Provisions for onerous contracts, i.e. contracts where the expected unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it, are recognized when it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle a present obligation as a result of an obligating event, 
based on a best estimate of such obligation.
	
	
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure is made as contingent liability. A disclosure for a contingent liability 
is also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow 
of resources. A contingent asset is neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.
	
(l) 	 Warranty	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Provision for warranty related costs are recognized when the license is provided or service provided. Provision is based on 
historical experience. The estimate of such warranty related costs is revised periodically.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(m) 	Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise of cash at bank and in hand and short term investments 
with an original maturity value of three months or less. The cash flow statement is prepared under the indirect method.
	
(n) 	 Stock compensation expense
	
	
Measurement and disclosure of the employee share-based payment plans is done in accordance with Ind AS 102 share 
based payments. The Company accounts for stock compensation expense based on the fair value of the options granted, 
determined on the date of grant. Compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the option on a straight-line 
basis. The accounting value of the options outstanding net of the deferred compensation expense is reflected as employee 
stock options outstanding.
Recent Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has not notified any new standards 
or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.

Note on financial instruments :
During the year, the Company has changed financial classification of its investments in fixed income instruments from amortized cost 
to fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). The change in classification is due to change in intention of the Company 
to sell the instruments when it is more profitable to sell them rather than holding.

(c) 	 Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to equity shares:
	
	
The Company has only one class of equity shares having a par value of ` 10 per share. Accordingly, all equity shares rank 
equally with regard to dividends and share in the Company’s residual assets. The holders of equity shares are entitled 
to receive dividend as declared from time to time. The dividend if any proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to 
shareholders’ approval at the ensuing Annual General Meeting. The voting rights of an equity shareholder on a poll (not on 
show of hands) are in proportion to its share of the paid-up capital of the Company. Voting rights cannot be exercised in 
respect of shares on which any call or other sums presently payable have not been paid.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Failure to pay any amount called up on shares may lead to forfeiture of the shares. On winding up of the Company, the 
holders of equity shares will be entitled to receive the residual assets of the Company, remaining after distribution of all 
preferential amounts in proportion to the number of equity shares held.

Deferred taxes on unrealized mark to market gain / loss relating to cash flow hedges, fair value changes on instruments at 
FVTOCI and actuarial gains / losses on defined benefit plans are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and presented 
within equity. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recorded in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
	
	
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the 
deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future 
taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards become deductible. 
The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning 
strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realize 
the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be 
reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.
	
	
The Company has provided for income taxes at the rates provided in Section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the 
year ended March 31, 2025.

The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be 
recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognize these 
amounts in  revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining 
performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value 
to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time-and-
material. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including 
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized 
and adjustments for currency fluctuations.
	
	
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied out of the purchase orders 
received, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is ` 244.17 lakhs as at March 31, 2025 (` 723.91 
lakhs as at March 31, 2024). Out of this, the Company expects to recognize majority of the revenues in next year.

Fair value hierarchy
	
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because the cost 
represents estimate of fair value.

The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:

Credit risk;
	
	
l	
Liquidity risk; and
	
	
l	
Market risk
	
i. 	
Risk management framework
	
	
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise trade payables, other payables and unpaid dividend. The main purpose 
of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include trade 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents and unbilled revenues that derive directly from its operations.
	
	
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s 
primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its 
financial performance. The primary market risk for the Company pertains to investing activities. The Company’s exposure 
to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of customers and counterparties to derivative instruments 
such as banks.
	
ii.	
Credit risk
	
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers and investments in debt 
securities.
	
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ` 9,295.32 lakhs and 
` 5,145.19 lakhs as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively and unbilled revenues amounting to ` 2,721.47 
lakhs and ` 2,054.94 lakhs as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 respectively. Credit risk has always been managed 
by the Company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of 
customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. As per Ind AS 109, the Company 
uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The Company uses a provision matrix to compute 
the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues.

The carrying amount of the following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
	
	
Trade receivables
	
	
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, 
management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk of 
the industry and country in which customers operate.
	
	
Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. The Company 
establishes an allowance for impairment that best represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade receivables. 
The Company has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for credit worthiness 
before the standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The balance outstanding of trade receivable is 
less than 180 days.
	
	
Cash and bank balances
	
	
The Company held cash and bank balances of ` 1,456.02 lakhs at March 31, 2025 (March 31, 2024: ` 1,179.96 lakhs). 
	
	
Derivatives
	
	
The derivatives are entered with banks being counterparty.
	
iii. 	 Liquidity risk
	
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is 
to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal 
and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.
	
	
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from 
operations. The Company has no outstanding bank borrowings. The Company believes that the working capital is sufficient 
to meet its current requirements. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.
	
	
Exposure to liquidity risk
	
	
The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross

Market risk
	
	
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices – 
will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Market risk is attributable to all 
market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company is exposed to 
market risk primarily related to the market value of its investments. Thus, the exposure to market risk is primarily related to 
investing activities. The objective of market risk management is to diversity our portfolio according to nature of investments 
to mitigate risks.
	
v.	
Currency risk
	
	
The Company is exposed to currency risk on account of export of services in foreign currency. The functional currency of

consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025, and of consolidated profit (including other comprehensive income),

requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by Institute

1
Revenue Recognition from Fixed Price Contracts (Refer 
Note 3(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized using 
percentage of completion method (“POC”) as per the 
input method prescribed under Ind AS 115 - Revenue 
from contracts with customers (“Ind AS 115”) where 
performance obligations are satisfied over time. The 
POC method involves computation of actual cost 
incurred till date and estimation of total future cost to 
be incurred towards remaining performance obligations 
over the life of the project, which involves following 
factors requiring significant auditor attention:
i.	
There is an inherent estimation uncertainty relating 
to determination of the progress of each contract, 
cost incurred till date and future cost to complete the 
remaining performance obligation on the contract, 
given the customized nature of the contracts.
ii.	 The estimation of total cost to complete the 
contract involves significant judgement throughout 
the period of contract and is subject to revision as 
the contract progresses based on latest available 
information and also involves critical estimates to 
make provision for onerous contract, if any;
Our audit procedures related to estimation of total cost to complete the contract 
for fixed price contracts included but not limited to following:
i.	
Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls 
implemented by management for recording and computing revenue and 
associated contract assets and contract liabilities.
ii.	 Verified the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls implemented by the Group with respect to estimation 
of future cost to completion, estimation of provision for onerous contract, 
measurement of contract assets, contract liabilities, total contract revenue on 
its completion, approval and recording of revenue on a test check basis.
iii.	 Internal Information Technology (‘IT’) specialists were involved to verify the 
design and operating effectiveness of key application controls relating to 
revenue recognition which, included testing of automated controls, system 
generated reports and system reconciliations.
iv.	 We performed below substantive audit procedures on a test check basis for 
fixed price contracts:-
a.	 Verified the contractual terms to identify the performance obligation and 
assessed the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with Ind AS 115;
b.	 Compared the status of delivery of the milestones and customer 
acceptances with the agreed timelines as per the contract to identify 
possible delays in achieving the milestones which require changes in 
estimated cost to complete the contract;

has been identified as a key audit matter.
c.	 Performed inquiries with delivery / project managers to corroborate the 
status of contracts;
d.	 Carried out a retrospective assessment of costs incurred with estimated 
costs to identify any significant variation and verified whether those 
variations have been considered in estimating the remaining costs to 
complete the contract;
e.	 Verified that the revenue in foreign currency is recognized applying the 
spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign 
currency at the date of the transaction;
f.	
Verified the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of revenue using the 
ratio of actual costs incurred to estimated costs;
g.	 Verified the accuracy of the actual cost incurred in respect of fixed price 
contracts;
h.	 Assessed the appropriateness of contract assets on Balance Sheet date by 
evaluating the underlying documentation to identify possible changes in 
estimated costs to complete the remaining performance obligations; and

On the basis of above procedures, verified that adequate provision has been 
accounted for in respect of onerous contracts.
vi.	
Verified that the adequate disclosure has been made in respect of revenue 
from contracts with customers, contract assets and contract liabilities in 
compliance with the requirements of Ind AS 115 - ‘Revenue from contracts 
with customer.

Evaluation of uncertain tax positions (Direct Tax and 
Indirect Tax)
Refer Note 34 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group has ongoing litigations with respect to Direct 
tax and Indirect tax at various levels. There are significant 
matters of interpretation in terms of application of 
tax laws and rules to determine current and deferred 
taxes. The Group’s tax positions are challenged by 
the tax authorities on a range of tax matters including 
indirect tax matters. This requires the Management 
to make significant judgements and evaluations of the 
outcome of uncertain tax positions that are currently 
in litigation before various tax authorities and thus it 
may significantly impact the recognition of liabilities 
and contingent liability related disclosure as per 
requirements of ‘Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities, and Contingent Assets’. In view of the above 
and significance of the matter, this has been identified as 
a key audit matter

not limited to following:
i.	
Obtained a detailed understanding of the management’s process for 
determining statutory liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities pertaining 
to tax claims and disputes.

internal financial controls over review and approval of accounting of uncertain 
tax positions and related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
iii.	 Obtained the details and understood the nature of tax positions and litigations 
pending against the Group by reading the minutes of various meetings and 
discussing the developments during the year for litigations with Chief Risk 
Officer and with other Senior Management personnel.
iv.	 Obtained management’s evaluation on outcome of these matters, where 
applicable. 
v.     Read the orders received by the Group from the tax authorities.
vi.	 We along with our internal tax experts:
a.	 read and analyzed key correspondences and relevant legal precedence 
and other rulings on test check basis;
b.	 evaluated the Group’s key underlying assumptions in estimating the tax 
provisions;
c.	 assessed the Group’s estimate of the possible outcome of the disputed 
cases;
vii. Assessed whether the Group’s disclosures in Note 34 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements - contingent liabilities and commitments, adequately 
disclose the relevant facts and circumstances of the Group in compliance with 
Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and Ind AS 
12 Income Tax.

assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements.

ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OF SASKEN TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management and Board of Directors.
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group and to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group and to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which 
we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been 
audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits 
carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

referred to in the Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, , which

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A Company’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial control with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
Sasken Annual Report 2024-25
174
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2. 	
Basis of preparation
	
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, (the ‘Act’) read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as 
amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
Accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, except 
for the adoption of new accounting standards and amendments to the existing accounting standards, effective as of April 1, 
2025.
	
The consolidated financial statements correspond to the classification provisions contained in Ind AS 1,“Presentation of Financial 
Statements”. For clarity, various items are aggregated in the consolidated statements of Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet. These 
items are disaggregated separately in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, where applicable.
	
The consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 25, 2025.
	
A. 	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate (i.e. the “functional currency”). These consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is also the Company’s functional currency. All amounts 
included in these consolidated financial statements are reported in INR (Amount in ` lakhs), except share and per share 
data, unless otherwise stated.
	
B. 	
Basis of measurement
	
	
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis of 
accounting except for the following material items which have been measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS.
Items
Measurement basis
Derivative financial instruments
Fair value
Investments classified as fair value through profit or loss

Investments classified as fair value through Other 
comprehensive income

Fair value of plan assets less present value of defined 
benefit obligations
Share based payment option

C. 	
Use of estimates and judgments
	
	
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
	
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized 
prospectively.
Sasken Annual Report 2024-25
180
	
	
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
	
	
Information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that 
have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements are included in the following 
notes:
	
	
a) 	
Revenue recognition:
	
	
	
The Group uses the percentage of completion i.e. input (cost expended) method to measure progress towards 
completion in respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method accounting relies on estimates of 
total expected contract revenue and costs. This method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates of the 
revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in 
estimating the future costs to complete include estimates of future labour costs and productivity efficiencies. Because 
the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of 
these contracts, recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. 
When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes 
probable.
	
	
b) 	
Impairment testing (non-financial assets):
	
	
	
Intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable amount of the asset or cash generating units to which these pertain is less than its 
carrying value. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs to 
sell. The calculation of value in use of a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates and assumptions 
which include growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, 
future economic and market conditions.
	
	
c) 	
Income taxes:
	
	
	
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes including judgment on whether tax 
positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which 
can only be resolved over extended time periods.
	
	
d) 	
Deferred taxes:
	
	
	
Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The ultimate realization 
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those 
temporary differences and tax loss carry forwards become deductible. The Group considers the expected reversal of 
deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred tax 
assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during 
the carry-forward period are reduced.
	
	
e) 	
Defined benefit plans and compensated absences:
	
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences and the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
are based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and fair value of plan assets. Due to the complexities involved in the 
valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
	
f) 	
Expected credit losses on financial assets:
	
	
	
The impairment provisions of financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected timing 
of collection. The Group uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation, based on the Group’s past history, customer’s creditworthiness, existing market conditions as well as 
forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
g) 	
Impairment on goodwill:
	
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which it pertain is less than its carrying value. The recoverable 
amount of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell. The calculation of value in 
use of a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates and assumptions which include growth rates and 
net margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market 
conditions.

h) 	
Other estimates:
	
	
	
Fair valuation of derivative hedging instruments designated as cash flow hedges involves significant estimates relating 
to the occurrence of the highly probable cash flow forecast transactions.
	
D.	
Measurement of fair values :
	
	
Some of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require measurement of fair values, for financial assets and 
liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities.
	
	
Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques 
as follows:
	
	
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
	
	
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); or
	
	
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
	
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the 
inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair 
value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is 
significant to the entire measurement.
	
	
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which 
the change has occurred.
3. 	
Summary of material accounting policies
	
(a) 	 Basis of consolidation
	
	
Subsidiaries
	
	
The Company determines the basis of control in line with the requirements of Ind AS 110, Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries and controlled trusts are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
	
	
The financial statements of all Group entities are prepared using uniform accounting policies and for the same reporting 
period as that of the Company. The financial statements of the Group entities are consolidated on a line-by-line basis by 
adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Intra-group balances, transactions, and unrealised 
profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition or up to the date of 
disposal, as appropriate.  All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
	
	
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately within equity. The share 
of profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests is also presented separately in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss.
	
(b) 	 Business combinations
	
	
Business combinations involving entities that are controlled by the Group (common control transactions) are accounted for 
using the pooling of interests method as follows:
	
	
- 	
The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts;
	
	
- 	
The financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated with effect from the 
appointed date as per the approval obtained from the requisite authorities.
	
	
- 	
The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at their carrying amounts. The identity of the reserves is preserved 
and they appear in the consolidated financial statements of the Group in the same form in which they appeared in the 
financial statements of the acquired entity;
	
	
- 	
The difference, if any, between the consideration and the amount of share capital of the acquired entity is transferred 
to capital reserve.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.)
(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
Sasken Annual Report 2024-25
182
	
	
Business combinations for transactions other than the common control transactions are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed 
and equity instruments issued at the date of exchange by the Company. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.
	
	
The cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration measured as at the date of acquisition. 
Any subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration classified as liabilities, other than measurement 
period adjustments, are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured at fair value as on the acquisition date. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus 
the non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-
controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
	
	
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of the net identifiable 
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
for the purpose of impairment testing. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that 
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
	
(c) 	 Property, plant and equipment (including intangible assets)
	
	
i. 	
Recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation / amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
	
Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-
refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing 
the item to its working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located.
	
	
	
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for 
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
	
	
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use as at each reporting date is disclosed under capital 
work-in-progress.
	
	
	
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the Statement Profit and 
Loss.
	
	
ii. 	
Subsequent expenditure
	
	
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the incremental future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group.
	
	
iii. 	
Depreciation and amortization
	
	
	
Based on an independent assessment, Management has estimated the useful lives of the following classes of assets, 
which are lower than or equal to those indicated in Schedule II of the Act. Management believes this best represents 
the period over which they expect to use these assets. Depreciation is provided using the straight line method (SLM), 
over the estimated useful life of the asset, as follows:
Asset block

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of estimated useful life of the assets or the related lease 
term. Freehold land is not depreciated.

(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
183
	
	
	
Assets with unit value of ` 5,000 or less are depreciated entirely in the year of acquisition.
	
	
	
Intangible assets	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized 
over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. 
The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of 
obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known 
technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows 
from the asset.

The cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-
progress.
	
(d) 	 Leases
	
	
The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To 
assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
Group as a lessee
	
	
The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the 
contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone 
price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.
	
	
The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the 
incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the 
carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made 
and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance 
fixed lease payments.
	
	
The Group measures the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid 
or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial 
application. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the date of initial application over 
the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined 
on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there 
is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognized in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
	
	
The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term 
of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these 
leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
(e) 	 Revenue
	
	
The Group derives revenues from rendering software services, installation and commissioning services and maintenance 
services.
	
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those services.
	
	
i. 	
Time and material contracts
	
	
	
Revenue and costs relating to time and material contracts are recognized as and when the services are rendered.

(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
Sasken Annual Report 2024-25
184
	
	
ii. 	
Fixed-price contracts
	
	
	
Revenue from fixed price service contracts and customized technology developments is recognized based on the 
percentage of completion method (POC) of accounting with contract cost incurred determining the degree of 
completion of the performance obligation. Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term 
of the maintenance arrangement.
	
	
	
The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party software. In such cases, revenue for supply of 
such third party software are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the principal 
or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting 
as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.
	
	
iii. 	
Others
	
	
	
Revenue from royalty is recognized when the later of the following events occurs;
	
	
	
a) 	
the subsequent sale or usage occurs; or
	
	
	
b) 	
the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been allocated 
and satisfied (or partially satisfied).
	
	
	
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, 
service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, specified in the contract with the 
customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.
	
	
	
Contract assets are recognized when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are 
classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, 
and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
	
	
	
Deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognized when there is billings in excess of revenues. Advances received 
for services are reported as liabilities until all conditions for revenue recognition are met.
	
	
	
Interest income is recognized as it accrues in the Statement of Profit and Loss using effective interest rate method. 
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive the dividend is established.
	
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognizes an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of 
meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
	
	
	
Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group 
reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be 
allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In 
the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
	
	
	
The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by geography and nature of services.
	
	
	
Use of significant judgements in revenue recognition:
	
	
	
The Group's contracts with customers include promises to transfer services to a customer. The Group assesses 
the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of 
distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to 
benefit independently from such deliverables.
	
	
	
Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract. The transaction price could be either 
a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service 
level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the 
effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration 
payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a service from the customer. 
The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and is reassessed at 
the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance 
obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance 
obligations.
	
	
	
The Group uses judgement to determine an appropriate standalone selling price for a performance obligation. The 
Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling 
price of each distinct service promised in the contract.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.)
(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
185
	
	
	
The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time 
or over a period of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are 
rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance 
to date and alternate use of such service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of 
delivery by the customer, etc.
	
(f) 	 Foreign currency
	
	
Foreign currency transactions
	
	
(i) 	 Initial recognition
	
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency by applying to the foreign currency 
amount, the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date, of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
and reported within foreign exchange gains / (losses), net within results of operating activities, except when deferred 
in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
	
	
	
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated on 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
	
	
(ii) 	 Foreign operations
	
	
	
For the purpose of presenting these consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group foreign 
operations that have a functional currency other than Indian rupees are translated into Indian rupees using exchange 
rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for 
the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and held in foreign 
currency translation reserve (FCTR), a component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed, the relevant 
amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss as part of the Statement of Profit and 
Loss on disposal.
	
(g) 	 Financial instruments
	
	
i. 	
Recognition and initial measurement
	
	
	
Trade receivables are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are 
initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
	
	
A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through Profit 
and Loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
	
	
ii. 	
Classification and subsequent measurement
	
	
	
Financial assets:
	
	
	
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost or fair value through Profit and Loss 
(FVTPL) or fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
	
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Group 
changes its business model for managing financial assets.
	
	
	
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at 
FVTPL:
	
	
	
- 	
the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
	
	
	
- 	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
	
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
	
	
	
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all 
derivative financial assets.

186
Financial assets
at FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any 
interest or dividend income, are recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss. However, see 
Note 3(g)(iv) for derivatives designated as hedging instruments.
Financial assets
at amortized
cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses, if any. Interest income, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on 
derecognition is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
Financial assets at 
OCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income 
in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the 
investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are not reclassified to the 
Statement of Profit or Loss.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL 
if it is classified as held‑for‑trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial 
liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
iii. 	 Derecognition
	
	
	
Financial assets:
	
	
	
The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, 
or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities:
	
	
	
The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.
	
	
	
The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified 
terms are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair 
value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability 
with modified terms is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
iv. 	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
	
	
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk from monetary assets, liabilities and forecasted cash flows denominated 
in foreign currencies. The Group limits the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by following established risk 
management policies including the use of derivatives. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments where 
the counterparty is a bank.
	
	
	
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in Statement of Profit and 
Loss as cost.
	
	
	
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured as described below:
	
	
	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of the derivative is recognized in OCI and accumulated in 'other equity' under cash flow hedging reserve. The effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognized in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair 
value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of 
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated 
or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is 
discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in other equity remains there until, for a hedge of a transaction 
resulting in recognition of a non‑financial item, it is included in the non‑financial item’s cost on its initial recognition 
or, for other cash flow hedges, it is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period or periods as the 
hedged expected future cash flows affect the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in 
other equity are immediately reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

(h)	 Impairment
	
	
i. 	
Impairment of financial Asset
	
	
	
The Group recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost.
	
	
	
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit‑impaired. A 
financial asset is ‘credit‑impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
	
	
	
Evidence that a financial asset is credit‑impaired includes the following observable data:
	
	
	
- 	
significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
	
	
	
- 	
a breach of contract such as a default or being past due for 180 days or more;
	
	
	
- 	
the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
	
	
	
- 	
it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization: or
	
	
	
- 	
the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.
	
	
	
Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. 
Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible defaults over the expected 
life of a financial instrument.
	
	
ii. 	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
	
The Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated.
	
	
	
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash-
generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent on the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) 
and its value-in-use (VIU). The VIU of long-lived assets is calculated using projected future cash flows. FVLCD of 
a cash generating unit is computed using turnover and earnings multiples. Impairment losses are recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss recognized in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU 
(or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
	
	
	
If at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the 
recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment losses previously recognized are reversed such that the asset 
is recognized at its recoverable amount but not exceeding written down value which would have been reported if the

(j) 	 Employee benefits
	
	
a) 	
Post-employment and pension plans
	
	
	
The Group's employees participate in various employee benefit plans. Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the 
Group’s only obligation is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does 
not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. The related remeasurement and investment risks fall on the 
employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is recognized as an expense during the period when the 
employee renders service. Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Group’s obligation to provide agreed benefits to 
the employees. The related remeasurement and investment risks fall on the Group. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligations is calculated by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
	
	
	
All remeasurement gains or losses are immediately recognized in OCI, net of taxes and permanently excluded from 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. Further, the Statement of Profit and Loss will not include an expected return on plan 
assets. Instead, net interest recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is calculated by applying the discount rate 
used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The actual return on the 
plan assets above or below the discount rate is recognized as part of remeasurement of net defined liability or asset 
through OCI, net of taxes. The Group has the following employee benefit plans:
	
	
	
i. 	
Gratuity
	
	
	
	
The Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan covering all eligible employees. The plan provides a lump 
sum payment to eligible employees at retirement or on termination of employment based on the salary of the 
respective employee and the years of employment with the Company.
	
	
	
	
The Group contributes to gratuity funds maintained by third parties, such as insurance companies and mutual 
funds. The amount of contribution is determined based upon actuarial valuations as at the period end using the 
projected unit credit method. Provision is made for the shortfall between the actuarial valuation carried out as at 
balance sheet date as per projected unit credit method and the fair value of the plan assets with the third parties, 
such as insurance companies and mutual funds.
	
	
	
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise remeasurement gains and losses, the return 
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized 
in OCI, net of taxes. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability 
(asset) for the period, by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning 
of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net 
defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest 
expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
ii. 	
Provident fund
	
	
	
	
Employees in India are eligible to receive provident fund benefits through a defined benefit plan in which the 
employees and the employer make monthly contributions to the plan.
	
	
	
	
Company's portion of the contribution is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the Company 
while the remainder of the contribution is made to the Government administered pension fund. The provident 
fund trust guarantees a specified rate of return on such contributions. While the contributions made to the trust 
managed by the Company is accounted for as a defined benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in 
the Trust's assets based on the Government specified rate of return, the contributions made to the Government 
administered pension fund is accounted for as a defined contribution plan as the Company has no obligation 
other than to make such contributions.
	
	
	
	
Provident fund related to employees of Sasken Silicon Technologies Private Limited (SSTPL) are contributed to 
Government administered fund and is accounted as a defined contribution plan.
	
	
	
iii. 	 Pension
	
	
	
	
In case of the Company's branch in Germany, pension contributions are made as per the local laws and regulations. 
The Group provides for these pension benefits, a defined benefit plan, covering all eligible employees. The plan 
provides for various pension benefits to eligible employees at retirement or on termination of employment based 
on earnings of the respective employee and the years of employment with the Group. The Group contributes to a 
reinsured support fund maintained by an external agency. The contributions made by the employer are charged 
to the Statement of Profit and Loss on accrual basis. Provision is made for the shortfall between the actuarial 
valuation carried out as at the year end, based on the projected unit credit method and the plan assets.

For other overseas branches, social security contributions are made as per the respective local laws and 
regulations. The same is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on an accrual basis. There are no obligations 
beyond the respective entity’s contributions.
	
	
	
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise remeasurement gains and losses are 
recognized in OCI.
	
	
	
iv. 	
Superannuation
	
	
	
	
The Group contributes to a superannuation scheme, a defined contribution plan maintained by the Company 
with an insurance company. Such contributions are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on an accrual 
basis. The Group has no other obligations beyond its monthly contributions.
	
	
b) 	
Short - term employee benefits
	
	
	
Employee benefits payable by the Group wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are classified 
as short term employee benefits. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus and ex-gratia. The undiscounted 
amount of short term employee benefits to be paid in exchange for employee services is recognized as an expense as 
the related service is rendered by employees.
	
	
c) 	
Compensated absences
	
	
	
The Group's employees are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry forward a portion of the 
unutilized accumulating compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or 
termination of employment. The Group records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the 
employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The Group measures the expected cost of compensated 
absences as the additional amount that the Group expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has 
accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Group recognizes accumulated compensated absences based on 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Non-accumulating compensated absences are recognized 
in the period in which the absences occur.
	
	
	
Accumulated leaves, which are expected to be utilized within the next twelve months and not eligible to be carried 
forward to future years, is treated as a short term employee benefit. The Group measures the expected cost of such 
absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated 
at the reporting date. These amounts are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(k) 	 Income taxes
	
	
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that 
it relates to a business combination or to an item recognized directly in equity or in OCI.
	
	
i. 	
Current tax
	
	
	
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any 
adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best 
estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income 
taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and 
applicable for the period.
	
	
	
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized 
amounts, and it is intended to realize the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
	
	
ii. 	
Deferred tax
	
	
	
Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred tax is also recognized in respect of carried forward tax losses and tax credits. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
	
	
	
- 	
temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable the Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of the 
transaction;
	
	
	
- 	
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent 
that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
	
	
	
- 	
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.)
(Amount ` in lakhs, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
191
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be used.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets, whether unrecognized or recognized, are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognized/ 
reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realized.
	
	
	
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the 
liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
	
	
	
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will 
be realized simultaneously.
	
(l)	
Earnings per share
	
	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the 
period, adjusted by the number of ordinary shares bought back or issued during the period multiplied by a time-weighting 
factor. The weighted average numbers of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for events of bonus issue; 
bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders; share split; and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) and 
buy back of shares.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the effects 
of all dilutive potential equity shares, except where the results are anti-dilutive.
	
(m) 	Provisions and contingencies
	
	
A provision is recognized when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are not 
discounted to their present value and are determined based on best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
	
Provisions for onerous contracts, i.e. contracts where the expected unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it, are recognized when it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle a present obligation as a result of an obligating event, 
based on a best estimate of such obligation.
	
	
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure is made as contingent liability. A disclosure for a contingent liability 
is also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow 
of resources. A contingent asset is neither recognized nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
	
(n) 	 Warranty
	
	
Provision for warranty related costs are recognized when the license is provided or service provided. Provision is based on 
historical experience. The estimate of such warranty related costs is revised periodically.
	
(o) 	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise of cash at bank and in hand and short term investments 
with an original maturity value of three months or less. The cash flow statement is prepared under the indirect method.
	
(p) 	 Stock compensation expense
	
	
Measurement and disclosure of the employee share-based payment plans is done in accordance with Ind AS 102 share 
based payments, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The Group accounts for stock compensation 
expense based on the fair value of the options granted, determined on the date of grant. Compensation expense is amortized 
over the vesting period of the option on a straight-line basis. The accounting value of the options outstanding net of the 
deferred compensation expense is reflected as employee stock options outstanding.

Note on investments:
During the year, the Company has changed financial classification of its investments in fixed income instruments from amortized cost 
to fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The change in classification is due to change in intention of the Company 
to sell the instruments when it is more profitable to sell them rather than holding.

(c) 	 Rights, preference and restrictions attached to the equity shares:
	
	
The Company has only one class of equity shares having a par value of ` 10 per share. Accordingly, all equity shares rank 
equally with regard to dividends and share in the Company’s residual assets. The holders of equity shares are entitled 
to receive dividend as declared from time to time. The dividend if any proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to 
shareholder’s approval at the ensuing Annual General Meeting. The voting rights of an equity shareholder on a poll (not on 
show of hands) are in proportion to its share of the paid-up capital of the Company. Voting rights cannot be exercised in 
respect of shares on which any call or other sums presently payable have not been paid.
	
	
Failure to pay any amount called-up on shares may lead to forfeiture of the shares.
	
	
On winding up of the Company, the holders of equity shares will be entitled to receive the residual assets of the Company, 
remaining after distribution of all preferential amounts in proportion to the number of equity shares held.

(g) 	 There are no bonus shares issued during the period of five years immediately preceding the balance sheet date.
	
(h) 	 The Board in their meeting held on April 25, 2025 has approved ` 13 per share as final dividend for the year ended March 
31, 2025 and in October 2024 dividend of ` 12 per share was paid during the year. It would result in net cash outflow of 
` 1,965.81 lakhs (March 31, 2024: ` 25 per share).
	
(i) 	 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
	
	
The Sasken Employees’ Share Based Incentive Plan 2016 (Plan) was duly approved and instituted in December, 2016. 
The Plan authorizes the Board of Directors of the Company to offer share based incentive to eligible employees of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. The maximum number of shares to be granted under the Plan will be in accordance with SEBI 
(Employee Share Based Payments and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021 and other applicable regulations.
	
	
The above grants have been made to identified employees of the Company on January 13, 2022; May 26, 2022; October 
19, 2022; November 4, 2022; April 3, 2023 and October 13, 2023. These shall vest as per the vesting schedule of 2 years as 
approved by the Committee and can be exercised over the exercise period of 3 years as approved by them.
	
	
During the year ended March 31 2025, no new RSUs were granted, 23,550 RSUs lapsed due to non-meeting of vesting 
conditions, totally 54,740 RSUs vested, out of which 43,640 RSUs were exercised during the year. The employee share 
based compensation cost of ` 380.26 lakhs charged to the profit or loss (for the year ended March 31, 2024: ` 533.57 lakhs).
	
	
The Group has used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair value of the RSUs based on which the 
compensation cost for the current year has been computed.

Deferred taxes on unrealized foreign exchange gain / loss relating to cash flow hedges, fair value changes on instruments 
at FVTOCI and actuarial gains / losses upon remeasurement defined benefit plans are recognized in other comprehensive 
income and presented within equity. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recorded in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the 
deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future 
taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards become deductible. 
The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning 
strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realize 
the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be 
reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.
	
The Company has provided for income taxes at the rates provided in Section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the 
period ended March 31, 2025

geographies, the revenues based on domicile of the customer are disclosed in Note (c) below. Assets and liabilities used in 
the Group’s business are not identified to any of the geographies, as these are used interchangeably between geographies.

None of the customer group individually accounted for more than 10% of the revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025 
(March 31, 2024: 1 customer group)
	
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be 
recognized as at the end of the reporting year and an explanation as to when the Group expects to recognize these 
amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Group has not disclosed the remaining 
performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value 
to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time-and-
material. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including 
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized 
and adjustments for currency fluctuations. 
	
	
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied out of the purchase orders 
received, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is ` 847.29 lakhs as at March 31, 2025 
(` 1,253.50 lakhs as at March 31, 2024). Out of this, the Group expects to recognize revenue of 100% in future.

Attrition rate
20.00%
20.00%
	
	
The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities for the estimated term of the 
obligations. The expected return on plan assets is based on expectation of the average long term rate of return expected 
on investments of the fund during the estimated term of the obligations. The estimates of future salary escalations 
considered takes into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors. Attrition rate considered is the 
management’s estimate, based on previous years’ employee turnover of the Group.
	
(vi)	 Sensitivity analysis:
	
	
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions 
constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below:

Financial instruments – fair values
	
Fair value hierarchy
	
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because the cost 
represents estimate of fair value.

to employees, accrued interest, other advances, unbilled revenue, trade payables, lease liabilities, employee related payables, unpaid 
dividends are considered to be the same as their fair values, since they are short-term in nature. They are classified as level 3 fair 
values in the fair value hierarchy due to the inclusion of unobservable inputs including own and counterparty credit risk. The carrying 
amount of non-convertible debentures, investment in preference shares, zero coupon bonds, corporate fixed deposits, government 
securities and tax free bonds carried at amortized cost approximates fair value of these investments.

Derivative instruments (assets and liabilities): The Group enters into derivative contracts with banks with investment grade 
credit ratings. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are foreign exchange forward 
contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and 
Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including 
the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and forward rate curves of the underlying. As 
at March 31, 2025, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for 
derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognized at fair value.
The carrying amount of cash and bank balances, investments carried at amortised cost, trade receivables, security deposits, 
advance to employees, accrued interest, other advances, unbilled revenues, trade payables, lease liabilities, employee related 
payables, unpaid dividends are considered to be the same as their fair values, since they are short-term in nature. They are classified 
as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the inclusion of unobservable inputs including own and counterparty credit 
risk. The carrying amount of non-convertible debentures, investment in preference shares, zero coupon bonds, corporate fixed 
deposits and tax free bonds carried at amortized cost is considered to be the same as the fair value of the investments.

B.	
Financial risk management
	
	
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
	
	
l	
Credit risk;
	
	
l	
Liquidity risk; and
	
	
l	
Market risk.
	
i. 	
Risk management framework
	
	
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise trade payables, other payables and unpaid dividend. The main purpose 
of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and unbilled revenues that derive directly from its operations.
	
	
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s primary 
focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial 
performance. The primary market risk for the Group pertains to investing activities. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is 
influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of customers and counterparties to derivative instruments such as banks.
	
ii.	
Credit risk
	
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investments in debt 
securities.
	
	
The carrying amount of the following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
	
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ` 10,645.98 lakhs and 
` 6,576.79 lakhs as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively and unbilled revenues amounting to ` 3,020.37 
lakhs and ` 2,533.88 lakhs as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 respectively. Credit risk has always been managed 
by the Group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of 
customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. As per Ind AS 109, the Group uses 
expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The Group uses a provision matrix to compute the 
expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues.
	
	
The following table gives details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from top two customer and top ten 
customers:
Particulars
For the year 
ended 
March 31, 2025
For the year 
ended 
March 31, 2024
Revenue from top 2 customers
14.61%
18.28%
Revenue from top 10 customers
55.46%
56.66%
	
	
The carrying amount of the following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
	
	
Trade receivables
	
	
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, 
management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk of 
the industry and country in which customers operate.
	
	
Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. The Group 
establishes an allowance for impairment that best represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade receivables. 
The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for credit worthiness 
before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The balance outstanding of trade

iii. 	 Liquidity risk
	
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to 
ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
	
	
The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. 
The Group has no outstanding bank borrowings. The Group believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current 
requirements. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.
	
	
Exposure to liquidity risk
	
	
The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross

Market risk
	
	
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices – 
will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market 
risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The Group 
is exposed to market risk primarily related to the market value of its investments. Thus, the exposure to market risk is 
primarily related to investing activities. The objective of market risk management is to diversify our portfolio according to 
nature of investments to mitigate risks.

Revenue:
USD revenue for FY2025 is USD 65.01 Million increased by 32% compared with FY 2024 USD 49.17 Million mainly on account of 
growth in business volumes across customers in line with our 60x4x3 vision. Customers with annual run rate of more than USD 1 
Million have increased to 20 in FY 2025 from 16 in FY 2024. Customers with USD 4 Million run rate increased to 3 in FY 2025 from 1

Management Discussion and Analysis Report (Contd.)
Expenses:
The total expenses for FY 2025 are ` 52,800 lakhs compared to ` 37,573 lakhs in FY 2024, an increase of 41% and in absolute terms 
increase of ` 15,227 lakhs compared to FY 2024.
The increase in costs was primarily driven by planned workforce expansion, including the hiring of fresh graduates and the 
implementation of competitive compensation adjustments aimed at retaining key talent and supporting long-term value creation. In 
addition, we have undertaken strategic leadership hiring for our newly established subsidiaries.
Furthermore, the Group made targeted investments to expand into emerging areas such as Generative AI and to establish new 
subsidiaries, aligning with our broader strategy of diversifying offerings and extending our geographical footprint. These investments 
include both fixed and one-time costs, largely associated with the Borqs acquisition and capacity-building initiatives designed to 
enhance our operational capabilities and position the Group for sustained future growth.
Depreciation and amortization expenses:
Depreciation and amortisation expenses have increased to ` 1,396 lakhs for FY 2025 as against ` 743 lakhs for FY 2024. During the 
year, new premises were taken on long-term lease in Chennai, Kolkata & Pune and accounted as Right-of-use (ROU) assets. The 
consequent depreciation on such ROU assets led to an increase in depreciation and amortisation.
Other Income:
Other Income comprises of fair valuation of mutual funds, interest from corporate deposits, tax free bonds, zero coupon bonds (ZCB), 
government securities and non-convertible debentures (NCD), gain on sale of investments, proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets, preference 
dividend on investment, write back of unclaimed balances and provisions, exchange gains on foreign currency, interest on income tax 
refund and other miscellaneous receipts.
Other income for FY 2025 has decreased to ` 5,584 lakhs compared to FY 2024 of ` 7,086 lakhs. Your Group has earned an annualized 
pre - tax yield of 8.79% in FY 2025 as against 11.80% in FY 2024. The returns from investments are as follows:

During the year, the Group gradually increased its allocation in fixed income portfolio with focus on long duration instruments given 
the rate reversal is imminent.
During FY 2025, the Indian equity market remained largely muted, impacted by ongoing market corrections and elevated volatility. 
A key driver of this turbulence was the movement in the US dollar, triggered by the imposition of new tariffs by the United States on 
several global trading partners.

In response to the market environment, all equity investments were strategically exited in alignment with the pre-defined take-profit 
policy. The equity portfolio delivered a robust return of 22%, underscoring disciplined risk management and timely profit booking 
amidst an uncertain macro backdrop.
In FY 2025, the Company received ` 1,145 lakhs of dividend from its subsidiary companies, which is reflected in the Standalone 
Financial Statements.
Income Tax Expense:

The effective tax rate increased to 18.54% in FY 2025, up from 16.05% in FY 2024. While taxes on business income remained broadly 
consistent year-over-year, the rise in the overall tax rate is primarily attributable to changes in treasury income composition. In FY 
2024, lower tax on equity gains reduced the overall tax burden. In FY 2025, the absence of such gains led to more income being taxed 
at standard rates, increasing the effective tax rate.

A key pillar of our investment policy is a proactive risk management framework that ensures continuous monitoring of market 
conditions. This approach enables us to realize profits based on predefined market triggers, facilitating prudent decision-making and 
the timely capture of gains in a dynamic and often volatile market environment.
In line with this strategy and considering the heightened volatility in equity markets during the year,  we made the strategic decision 
to fully exit our equity portfolio. This exit allowed us to realize profits in accordance with our risk-adjusted investment approach. 
Furthermore, we exited select investments during the year and temporarily allocated the proceeds to money market mutual funds 
to ensure liquidity in preparation for the Borqs acquisition. In addition, we increased our allocation to government securities and 
preference shares, reflecting a strategic shift toward lower-risk, fixed-income instruments aimed at preserving capital while 
maintaining portfolio stability.
During FY 2025, the Group made an additional investment of `250 lakhs in the Ideaspring Capital Future Now II Fund, bringing the 
total investment to `750 lakhs against a capital commitment of `1,000 lakhs. Similarly, `200 lakhs were invested in the MV Core 
Tech Fund I during the year, taking the total investment to `730 lakhs, also against a capital commitment of `1,000 lakhs. Both these 
funds are classified as Category II Alternative Investment Funds and are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI).
In addition, the Group invested `63 lakhs in its Singapore subsidiary and `866 lakhs in its Japan subsidiary, in line with its strategic 
focus on expanding international operations.
Trade receivables, Unbilled revenue, and contract assets:
Trade receivables, unbilled revenue, and contract assets of ` 14,658 lakhs as at March 31, 2025, representing 15.29% of the total assets. 
This balance was ` 9,678 lakhs as at March 31, 2024. Daily Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased to 97 days in FY 2025, compared to 
87 days in FY 2024. The rise reflects higher receivables driven by increased sales activity. This is in line with the Company’s continued 
investment in working capital to support growth in top-line revenues. The Group periodically assesses the quality of its receivables 
portfolio and makes provisions for doubtful debts where required, ensuring that the carrying value of receivables reflects expected 
recoverability
Other assets:
Other assets include derivative assets, tax assets, other financial assets, and others. Other assets of ` 10,467 lakhs as at March 31, 
2025, represent 11% of the total assets. This balance was at ` 8,373 lakhs as at March 31, 2024.

mergers and acquisitions during the year impacting the overall operating cash flow.
Threats, Risks and Concerns
In today’s dynamic global environment, the Company operates amidst a range of external and internal risks that require continuous 
assessment and strategic response. Geopolitical tensions in key regions such as Asia and Europe continue to pose uncertainties that 
may disrupt global supply chains, delay project timelines, and impact client engagements. These developments necessitate proactive 
monitoring and contingency planning to ensure operational resilience.
Macroeconomic challenges, including persistent inflationary pressures and volatility in commodity prices, are further compounded by 
divergent fiscal and monetary policies across geographies. These factors can influence customer spending patterns, delay investment 
decisions, and affect overall business sentiment.
The rapid pace of technological advancement particularly in areas such as generative AI, automation, and digital engineering presents 
both transformative opportunities and heightened competitive intensity. To remain at the forefront of innovation, the Company must 
continue to invest in digital capabilities, workforce upskilling, and R&D initiatives.
In parallel, the growing sophistication and frequency of cyber threats represent a critical area of concern. As a technology-driven 
enterprise with a global digital footprint, the Company is exposed to risks related to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and 
operational disruptions. Strengthening cybersecurity infrastructure, enhancing threat detection capabilities, and fostering a culture 
of cyber awareness remain top priorities.
To effectively manage these risks and leverage opportunities, Your Company adheres to the requirements of Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM), as mandated by various regulations, including the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and the Companies Act, 2013.

Risk of data loss, corruption, or 
unauthorized access due to hardware 
/ software issues, insecure coding, 
or inadequate PII protection. This 
may lead to operational disruption, 
data breaches, privacy violations, 
reputational damage, and regulatory 
penalties.
The Secure Software Development Lifecycle (including secure coding 
guidelines) is adhered to by the delivery teams throughout the project 
lifecycle until the closure phase. For instance, we utilize the Secure SDLC 
framework at Sasken Management Systems and follow MISRA coding 
guidelines.
By employing open-source code scanning tools, we identify vulnerabilities 
and consult with customer/internal information security teams for 
guidance on their resolution. Examples of such tools include Klocwork 
Insight, Black Duck, and FOSSA.
We establish robust controls at entry and exit points within the 
organization to ensure both digital and physical security, thereby 
preventing any breach of confidential information.
We have implemented a comprehensive framework to address data 
privacy requirements in accordance with various regulatory standards 
worldwide. This framework includes technical and organizational 
measures, policies, processes, guidelines, systems, IT controls, and 
controls across HR, payroll, and other departments. Additionally, we 
have established cross-border data transfer mechanisms to prevent any 
leakage of stakeholder privacy within and outside of Sasken, associated 
with business needs.
Periodic Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs) are conducted to 
identify potential risks related to personally identifiable information (PIIs) 
and to take corrective actions.
Our organization is certified according to global standards such as ISO/
IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27701. Furthermore, we have upgraded our 
Quality Management System to TISAX (Trusted Information Security 
Assessment Exchange) standards to ensure data security and privacy.

risks 
encompass a range of potential 
challenges that can arise during 
and after the transaction process. 
Merger & Acquisition risk refers to 
the potential for operational, financial, 
legal, and cultural challenges that 
could negatively impact the success 
of the merger or acquisition.
We engage professional and experts to help us conduct the due diligence 
covering financial, operational, legal and cultural dimensions.
Integration planning is anchored by strong executive sponsorship with 
clearly defined roles, identification of synergies, and realistic timelines. 
We engage experienced professionals to deliver specialized assistance
Risk mitigation includes well-defined earnout clauses tied to performance, 
insurance, hedging strategies, succession planning for key leadership, 
and retention plan of high-potential talent.
We ensure operational monitoring to address customer retention, 
supplier diversification, and stakeholder communication.
Predictable 
Project Delivery
The risk of project delivery falling 
short of its commitment on timelines, 
costs, and quality stems from various 
factors, including but not limited to 
inadequate 
planning, 
inadequate 
resources, 
ineffective 
project 
management and / or unforeseen 
challenges
During the contracting stage, Delivery Program Managers are required 
to review engagement-specific risks and define mitigation actions with 
formal sign-off.
Project progress is tightly monitored through the automated Percentage 
of Completion (POC) method in the Sasken Delivery Platform (SDP), 
while Earned Value Management (EVM) is used to generate early 
warning indicators for applicable projects.
Weekly Red / Yellow governance reviews led by the Global Delivery Head 
(GDH) provide flash updates to senior management, complemented by 
periodic project-specific reviews with Delivery Program Managers.
Additionally, a systemic change management process is embedded in 
SDP to ensure timely identification and execution of project changes. A 
contingency risk buffer is also maintained to address unforeseen delivery 
challenges, enhancing overall project resilience.
Contractual 
Obligation Risk
Contractual obligations risk refers 
to 
risks 
arising 
from 
customer 
agreements, including service-level 
commitments, 
delivery 
timelines, 
and

Environmental 
Risk - High 
Carbon Intensity
Clients, especially global enterprises, 
increasingly require suppliers to meet 
strict Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) standards.
High carbon intensity can lead to loss 
of business opportunities, especially 
with clients who have committed to 
Science-Based Targets (SBTs) or net-
zero goals.
Many countries and companies have 
reinforced these targets at global 
climate 
summits 
(e.g., 
COP28), 
pushing for stricter Scope 3 emissions 
compliance across value chains.
We conduct periodic GHG assessments under All scopes (Scope 1, 
Scope2, Scope 3) to identify emission hotspots and establish baselines.
In 2024-25 we sourced 100% (78% through Wind energy and 22 % 
through I-REC offset) of energy from Green Source enabling us to reduce 
our Scope2 emission drastically
We prioritize sourcing EPEAT Gold or Platinum-rated computing devices, 
which significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to their 
high environmental performance standards.
On average, we plant 4,000 trees annually, actively working to offset our 
GHG emissions and support environmental sustainability.
We work with suppliers to promote low-carbon practices and ensure 
alignment with our sustainability values.
Employee awareness campaigns and digital tools help track and reduce

Internal Control Systems
At Sasken, we recognize the paramount importance of robust internal control systems in safeguarding assets, ensuring accurate 
financial reporting, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. Our internal control framework is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of operational objectives, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
Annual certification is an important step. It starts with the ‘control’ owner and then moves on to the ‘process’ owner and upwards, 
leading to the CEO and CFO certification.
Key components of our internal control systems include:
Control Environment: We emphasize integrity, ethical values, and compliance through a strong control of culture led by management.
Risk Assessment: Regular assessments identify and prioritize risks, allowing us to allocate resources and implement controls 
effectively.
Control Activities: Comprehensive controls address specific operational risks, safeguard assets, ensure financial accuracy, and 
promote efficiency.
Information and Communication: We communicate relevant internal control information, policies, and procedures throughout the 
organization, ensuring employees understand their responsibilities.
Monitoring and Review: Continuous monitoring and periodic reviews assess control effectiveness, with management addressing 
deficiencies and making improvements as necessary.
We have adopted policies and procedures to ensure the prevention and detection of fraud and errors, and have measures to safeguard 
our assets and ensure the accuracy and completeness of accounting records with reliable financial disclosures. The Internal Auditors 
conduct audits based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors and the audit 
committee. In line with international practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented toward the review of internal controls and risks 
in its operations including most of the subsidiaries and foreign branches. As a measure of good corporate governance, all matters 
of significant importance or relevance have been reported to the Audit Committee as well as the Company’s Statutory and Internal 
Auditors.
