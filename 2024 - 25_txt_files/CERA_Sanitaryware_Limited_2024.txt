Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format.

GHG and 
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk
The 
manufacturing 
processes of sanitaryware, 
faucet 
ware, 
bathroom 
accessories 
involve 
the 
consumption of electricity 
and 
natural 
gas 
for 
operating 
kilns 
which 
results in greenhouse gases 
emissions (GHGs).
Opportunity
Adopting energy efficiency 
initiatives and integrating 
renewables into the energy 
mix, CERA can reduce 
operational 
costs 
and 
strengthen its position as a 
responsible brand.
CERA has set up solar and wind 
plants with a combined capacity 
of 
10.325 
MW, 
generating 
13,000 
MWh. 
This 
setup 
sufficiently meets around 60% 
of the electricity requirements, 
thus reducing its dependency 
on grid electricity.
Further, the Company has also 
installed a waste heat recovery 
system, 
which 
optimizes 
energy extraction/utility from 
fuels.
Our R&D unit explores various 
alternatives aimed at reducing 
fuel consumption, including 
using fuel-efficient burners 
and 
incorporating 
newer 
energy-saving technologies.

Water 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Water is crucial in the 
mixing and moulding stages 
of production. Improper 
water management poses 
risks 
to 
operations, 
increases costs, and could 
result in non-compliance 
which affects the business 
continuity.  
Opportunity:
Implementing 
water 
management 
practices 
that optimize water usage 
is critical to reduce the 
dependency on freshwater 
sources. 
Additionally, 
incorporating 
water-
efficient product designs 
and manufacturing fosters 
resilience and encourages 
innovation 
within 
our 
business model.
The 
Company 
recognises 
the importance of the water 
and it has installed state-of-
the-art ETP, STP, MEE, RO 
units in the manufacturing 
facility to treat the effluents. 
Further, the company reuses 
the 
treated 
water 
in 
the 
production process, gardening 
and other applications. This 
has enabled us to achieve Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in our 
operations.
we have developed a fully 
functional 
rainwater-
harvesting 
system 
by 
maintaining 
over 
10 
wells 
within the premises. This water 
is further treated and reused in 
production which reduces the 
dependency on groundwater.
As 
a 
socially 
responsible 
corporate 
citizen, 
CERA 
prioritizes 
water-efficient 
product design, with 48% of its 
portfolio consisting of water-
saving products.
Positive &

Waste 
Management
Opportunity
The 
majority 
of 
the 
waste generated in the 
Company’s operations is 
recyclable. Through ‘Waste 
Minimization and Waste 
Utilization’ initiative, the 
company has undertaken 
several measures to reduce, 
reuse, and recycle its waste.
Repurposing 
waste 
at 
various production stages 
(including 
both 
unfired 
and 
fired 
waste) 
and 
implementing 
stringent 
pollution control measures 
reduces 
environmental 
impact 
and 
provides 
a 
competitive edge in the 
market.

The Company demonstrates 
its commitment to social

through 
the

of 
strategic and trust-based

interventions.
The 
Company 
actively 
engages 
with 
local 
communities 
and 
participates 
in 
various 
social welfare activities.
These programs enhance 
the company’s engagement 
with

contribute to strengthening 
its social commitments.

Human Rights Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk:
Adhering to human rights 
principles is a fundamental 
responsibility 
of 
the 
company. It is essential 
to prioritize compliance 
with laws and regulations 
related to human rights. 
Failure to do so can lead 
to 
legal 
consequences 
and negatively affect the 
company’s reputation and 
brand perception.
Opportunity:
Adhering 
to 
ethical 
labour 
practices 
and 
promoting diversity, equity 
and 
inclusion 
through 
stakeholder 
engagement 
reinforces our position as 
a responsible and preferred 
employer.
At CERA, we are dedicated to 
safeguarding the human rights 
of our employees and workers.
We 
have 
adopted 
various 
policies including Code of 
Conduct, 
Anti-Corruption 
Policy, 
Business 
Ethics 
& 
Labour Policy, Policy on Child 
Labour 
& 
Forced 
Labour, 
Policy on Sexual Harassment, 
Whistle- blower Policy.
These policies serve as guiding

and

processes 
and 
procedures 
aimed 
at 
eliminating all forms of human 
rights violations.

At CERA, we remain committed to integrating Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) principles into every aspect of our business. We 
approach ESG matters holistically, recognising their critical role in shaping 
sustainable and responsible growth.
The sector’s growth, driven by changing consumer preferences and 
national priorities, is expected to support long-term, sustainable progress 
for committed players like us. As India moves toward modern, wellness-
focused living, we continue to innovate and stay aligned with evolving 
customer needs. The formalisation of the sanitaryware sector, supported 
by recent reforms, has strengthened the organised market and expanded 
its reach. We aim to minimise our environmental footprint by investing in 
energy-efficient processes and responsible sourcing, with approximately 
48% of our product portfolio comprising water-saving solutions. On the 
social front, our focus remains on ensuring workplace safety, supporting 
employee well-being, and enabling inclusive growth through deeper 
community engagement. Governance is a cornerstone of our operations, 
grounded in transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct.
With these three levers of ESG guiding us at the core of our strategy, we 
remain committed to embedding sustainability, driving long-term value 
creation for all stakeholders.

 Health and safety management system:
 
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, the coverage such system?
Yes, CERA has implemented a comprehensive health and safety management system, ISO 45001:2018 across the 
facilities. We uphold an Occupational Health & Safety Policy that underscores our dedication to the well-being 
and safety of our employees as our top priority and fundamental objective. We adhere to compliance of health 
and safety regulations, as per the Gujarat State Factories Rules, which is integral to ensuring a safe workplace 
environment for all employees.
We aim to minimize health and safety risks by leveraging technology and implementing safe work practices, all in 
the pursuit of sustainable development. To further strengthen safety practices, CERA has celebrated the National 
Safety Week with a series of initiatives focused on promoting awareness and engagement among employees. The 
week-long campaign included practical, shop-floor safety training to help employees apply safe practices in their 
daily tasks. Activities such as safety quizzes, slogan and poster competitions, essay writing, a safety march, and a 
safety oath ceremony were conducted to reinforce safety protocols. During these events, employees reaffirmed 
their commitment to safety norms. Safety banners and badges were used across the plant to enhance safety 
awareness and employee accountability

b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
At CERA, we have implemented Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process to identify work-
related hazards. Our dedicated health and safety team conducts regular inspections to identify potential hazards, 
incorporating feedback from employees and workers. Identified hazards are mitigated with the assistance of 
Plant Engineering team and Department Heads. Additionally, we conduct third-party safety audits and ensure 
compliance. We promote a safety culture by encouraging prompt reporting of unsafe acts, hazardous conditions, 
near misses, or work-related risks to the health and safety team.
Further, we have integrated a Kaizen system focused on safety to identify and mitigate work-related hazards. To 
encourage active participation from our workforce, we have introduced Kaizen coupons for participants in this 
program. These coupons serve as tokens of encouragement for our workforce and helps us to identify the work-
related hazards.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
At CERA, we actively encourage our workers to report any work-related hazards to our safety team or supervisor. 
Upon receiving reports, the respective team investigates the hazards and implements necessary corrective 
actions, reinforcing our commitment to creating a safe and aware workplace environment. If employees feel 
unable to work in their current department due to health concerns, they can request assistance from the HODs. 
After reviewing their situation, HR assesses them for a suitable role and transfers them to another department 
that better accommodates their needs. This comprehensive approach reflects our dedication to creating a safe and 
supportive work environment for all employees.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?  
(Yes/ No)
Yes, CERA's manufacturing facility is equipped with an Occupational Health Centre (OHC) to ensure prompt and 
efficient healthcare response for the workforce. Employees and workers are covered by health insurance, and 
those not included in these insurance schemes have access to the ESIC program. Additionally, we organize annual 
health check-up programs at all operational sites, complemented by twice-a-month health check-ups conducted 
under the Shramyogi Vaan initiative. In case of emergencies, we have a tie-up with a local hospital (Rhythm) to 
ensure timely medical support. Awareness programs are also regularly conducted to educate the workforce on the 
prevention of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, promoting overall well-being.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
At CERA, we are committed to health and safety of our employees by eliminating unsafe conditions and acts within 
the workplace. As a preventive measure, workers are allowed to begin work only after receiving a safety briefing on 
the tasks involved. For all safety-related incidents, our safety team conducts root cause analysis and implements

Yes, CERA has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism within our manufacturing facility. This 
comprehensive system ensures that all wastewater generated is treated and recycled or reused, with no discharge into 
the environment. We have achieved ZLD by implementing:
We have implemented advanced wastewater treatment systems to support responsible water management and achieve 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) at our manufacturing units:
Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs): Two ETPs with a total capacity of 710 KLD. The treated water is further purified via 
Reverse Osmosis (RO), and the RO reject is recirculated into the ETPs through a closed-loop system to maximize reuse.
Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs): Two STPs with a combined capacity of 140 KLD handle on-site domestic 
sewage treatment.
ZLD Commitment: Our commitment to ZLD is reinforced through the installation of a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) 
for high-TDS wastewater treatment, alongside ozonators and RO units, to ensure responsible water discharge and 
maintain rigorous quality standards.
A major portion of the treated water is reused in key production processes such as mould making, slip preparation, 
glaze preparation, casting, and in chillers. The remaining treated water is utilized for gardening and landscaping. (75% 
- plant operation use; 25% - domestic use)
We have achieved zero external discharge from our manufacturing operations and conducted water audit, reflecting 
our commitment to sustainable water management and environmental protection.

Note: In FY 2024–25, although the overall production declined slightly, energy consumption and emissions increased. 
This was primarily due to the expansion of a specific production unit and increased reliance on grid electricity during 
the shutdown of the renewable energy plant for maintenance and weather-related issues. Efficiency improvements and 
equipment upgrades did provide considerable savings (listed below), but these were offset by higher grid dependency. 
Additionally, the emission factors for Scope 1 and Scope 2 have been updated in accordance with the 2024 GHG Protocol 
and the Indian CEA (SEBI ISF guidance). Consequently, the figures for FY 2023–24 have also been revised to ensure 
consistency and comparability.
8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
CERA has initiated Non-Conventional Energy generation project since 1995, harnessing wind and solar power to 
produce 10.325 MW of energy. Today, our manufacturing plants in Gujarat fulfil about 60% of electricity requirements 
through non-conventional captive generation. To further improve efficiency, we have partly replaced our existing solar 
panels with newer ones, enhancing the overall performance of our renewable energy systems. Additionally, we prioritize 
cleaner fuels like market gas for our production processes. At our Kadi factory premises, we host a dedicated R&D unit 
recognized by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). This unit spearheads initiatives to minimize 
fuel consumption, driving efficiency improvements throughout our operations.
Energy audits were conducted at our locations, which helped identify energy-saving opportunities for energy 
conservation and cost reduction. The recommendations from these audits are implemented based on priority.
Optimizing energy efficiency and emission reduction
Fuel
Electrical
Mechanical
Automation and control improvements 
were implemented through auto ON-
OFF valves, burner/kiln timers, and 
pressure-based gas booster control.
Optimization of gas usage included 
prioritizing GAIL gas for generator 
usage and utilizing waste heat in dryers.
Equipment-level efficiency measures 
like damper adjustments and mould-
weight-based burner shutdown were 
introduced.
Extensive timer installations 
across plant equipment 
(HF plant, coolers, mixers, 
conveyors) to optimize runtime.
Replacing tube lights with 
sensor-based lighting and 
disconnecting idle equipment.
Control enhancements via 
remote ON/OFF switches and 
interlocks (e.g., pitcher ball 
mill with compressor) reduced 
unnecessary consumption.
Equipment modifications and upgrades 
such as higher-capacity dryers, slip 
blunger belt changes, and agitator 
timer pilots enhanced efficiency.
Transition to energy-efficient 
components, including IE3 motors and 
delta-to-star conversion for multiple 
agitators.
Process streamlining with improved 
shuttle kiln loading and blower-airline 
interlocking helped reduce mechanical 
load and improve safety.
These have resulted in approximately 600 MWh/2000 GJ in energy savings and 250 MtCO2e of emission reduction 
for FY 2024-25
Moreover, frequent monitoring of energy consumption enables us to swiftly identify inefficiencies and optimization 
opportunities. This approach aids in informed decision-making towards energy conservation and cost reduction.
