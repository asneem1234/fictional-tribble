Message from the CEO 
 
Dear Stakeholders,                                                                                                         
 
At SG Finserve, sustainability is not just a corporate responsibility, it is a deeply 
rooted commitment that guides how we think, operate, and grow. We believe 
that responsible business practices are essential not only for building long-term 
value but also for fostering trust among our stakeholders and contributing to a 
better future for all. 
 
As we present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), we reflect on the progress 
we've made in integrating ESG principles across our operations. From empowering underserved 
businesses through accessible financial services to promoting environmental stewardship and inclusive 
growth, our efforts are aligned with both our core values and national priorities. 
 
Over the past year, we have made significant strides in enhancing our digital infrastructure to reduce 
environmental impact, improving employee engagement through learning and wellness initiatives, and 
maintaining robust governance systems to ensure transparency and compliance. Each of these steps 
reflects our belief that sustainable success is best achieved when we grow responsibly and inclusively. 
As a responsible NBFC, we also recognize the transformative role finance can play in shaping equitable 
and sustainable growth. Through our focus on MSMEs, we are not only supporting entrepreneurship 
but also contributing to job creation and economic resilience in underserved regions. Our partnerships 
and innovations are guided by a vision to democratize finance while staying agile in a rapidly evolving 
regulatory and environmental landscape. 
 
Looking ahead, we remain committed to aligning our strategies with the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and India’s vision for sustainable finance. We understand that our role in shaping a 
resilient financial ecosystem extends beyond profitability it’s about creating lasting value for people, 
planet, and progress.
