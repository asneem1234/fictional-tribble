(Indicate positive 
or negative

1.
Digital theft, 
mobile 
security and 
firewall
Opportunity 
As with every passing day, more and 
more people adopt and shift to digital 
transactions, theft and security issues 
have also emerged; countries across the 
globe have a sizeable elderly population 
who may not be very sophisticated in 
operating phones and computers; this 
offers an incredible opportunity for RML 
through 
security/ 
scanning 
offerings, 
thereby leading to increasing revenue 
from our curated service offerings.
NA
Positive
2.
Talent pool
Opportunity 
and Risk
Increasing revenue from service offerings 
from cutting edge technology & products, 
enabled by our talent pool; this could also 
pose as threat as the company may lose 
in talent retention if the millennial talent 
pool is not provided with satisfactory 
career 
programs 
accompanied 
by 
industry competitive facilities at work 
place.
Talent  
re-skilling, 
attrition
Positive:
Given niche 
talent pool, we 
can emerge 
as a preferred 
business partner.
3.
Platform 
reliability
Opportunity
Our 
platform 
reliability 
creates 
differentiation 
from 
competitor, 
by 
ensuring high service delivery.
Strengthen 
infrastructure, 
implement 
redundancy 
measures, and 
continuous 
monitoring 
and 
maintenance
Negative
4.
Business 
Continuity
Risk
Any downtime can result in poor customer 
experience, and potential customer loss.
Develop 
comprehensive 
business 
continuity 
plans, conduct 
regular drills 
and testing, 
and establish 
backup 
systems
Negative
5.
Innovation
Opportunity
We 
continuously 
enhance 
product 
capabilities and drive multiple revenue 
streams with existing / new customer 
base. At the same time, this helps enhance

6.
Digital 
Inclusion 
resulting 
in market 
growth
Opportunity
In order to provide access to everyone 
in society, especially those in rural areas 
and low-income households, Companies 
are making huge investments in digital 
Infrastructure 
and 
programmes 
that 
aim to narrow the digital divide. As more 
companies across various sectors have 
started using cloud-based services, the 
cloud communication market in India is 
expanding quickly. This creates various 
opportunities for RML.
NA
 Positive:
With Digital 
inclusion and 
rapidly growing 
market several 
opportunities are 
created.
7.
Digital 
Identity
Opportunity
To avoid income loss, enterprises must be 
prepared to resist identity theft in real-
time. Additionally, it's critical to protect 
clients from fraud and inconveniences by 
adding an additional degree of security to 
their online experience.
NA
Positive:
TruSense – A 
product launched 
by the Company 
ensures secure 
authentication, 
reliable identity 
verification and 
intelligent fraud 
detection with a 
frictionless user 
experience
8.
Data 
privacy and 
Regulatory 
compliance
Risk
As we process data, we may be exposed 
to privacy breach claims. Further various 
countries have regulatory authorities for 
e.g., TRAI in India. These authorities define 
rules of the game for CPaaS players and 
changes to these regulatory requirements 
could affect business potential.
Privacy policy, 
Employee 
Training, 
Robust 
Compliance 
programme, 
Audit 
Negative: 
Claims under 
privacy laws in 
jurisdictions 
where we 
operate. 
There’s an 
element of 
increased cost 
to hire privacy 
professionals 
in different 
jurisdictions.
9. 
Cyber security 
Threats
Risk
Increasing cyber threats can compromise 
data and operations, therefore mitigating 
cybersecurity risks is essential to protect 
company data and operations.
Invest in 
and deploy 
advanced 
cybersecurity 
tools and 
measures, 
regular 
security audits, 
employee 
training
Negative: 
Potential financial 
loss from data 
breaches and 
recovery costs.
10. Customer 
Retention & 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
High levels of customer satisfaction lead 
to better retention rates and increased 
revenue. 
Implement 
customer 
feedback 
systems, 
improve service 
quality, provide 
excellent 
customer 
support
Positive: Increased 
customer loyalty 
and revenue
11. Supply Chain 
Disruptions 
(MNO’s and 
Infra vendors)
Risk
Global events can disrupt the supply chain 
and affect service delivery. Any disruptions 
in our telecom partner operations or 
hardware vendors, affect our ability to 
deliver quality services
Enhance our 
diversified pool 
of suppliers 
and super 
network of 
operator 
connects 
Negative: 
Potential delays 
and increased 
costs

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases. 
The Company has a comprehensive framework in place to protect individuals who come forward with 
complaints of discrimination or harassment, as reflected in our Whistle-blower and POSH policies.
Our Whistle-blower Policy encourages all employees to voice concerns regarding human rights 
violations, improper conduct, or any unethical activities within the company. We assure our employees 
that any such reports made in good faith will be treated with utmost confidentiality and respect. 
Importantly, we have a strict non-retaliation clause embedded in this policy, which strictly prohibits 
any form of retaliatory action against individuals who report such incidents. We have designated a 
Competent Authority to handle these complaints, ensuring that they are addressed professionally 
and appropriately.
Similarly, our POSH policy is designed to prevent and address sexual harassment in the workplace. We are 
committed to providing a safe and inclusive working environment for all our employees. If an employee 
or job applicant chooses to exercise their right to make a complaint under this policy, we guarantee 
that they will be protected from any form of retaliation. This is part of our commitment to fostering a 
respectful and dignified work environment for all.
We regularly reinforce these policies and their protections during mandatory training sessions, ensuring 
that every member of our team understands their rights and the company's commitment to uphold 
them. We also continually review and update our policies in accordance with evolving laws and societal 
standards to make sure we are providing the best possible protections for our employees.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts?
Yes. Our commitment to upholding human rights extends not just to our own operations, but also to 
our business relationships. As such, we have incorporated human rights requirements into our business 
agreements and contracts.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct, which forms a standard clause in all our contracts, explicitly outlines our 
human rights expectations. Our major suppliers, including those providing IT support, staffing solutions, 
facility management, and security services, are bound by this Code. This is especially significant for those 
suppliers that employ individuals from more vulnerable demographics with lower literacy levels.
We make every effort to ensure our partners are well-informed about our Supplier Code of Conduct and 
the human rights requirements it entails. We emphasise the importance of these standards not only 
in initial contract negotiations but also in our ongoing business relationships. Our partners' adherence 
to these standards is a key component of our decision-making when selecting and retaining suppliers.
Furthermore, we monitor compliance with these standards regularly and take necessary action in the 
event of non-compliance. This diligent approach is part of our commitment to promote human rights 
across our business ecosystem and to contribute positively to all communities we interact with.

At Route Mobile, our value chain primarily consists of large telecom partners 
who are recognised for their robust policy frameworks that uphold ethical 
corporate behaviour in accordance with international benchmark practices. 
This ensures that the vast majority of our value chain is governed by stringent 
ethical standards, reflecting our own commitment to corporate responsibility 
and integrity.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is a crucial component of our contractual 
relationships, underpinning our interactions with all our partners, suppliers, 
and vendors. It's not just a document; it's a commitment that forms a standard 
clause in all our contracts, reinforcing our collective responsibility to uphold 
ethical practices.
While we trust in our partners' established policy architecture, we also believe 
in proactive measures to ensure compliance. Therefore, we are taking steps 
towards assessing the adherence of our value chain partners to our Supplier 
Code of Conduct, thus further ensuring that our commitment to ethical 
practices is consistently upheld across our entire value chain.

caused by unexpected situations like accidents, fire, sabotage, spills, explosions, natural disasters, 
terrorist activities and medical emergencies. It includes a series of actions to be taken in the case of such 
emergencies. It shows the preventive actions, preparation to meet adverse situations, how to mitigate
