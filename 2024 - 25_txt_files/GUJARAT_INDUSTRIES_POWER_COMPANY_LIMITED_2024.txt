heat waves
Risk
Increase in temperature 
and prolonged heat 
waves may create 
unsafe environment 
and cause health & 
safety risks for the 
workforce
The risk is minimised as most 
of the mining operations are 
mechanised with minimal 
human tasks in the open 
environment. All equipment/
machinery being operated 
have air conditioned cabins.
In case of power generation 
operations, the Company 
maintains infrastructure to 
reduce impact of extreme 
heat. Adequate sheds are also 
installed to provide places 
for workers to rest and for 
protection from outside heat.

enable diversification in case of 
water scarcity. It also maintains 
reservoir with upto 5 days 
worth of water requirements in 
case of emergency.Additionally,

ground water around Bodhan 
and Patan as a standy source 
of water.Due to all this, the 
risk of disruption due to water 
scarcity is minimal.

in particular low wind speed 
which is becoming more 
common across India.The 
Company’s solar and wind 
assets have defence mechanism 
(barriers, etc.) to prevent any 
impact from floods.

Fly ash is the key waste generated as part of the electricity generation from thermal sources. There are procedures in place where 
the Company captures 100% of the fly ash generated which is then onward sold to the companies in real estate sectors for use 
in producing green cement / concrete mix. 
 
The Company does not generate any other hazardous or toxic waste as part of its operations.
 
The Company continues to win awards at pan-India level for its fly ash management processes being implemented across its 
plant locations.
