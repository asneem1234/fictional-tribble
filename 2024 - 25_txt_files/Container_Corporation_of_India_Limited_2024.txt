Opportunity 
Risk: The absence of a comprehensive 
Human Rights governance structure 
from the aspects of parameters such as 
working conditions, fair remuneration,

Opportunity: The presence of a strong 
redressal 
mechanism 
outlines 
the 
Company’s commitment to Human 
Rights protection. A better organized 
and more respected workforce is more

5 Specific commitments, 
goals and targets set by 
the entity with defined 
timelines, if any. 
In the near future, the Company will adopt a focused approach to achieving the following objectives: 
• 
Enhance the share of rail in container transportation. 
• 
Encourage eco-friendly road transportation through the use of LNG. 
• 
Replace existing lighting systems with energy-efficient LED lights. 
• 
Strive to procure electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind energy. 
• 
Promote the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems. 
• 
Achieve energy conservation through the efficient use of equipments. 
 
6 Performance of the 
entity against the 
specific commitments, 
goals and targets along-
with reasons in case the 
same are not met. 
Some of the key initiatives undertaken during the year on the ESG front are as follows: 
• In line with our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals, we are actively transitioning toward low-emission transportation 
solutions to reduce our carbon footprint and drive sustainable logistics practices. 
• As part of this initiative, 130 trucks have been inducted into our fleet—75 commissioned in FY 2023–24 and 55 in FY 2024–25—
marking a major step toward fleet modernization. 
• To further accelerate our decarbonization efforts, we have placed orders for 100 LNG trucks (i.e. 50 each LNG Trucks with M/s Blue 
Energy Commercial Vehicles Pvt. Ltd. & M/s Tata Motors Ltd.) 
• Our first LNG station has been commissioned at Khatuwas terminal, enabling immediate support for the new fleet & another LNG station 
is planned in FY 2025-26 at ICD Dadri, ensuring wider network coverage and operational reliability. 
• In line with its efforts to reduce emissions from cargo handling operations, CONCOR is planning to acquire 5 Electric Reach Stackers. 
These energy-efficient, zero-emission machines will significantly cut down diesel usage and contribute to quieter, cleaner terminal 
environments. 
• CONCOR has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) for setting up of 
“CONCOR-TERI Centre of Excellence for Green and Sustainable Logistics”. 
• CONCOR has placed a Notification of Award (NOA) with M/s REMC Ltd (Joint Venture of Ministry of Railways and Rites Ltd) on 
04.04.2025 to install rooftop solar power systems at CONCOR Multi-Modal Logistic Park/Barhi/Haryana and Corporate Office/New 
Delhi. This initiative directly contributes to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and increasing the share of clean energy in our 
operations.

and operational requirements by adhering to the Five R’s of Procurement: Right Quality, Right 
Quantity, Right Price, Right Time & Place, and Right Source.

the cost estimates. As per the established procedures detailed in the relevant manuals and the 
Delegation of Powers (DOP), Tender/Quotation Opening and Evaluation Committees are formed. 
These committees include representatives from the user department, finance, and other relevant 
departments. The DOP is duly approved by the Board of Directors of CONCOR. 
 
Bids from prospective suppliers are invited through a transparent process that promotes broad-based 
competition. The Company employs various procurement methods including open tenders, limited 
tenders, procurement from an approved panel of suppliers, single tenders for proprietary or critical 
items with a single source, and direct procurement through a designated purchase committee. 
 
Procurement-related risks are managed within a structured risk management framework. This involves
