GHG 
Emissions
Risk 
Mining 
operations 
are 
inherently 
energy-intensive 
and are a notable source of 
direct greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, particularly carbon 
dioxide, due to the extensive 
use of fossil fuels in excavation, 
processing, 
and 
associated 
activities. With the escalating 
frequency 
and 
intensity 
of 
climate-related events, climate 
change has emerged as a 
critical global concern, posing 
substantial 
operational 
and 
reputational risks to the mining 
sector.
To 
mitigate 
risks 
associated 
with 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, 
the 
Company places a strong emphasis on 
GHG reduction and energy efficiency 
through the adoption of environmentally 
responsible technologies. The Company 
uses low-sulfur coal in order to curb 
GHG emissions. In line with its long-
term sustainability vision, the Company 
has set an ambitious target to achieve 
net-zero emissions by 2050 and is 
proactively advancing toward this goal.

Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Safety is of utmost importance 
in 
mining 
operations 
due 
to 
the 
hazardous 
working 
environments often encountered. 
The mining sector, in particular, 
experiences 
higher 
rates 
of 
fatalities compared to other 
industries, with risks arising 
from factors such as powered 
haulage, machinery operation, 
and mine structural integrity. 
Poor health and safety records 
not only put workers at risk but 
also expose the company to 
fines, penalties, and increased 
regulatory scrutiny, leading to 
higher compliance costs.
Ensuring a safe work environment 
for 
employees 
is 
a 
fundamental 
responsibility. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
commitment, the Company consistently 
strives to provide and maintain safe 
premises, machinery, systems, and 
processes across its operational sites. 
With its open-cast surface mining 
operations, 
the 
Company 
takes 
proactive measures to significantly 
minimize associated risks.

Waste 
& Haz-
ardous 
Materials 
Manage-
ment 
Risk
The mining sector generates 
significant 
amounts 
of 
both 
mineral and non-mineral waste, 
and industrial waste. Some of 
these materials may contain 
toxic, hazardous, or chemically 
reactive substances. Additionally, 
mineral processing often involves 
the use of hazardous materials 
for metal extraction, which can 
pose risks to life and health. 
Improper disposal or storage of 
hazardous materials or mining 
waste presents a serious long-
term risk to human health 
and 
ecosystems, 
potentially 
contaminating groundwater or 
surface water used for drinking 
or agriculture, as well as causing 
land contamination.
Depending on the nature of the waste, 
materials generated during mining 
operations are either treated, disposed 
of, or stored, either on-site or off-site, 
typically in impoundments or disused 
mine pits. The Company ensures 
proper waste disposal practices are 
in place at all operational levels. 
Furthermore, none of the Company’s 
operations generate materials such 
as sludge or slags. The overburden is 
responsibly managed by using it for 
backfilling the mines, contributing to 
sustainable mining practices.

Air 
Quality 
Risk
The mining sector generates 
non-greenhouse gas (GHG) 
air emissions and ambient 
air pollutants that can have 
significant localized impacts 
on both human health and the 
environment. Depending on the 
type of metal being mined, key 
pollutants include sulfur dioxide, 
lead, mercury, cadmium, 
arsenic, and particulate 
matter. The release of these 
emissions—such as sulfur oxides 
(SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
suspended particulate matter 
(SPM), and particulate matter—
poses health risks and potential 
life hazards to stakeholders 
both inside and outside 
the Company's operational 
premises.
To address the risks associated with 
air pollution, the Company takes 
proactive steps to monitor and manage 
its emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), and suspended 
particulate matter (SPM) and has 
installed twin bag filters, and cyclone 
separators to curb emissions. These 
emissions 
are 
regularly

Risk
As a highly regulated 
industry, the mining sector is 
subject to frequent revisions 
and increasingly stringent 
environmental and operational 
regulations. These changes 
present a risk of non-
compliance, which could impact 
the Company's activities and 
operations if not meticulously 
managed.
The 
Company 
has 
established 
a 
comprehensive 
compliance 
management 
framework, 
which 
is 
consistently updated to align with 
evolving regulations. This framework is 
fully integrated with business processes, 
risk 
management, 
and 
controls. 
Any 
changes 
in 
regulations 
are 
promptly monitored and incorporated 
into the Compliance Management 
System, ensuring that the Company's 
governance mechanisms remain robust 
and effective.

At Ashapura Minechem Limited, our commitment to Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles is a fundamental part of our 
strategy and day-to-day operations. ESG is not a box to be checked but a responsibility that we carry with sincerity and foresight.
We understand the environmental challenges associated with mining and remain focused on reducing our ecological impact through 
efficient resource utilization, strong waste management practices, and sustained efforts in land rehabilitation. Our goal is to reach net-
zero emissions by the year 2050. We have begun this journey by identifying our indirect emission sources and supporting carbon offset 
initiatives to ensure meaningful progress.
On the social front, the welfare and safety of our employees and the communities we serve continue to be our priority. We have created 
a workplace culture that promotes inclusivity, ethical conduct, and mutual respect. Our initiatives reflect a belief that people are the 
foundation of long-term sustainability.
From a governance perspective, we have built a robust framework that emphasizes integrity, transparency, and responsible leadership. 
We are mindful that strong governance is key to maintaining trust and credibility across all stakeholders.
Through a combination of innovation, technology, and principled leadership, we remain committed to delivering outcomes that align with 
our ESG goals while contributing to a better and more sustainable future for all.

The Company’s investment in research and development is driving innovation, 
improving processes, and creating products that support sustainability and deliver 
positive social impact. Considerable efforts have been undertaken to meet energy 
goals, including the adoption of solar power generation and the installation of 
power-saving systems. These initiatives combine efficient lighting solutions such as 
LED lights and motion sensors with optimized air-cooling systems, natural ventilation 
fans, and measures to improve power factors through the use of static capacitors and 
synchronous condensers.
In water management, the Company follows an integrated and sustainable approach. 
This includes drip irrigation for plantations, wastewater treatment for reuse and 
recycling, and gravity-based water filtration systems for pre-treating bore or well 
water before RO filtration. The treated water is then distributed within the premises, 
significantly contributing to plant and tree growth.
Ethical business practices are reinforced through a multi-pronged strategy that 
emphasizes rigorous testing, adherence to established standards, and an unwavering 
commitment to safety and quality. This approach includes the implementation of 
standard work practices, achievement of NABL accreditation, adherence to robust 
safety protocols, and the application of the 5S methodology to ensure operational 
excellence.

The Company has instituted structured processes to ensure the safe reclamation, reuse, recycling, and disposal of its products and waste
streams. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are in place, assigning responsibility to respective departments for proper disposal through
authorized vendors. Oversized, undersized, or rejected materials are crushed and reintroduced into the production cycle. The Company also
undertakes research initiatives to explore the reuse of mineral waste in the manufacture of ceramic products. At the plant level, certain waste
materials are converted into fertilizers for beneficial reuse. Segregation of waste at the source into wet and dry categories is enforced across
facilities, with clearly marked bins placed at strategic locations for efficient collection and management.

Yes, a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system has been implemented at the Ashapura Perfoclay Limited’s Bleaching Clay Unit (APL - Bleaching Clay).
The facility operates a comprehensive wastewater treatment and recycling process designed to eliminate any liquid effluent discharge. The system 
includes neutralization of acidic wastewater, followed by lime-soda softening, coagulation, flocculation, and clarification to remove suspended
solids and hardness. Post-clarification, the water undergoes sand filtration and ultrafiltration to eliminate finer particles and microorganisms.
A two-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) system is then used to extract clean water from the effluent. The RO permeate is reused within the plant for
operations such as industrial processing and gardening, while the RO reject is processed through a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) to recover
additional water and reduce waste volume. This setup ensures that nearly all wastewater is treated and reused within the unit, enabling full
compliance with ZLD principles and significantly reducing reliance on freshwater sources.
At Ashapura Minechem Limited’s Kaolin Unit (AML – Kaolin), operations follow a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) approach. No chemicals are used
during any stage of the process, ensuring that the water remains uncontaminated. After passing through a filter press, the water is fully recovered 
and reused within the system. This approach supports sustainable water management and helps minimize environmental impact.
At the Ashapura Minechem Limited’s Dapoli Unit (AML – Dapoli), no water is discharged from mine pits or production activities. The mining
operations do not intersect with the groundwater table, as bauxite is available at shallow depths. Water is sourced from nearby villages through
tankers and is used solely for dust suppression within the mine area and on haulage roads. Since all the water is utilized in these activities and
there is no water used in the production process, the operations result in negligible discharge.

Yes, at Ashapura Minechem Limited’s Kaolin Unit (AML - Kaolin), a project has been implemented to reduce fuel consumption as part of efforts
to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The conventional methods used for drying and conveying materials have been replaced with a more
sustainable, energy-efficient process. This transition has led to a notable decrease in fuel usage, contributing to the reduction of GHG emissions
from operations.
In addition, Ashapura Perfoclay Limited’s Bleaching Clay Unit (APL - Bleaching Clay) has implemented multiple initiatives to further its climate
action efforts. A major initiative is the development of a green belt across an area of 57,166.09 m², which includes the plantation of 12,476
trees within the premises and several thousand more in nearby areas such as Mangal Mandir, Vankal Mata Mandir, Gir Gaudham, and Lakhond
Village. This contributes to increased carbon sequestration, reduced ambient temperatures, and enhancement of local biodiversity.
Furthermore, APL’s Bleaching Clay Unit (APL - Bleaching Clay) has also transitioned to the use of De-Oiled Cake (DOC), a carbon-neutral
biofuel, in its boilers, replacing a portion of coal usage. This shift has helped in reducing carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions, while
also supporting a circular economy through the reuse of agro-industry by-products.
AIL’s Hamala Unit (AIL - Hamala) has undertaken a plantation initiative involving the planting of over 500 trees, including 300 near the
entrance gate and 200 around the office area. This effort contributes to enhancing green cover, supporting carbon sequestration, and promoting 
environmental sustainability, thereby helping to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions.

Waste management at Ashapura Minechem Limited (Ashapura Group) involves a comprehensive process that includes the identification, collection, 
transport, processing, recycling, and monitoring of waste materials. Primarily focused on Ashapura follows a structured and comprehensive
approach to waste management, encompassing the identification, collection, transportation, processing, recycling, and monitoring of waste
materials. The process primarily addresses waste generated from operational activities, with a strong emphasis on minimizing adverse
environmental and health impacts. Waste is classified into categories such as hazardous, non-hazardous, food, and biomedical waste—each
requiring specific protocols for handling and disposal. Hazardous waste, in particular, is managed with stringent controls, including reference to
Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) to ensure safety and compliance.
Waste segregation begins at the source, facilitated through the use of clearly color-coded bins: blue for non-biodegradable waste, green
for biodegradable waste, and yellow for hazardous waste. These bins are strategically placed across facilities to optimize collection. Post-
collection, waste is further segregated into streams such as general waste, metal, wood, paper, and others to enable efficient and responsible
disposal. Designated storage areas—including secure, covered zones for hazardous waste—help prevent contamination and ensure regulatory
compliance.
The company actively promotes the principles of reuse and recycling. Materials like plastic, metal, wood, and paper are either reused internally or 
handed over to authorized recyclers. Detailed records of waste generation and disposal are maintained to enhance traceability and governance.
Disposal practices are tailored to the nature of the waste—biodegradable waste is collected by municipal bodies, while hazardous and electronic
waste is managed through certified external agencies. This integrated waste management framework is aimed at reducing environmental impact 
and reinforcing Ashapura’s commitment to sustainability.

Spent Acid 
Recycling (APL - 
Bleaching Clay)
A total of 7,616 metric tonnes of spent acid has been sent to Indian 
Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) for reuse as a raw material 
in fertilizer manufacturing. 
The initiative has eliminated the need 
for hazardous waste disposal and 
supported the conservation of virgin 
raw materials. It has also contributed 
to circular economy principles in the 
fertilizer sector.
10
Installation of 
Wet Scrubbers 
and CEMS (APL -

Operating primarily within the B2B domain, the Company has instituted a streamlined and highly responsive mechanism for addressing customer 
grievances, which, though rare, are treated with the utmost urgency. Any issue raised by a client is immediately escalated through designated
marketing channels and directed to the appropriate internal teams—be it logistics, quality assurance, or production—depending on the specific
nature of the concern. The grievance redressal process is both structured and proactive, often involving measures such as retrieval of product
samples, detailed batch testing at the mine or factory level, and, where necessary, the deployment of technical experts to the client’s site. These
protocols reflect the Company’s unwavering commitment to operational excellence and a service ethos centred on prompt, effective resolution.
