1
Climate change
Opportunity
Climate 
change 
allows 
REC 
to 
diversify its loan portfolio, improve 
the quality of assets in the long term 
and tap new types of capital like 
green bonds - and sustainability-
linked instruments. REC can be an 
important force for funding next-
generation infrastructure such as 
green ammonia, carbon capture and 
smart grids. It provides a strategic 
window for diminishing risk from 
carbon-intensive 
exposures 
and 
creating a stable, future-proof loan 
portfolio. By driving green financing 
forward, REC can access low-cost 
ESG capital, get ahead of regulatory 
requirements 
and 
reinforce 
its 
position in India’s clean energy 
transformation-converting a global 
risk into a competitive strength.
 -
Positive: 
Embracing 
green finance, REC 
can diversify its loan 
portfolio, 
reduce 
carbon risk and access 
low-cost ESG capital. 
This 
positions 
REC 
to fund future-ready 
infrastructure, 
meet 
regulatory demands 
and lead India’s clean 
energy 
transition-
turning 
climate 
risk into a strategic 
advantage.

India’s ambitious climate targets, 
create a massive, expanding market 
for 
green 
and 
energy-efficient 
financing. REC, as a leading power 
sector financier, is ideally positioned 
to capture a substantial share of this 
growth.
-
Positive: Boosts REC’s 
financial 
health 
by 
enabling 
substantial 
loan 
book 
growth 
in 
high-demand 
green 
sectors 
and 
diversifying its funding 
through 
access 
to 
cheaper, 
specialized 
green capital markets. 
This 
also 
improves 
asset 
quality 
by 
financing 
resilient 
projects, leading to 
reduced 
NPAs 
and 
enhanced long-term 
profitability.
3

Development
Opportunity

engagement 
and 
development 
can 
impact 
the 
company’s 
social 
license 
to 
operate, reputation and long-term 
sustainability. By engaging with local 
communities, REC fosters positive 
relationships, address community 
concerns and promote economic 
development, 
enhancing 
project 
acceptance and minimizing social 
risks.

Customer 
satisfaction
Opportunity
Customer 
satisfaction 
is 
a 
fundamental driver of REC reputation, 
market position and bottom line. 
In a competitive and changing 
infrastructure finance environment, 
responsiveness, transparency and 
service quality are essential to 
institutional client retention and 
new client acquisition. Customer 
relationship building is not merely 
a matter of service delivery, it has 
a direct effect on deal continuity, 
portfolio stability and long-term 
client 
trust. 
By 
incorporating 
customer-focused practices within 
its operations, REC promotes loyalty, 
minimizes friction in project cycles 
and supports its position as a trusted 
financial partner in the power and 
infrastructure markets.
-

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Diversity and inclusion are not 
only corporate values, but strategic 
assets that have a direct impact on 
organizational 
performance 
and 
resilience. For REC, building a diverse 
employee base ensures access to a 
broader range of views, skills and 
experiences and this makes for 
greater innovation and decision-
making. Inclusion extends beyond 
representation; it leads to employees 
at all levels feeling empowered, 
respected and engaged. This results 
in better collaboration, increased 
productivity and lower attrition. As 
REC is operating in an increasingly 
fast-changing 
business 
climate, 
integrating diversity and inclusion in 
the culture is key to capturing best 
talent, catalysing adaptive thinking 
and 
sustaining 
a 
competitive 
advantage.
- 
Positive: 
Integrating 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
into 
REC 
culture opens access 
to a broader talent 
pool, which fosters 
innovation 
and 
enhances 
decision-
making 
through 
diverse perspectives. 
It 
promotes 
higher 
employee 
e n g a g e m e n t , 
reduces 
attrition 
and 
strengthens 
brand 
reputation, 
making REC a more 
attractive 
and 
trusted employer. By 
prioritizing diversity, 
REC 
improves 
collaboration 
and 
ensures adaptability 
and 
resilience 
in 
the face of a rapidly 
changing 
business 
e n v i r o n m e n t , 
ultimately securing a 
sustained competitive 
advantage.
6
Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
Human capital is a core driver of 
REC's long-term performance and 
institutional 
resilience. 
A 
firm’s 
ability to attract, retain and build 
talent directly impacts operational 
effectiveness, innovation and service 
delivery. A high-performing engaged 
workforce is not an accident of good 
culture, it is an intended consequence 
of strategic investments in employees’ 
wellbeing, capability development 
and inclusive leadership. Mental and 
physical well-being support initiatives 
minimize absenteeism and turnover 
and 
targeted 
training 
enables 
staff to change to meet changing 
industry needs. Aligning workforce 
development 
with 
business 
objectives 
not 
only 
enhances 
productivity but also ensures that 
REC’s human capital continues to be a 
primary driver of sustainable growth 
and competitiveness.
- 
Positive: 
REC’s 
investment 
in 
human capital is a 
strategic 
move 
to 
stay competitive in 
a 
rapidly 
evolving 
industry. 
Upskilling 
ensures a future-ready 
workforce, while well-
being initiatives and 
inclusive 
leadership 
drive 
productivity

Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
Sustainable procurement is a key 
strategic tool for REC in managing 
environmental 
and 
social 
risks 
intrinsic to its value chain. Embedding 
ESG factors in purchasing decisions, 
REC can ensure compliance with 
responsible 
standards 
among 
vendors and service providers to lower 
exposure to compliance, reputation 
and operations risks. Additionally, by 
embracing preferential procurement 
strategies in favour of MSMEs and 
disadvantaged business segments, 
REC not only promotes economic 
inclusion, but it also establishes viable 
local supply chains. Such a strategy 
strengthens 
stakeholder 
trust, 
facilitates 
regulatory 
compliance 
and generates long-term shared 
value-making REC a responsible and 
forward-looking institution.
 
Positive: 
REC’s 
s u s t a i n a b l e 
p r o c u r e m e n t 
strategy 
mitigates 
environmental 
and 
social risks, ensures 
regulatory alignment 
and 
minimizes 
r e p u t a t i o n a l 
and 
operational 
vulnerabilities. 
By 
integrating 
ESG 
criteria and leveraging 
preferential sourcing 
from 
MSMEs 
and 
underrepresented 
sectors, REC enhances 
supply 
chain 
resilience, 
fosters 
inclusive growth and 
generates long-term 
stakeholder value.
8
Digital 
Transformation 
and Innovation
Opportunity
Digitalization is a key driver for REC to 
promote efficiency, enhance delivery 
of services and compete effectively 
in an evolving infrastructure finance 
landscape. 
Adopting 
technology 
allows 
for 
more 
streamlined 
operations, 
quicker 
decision-
making and a more individualized 
customer 
experience. 
Innovation 
enhances REC’s resilience to change 
in borrower needs, regulation and 
market disruption. It also opens 
up the possibility of creating new 
financing schemes and enhancing 
risk management. Through investing 
in digital capacities, REC not only 
enhances operational resilience but 
also strengthens its position as a 
forward-thinking, modern institution 
within sustainable finance.
Positive: 
For 
REC, 
d i g i t a l i z a t i o n 
will 
streamline 
operations, enhance 
customer service and 
boost 
profitability. 
With 
automation 
and 
analytics, 
IT 
systems will improve 
loan 
origination, 
u n d e r w r i t i n g , 
c o l l e c t i o n s 
and 
customer

driving 
efficiency 
and 
reducing costs. This 
will strengthen REC’s 
competitive position 
and ensure smoother, 
more 
responsive 
services.
9
Economic 
Development
Opportunity
Economic development presents a 
significant opportunity for REC by 
driving demand for infrastructure, 
particularly in the power sector. 
As India grows, increased energy 
consumption and industrialization 
necessitate 
more 
generation, 
transmission 
and 
distribution 
projects, directly expanding REC’s 
financing avenues. Furthermore, the 
Government’s focus on sustainable 
and 
inclusive 
growth 
creates 
demand for smart grids and rural 
electrification, solidifying REC’s role 
as a key financial enabler of national 
progress. 
Positive: 
 
This 
opportunity directly 
leads to loan book 
growth and stronger 
financial performance 
due 
to 
increased 
demand for REC’s core 
financing services in a 
growing economy.

Sustainable 
Finance
Opportunity
Encouraging 
sustainable 
finance 
tools, like green loans and bonds, 
provides REC with a strong vehicle 
for linking capital to climate and 
development 
priorities. 
Through 
its Green Bond Framework, REC 
directs financing toward high-impact 
sectors of renewable energy, energy 
efficiency, 
clean 
transportation 
and 
pollution 
control, 
enabling 
both national climate objectives as 
well as sustainable infrastructure 
development. These tools not only 
broaden REC’s capital base but 
also improve access to global ESG 
capital at competitive prices. Most 
importantly, having a larger portfolio 
of 
sustainability 
linked 
financial 
products enables REC to go beyond 
compliance and proactively take 
the lead in financing the green shift, 
giving environmental and social 
value as well as robust financial 
returns.
- 
Positive: 
Stronger 
alignment 
with 
climate 
and 
development 
goals, 
broader 
access 
to 
global 
ESG 
capital 
and a leading role 
in 
sustainable 
i n f r a s t r u c t u r e 
financing. 
By 
leveraging 
green 
finance 
tools, 
REC 
enhances its financial 
strength, 
supports 
national 
climate 
initiatives and delivers 
both social impact 
and 
solid 
financial 
returns.
11
Responsible 
Lending
Opportunity
Incorporating 
ESG 
considerations 
into lending provides REC with 
a competitive advantage in risk 
management 
and 
stakeholder 
alignment. 
Investors, 
regulators, 
communities 
and 
partners 
increasingly expect lenders to take 
long-term environmental and social 
considerations into account. Credit 
decisions that are informed by ESG 
enable REC to identify risks such as 
regulatory change, environmental 
expenditure, 
or 
local 
resistance 
earlier, lowering the risk of delays, 
losses and reputational damage. This 
strategy not only enhances portfolio 
robustness but also enhances REC’s 
reputation as a socially responsible 
lender, 
in 
accordance 
with 
international sustainability objectives 
and appealing to impact-driven 
capital.
- 
Positive: 
Improved 
risk 
management, 
enhanced 
portfolio 
resilience 
and 
a 
stronger 
reputation 
as 
a 
socially 
responsible 
lender. 
By integrating ESG 
considerations 
into 
lending, REC gains 
a competitive edge, 
aligns 
with 
global 
sustainability 
goals 
and attracts impact-
driven capital while 
minimizing potential 
project delays, losses 
and reputational risks.

ESMS 
(Environmental

ESMS 
allows 
the 
Company 
to 
mainstream 
sustainability 
in 
its lending process so that the 
projects it finances with REC meet 
national 
regulatory 
requirements 
and international best practices 
in 
environmental 
and 
social 
governance. The ESMS is indicative 
of REC’s responsibility towards its 
financing and promoting inclusive 
and 
sustainable 
infrastructure 
development.
Positive: 
Enables 
REC 
to 
embed 
sustainability 
into 
its 
core 
lending 
practices, 
ensuring 
that financed projects 
comply 
with 
both 
national regulations

global 
ESG 
standards. 
This 
strengthens 
REC’s 
commitment 
to

14
Climate change
Risk
Climate 
change 
introduces 
physical 
risks 
(floods, 
droughts, 
cyclones), transition risks (carbon 
tax, clean energy standards) and 
reputational risks associated with 
ESG expectations. These have the 
potential to interrupt projects, raise 
credit risk and affect REC’s ability to 
access capital. REC is responding to 
this by incorporating climate risk 
into project appraisals, matching 
regulatory requirements and green 
financing upscaling.
REC is advancing its ESG 
Journey 
and 
integrated 
E&S assessment in the loan 
appraisal process of private 
borrowers. We are in the 
process of aligning disclosures 
with draft RBI’s framework 
on Climate-related Financial 
Risks. 
REC aims to expand its clean 
energy portfolio underscoring 
its commitment to India's 
energy 
transition. 
In 
the 
financial year 2024-25, the 
Company has achieved a YoY 
growth of renewable loan 
book by 49% and renewable 
disbursements 
by 
63% 
which is the testimony of our 
commitment.
Negative: 
Potential 
possibility of asset 
stranding 
due 
to 
climate risk.
15
Operational 
eco-efficiency
Risk
As a major financier in India’s 
power 
sector, 
REC’s 
financial 
health and reputation are tied to 
the 
environmental 
performance 
of the projects it funds. Poor eco-
efficiency in financed assets can lead 
to reputational damage, increased 
regulatory 
scrutiny, 
potential 
stranded assets and limited access to 
green finance.
To mitigate this, REC has 
adopted a comprehensive ESG 
Policy guiding its investments 
and operations. This policy 
enhances ESG due diligence 
in project appraisal, prioritizes 
funding for renewable and 
energy-efficient 
projects 
and develops green financial 
products. 
It also builds internal capacity 
and 
promotes 
borrower 
awareness 
of 
eco-efficient 
technologies, 
ensuring 
sustainable 
growth 
and

with 
national 
environmental goals.

Data Privacy 
and 
Cyber Security
Risk
As a PSU with sensitive financial 
and 
project-related 
information, 
REC has huge risks in case of breach 
of data privacy and cybersecurity. 
Any cyberattack or data breach may 
cripple operations, invite regulatory 
penalties 
and 
dent 
stakeholder 
trust. As there is more and more 
digitalization taking place, the threat 
level is also on the rise, so it becomes 
critical 
to 
implement 
stringent 
security protocols and adhere to 
regulations. Neglecting it, risks not 
only the continuity of business but 
also invalidates REC’s credibility and 
accountability as a public sector 
organization.
REC, 
as 
a 
prominent 
Government 
of 
India 
Company, 
prioritizes 
Data 
Privacy 
and 
Cybersecurity 
with utmost diligence to 
protect sensitive information 
and 
maintain 
operational 
resilience.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
a 
robust 
Information 
Security 
Management System (ISMS) 
to ensure the confidentiality, 
integrity 
and 
availability 
of 
its 
information 
assets, 
aligning 
with 
national 
cybersecurity 
frameworks 
and global best practices. 
Led by its Chief Information 
Security Officer (CISO), REC 
actively promotes a culture 
of cybersecurity awareness 
through continuous trainings, 
informative sessions, internal 
messages, 
social 
media 
campaigns and even desktop 
wallpapers. 
This commitment is further 
solidified by a comprehensive

Corporate 
Governance 
and 
Business Ethics
Risk
For REC, poor corporate governance 
and ethical misconduct are not only 
reputational risks-they are systemic 
risks that can compromise strategic 
decision-making, investor confidence 
and long-term value creation. In the 
current regulatory climate any case 
of corruption or non-compliance 
can lead to legal sanctions and 
damage stakeholder trust. Moreover, 
without 
robust 
governance 
ingrained at all levels, there is a 
danger of misalignment between 
corporate behaviour and stakeholder 
expectations. Thus, a culture of 
accountability and integrity is not 
a luxury, it is a necessity for REC’s 
sustainable development.
REC’s corporate governance 
framework is a cornerstone 
of its operations, reflecting 
its status as a Government of 
India company.
The 
Company 
adheres 
rigorously to the Guidelines 
on 
Corporate 
Governance 
for 
Central 
Public 
Sector 
Enterprises 
(CPSEs) 
issued 
by the Department of Public 
Enterprises (DPE), alongside 
the Companies Act, 2013 and 
SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. 
Furthermore, the vigilance 
division of REC functions 
independently 
under 
the 
Central Vigilance Commission, 
ensuring vigilance activities 
as per CVC Guidelines. This 
commitment to transparent, 
accountable 
and 
ethical 
practices, overseen by a Board 
with Government nominated 
Directors, builds trust among 
all stakeholders and ensures 
the 
company’s 
long-term 
sustainability 
as 
a 
public 
entity.
Negative: 
Potential 
fines/ 
penalties 
in 
case of violations.
18
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
REC, being a government-owned 
enterprise, is under strict legal and 
regulatory compliance. Failure to 
comply with respective laws, financial 
regulations, or industry regulations 
can subject the company to penalties, 
lawsuits and business losses. Aside 
from 
fiscal 
impacts, 
regulatory 
violations can substantially erode 
REC’s reputation as a credible and 
compliant 
organization. 
Within 
a strongly regulated ecosystem, 
stringent compliance is not just 
legally required but strategically 
imperative-vital 
to 
maintaining 
stakeholder 
trust, 
guaranteeing 
smooth operations and ensuring 
REC’s future growth and credibility.
As a Central Public Sector 
Enterprise 
(CPSE) 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Power, 
Government of India, REC's 
approach to regulatory risk is 
intrinsically linked to its public 
mandate. It maintains a highly 
vigilant compliance division 
that 
proactively 
monitors 
all governmental directives, 
policies 
and 
statutory 
changes from entities like the 
Ministry of Power, RBI and 
SEBI. This ensures not only 
strict adherence to extant 
regulations but also agile 
adaptation to new norms, 
safeguarding its critical role 
in 
national 
power 
sector 
development and financial 
stability.

Risk
Risk 
Management 
involves

By effectively managing risks, REC 
can safeguard financial stability, 
reputation and long-term viability.
Implementing 
robust 
risk 
management 
processes 
ensures resilience in the face 
of 
uncertainties, 
enhances 
decision 
making 
and 
preserves stakeholder trust. 
It also captures REC’s ability 
to 
absorb

arising 
from financial and economic 
stress 
and 
meet 
stricter 
regulatory 
requirements 
related to the complexity 
and interconnectedness of

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets and 
achievements
	
At REC, sustainability is not an after thought but a strategic priority embedded across our operations. As India progresses on 
its path of rapid economic growth, we are committed to ensuring that development goes hand in hand with environmental 
protection, social inclusion and strong governance. REC Board approved policy guides us all the way to systematically integrate 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles into our core decision-making enables us to create long-term value for 
stakeholders while supporting the country’s sustainable development goals. 
	
Challenges and Strategic Goals
	
Implementing ESG at scale presents key challenges such as infrastructure gaps, technology adoption, stakeholder alignment and 
the need for continuous compliance and monitoring. Despite these hurdles, REC has set clear targets most notably, increasing 
the share of renewable energy in our loan portfolio. Our commitment extends to greening our operations through renewable-
powered facilities, electric vehicle adoption and best practices in water and waste management. Furthermore, our Corporate Social 
Responsibility initiatives are expanding our positive impact in rural and underserved communities.
	
Key Achievements
	
REC significantly advanced its ESG commitments, making substantial progress towards Net Zero with a 1 MWp captive solar plant 
underway and 76% of its vehicle fleet now electric. REC has agreed with DHBVN for supplying 100% green power to our corporate 
office for FY 2025-26 by which it is estimate that around 85% of Scope 1 & 2 emissions will be avoided in commitment to advance 
India’s Panchamrit goals, renewable loan disbursements grew by an impressive 63% YoY and the loan book increased by 49%, 
consequently avoiding an estimated 6.1 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions. Socially, REC introduced a new Occupational Health and 
Safety Policy and achieved zero data breaches and zero customer grievances. Governance was strengthened by integrating ESG 
into loan appraisals and procurement. 
	
Governance and the Road Ahead
	
Governance remains the foundation of our sustainability agenda. We ensure transparency, ethical procurement and ESG aligned 
value chain engagement, reinforcing integrity across our value chain. With a strong governance structure and clear ESG roadmap, 
REC is positioned not just as a financier of India’s energy and infrastructure sectors, but as a proactive enabler of the country’s 
green and inclusive transformation. Going forward, we aim to scale our impact by embracing innovation, deepening stakeholder 
engagement and advancing our ESG commitments.

and Appeal (CDA) Rules specify the code of conduct for all workers, recognizing acts of bribery, corruption and other misconduct 
as criminal offences if proven. The Company also has a Fraud Prevention Policy, which addresses the prevention, detection and 
reporting of all acts of fraud, bribery and corruption. Furthermore, REC follows CVC rules and Guidelines for anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery, including the PIDPI Resolution (GoI Resolution on Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Informers relating 
to complaints for disclosure on any allegation of corruption or misuse of office wherein CVC is the Designated Agency). Aside 
from the aforementioned, REC has also adopted a Whistle blower Policy. The policy documents of REC can be found on the link

11#
* The increase of number of days accounts payable compared to last year is primarily due to two factors related to our role as a nodal agency for 
government programs like RDSS. Firstly, there was a significant ~40% decrease in procurement volume (the denominator), specifically for smart 
metering. Secondly, accounts payable (the numerator) increased due to payments awaiting disbursement from the Government of India for these 
projects. These timing differences are inherent to government-led schemes and do not reflect any inefficiency. We maintain rigorous financial 
management, ensuring prompt payments upon receipt of funds, aligning with our robust governance and ESG objectives.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
REC is committed to a robust and comprehensive sustainable procurement policy that aligns seamlessly with our core values. 
This policy not only outlines our dedication to upholding exemplary standards across various domains such as economic, social, 
ethical and environmental, but also emphasises the importance of recognising and addressing the potential risks associated 
with our procurement processes.
	
	
In our efforts to cultivate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) awareness, we actively engage with our suppliers, 
encouraging them to embrace sustainable practices. We believe in the power of collaboration and aim to support our suppliers 
through training programs focused on skill enhancement and the adoption of sustainable methods. To ensure a consistent 
commitment to sustainability, we require all our suppliers to comply with our sustainable procurement policies. We also expect 
adherence to our supplier code of conduct, which outlines the ethical standards we uphold. Suppliers are encouraged to provide 
relevant ESG data to REC upon request, fostering transparency and accountability in our supply chain.
	
	
Our senior management team plays a crucial role in this endeavour, taking an active interest in overseeing the implementation 
of our sustainable procurement policy. This involvement ensures that our commitment to sustainability is not just a statement 
but a proactive approach integrated into our operational practices.

company would for physical products. 
However, REC actively incorporates Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations into its project appraisal and financing 
processes. This strategy serves a similar purpose to that of an LCA by evaluating and mitigating the environmental impacts of the 
projects they finance throughout their lifecycle.

Description of the risk / concern
Action Taken
REC operates in a capacity that inherently avoids significant social or environmental risks typically associated with manufacturing 
or physical production. As a financial entity, the Company does not engage in activities that would directly contribute to ecological 
degradation or social harm.
Nonetheless, REC is deeply committed to maintaining responsible financing practices that prioritize environmental integrity. During its 
thorough project appraisal process, the Company undertakes a systematic evaluation of the environmental risks linked to the power 
projects it chooses to finance. This evaluation involves meticulous due diligence, which includes a comprehensive review of all relevant 
environmental compliance regulations and necessary clearances to ensure that projects align with sustainability goals.
In addition to these practices, REC actively supports government initiatives aimed at enhancing environmental protection. The 
company plays a pivotal role in promoting the adoption of advanced pollution control technologies within thermal power plants. This 
encompasses financing for the installation of critical systems such as Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD), Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) 
and Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP). These technologies are essential for significantly reducing harmful emissions, thereby contributing 
to improved air quality and a healthier environment for communities surrounding these power facilities.

Yes, REC has a grievance redressal mechanism in place to address employee concerns.
Employees can initially raise their grievances with their reporting manager. The reporting manager will attempt to 
resolve the issue within 7 days. If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution, they can escalate the grievance 
to the Head of Department (HoD) within 15 days. The HoD will then try to resolve the grievance within 7 days. 
If the employee remains dissatisfied with the HoD's decision or does not receive a response within the specified 
time frame, they can escalate the matter to the Grievance Redressal Committee. The committee will communicate 
its decision to the employee within 45 days. 
In exceptional cases, if the employee is still unsatisfied, they may appeal to the Chairman and Managing Director 
(CMD) within 10 days of receiving the committee's decision. The CMD will decide and inform the employee within 
30 days.
All grievances received are tracked and monitored regularly and decision notes are maintained for future reference.

of necessary statutory clearances. Additionally, borrowers are held accountable for fulfilling other similar obligations in accordance 
with applicable statutory requirements. To ensure compliance throughout the loan period, borrowers must provide REC with proof 
of adherence to these conditions at various stages of their agreement. This systematic approach not only reinforces the borrowers' 
responsibilities but also aligns with REC's commitment to regulatory standards and operational integrity.

employees, both as they approach retirement and during their post-retirement phase. As a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE), 
REC is committed to adhering meticulously to the employment Guidelines set forth by the DPE, particularly concerning the processes 
of retirement and the termination of employment.
	
While REC does not have a formalised program specifically labelled as a "transition assistance program" for enhancing employability 
after retirement, the organisation places a strong emphasis on continuous skill enhancement throughout an employee's career. Each 
year, employees partake in a variety of training opportunities, both through in-house resources and external institutions, aimed at 
ensuring their skills remain current and relevant. This ongoing commitment to professional development not only fosters individual 
growth but also enhances adaptability during their active years of service.
	
In addition to career development, REC deeply values the well-being of its retired employees. The Company provides a range of 
significant post-retirement benefits designed to support their health and welfare. Among these are comprehensive post-retirement 
medical benefits and various welfare programs, demonstrating REC's dedication to caring for its workforce even after their active

PRINCIPLE 4 Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
	
REC has developed a thorough and well-structured stakeholder engagement policy designed to streamline the process of identifying, 
engaging with and managing its various stakeholders. This policy is rooted in several key components:
	
Definition of Stakeholders: In the context of REC, stakeholders encompass a diverse range of individuals and groups who may be 
directly or indirectly affected by the company’s operations. This includes not only those who have a direct stake in REC’s activities but 
also those who possess a vested interest in its success or have the capacity to influence its outcomes.
	
Key Stakeholder Groups: REC acknowledges a wide array of stakeholders as vital to its ongoing business endeavours. These 
groups are categorised into two main categories: internal stakeholders, primarily comprised of employees who contribute to the 
company's culture and productivity and external stakeholders, which include various business associates. External stakeholders 
encompass suppliers, vendors, partners and service providers, as well as shareholders and investors, including bondholders and 
creditors. Additionally, borrowers and banking institutions, regulatory bodies and government agencies-such as state governments, 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and stock 
exchanges (i.e. NSE and BSE) are also recognised. Customers and neighbouring communities play a crucial role in REC’s stakeholder 
network as the company’s activities directly impact them.
	
Ongoing Stakeholder Identification: Identifying stakeholders is not a one-time event, but a continuous and evolving process. 
REC is committed to maintaining an adaptive approach that allows it to stay attuned to the changing needs and expectations of its 
stakeholders. This proactive attitude ensures that the company remains aligned with the interests of those it serves and interacts 
with.
	
Engagement and Relationship Building: Recognising the importance of open communication, REC actively engages with 
stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of their concerns and expectations. The company prioritises addressing these issues, 
which in turn helps mitigate potential risks. By fostering strong, long-term relationships with its stakeholders, REC aims to cultivate 
an environment that contributes to its overall success.
	
Through its commitment to continually monitoring and responding to the diverse needs of stakeholders, REC aspires to enhance its 
business operations, mitigate risks and establish mutually beneficial and sustainable partnerships. This comprehensive approach not 
only strengthens the company’s position but also supports the broader community and economic environment in which it operates.

Although the majority of the stakeholder groups mentioned are not typically categorised as Vulnerable or marginalised, there are specific 
segments within these larger groups that do fall into these classifications. This includes individuals from economically disadvantaged 
backgrounds, those belonging to lower income brackets, as well as women, children and people with disabilities. Additionally, Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and businesses owned by members of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), along 
with women entrepreneurs, are also represented among these marginalised segments. REC is dedicated to supporting and uplifting these 
vulnerable portions of society by offering comprehensive training programs and fostering equal opportunities for their advancement. 
LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and social topics 
or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
REC is committed to fostering transparent and effective communication with all of its stakeholders while rigorously adhering to 
the relevant regulatory frameworks that govern its operations. The Company emphasises the importance of providing timely and 
pertinent information regarding decisions that could significantly affect its stakeholders. At the same time, REC ensures that sensitive 
business strategies and proprietary information are kept confidential to protect its competitive edge.
	
To uphold its commitment to responsible governance, REC has established several Board-approved policies that comprehensively 
address essential economic, environmental and social dimensions of its operations. These policies are carefully crafted in consultation 
with key stakeholders, ensuring they resonate with their expectations and address any concerns. A cornerstone of this endeavour 
is the comprehensive Environment, Social & Governance (ESG) Policy, which has been ratified by REC’s Board. This policy serves as 
a foundational framework guiding the company's ESG-related initiatives, ensuring they are well-aligned with overarching strategic 
objectives.
	
Stakeholder engagement is not merely a one-time event at REC, it is an integral component of the Company’s business processes and 
is approached as an ongoing effort. The leadership of these engagements primarily rests with various business units, although senior 
management actively participates when necessary. The outcomes of these engagements are systematically reported to the Board 
of Directors, facilitating informed oversight and assisting in crafting strategic directions that consider the interests and concerns of 
stakeholders effectively.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
REC actively engages in comprehensive dialogues with a diverse array of stakeholders including employees, borrowers, government 
entities and local communities when addressing environmental and social challenges. The organization firmly believes that by 
actively listening to these varied perspectives, it can better align with public expectations and foster sustainable development 
practices.
	
In response to these insightful discussions, REC has developed an intricate Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy. This 
policy acts as a guiding framework, enabling the Company to make informed decisions that prioritize environmental stewardship 
and social responsibility. For instance, during the preliminary stages of project reviews, REC meticulously evaluates the potential 
environmental impacts of the projects it finances. This assessment plays a crucial role in shaping its operational strategies, financial 
planning and risk management frameworks. To enhance its commitment to responsible lending, REC incorporates specific provisions 
within its loan agreements designed to safeguard the environment, protect public health and safety and support local communities. 
158
This is particularly emphasized in projects related to clean energy and infrastructure, where REC exercises heightened diligence to 
adhere to applicable environmental and social standards.
	
By maintaining open lines of communication with stakeholders and actively responding to their feedback, REC ensures that its 
operations remain meaningful, responsible and reflective of the evolving needs of the society.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
	
REC is deeply committed to fostering an inclusive environment for vulnerable and marginalised stakeholders through a combination 
of thoughtful policies, responsible business practices and proactive outreach efforts. A considerable emphasis is placed on 
empowering small businesses, particularly Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) and women-led businesses. To facilitate transparency, 
efficiency and timely payments to vendors, especially those who are smaller suppliers, REC is registered on several government 
platforms, including GeM (Government e-Marketplace), Sambandh, Samadhan and TReDS (Trade Receivables Discounting System). 
All REC offices, including their regional branches, consistently utilise these platforms to ensure fair treatment and accessibility for all 
vendors.
	
In its procurement process, REC prioritizes MSEs, granting them special preferences and extending various benefits in line with 
established Guidelines. This initiative is designed to create a more equitable playing field for smaller enterprises, ultimately promoting 
economic inclusion and sustainable growth for these vital components of the economy.
	
Beyond vendor engagement, REC actively reaches out to individual investors, including equity shareholders and bondholders, who 
may be unaware of unclaimed dividends or redemption amounts. The Company takes the initiative to proactively communicate 
with these stakeholders to assist them in reclaiming their rightful dues, ensuring that no individual is overlooked due to a lack of 
knowledge or access to the necessary information.
	
Moreover, REC’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs are centred on uplifting socially and economically disadvantaged 
groups. These initiatives are comprehensive and target key areas, including education, healthcare, skill development, sanitation 
and assistance for persons with disabilities. By directly addressing the diverse needs of poor, underprivileged and differently abled 
individuals, REC actively promotes social equity and inclusion, making a tangible difference in the communities it serves.

Note: The shift in the proportion of wages paid to women stems from a temporary reduction in female workforce representation, primarily 
due to a higher-than-expected number of female retirements. Our compensation practices remain strictly gender-neutral, with remuneration 
determined by role and experience in full compliance with our commitment to equal opportunity. We are proactively implementing targeted 
recruitment and retention strategies to restore and enhance gender diversity, underscoring our dedication to fair employment practices and 
alignment with ESG best practices.

5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
REC is deeply committed to upholding human rights across all dimensions of its operations, establishing a comprehensive policy 
that applies to every stakeholder connected to the company. This includes not only our full-time and contractual employees but also 
external contractors, suppliers, partners and consultants. We hold the firm belief that all stakeholders must adhere to fundamental 
human rights principles in their interactions with REC. To maintain a just and ethical environment, REC strictly prohibits any incidents 
of human trafficking, forced labor and child labor within its operations and throughout its entire value chain. Furthermore, our 
commitment extends to ensuring that all individuals receive equal pay for work of equal value, fostering a workplace free from 
discrimination. We actively prohibit any forms of discrimination based on gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation or any 
other characteristics that are legally protected.
	
To effectively address any allegations or reports of human rights violations, REC has established a robust grievance redressal 
mechanism. This system is designed to be efficient, fair, transparent and accessible, ensuring that all stakeholders can voice their 
concerns. It allows for the systematic monitoring and prompt response to grievances, providing effective remedies for those affected. 
Individuals wishing to report any human rights issues can easily reach out to the designated grievance redressal officer following 
REC's stated procedures.
160
	
Our grievance redressal mechanism offers a well-structured and equitable process for both internal and external stakeholders to 
express their grievances, concerns and complaints. To maintain accountability and compliance with our policy, REC conducts regular 
audits and assessments of its practices as well as those of its value chain partners, ensuring that all parties remain aligned with 
established human rights standards. Through these measures, REC strives to create a workplace and community that prioritizes 
respect and dignity for all.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
REC is dedicated to fostering a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment where all individuals are treated fairly, regardless of 
their role, background or identity. The Company places a strong emphasis on ethics, respect for human rights and providing equal 
opportunities in the workplace. Career advancement at REC is based solely on talent, performance and merit.
	
To ensure that concerns related to discrimination or harassment are addressed appropriately, REC has established clear and secure 
mechanisms to protect the rights and well-being of those who come forward with complaints. In cases of sexual harassment, REC 
adheres to the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. 
Such cases are handled with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality. Dedicated internal committees are in place to investigate 
complaints promptly and fairly, while ensuring that the identity and dignity of the complainant are safeguarded throughout the 
process.
	
Furthermore, the Company strictly prohibits any form of retaliation against individuals who report discrimination, harassment or 
other violations in good faith. This protection includes safeguarding employees from threats, dismissal, demotion, or any form of 
professional disadvantage. To reinforce this commitment, REC has implemented a Whistle blower Policy that allows employees and 
stakeholders to raise concerns confidentially and without fear of negative consequences. This policy ensures that complaints are

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Details of a business process being modified / introduced as a result of addressing human rights grievances/complaints.
	
Throughout the reporting year, we did not encounter any grievances or complaints related to human rights violations. However, our 
commitment to human rights extends far beyond merely responding to issues as they arise. We take a proactive stance by rigorously 
implementing ongoing due diligence practices aimed at upholding the highest standards of human rights across all facets of our 
operations. This includes seamlessly integrating our human rights policy into our everyday business practices and cultivating robust 
relationships with our stakeholders. By doing so, we strive to identify and address potential risks before they develop into significant 
issues, thereby fostering an environment of respect and dignity for all individuals.
2.	
Details of the scope and coverage of any human rights due diligence conducted. 
	
REC places a strong emphasis on upholding human rights throughout all aspects of its operations and in its interactions with 
stakeholders. We have developed a thorough human rights policy that not only delineates our commitments but also applies to all 
individuals and organisations we engage with, including employees, clients, vendors and community partners.
	
To ensure that these standards are met consistently, we require our vendors to provide formal declarations attesting to their 
compliance with established human rights principles. This initiative is part of our larger effort to foster an ethical supply chain and 
promote responsible business practices. Additionally, beginning in January 2025, we expanded our commitment by incorporating 
human rights assessments into our evaluation processes for both borrowers and vendors. This integration is a key component of 
our broader Environmental, Social and Governance evaluations, emphasising our dedication to socially responsible investment and 
lending practices.
	
Internally, we are equally committed to maintaining stringent human rights compliance within our corporate offices. This is achieved 
through regular assessments and ongoing monitoring conducted by our dedicated ESG division. Our monitoring efforts are guided 
by clearly defined internal quarterly targets, which not only help to evaluate our progress but also ensure that we continuously 
improve our human rights practices. By setting these targets, we aim to hold ourselves accountable and reinforce our commitment 
to fostering a culture of respect for human rights throughout our organisation.

*Despite energy efficiency initiatives such as automated lighting systems and regular AC maintenance, Scope 2 emissions increased compared 
to last year. This rise is primarily due to: (1) the in-house leasing of 48 Electric Vehicles (EVs), which added approximately 400 MWh (1,440 GJ) of 
electricity consumption for charging; and (2) an increase in the grid emission factor from 0.716 to 0.726, which contributed to higher calculated 
emissions.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details. 
	
Yes, REC is significantly involved in reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions through its core business operations and internal 
initiatives.
	
REC's primary contribution stems from its role as a major financier of India's transition to a clean energy power sector. REC provides 
substantial loans for a wide range of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind and other non-fossil fuel-based power 
generation sources. This directly displaces electricity generated from conventional, emission-intensive sources. For instance, in 
the financial year 2024-25, REC sanctioned an impressive ₹1,05,259 crore renewable energy projects, also renewable energy loan 
disbursements witnessed a substantial increase of 63% YoY during the financial year 2024-25.
	
Issuance of Green Bonds: To further support green initiatives, REC regularly issues international Green Bonds. The funds raised from 
these bonds are exclusively channeled into “Eligible Green Projects” that meet stringent environmental criteria, directly contributing 
to carbon emission reductions as per REC Green finance framework.
	
Enhancing Energy Efficiency: Beyond renewables, REC also supports projects aimed at improving the efficiency of the power grid, 
such as smart metering and distribution reforms. While not direct GHG reduction projects, these initiatives lead to reduced energy 
losses and, consequently, lower emissions from the power sector.
	
REC also focuses on minimizing its own carbon footprint: REC operates rooftop solar plants at its premises, which generated 1,379 
MWH of electricity in the financial year 2024-25, avoiding 1,002 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
	
Pursuing Net Zero Operations: REC is committed to achieving Net Zero emissions in its direct operations. As part of this commitment, 
it has agreed with its power discom for 100% green power supply, which is projected to avoid 85% of its internal emissions.
	
In essence, REC actively enables large-scale GHG reductions across India by financing the green energy transition, while simultaneously 
implementing robust measures to decarbonize its own operations.

Throughout the financial year, REC has taken substantial steps to support this environmentally responsible approach by sanctioning 
projects specifically aimed at installing FGDs. The total amount allocated for these projects is an impressive ₹5,441 crore, demonstrating 
REC's commitment to enhancing air quality and adhering to stringent environmental regulations.
	
In addition to pollution control measures, REC is also financing Ultra Super Critical Thermal Power Projects. These projects are 
distinguished by their superior thermal efficiency compared to conventional thermal power plants, which contributes to lower fuel 
consumption and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. For the financial year 2024-25, REC has sanctioned a total of 5 Ultra Super 
Critical Projects, amounting to a significant ₹11,755 crore. This investment reflects REC's forward-thinking approach and dedication 
to sustainable energy development in India.

REC being a NBFC, does not own or implement projects. For renewable energy projects funded by REC, the Company requires its 
borrowers to obtain an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.
8.	
How many Green Credits have been generated or procured: 
a.	
By the listed entity 
	
REC has achieved a remarkable milestone by generating a total of 1,379 megawatt-hours (MWh) of clean solar power from its in-
house rooftop solar installations, which have a combined capacity of 1,019 kilowatts peak (kWp). This output, achieved during 
the financial year 2024-25, has led to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, specifically avoiding 1,002 tonnes of CO2. This 
reduction can be quantified as the generation of 1,002 carbon credits, emphasising REC's commitment to sustainability.
	
To further enhance its environmental impact, REC is actively pursuing its goal of attaining Net Zero emissions across all its 
direct operations. To support this ambitious target, the Company has agreed with Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited 
(DHBVNL) to obtain a supply of 100% green power for FY 2024-25. This strategic initiative is anticipated to result in a substantial 
reduction, avoiding approximately 85% of REC's total emissions.
	
Additionally, REC has made strides in energy efficiency at its Corporate Office by operationalising an automatic lighting 
management system within the current financial year. This system aims to optimise energy usage by automatically adjusting 
lighting according to occupancy and natural light levels, contributing further to the organization's sustainability efforts.
b.	
By the top ten (in terms of value of purchases, sales and value chain partners, respectively)
	
As the cornerstone of REC's operations lies in project finance, the organization has made significant strides in environmental 
impact through its portfolio of renewable energy projects. During the financial year 2024-25, the top ten renewable projects 
that REC financed successfully avoided an impressive total of 48,39,745 tonnes of CO2 emissions. This remarkable achievement 
is tantamount to generating 48,39,745 Carbon Credits, which reflect the positive contribution these projects have made to 
combating climate change.
	
When expanding the scope to encompass all renewable projects funded by REC, the cumulative avoided emissions soar to an 
astounding approximately 1,07,28,074 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 0.1 billion tonnes. Utilising the PCAF (Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials) methodology for more precise attribution, REC's direct contribution to these avoided emissions stands 
at 61,14,045 tonnes of CO2. This underscores REC's pivotal role in advancing sustainable development and reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions through strategic financing in the renewable energy sector.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community. 
	
In response to the government's initiative for enhancing transparency and efficiency in grievance management, REC has made 
a significant advancement by integrating its Public Grievance Redressal Cell with the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and 
Monitoring System (CPGRAMS). This comprehensive national platform, which is managed by the Department of Administrative 
Reforms & Public Grievances (DARPG), serves as a centralized hub for lodging and resolving grievances across multiple sectors.
	
Through CPGRAMS, citizens have the opportunity to file complaints regarding various public services, including those directly 
172
related to the operations and services of REC. This integration ensures that all grievances submitted via CPGRAMS are meticulously 
addressed in accordance with established national standards and within defined timelines, reflecting a commitment to timely and 
effective resolution.
	
The Grievance Redressal Cell at REC plays a crucial role in this process by systematically tracking and managing the complaints 
received. This approach not only streamlines the grievance redressal process but also enhances accessibility for the public. Citizens 
can easily lodge their complaints, monitor the status of their submissions and receive timely updates on the actions taken to resolve 
their concerns. Overall, this initiative is a pivotal step towards fostering accountability and improving the overall experience of 
stakeholders interacting with REC.

education, agriculture & water resources, financial inclusion & skill development) of districts that are relatively underdeveloped.
3.	
(a)	 Do you have a preferential procurement policy where you give preference to purchase from suppliers comprising 
marginalized /vulnerable groups? (Yes/No) 
	
Yes, REC has a policy to support public procurement from MSMEs. The policy is available at https://recindia.nic.in/uploads/files/
RECPolicy-for-MSME-11022022.pdf
	
(b)	 From which marginalized /vulnerable groups do you procure?
	
	
REC being a Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU), is mandated to adhere to the Government of India's policy on Public 
Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs), 2012 (Link: https://dcmsme.gov.in/pppm.htm.aspx). This policy, 
which has been amended over time and as per the latest amendments to the policy, all PSEs are required to meet the following 
targets from MSEs annually:
	
	
1)  25% of the total annual procurement of goods and services.
	
	
2)  A sub-target of 4% within the 25% for procurement from MSEs owned by Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) 
entrepreneurs.
173
	
	
3)  A sub-target of 3% within the 25% for procurement from MSEs owned by women entrepreneurs.
	
	
To support these goals, we have aligned our internal policy to exclusively procure commonly used goods and services valued up 
to ₹10 lakh from MSE vendors. This initiative helps boost their growth and participation in our supply chain.
	
	
We've implemented several measures to encourage MSE participation:
 

Price Preference: If a non-MSE vendor submits the lowest bid (L1), an MSE can still be awarded the contract by matching the 
L1 price, provided their initial bid was within 15% of the L1 price. This provision applies when an order can be split among 
multiple vendors.
 

Reduced Financial Barriers: Registered MSEs receive tender documents for free and are exempt from submitting earnest 
money deposits, making it easier for them to bid on our contracts.
 

Vendor Development Programs (VDPs): We organize VDPs to connect MSEs with our buyers, help them understand our 
requirements and equip them to become competitive suppliers.
	
	
By implementing these supportive measures, we are creating a more inclusive and equitable procurement environment that 
fosters the growth of the MSE sector.
	
(c)	 What percentage of total procurement (by value) does it constitute?
	
	
REC's procurement from MSEs for the financial year 2024-25 hit a remarkable 44.83%, well beyond the mandated minimum. 
The company's role in this is limited, though, as it relies on vendors to report their own diversity claims to help REC meet the 
government's procurement targets.

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
	
Being an NBFC, the Company has adopted a Fair Practices Code in line with the statutory requirements. The Fair Practices Code, as 
prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), outlines a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism designed specifically for 
consumers. This framework enables individuals to submit any complaints they may have regarding services or practices. The Board 
of Directors plays a crucial role in this process, as they periodically conduct thorough reviews to assess compliance with the Fair 
Practices Code. This review includes an evaluation of the grievances that have been filed under this code.
	
For the financial year 2024-25, it is noteworthy that the organisation did not receive any complaints associated with the Fair Practices 
177
Code, indicating a high level of consumer satisfaction and adherence to the established practices. For those interested in reviewing 
the Guidelines and protocols outlined in the Fair Practices Code can be accessed at https://recindia.nic.in/uploads/files/co-hr-GRO-

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Channels / platforms where information on products and services of the entity can be accessed (provide web link, if available):
	
REC provides a diverse and comprehensive suite of financial products and services specifically designed to support the power, 
infrastructure and logistics sectors. This extensive offering addresses the complete value chain, enhancing the development of 
essential systems for power generation, transmission and distribution. By focusing on improving operational efficiency, REC plays a 
crucial role in facilitating the implementation of innovative and sustainable technologies across these industries.
	
The financing solutions offered by REC are tailored to a wide array of clients. This includes not only State power utilities and State 
Governments but also public sector undertakings and private sector developers. These financial products are carefully designed 
178
to meet the unique needs and challenges faced by each segment of the market, ensuring that all stakeholders in the energy and 
infrastructure landscape can access the necessary capital for growth and sustainability.
	
For more detailed information regarding our product portfolio, including specific interest rates and other related financial 
information, interested parties are encouraged to visit the official Company website, where resources are readily available for 
current and potential customers. https://recindia.nic.in/financial-products. Details on our business profile can be accessed at 
https://recindia.nic.in/business-profile.
2.	
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services:
	
REC maintains a comprehensive presence throughout India, with regional offices strategically located in various states across the 
country. Each regional office is supervised by a Senior Chief Program Manager or Chief Program Manager (CPM), who serves as the 
primary point of contact for borrowers within the respective state. This position is crucial for addressing any concerns relating to the 
wide array of products and services offered by the company. For those seeking direct assistance or information, detailed contact 
information for each regional office and the associated Senior CPMs/CPMs can be found at https://recindia.nic.in/contact 
	
To promote consumer awareness and educate the public about its offerings, REC has made a range of consumer awareness literature 
available on its official website at https://recindia.nic.in/financial-products. This initiative is part of the organization’s commitment to 
transparency and consumer engagement.
	
In addition to these initiatives, REC boasts an in-house training institute known as the REC Institute of Power Management and 
Training (RECIPMT). This institution is dedicated to fulfilling the training and development needs of engineers and managers from 
power sector organizations, not only within India but also extending its reach internationally. RECIPMT offers a diverse array of 
training programs focusing on vital topics such as electrical safety, the techno-commercial improvement of DISCOM performance 
and the sustainability of power utilities.
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services:
	
For REC which is a project finance NBFC and not a direct utility provider, the concept of "consumers" and "essential services" needs to 
be understood in the context of financing infrastructure, not providing power directly.
	
The essential service is the financing of power and infrastructure projects. The "consumers" are the large state and private power 
utilities, not the end-users of electricity.
	
Therefore, the mechanisms for informing stakeholders of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of its essential service (financing) 
are primarily focused on transparency, regulatory compliance and direct communication with its institutional borrowers and the 
financial market. The direct mechanisms in place are Regulatory disclosures, Stock Exchange filings, Direct communication with 
borrowers, Credit Ratings.
4.	
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws? If yes, 
provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to consumer satisfaction relating to the major 
products / services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)  
	
Yes, the entity provides product information that goes beyond legal requirements.
	
As a wholesale Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), the Company primarily offers financial products to state utilities. To ensure 
transparency, detailed loan terms, conditions and other crucial information are available on its corporate website. In addition to the 
website, the company actively advertises its products through:
i.	
Workshops: For example, a workshop on Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) was held in financial year 2024-25 to educate 
borrowers.
ii.	
Investor and Borrower Meets: These events are organized to provide direct information.
iii.	
Regional Office : The state offices of RECs educate small groups of borrowers about available products and services.
	
Additionally, REC is dedicated to enhancing customer experience by continuously conducting customer satisfaction surveys. These 
surveys are strategically implemented at multiple touchpoints throughout the loan transaction process, including application, 
approval, disbursement and closure stages. We actively seek feedback from our borrowers, which serves as a valuable resource for 
refining our systems and processes. This feedback informs our ongoing efforts to improve service delivery and enables us to focus 
more effectively on the training and development of our staff, ultimately aiming to provide an exceptional customer experience.
	
As an NBFC, we rigorously adhere to the Fair Practices Code as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This code outlines the 
ethical lending practices we follow in our interactions with borrowers, encompassing various stages of the loan lifecycle, including the 
application process, approval and sanctioning of loans, disbursement, post-disbursement supervision and an established grievance 
redressal mechanism. The full text of our Fair Practices Code is available at https://recindia.nic.in/uploads/files/co-hr-GRO-Order-Fair-
Practice-Code-30-05-2024.pdf ensuring that our customers are well-informed about their rights and the standards we uphold.
