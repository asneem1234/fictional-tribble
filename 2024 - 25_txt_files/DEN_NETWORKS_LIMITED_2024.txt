1.
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Effective energy use is a 
key enabler of sustainable 
growth 
across 
sectors. 
By 
optimizing 
energy 
consumption, 
businesses 
can 
enhance 
operational 
performance and long-term 
value creation.
DEN has adopted a range of 
initiatives to optimize energy 
usage, such as switching off 
unused 
devices, 
replacing 
conventional bulbs with LED 
lighting across offices, and 
introducing electric inverters 
as 
alternatives 
to 
diesel 
generators at select locations. 
Positive
2.
Waste 
Management & 
Circular Economy
Risk and 
Opportunity
The Environment Protection 
Act 
of 
1986 
mandates 
responsible waste handling. 
Non-compliance can lead to 
penalties and reputational 
risks. On the flip side, 
adopting circular economy 
practices can reduce costs 
and resource dependency.
DEN follows safe disposal 
procedures 
for 
end-of-life 
and faulty equipment through 
certified e-waste handlers, 
adhering to all regulatory 
requirements. The Company 
also emphasizes reuse by 
refurbishing Set Top Boxes 
(STBs) for future deployment.
Negative 
and 
Positive
3.
Employee well-
being, health and 
safety
Risk
Employee wellness directly 
impacts productivity and 
customer 
satisfaction. 
Neglecting health and safety 
can disrupt operations and 
damage workplace morale.
We 
prioritize 
employee 
wellness 
by 
fostering 
a 
supportive 
environment. 
Initiatives 
include 
mental 
health 
awareness, 
safety 
training, readily available first-
aid kits etc. 
Negative
4.
Human Rights
Risk
Ensuring 
respect 
for 
human rights throughout 
operations 
and 
supply 
chains is critical. Violations 
can cause regulatory issues 
and reputational harm.
DEN complies with all human 
rights laws, prohibits child and 
forced labour, ensures non-
discrimination, and guarantees 
minimum wage adherence. 
The HR department manages 
and resolves any grievances 
related 
to 
human 
rights 
violations.
Negative
5.
Responsible Supply 
Chain
Risk and 
Opportunity
Rising 
stakeholder 
expectations 
necessitate 
a sustainable supply chain 
that mitigates ESG risks and 
encourages 
responsible 
growth.
DEN plans to conduct ESG 
assessments 
across 
its 
supply chain, focusing on 
environmental, 
social, 
and 
governance criteria, to identify 
and address risks early.
Negative 
and 
Positive
6.
Data Privacy and 
Security
Risk
As 
a 
technology-driven 
organization,  safeguarding 
data is essential to protect 
customers, 
infrastructure, 
and internal systems from 
cyber threats.
DEN 
has 
developed 
a 
comprehensive 
risk 
management 
protocol 
involving threat identification, 
mitigation 
planning, 
and 
continuous 
monitoring. 
Regular 
employee 
training 
sessions help raise awareness 
of 
cybersecurity 
best 
practices.
Negative
7.
Governance and 
Accountability
Risk
Strong 
governance 
is 
foundational to stakeholder 
trust. 
Weaknesses 
in 
governance practices can 
undermine confidence and 
affect the Company’s long-
term viability.
DEN 
operates 
under 
a 
well-defined 
governance 
framework, ensuring clarity 
in 
leadership 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
to 
uphold 
accountability at all levels.

Statement by director responsible for the Business Responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements:
At DEN, sustainability is not just a guiding principle—it is the backbone of our operations. Through our Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR), we maintain transparency and keep our stakeholders informed about our sustainability 
efforts.
The growing challenges of climate change highlight the urgent need to safeguard our planet for future generations. In response, 
we are in proces of developing a comprehensive ESG strategy and governance framework to embed sustainability into every 
aspect of our business, from service design to supply chain management. We have launched various initiatives to reduce our 
environmental footprint, promote diversity, inclusion and employee well-being, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
With a strong focus on responsible resource consumption, we are taking proactive steps to lower our carbon footprint. Our 
energy-efficient programs across offices are designed to reduce Scope 2 emissions, while our commitment to the circular 
economy helps us minimize reliance on virgin materials and cut GHG emissions. A key part of this effort includes refurbishing 
and repackaging set-top boxes, extending their lifecycle and maximizing value for our customers.
At DEN, we are dedicated to fostering a diverse, inclusive and healthy workplace where employees feel valued and supported. 
We prioritize continuous learning, career development and competitive compensation, ensuring we attract and retain top 
talent.
Beyond our internal operations, we actively support the upliftment of marginalized and vulnerable communities through our 
CSR initiatives tailored to their specific needs, empowering them to become self-reliant.
Our unwavering commitment to service excellence drives us to uphold the highest quality standards and ensure timely delivery 
for our customers.
At DEN, we look beyond short-term gains—our vision is to create lasting value for our shareholders, employees, customers, 
suppliers, and the wider community. By reinforcing environmental responsibility, social impact, and transparent governance, 
we remain committed in our journey toward sustainable growth. Sustainability is not a destination for us; it is an ongoing 
commitment to making a meaningful impact across all facets of our operations.

We are actively taking initiatives to reduce waste generation and manage the waste produced responsibly. Solid waste generated

dry materials such as paper and plastic, with no hazardous or construction and demolition waste generated. E-waste, including 
desktops and other electronic equipment, is disposed of sustainably through a buy-back scheme and registered recycling vendors, 
in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, any battery waste generated is also managed through the buy-back scheme, 
ensuring responsible disposal practices.
