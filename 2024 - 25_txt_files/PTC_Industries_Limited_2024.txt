1
Disaster 
Recovery
R
Businesses remain exposed to 
operational risks from natural 
calamities such as earthquakes, 
floods, and extreme weather 
events, as well as large-scale 
disruptions like global health 
emergencies. The COVID-19 
pandemic highlighted the 
vulnerability of supply chains and 
production systems to prolonged 
interruptions.
1.	 The Company has implemented 
a robust disaster recovery 
framework, supported by 
appropriate insurance coverage 
to safeguard assets and 
minimise financial impact in 
the event of natural calamities. 
Business continuity and 
contingency plans have been 
developed, including the 
creation of redundancies in 
key processes and critical 
infrastructure.
2.	 Learnings from the COVID-19 
pandemic have been 
institutionalised through health 
and safety protocols, remote 
working systems for non-
operational functions, and flexible 
supply chain arrangements, 
demonstrating PTC’s resilience in 
responding to global emergencies.
Negative
2
Health, 
safety and 
environment
R
Non-compliance with safety 
protocols or insufficient 
awareness of workplace 
hazards, particularly relating to 
the handling of chemicals and 
industrial processes, can pose 
significant risks to employees, 
operations, and the broader 
community. Such lapses may 
result in accidents, health 
hazards, or regulatory non-
compliance, potentially affecting 
both workforce wellbeing and 
business continuity.
1.	 The Company has embedded a 
comprehensive Environment, 
Health and Safety (EHS) 
framework across all facilities, 
supported by regular training 
and awareness programmes to 
ensure strict adherence to safety 
protocols.
2.	 Robust controls have been 
implemented at the source to 
minimise effluent generation, 
reduce emissions, and limit 
waste, ensuring compliance with 
environmental standards and 
reducing operational risks.
3.	 In alignment with statutory 
requirements, periodic medical 
examinations, vaccination drives, 
and health camps are organised 
to safeguard employee wellbeing 
and promote a culture of 
occupational health.
4.	 Continuous monitoring, audits, 
and safety drills are carried 
out to reinforce preparedness, 
while investments in modern 
safety equipment and protective 
infrastructure further strengthen 
the Company’s resilience.

IT data centre 
& far sight 
disaster 
recovery
R
Inadequate data infrastructure 
or lapses in data centre security 
could expose the Company 
to operational disruptions, 
cyber threats, or data loss. As 
operations become increasingly 
digitised, ensuring resilience of 
IT systems and safeguarding 
sensitive information are critical 
to business continuity and 
stakeholder trust.
1.	 A comprehensive Disaster 
Recovery (DR) and Business 
Continuity framework is in place 
and updated regularly.
2.	 Enhanced disaster recovery 
solutions, high-availability 
configurations, and SaaS-based 
platforms provide redundancy 
and protection of critical data.
3.	 Regular DR testing, IT audits, and 
robust cybersecurity protocols 
strengthen preparedness.
4.	 Certification under ISO 27001 
reinforces compliance with 
global standards for information 
security management.
Negative
5
Training and 
education
O
A skilled and capable workforce 
is a significant asset for any 
organization. Well-trained 
employees and workers are more 
proficient in carrying out their 
duties efficiently, completing tasks 
more quickly while also reducing 
the likelihood of workplace 
injuries.
Positive
6
Data 
Protection
R
Unauthorised exfiltration of 
confidential data (designs, process 
IP, customer and employee 
information) through USB/
flash drives, personal devices or 
unapproved channels could lead 
to regulatory non-compliance, 
contract breaches, operational 
disruption and reputational harm.
USB/flash drive access is disabled 
across company systems; DLP 
solutions and firewalls monitor 
all endpoints and networks; 
blacklisting of unauthorised sites 
and secure email gateways protect 
communications; privileged access 
rights are reviewed periodically 
and strong encryption is enforced, 
including for remote work.

Customer 
Experience & 
Satisfaction
O
Providing an exceptional customer 
experience is crucial for building 
lasting relationships with clients, 
fostering their loyalty, and driving 
sustainable business growth. 
Several key factors contribute to 
customer satisfaction and positive 
experience, including the quality 
of the product or service, clear 
and effective communication,

O
Developing a highly skilled and 
competent workforce provides 
organizations with a clear 
competitive edge. This workforce 
enables companies to excel in 
delivering high-quality products or 
services, while also empowering 
them to drive innovation and 
demonstrate agility in responding 
to changing market dynamics, 
allowing them to stay ahead of 
competitors in these critical areas.
Positive
9.
Social 
engagement & 
Impact
O
By actively engaging with the local 
community and addressing social 
issues, the company can boost its 
brand reputation, build stronger 
customer loyalty, and establish 
itself as a socially responsible 
corporate entity. This, in turn, can 
lead to increased market share, 
enhanced employee morale, 
and open new opportunities 
for growth and innovation. 
Embracing this approach allows 
the company to differentiate itself 
from competitors, strengthen 
its competitive edge, and 
make a positive impact on the 
communities it serves.

Quality of 
Products 
and Project 
Delivery
O
By consistently delivering high-
quality products and services 
within the committed timelines, 
the company reinforces its 
reputation for reliability, customer 
satisfaction, and operational 
excellence. This approach 
fosters greater customer loyalty, 
encourages positive word-of-
mouth referrals, and provides 
a distinct competitive edge in 
the marketplace, ultimately 
supporting the company’s growth 
and profitability.

Labour, 
Human Rights, 
and Supply 
Chain Ethics
R
Global aerospace and defence 
customers (Safran, Dassault, HAL, 
IAI, BAE) require strict compliance 
with labour laws, human rights, 
and ethical supply chain practices. 
Non-compliance can lead to 
reputational damage, contract 
cancellations, and loss of market 
access.
Implementation of POSH policy and 
whistle-blower mechanism; supplier 
due diligence and monitoring; 
adoption of CII/IWN frameworks; 
integration of Aspire Values to 
embed ethics and respect into 
organisational culture.
Negative
12
Regulatory & 
Compliance
R
Operating across multiple 
jurisdictions (India, UK, EU) 
exposes the Company to 
diverse and evolving regulatory 
requirements, including export 
controls and defence offset 
obligations. Non-compliance could 
result in penalties, reputational 
damage, or restrictions on 
business operations.
Oversight by the Board and its 
Committees; structured compliance 
calendar; periodic in-house and 
external audits; robust legal and 
secretarial review.
Negative
13
Skill 
Shortages & 
Workforce 
Development
R
Aerospace and defence 
manufacturing requires highly 
specialised skills (metallurgy, 
casting, welding, precision 
machining). Shortage of skilled 
professionals could constrain 
growth and delay execution of 
projects.
Establishment of STrIDE Academy 
for skill building will help to 
mitigate some of these risks in the 
future; Aspire Value integration to 
foster engagement and retention; 
engagement with engineering 
and specialised institutions along 
with implementation of in-house 
training programs; focus on global 
recruitment initiatives to fill niche 
roles.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by Director, responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
	
At PTC, we view sustainability not as an adjunct, but as an integral element of strategy and execution. Our commitment is reflected 
in the design of our new facilities, where rooftop solar, rainwater harvesting, and advanced material recycling are embedded from 
inception. By adopting Green Titanium™ technology and other recycling-led processes, we are reducing dependence on imports, 
conserving resources, and lowering our carbon footprint, while supporting India’s vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.
	
We recognise that ESG implementation presents complex challenges—ranging from transitioning to low-carbon manufacturing 
to ensuring safe, equitable and inclusive workplaces. Yet, we remain committed to continuous improvement, supported by robust 
governance, data-driven monitoring, and accountability at every level. Our focus on employee well-being, workplace safety, and skills 
development reinforces our belief that human capital is as vital as technological capital.
	
PTC’s journey is one of balancing responsibility with growth—optimising resources, minimising emissions, and deepening community 
engagement around our manufacturing units. By embedding ESG into our risk management and strategic decision-making, we aim 
not only to meet global benchmarks but to set new standards of responsible manufacturing in aerospace and defence.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No)

Yes. PTC Industries Limited has established robust governance mechanisms to prevent and manage potential conflicts of interest

conflict at the outset and to recuse themselves from discussions, deliberations, or voting on matters where such conflicts exist.
	
Additionally, the Terms of Appointment of Directors expressly prohibit members of the Board from holding directorships in companies 
that compete directly with PTC, unless prior approval is obtained from the Board. These safeguards ensure that Board decisions 
are taken objectively, in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders, reinforcing a culture of ethical governance and 
transparent decision-making.

R&D efforts are directed towards sustainable manufacturing, with a focus on optimising

A significant share of capital investments was channelled into sustainable technologies, 
including Green Titanium™ recycling facilities, energy-efficient furnaces (VAR, VIM, EBCHR, 
PAM), water recycling systems, and zero-liquid discharge infrastructure. These investments 
strengthen circularity, reduce environmental impact, and align with long-term sustainability 
goals.
2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
	
	
Yes. In FY 2024–25, PTC Industries Limited operationalised a structured framework for sustainable sourcing, covering 
environmental, social, and governance parameters. The framework includes sourcing of recycled and circular inputs (such as 
Green Titanium™ from the Company’s materials plant), preference for long-term and ethically compliant suppliers, and ongoing 
monitoring of environmental and social criteria across the supply chain.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
	
With the framework now operational, the Company has commenced quantifying the share of sustainably sourced inputs, 
including recycled metals, captive sourcing from its Strategic Materials Technology Complex, and suppliers assessed on 
ESG criteria. While a significant portion of inputs already fall within this definition, the exact percentage will be disclosed in 
subsequent reporting cycles as data stabilises.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
(a)	 Plastics (including packaging)
As most of the Company’s products are supplied directly to OEMs and exported, the scope 
for reclaiming them at end-of-life is limited. Nonetheless, PTC recognises its environmental 
responsibilities and has put in place systems to manage waste from its operations in a safe 
and compliant manner. Plastics, including packaging materials, are segregated and recycled; 
e-waste is channelled through certified recyclers; hazardous residues are treated and disposed 
of by authorised agencies; and other process wastes such as foundry sand and ceramics are 
responsibly recycled or disposed. These measures ensure that all waste generated within the 
Company’s control is handled sustainably and in accordance with statutory requirements.

(d)	 Other waste.

A substantial share of the company’s products is exported and supplied directly to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers, 
which restricts the company’s capacity to reclaim these products at the end of their lifecycle. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight 
that the company’s primary input material comprises waste or scrap, enabling effective recycling and reuse. This practice underscores 
the company’s commitment to sustainability and the efficient management of resources.

ensures impartial, timely, and fair resolution. Grievances can be submitted through prescribed forms 
available in both online and physical formats. All submissions are acknowledged, reviewed systematically, 
and addressed in alignment with the Company’s governance framework.

Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the 
coverage such system? 
	
	
Yes. PTC Industries Limited has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) 
covering all employees, workers, and contractors across production and support functions. The system integrates detailed

audits to proactively mitigate risks.
	
	
Employees are empowered through induction and refresher training, including on critical areas such as working at heights 
and confined space entry. The Company operates a Safety Observation and Near Miss Reporting System to encourage hazard 
reporting and corrective actions. Preventive healthcare, ergonomic workplace design, wellness programmes, and safety videos/
inductions further strengthen the culture of safety.
	
	
The system has delivered strong performance outcomes, with zero fatalities, zero lost-time injuries, and zero recordable 
incidents in FY 2023–24 and FY 2024–25. Continuous improvements, such as the deployment of safety interlock systems and 
proactive equipment upgrades, have further enhanced resilience. This commitment to health and safety extends beyond its own

•	 Renewable Energy: Generated 891 MWh from solar and 446 MWh from wind in FY 2024–25. A long-term decarbonisation strategy 
is being developed to increase renewable share and substitute fossil fuels with low-emission alternatives.
•	 Cleaner Fuels: Integrated natural gas furnaces in casting and heat treatment operations, reducing CO₂ emissions by 50–60% 
compared to diesel systems. Existing equipment is being retrofitted to transition from Light Diesel Oil (LDO) to Compressed 
Natural Gas (CNG).
•	 Energy-efficient Solutions: Deployed induction heaters to replace conventional electric furnaces, significantly lowering power 
consumption during machining processes.
•	 LED Lighting: Implemented LED lighting across facilities, improving efficiency and cutting CO₂ emissions compared to 
conventional lighting.
	
Together, these measures have reduced dependence on high-carbon fuels, enhanced operational efficiency, and reinforced PTC’s 
commitment to sustainable growth and climate responsibility.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
	
PTC integrates the 3R principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) into all aspects of its waste management strategy, with a focus on reducing 
both hazardous and non-hazardous waste at source. Waste volumes are tracked through an environmental dashboard, enabling data-
driven monitoring and progress measurement.
•	 Hazardous Waste: Hazardous wastes are registered and disposed of only through authorised agencies, in compliance with 
regulatory requirements. Initiatives include recycling of waste oil through alternative disposal methods and safe handling of ETP 
sludge to minimise landfill use.
•	 Non-Hazardous Waste: At the operational level, PTC reduces packaging and logistics waste by using recycled cardboard boxes as 
fillers and introducing reusable pallets for parts and product deliveries.
•	 Process Chemicals: The Company actively pursues process optimisation and cleaner technologies to reduce reliance on hazardous 
and toxic chemicals. Efforts are directed at substituting materials and refining processes to lower environmental impact.
	
Through this structured approach, PTC demonstrates its commitment to regulatory compliance, innovation, and continuous 
improvement in waste management, while addressing challenges such as costs and regulatory complexities.

(a)	
Do you have a preferential procurement policy where you give preference to purchase from suppliers comprising 
marginalized/vulnerable groups? 
	
	
PTC does not maintain a formal preferential procurement policy exclusively for suppliers from marginalized or vulnerable 
groups. However, the Company actively prioritises procurement from local suppliers and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises 
(MSMEs) around its facilities in Lucknow and Mehsana. This approach reflects PTC’s commitment to fostering local economic 
development while ensuring that procurement decisions remain guided by quality, reliability, cost efficiency, and capability.
	
	
At the same time, the Company remains open to supporting and building capacity of small-scale and community-linked suppliers 
in areas where alignment with its technical and quality standards is possible.
	
(b)	
From which marginalized/vulnerable groups do you procure?
	
	
PTC primarily engages with local MSMEs and small community enterprises that form an integral part of its supply chain. 
Examples include small business partners managing canteen and food supply services at its AMTC Plant in Lucknow and 
Mehsana Plant in Ahmedabad, as well as local vendors and subcontractors providing specialised services such as rough 
machining, finishing, and ancillary processing work. These engagements not only support operational flexibility but also create 
livelihood opportunities and entrepreneurial growth within the surrounding communities.
	
(c)	
What percentage of total procurement (by value) does it constitute?
	
	
The proportion of procurement from such marginalized and community-linked suppliers currently represents a small share of 
total procurement value. However, PTC values their contribution and impact in creating local employment and entrepreneurship. 
The Company is also exploring ways to expand community-linked sourcing opportunities, particularly in support services, skill-
building programmes, and infrastructure-related needs, in line with its broader social responsibility goals.

Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services.
	
PTC manufactures products strictly as per customer drawings and specifications, and the responsibility for end-use lies with 
customers. However, the Company ensures that all products are accompanied by clear handling and usage guidance wherever 
required, and maintains a dedicated customer support team to address safety or performance-related queries. Open communication 
channels enable customers to seek clarifications, reinforcing PTC’s commitment to safety, accountability, and customer support.
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
	
As PTC supplies engineered components that are further assembled by its customers, it has limited direct control over the end-use. 
Nevertheless, the Company maintains transparent communication with customers on supply schedules and potential disruptions, 
and proactively engages with them to mitigate risks related to delivery timelines or continuity of supply.

relating to the major products/services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as whole?

meetings, and feedback sessions at major operating sites. Customer feedback is systematically analysed and forms a critical input 
into quality improvement and product development.
