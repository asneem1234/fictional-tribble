Material issue

Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying  
the risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1.
Tie-up with 
Fintech 
companies 
for delivering 
financial 
services.
Opportunity
Fintech is enabling and
empowering 
the 
next 
generation of consumers 
who are highly tech-savvy 
and have greater financial 
literacy but had a paucity of 
time. These customers can 
avail the services on the go. 
With the enablers like the 
use of Artificial intelligence 
for credit decisions based 
on algorithms, APIs for 
e-documentation, 
and 
system 
integrations 
any 
bank can excel and deliver 
the desired services and 
can enhance its asset/
liabilities portfolios.
Though the activity has 
inherent risks, however 
with 
appropriate 
risk 
mitigates in place, the 
risk can be reduced 
substantially
The adoption of newer 
technology will help any 
bank to provide financial 
services 
across 
the 
ecosystem even without 
having 
a 
brick 
and 
mortar structure more 
swiftly and enhance its 
asset/liability portfolio
2.
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals
-“Green Fixed 
Deposits”
Opportunity
Green Deposits will help
enhance 
Central 
Bank 
of India’s participation in 
projects directly supporting 
United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) 
and empower our depositors 
to opt for financial products 
that have a positive impact 
on the environment, and the 
society at large.
Green deposit is offered 
at special rates which 
are above other fixed 
deposit rates.
Positive: Safeguarding 
our environment from 
climate 
change 
is 
the need of the hour. 
Hence there is immense 
scope to increase green 
deposits in the country.
