Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk 
along-with its financial implications:
S. 
No.

(R/O)
Rationale for 
identifying the risk /

In case of risk, approach to adapt or

Financial 
implications of the

(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1
Managing 
Environmental 
Impacts
R
Any unforeseen leakages 
from pipelines or other 
incidents 
that 
may 
have negative impacts 
on 
environment 
will 
adversely 
affect 
the 
business 
and 
local 
communities.
The Company uses a Supervisory Control 
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and 
a Leak Detection System to continuously 
monitor the pipelines. Foot patrolling is 
carried out round-the-clock to guard the 
pipelines, and their progress is tracked 
via a GPS system in the control room. 
The Emergency Response and Disaster 
Management Plan (ERDMP) has a set of 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
to respond promptly in the event of any 
incident.

(Indicate positive

implications)
2
Energy 
Efficiency of 
operations
R
With 
ever-growing 
global 
demand 
for 
energy and associated 
increase 
in 
costs, 
it 
would 
lead 
to 
operational risks due 
to  non-availability of 
energy 
or 
increased 
energy costs if energy is 
not efficiently used.
The 
Company 
employs 
in-house 
mechanisms to continuously track various 
energy usage parameters, as well as tools 
to aid in decision-making, simulation and 
visualization of energy efficiency and 
conservation.
Negative 
Implications
3
Innovation and 
Technology
O
It is crucial for the 
Company to improve 
its 
innovation 
capabilities and make 
use 
of 
cutting-edge 
technologies in order 
to maintain relevance in 
the constantly evolving 
macro- 
economic 
environment 
and 
achieve 
consistent 
development.
The Company seeks the best technological 
equipment which is energy efficient 
and looks for innovative solutions in the 
industry for the most relevant products to 
employ.
Positive  
Implications
4
Disaster 
Preparedness 
and 
Management
R
Catastrophes 
such 
as 
unpredictable 
weather 
patterns, 
cyclones, 
droughts 
and downpours are on 
the rise due to climate 
change and are proving 
to 
be 
a 
challenge 
globally. 
These 
unforeseen 
adverse 
conditions can be a risk 
to the organization’s 
operations 
and 
can 
lead to infrastructure 
damage and human 
loss.
The Emergency Response and Disaster 
Management Plan (ERDMP) has a set of 
SOPs to react immediately in the event 
of any incident. A comprehensive and 
appropriately 
equipped 
Integrated 
Disaster 
Recovery 
and 
Emergency 
Response process is in place. Mock drills 
are conducted to keep the team engaged 
and prepared for potential disasters. 
The public, along with local fire & police 
stations have been informed about the 
pipeline routes.
Negative 
Implications
5
Health, safety 
and employee 
well-being
R
In order to provide its 
human capital with a 
working 
environment 
that 
places 
utmost 
emphasis 
on 
their 
mental 
and 
physical 
well-being, 
employee 
health and safety is 
a 
non-negotiable 
element 
for 
the 
Company.
The framework for managing operational 
and safety risks remains crucial. The 
Company has come up with robust 
systems to regularly review and audit 
the 
facilities 
periodically 
through 
both physical and virtual methods. Its 
involvement in Standards Committees of 
statutory authorities, Oil Industry Safety 
Directorate (OISD), Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), etc. has 
helped to create safe business practices.

Data 
privacy and 
cybersecurity
R
Proper 
handling 
of 
sensitive data including 
personal 
information 
and 
business 
confidential data is of 
paramount importance 
to safeguard businesses, 
clients, 
infrastructure, 
and 
internal 
users 
from security threats. 
Any 
leakages 
or 
discrepancies 
could 
lead 
to 
adverse 
financial, reputational, 
and 
operational 
impacts.
The Cyber Security strategy at RIIL is 
‘Aligned to Business’ and ‘Marked to 
Threat’. RIIL follows a defence-in-depth 
approach, whereby multiple security 
technology solutions and processes are 
deployed to improve resilience against 
diverse and ever-evolving threats. Privacy 
by Design principles are followed across 
the personal data lifecycle, business 
processes and business applications at 
RIIL. Further, RIIL regularly benchmarks 
its cybersecurity and privacy practices 
against 
applicable 
laws, 
regulations, 
industry best practices and standards 
through internal & external attestations 
to ensure compliance and enhanced 
assurance.
Negative 
Implications

Business 
Ethics, 
Integrity and 
Transparency, 
Code of 
Conduct and 
Grievance 
Handling 
Mechanisms
R
Ethics 
and 
integrity 
have always been the 
core values to acquire 
stakeholder trust and 
establish 
a 
strong 
reputation. 
These 
elements are essential 
for a Company in order 
to sustain over the long 
term. Any   mishaps 
in business ethics or 
integrity can prove risky 
and can cause business 
instability.
The decisions relating to the employee 
Code of Conduct are monitored through 
the Ethics and Compliance Task Force 
(ECTF), 
which 
comprises 
Executive 
Director, Company Secretary and Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
of 
the 
Company. 
The Company has established a vigil 
mechanism and a whistle blower policy 
for its employees and directors. The 
whistle-blower can make a protected 
disclosure through an e-mail or dedicated 
telephone line or a letter to the ECTF or to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Negative 
Implications
8
Regulatory 
issues and 
compliance
R
The foundation upon 
which the Company’s 
image 
is 
built 
is 
compliance. It is crucial 
for the Company to 
maintain 
regulatory 
compliance 
in 
order 
to 
foster 
confidence 
among its stakeholder 
groups and to ensure 
that 
its 
operations 
are 
compliant 
with 
applicable 
laws 
in 
order to prevent legal 
violations.
The Company has adopted a digitally 
enabled 
comprehensive 
compliance 
management framework. Effective control 
and efficient oversight by the senior 
management is ensured by cascading 
the responsibility matrix till the last 
performer of the activity. The Company’s 
Code of Conduct, training as well as 
focus on ensuring 100% compliance and 
continuous monitoring have enabled a 
mature, 
digitally-enabled 
compliance 
framework.
