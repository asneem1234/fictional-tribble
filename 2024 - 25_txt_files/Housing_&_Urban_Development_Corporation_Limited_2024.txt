Risk Management
Risk
Risk 
management 
involves 
a 
systematic 
process 
to 
identify, 
evaluate, 
treat, 
monitor, 
and 
communicate risks so that the 
organization can operate securely, 
make 
informed 
decisions, 
and 
achieve long-term success.
Risk management is needed to 
protect business from unexpected 
disruption, make smarter decisions, 
comply with laws, and ensure 
long-term growth. By effectively 
managing risks, HUDCO aims to 
attain financial stability, public trust, 
and sustainable development.
HUDCO 
mitigates 
risks 
by 
implementing 
robust credit appraisal 
systems, securing state 
guarantees, and closely 
monitoring 
project 
execution 
to 
prevent 
defaults and delays to the 
extent possible. Strategic 
risks are managed by 
staying 
responsive 
to 
policy 
changes, 
while 
reputational 
and 
data 
risks 
are 
being 
addressed 
through 
transparent governance, 
cybersecurity measures, 
and 
stakeholder 
engagement. 
Further, 
HUDCO 
has 
framed 
a 
Risk 
management 
Policy 
addressing 
all 
these 
aspects 
and 
periodic review of the 
risks identified on these 
aspects are being held 
with corrective, preventive 
actions. 
Together, 
these practices ensure 
HUDCO's stability and 
long-term sustainability.
Company’s income 
will see positive 
enhancement as 
Risk management 
improves profits 
by cutting losses, 
improving 
efficiency, ensuring 
compliance, and 
enabling smarter, 
business decisions 
with appropriate 
risk mitigation 
measures. For 
companies 
like HUDCO, 
it safeguards 
public funds 
while supporting 
sustainable and 
profitable growth.

Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
Investing in the skills, knowledge, 
health, 
and 
capabilities 
of 
employees -is a powerful opportunity 
for any business to drive growth, 
innovation, and long-term success. 
Human 
capital 
development 
is 
an opportunity for businesses to 
unlock higher productivity, foster 
innovation, reduce costs, and build 
a strong, adaptable workforce. It 
turns employees into key drivers 
of 
competitive 
advantage 
and 
sustainable growth.
HUDCO 
gives 
utmost 
importance 
to 
its 
employees and believes 
that they are one of the 
key pillars of growth. 
Hence, constant efforts 
are 
made 
to 
make 
employees more engaged 
in their contributions to the 
company, by increasing 
their 
willingness 
to 
contribute by taking care 
of their professional as 
well as personal needs 
like 
upgrading 
skills 
through 
well-designed 
training 
programmes 
and 
health 
initiatives 
taken in terms of medical 
facilities made available 
to all employees. There 
are various steps and 
initiatives 
taken 
for 
improving 
the 
safety& 
health of employees from 
time to time. 
Positive implication 
is foreseen as, 
when a company 
helps its people 
grow, the people 
help the company 
succeed — which 
leads to more 
profits.

Community 
Development
Opportunity
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR) is one of the most effective 
ways for a business to contribute 
to 
community 
development 
because 
it 
allows 
companies 
to use their financial resources, 
expertise, and influence to address 
critical 
social, 
economic, 
and 
environmental challenges. Through 
CSR initiatives, businesses can 
support the construction of essential 
infrastructure like schools, toilets, 
hospitals, and shelters, directly 
improving 
living 
conditions 
in 
underserved areas. CSR plays a 
transformative role in uplifting entire 
communities.
HUDCO 
has 
a 
well-
defined 
CSR 
Policy 
addressing the identified 
areas of service to the 
community. 
HUDCO’s 
CSR efforts are helping 
communities 
grow 
stronger 
by 
improving 
housing, 
sanitation, 
education, health, and 
the environment. These 
initiatives 
reflect 
its 
commitment to inclusive 
urban development and 
a better quality of life 
for all, especially the 
underserved.
Positive implication 
is foreseen as the 
bonds fostered with 
community and 
institutions engaged 
in community 
development 
Community 
development 
promoted through 
CSR helps increase 
a company’s profits 
in the long run by 
building customer 
loyalty, employee 
engagement, brand 
value, stakeholder 
trust, and business 
sustainability. It 
turns social good 
into strategic 
business 
advantage.

Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security 
Risk
Risk
Data privacy and cybersecurity are 
material risks because they can 
significantly impact a company's 
operations, finances, legal standing, 
and reputation. In today’s digital age, 
managing these risks is essential 
for maintaining stakeholder trust 
and most importantly, business 
continuity. We need to manage 
data privacy and cybersecurity to 
safeguard information, comply with 
laws, protect the organization from 
attacks, and preserve public trust. 
HUDCO has set in place 
an Information and Cyber 
Security 
Policy 
which 
provides structure and 
direction for protecting 
information 
systems 
and any other available 
forms of information from 
a wide range of threats 
including cyber-attacks in 
order to ensure safeguard 
information 
assets, 
minimize damage and 
business continuity.
In response to the cyber-
attacks, 
management 
at HUDCO has set up a 
strategy to protect its IT 
assets from cyber-attacks 
and respond to any cyber-
attacks, threats in a timely

5.
Specific commitments, goals and 
targets set by the entity with defined 
timelines, if any.
The Principle of Accountability is reflected in the fact that being a Central Public Sector 
Enterprise (CPSE), HUDCO’s operational and financial targets for the Financial Year are 
set annually as per internal Business Review Meetings as well as taking into consideration 
the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) guidelines issued by the Department of Public 
Enterprises (DPE), Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The MoU is signed annually 
with annual targets, between HUDCO and its Administrative Ministry i.e. MoHUA. 
The MoU framework for 2024-25, consists of 12 parameters, with each assigned specific 
weightage, adding up to a maximum of 100 marks. It also outlines certain compliance 
requirements, with penalties in the form of negative marks for any non-compliance. An 
overall score equal to or exceeding 90 marks qualifies the enterprise for an ‘Excellent’ MoU 
rating.
The Company also enters into MoUs with various state governments, other CPSEs, 
Research institutions, etc. towards business development. 
The Company had set a target of framing its ESG Policy in Financial Year 2024-25 reflecting 
its commitment to positively impact the environment, customers, employees and the 
community at large and adopt sustainable business practices. As a responsible organisation, 
we recognise our role in complementing the efforts of Govt. of India in achieving the 2030 
SDG goals as well as Net Zero goal by 2070.
6.
Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals, 
and targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
As an internal performance monitoring mechanism, the Board of the Company is apprised 
about the status of actual achievements vis-à-vis the MoU targets on a quarterly basis and 
thus the performance is being monitored every quarter and in case there are any gaps, the 
same is directed by the Board for follow up and achieve excellent performance.
By the end of the Financial Year, the performance of the Company is evaluated by 
Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), Ministry of Finance, Government of India every 
year based on MoU targets fixed between the Company and Administrative Ministry.
HUDCO has been rated as “Excellent” by DPE for Financial Year 2023-24, based on its 
outstanding performance against the MoU targets set by DPE. The Company is once again 
expected to be rated as excellent for Financial Year 2024-25, subject to final evaluation by 
DPE, MoF, Govt. of India.
The Company formulated its ESG Policy in July 2024. The Company has also received 
the ‘ESG Rating of 50/100’ for Financial Year 2024 from National Stock Exchange (NSE) 
Sustainability Ratings & Analytics which certifies that the Company demonstrates a stable 
Sustainability position. Further development and a structured approach across sustainability 
dimensions would yield stronger and sustainable outcomes.

Statement by director responsible 
for the Business Responsibility 
Report, 
highlighting 
ESG 
related challenges, targets, and 
achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure)
As a key enabler of the Government of India’s vision for Viksit Bharat @2047, HUDCO is 
committed to building a resilient and inclusive urban India through a sustainable business 
model. By financing affordable housing, green infrastructure, and climate-resilient urban 
services, HUDCO integrates sustainability at the core of its operations—driving long-
term value creation while advancing environmental stewardship, social equity, and good 
governance. HUDCO’s sustainability vision is deeply embedded in its vision and mission to 
provide affordable housing and infrastructure to underserved communities, while aligning 
with national and global environmental and social goals.
HUDCO, as a techno-financing CPSE, encourages projects which are environmentally 
safe and secure. The Company ensures that the projects funded by it meet the necessary 
parameters towards environmental protection, for which necessary stipulations have been 
incorporated at the appraisal stage.
The Company supports projects that cater to economically weaker sections (EWS) and 
low-income groups (LIG), thereby contributing to social equity and inclusive growth 
under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). It finances green and resilient 
infrastructure such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, and public 
transportation, helping improve urban quality of life and environmental outcomes.

The Company has increasingly aligned with green finance principles. Notably, it executed 
a pioneering climate finance transaction certified under ICMA’s Green Loan Principles, 
marking a significant step in sustainable financing. HUDCO encourages the adoption of 
energy-efficient technologies and green building practices in housing and infrastructure 
projects, supporting India’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.
Through HUDCO’s Human Settlement Management Institute (HSMI), it conducts training, 
research, and policy advocacy on sustainable habitat development, resilience, and smart 
cities.
The Company’s commitment to social goals also reflected in its Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) activities, which focus on environmental conservation, health, 
education, and livelihood enhancement. HUDCO, being an energy conscious organization, 
has taken various initiatives in the direction of energy conservation on a continuous basis.
Towards commitment to governance goals, the Company has set high standards of 
corporate governance with ‘Code of Business Conduct and Ethics’; Fair Practice Code; 
highest standards of IT security, cybersecurity, and data privacy; and fair, uniform and 
universal disclosure and dissemination.
HUDCO integrates Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its 
operations by supporting climate-resilient infrastructure, affordable housing for vulnerable 
populations, and responsible urban planning that prioritizes sustainability and equity. The 
Company has put in place its ESG Policy with an aim to contribute its share to sustainable 
development and responsible corporate citizenship.
However, ESG related challenges remain, particularly when it comes to integrating and 
reporting on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors due to issues such 
as: data measurement and reporting with limited availability of robust mechanisms for 
tracking and measuring environmental metrics like GHG emissions, water usage, and 
waste generation, particularly for a financing Company; multiple audits and oversight by 
auditing and oversight bodies creating a complex compliance environment which may divert 
focus from proactive ESG integration; and absence of a single, comprehensive codified 
law specifically addressing all ESG-related matters in India, which can create ambiguities. 
Therefore, for more effective ESG compliance, there is a need for developing more 
standardized ESG metrics and reporting frameworks as well as giving greater autonomy 
for CPSEs in their ESG journey. By addressing these challenges, CPSEs can not only 
meet regulatory requirements but also enhance their reputation, attract conscious investors, 
improve operational efficiency, and contribute more effectively to India’s sustainable 
development goals by 2030 as well as Net Zero goal by 2070.

Type of Waste
Mechanism
Plastics (including

Not Applicable - Company being NBFC does not produce any plastic waste.
E-waste
In HUDCO, a process is being followed for the Disposal of IT hardware and related items.
Upon identification, items deemed obsolete, unserviceable, or beyond repair (damaged) are 
firstly declared as unusable/unserviceable with the approval of the competent authority.
Subsequently, bids or quotations are invited for disposal of said items—either through the 
Government e-Marketplace (GeM) or from the open market, depending on the Written Down 
Value (WDV) of the items.
In cases where the disposal materials are non-recyclable (desktops/laptops/printers, etc.) or 
hazardous (damaged batteries, etc.), the process involves obtaining an e-Waste Disposal 
Certificate from hired e-waste vendor or recycler, in compliance with environmental and safety 
regulations.
Hazardous waste
Not Applicable - Company being NBFC does not produce any hazardous waste.
Other Waste
HUDCO has a guideline for disposal and weeding out of old files, records, documents and other 
scrap material like plastics, iron etc. In accordance with those guidelines, committee is constituted 
at different levels (depending on the amount/WDV of unusable/old assets to be sold off). 
Waste upto the extent of Rs. 50,000/- on each occasion is sold to any local buyer/vendor on 
limited quotation basis (normally not less than three) with the approval of the Competent Authority.

consistently involved HUDCO in the implementation of numerous schemes by entrusting responsibilities such as desk 
and site scrutiny, monitoring, and channelizing government subsidies etc.
Under the flagship programme Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), HUDCO has been designated as one of the 
Nodal Agencies for channelizing Government of India subsidies under the “Interest Subsidy Scheme (ISS)” vertical. A

implementing agencies to bridge funding gaps.
In collaboration with MoHUA, HUDCO organized a national-level workshop on PMAY, which involve participation from 
senior state government officials, parastatal agencies, and others. The workshop emphasized the need for a structured 
approach to expanding the affordable housing ecosystem through both government and private sector participation.
Furthermore, HUDCO is a member of the Technical Assessment Committee (TAC), responsible for evaluating applications 
for Performance Appraisal Certificates (PACs) for innovative construction technologies. This role supports the adoption 
of new technologies by developers and implementing agencies, who are eligible for additional central grants as per 
government guidelines.

Inherent Limitations
The preparation of the BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations 
about the relevancy of the information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, and energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amount and metrics.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the 
procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000, 
“Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information,” issued by the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with 
the Reporting Criteria. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, whether due to fraud or error and responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical 
procedures, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion/conclusion
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional and skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed 
and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable 
assurance opinion.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance 
opinion.

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgement, including an assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the information subject to reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding the information subject to reasonable assurance and the 
engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the information subject
