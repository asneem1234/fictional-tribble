Workplace Safety
Risk
Workplace safety is crucial, as 
inadequate measures can result 
in accidents that harm both 
employees and the organization. 
Such incidents may lead to 
serious injuries and spread of 
infections to employees working 
in laboratories. This may result 
in  higher absenteeism and 
productivity loss and even 
loss of life. The Company 
demonstrates its commitment 
to the safety and environmental 
stewardship through a 
comprehensive safety policy 
that addresses all aspects of 
workplace safety.
Personnel working in labs may 
be exposed to risks from various 
chemicals, infectious materials, fire 
hazard, electrical shock, gas leak 
etc. The environment is also at risk 
of being contaminated by hazardous 
materials used and wastes generated 
in the labs. Safety in labs therefore 
includes protection of both personnel 
and the environment from hazardous 
materials. The Company’s detailed 
safety manual outlines policies 
which cover appropriate measures 
for all lab operations under its 
jurisdiction including hazards and 
their mitigation plans and training 
of staff. This manual outlines the 
use of sharps, disposal of bio-waste, 
reagents and other wastes generated 
in the labs in accordance with local 
and national regulations.  Annual 
health checkups are mandatory for 
technical staff handling samples.
Records of accident/incident/injuries 
of lab personnel is maintained. This 
record is analysed with the purpose 
of effectively controlling repetitions 
and preventing future events. 
Employees working in labs are 
provided with essential safety gear, 
including eye wash stations, gloves, 
lab coats, goggles, fire sprinklers, and 
extinguishers. Stringent disinfection 
protocols ensure a clean and 
hygienic work environment. Regular 
fire drills are conducted to train staff 
in evacuation procedures and clarify 
their roles during emergencies.
Additionally, the Company strictly 
complies with Bio Medical Waste 
Management Rules.
Negative implications: This may 
result in increased workplace 
accidents. Situations where 
injuries persist can lead to loss 
of revenue.
2
Employee 
Training and 
development
Risk
Training is essential for business 
success, as inadequately trained 
employees are prone to poor job 
performance and higher levels 
of work-related stress. A lack 
of proper training on Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
and process guidelines can 
pose significant risks, such as 
inaccuracies in the testing of 
patient samples. Well-defined 
and clear SOPs are vital to 
ensure consistency, precision, 
and efficiency in lab operations.
The Company firmly believe that 
personnel are the most important 
resource and their wellbeing, safety  
and development is of its utmost 
importance. Personnel of the 
Company are appropriately trained to 
achieve quality outcomes in the labs 
and produce accurate, reliable, and 
timely test results keeping safety at 
the top of the priority.
The Company places significant 
emphasis on fostering employee 
growth and has invested in 
various training and development 
programs. These initiatives include 
comprehensive induction training 
for all new joiners, providing them 
with the understanding of the 
organization’s policies and practices, 
along with functional training, 
compliance training, and online 
learning modules.
Negative implications: 
Insufficient or inadequate 
training can lead to reduction in 
operational efficiency impacting 
the profitability and revenue of 
the Company.

Opportunity
Placing a priority on employee 
welfare brings advantages to the 
employees and the organization 
as well. It fosters a positive work 
environment, leading to enhanced 
job satisfaction, boosted morale, 
and increased motivation to 
excel. Incentive programs can 
help in motivating employees 
to perform at their best, achieve 
strategic goals, and improve 
overall Company’s performance. 
Additionally, the Company 
demonstrates a strong 
commitment to its employees’ 
well-being through 
various initiatives such as 
comprehensive mediclaim policy 
and accident insurance for 
frontline employees.
-

initiatives are crucial for 
attracting, retaining, and 
nurturing talent. 
4
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Energy efficiency is one of the 
top most priority for the Company 
and by optimizing energy 
consumption, the Company can 
achieve significant savings. 
Moreover, energy-efficient 
practices help lower greenhouse 
gas emissions, reinforcing the 
Company’s commitment to 
mitigating the human impact on 
climate change.
-
Positive as energy management 
presents a valuable opportunity 
for the Company to enhance 
its operational efficiency while 
reducing costs. By adopting 
innovative energy-efficient 
technologies and practices, the 
Company can achieve long-term 
savings, improve sustainability 
credentials, and meet regulatory 
standards. 
5
Fire Safety
Risk
A fire incident can severely 
disrupt lab operations, leading to 
potential damage to equipment, 
loss of critical samples, and 
delays in ongoing tests. 
The Company demonstrates its 
strong commitment to safety by 
installing a robust Fire Alarm system 
and equipping all lab operation with 
Fire Extinguishers. Furthermore, 
regular fire safety training sessions 
are organized for staff, underscoring 
the Company’s dedication to maintain 
a safe and secure workplace.
The Company also places evacuation 
plans at noticeable areas for 
employee safety and awareness.
Negative implications: Fire 
safety is critical, as fire incidents 
can lead to severe risks, 
including harm to personnel, 
damage to lab equipments, and 
loss of valuable samples. Such 
events can halt operations, 
compromise safety, and incur 
significant financial losses.

and lasting connections with 
the community. Through its 
diverse CSR initiatives, the 
Company focuses on addressing 
social challenges, fostering 
sustainability, and empowering 
underprivileged sections of

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link: 
	
The company has meticulously developed a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) tailored specifically for its IT 
Services. The primary objective of this plan is to facilitate uninterrupted operations from an alternate location in the event of 
unforeseen circumstances or disruptions at the primary site. When the Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan is activated, the company’s 
IT systems seamlessly transition to the DR facility, strategically located in a different seismic zone. This geographical separation 
enhances the resilience and stability of the IT infrastructure. The BCP plan encompasses several key objectives:
1.	
Timely Business Recovery:
	
	
The plan aims to restore business operations within the agreed-upon timeframe outlined in the policy terms. This ensures 
minimal disruption and enables the company to swiftly resume operations.
2.	
Continuous IT System Functionality:
	
	
The BCP plan guarantees that IT systems continue to function seamlessly from the alternate location until the primary site 
is fully restored. This uninterrupted availability of IT services is essential for maintaining business continuity and mitigating 
the impact on critical operations.
3.	
Crisis Response Guidelines:
	
	
The plan includes detailed guidelines on how the company should respond during crisis situations. These guidelines assist 
in managing and mitigating potential risks and challenges associated with disruptive events
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard:
