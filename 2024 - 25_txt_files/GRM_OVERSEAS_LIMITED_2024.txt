(R/O)
Rationale for identifying
the risk/ opportunityt
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the risk 
or opportunity (Indicate positive 
or negative implications)
1
Environmental 
Risk
Risk
Climate change has a direct impact on 
agriculture, particularly on paddy cultivation. 
Variations in rainfall patterns, temperature shifts, 
and extreme weather events can adversely affect 
crop yields and grain quality.
While these environmental risks 
are largely external and beyond 
the Company’s control, GRM 
ensures continuity of operations by 
maintaining diversified sourcing, 
investing in supply chain resilience, 
and optimizing production planning.
Negative – Disruptions in raw 
material availability and quality could 
impact procurement costs, margins, 
and export commitments.
2
Product 
Quality and
Food Safety
Risk
Neglecting product safety and quality resulting 
from contaminated raw materials, product 
defects from human or equipment errors, and 
non-compliance with hazardous substance 
regulations, misleading / insufficient product 
labelling —posing serious risks to consumer 
health and safety, can impair consumer decision-
making, damage brand reputation, and erode 
consumer trust. Inadequate packaging safety 
further increases the risk of product misuse or 
contamination.
Adoption of global food safety 
standards (BRC, ISO, HACCP), 
regular audits, and traceability 
systems. Additionally, regular 
internal and third-party audits 
are conducted to ensure strict 
compliance with these standards.
Negative – Product Recalls, or 
non-compliance with regulatory 
standards  can lead to fines and 
penalties, legal complications and 
reputational damage. It may erode 
consumer trust, affect purchase 
decisions, and ultimately impact
brand loyalty and sales.
3
Increase in 
demand on 
Basmati Rice
Opportunity
Following the government’s ban on the export of 
Non-Basmati rice, international buyers have shifted 
their focus to Basmati rice, creating a strong surge 
in demand. This presents a significant market 
expansion opportunity for the Company.
-
Positive – May Increased sales 
volume, improved realizations, and 
potential for wider international 
market penetration.
4
Agricultural 
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk
The Company’s rice production is heavily 
dependent on the timely and consistent 
availability of high-quality paddy. Disruptions 
in agricultural supply chains, particularly due 
to inadequate engagement with farmers, can 
adversely affect raw material quality, pricing, and 
production schedules.
The Company through its Research & 
Development cell and dedicated field 
staff, regularly engages with farmers 
to promote good agricultural practices, 
enhance yield, and ensure quality 
compliance. This includes on-ground 
guidance, training, and crop monitoring 
to strengthen supply chain reliability.
Negative – Unstable supply or poor 
crop quality can lead to increased 
procurement costs, production 
delays, and potential revenue 
impact.
 • ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
5
Workforce
Health,
Safety
and
Wellbeing
Risk
As the Company’s most valuable resource, 
employee safety and wellbeing are of paramount 
importance. This is accomplished by assessing 
and controlling health and safety risks across 
the operations. Unsafe conditions can result in 
workplace accidents, loss of productivity, and 
legal non-compliance.
The Company emphasis on 
placing safety as a pre-requisite 
across all its operations. Further, 
the Company also takes various 
measures to ensure the health and
wellbeing of employees by resorting 
to variousinterventions through 
health awareness programs.
Negative - Any kind of injury in our 
operations is considered as a
significant negative outcome for our
operations. There can be financial 
risk as well in case of any major 
incident.
6
Innovation
and 
Technology
Opportunity
Technological advancements and continuous 
innovation enable the Company to improve 
product quality, enhance operational efficiency, 
ensure food safety, and reduce environmental 
impact. Embracing innovation helps GRM 
maintain competitiveness and respond to 
evolving customer expectations.
Not Applicable
Positive – Leads to improved 
market share, cost savings, product 
differentiation, and long-term 
sustainability benefits.
7
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
Safeguarding the security of the data and the 
entire value chain, particularly customers is 
important for our business operations. Any data 
breach may lead to leakage of the Company’s 
sensitive data resulting into frauds, business 
disruptions and continuity.
The Company adopts appropriate 
IT controls and security systems, 
access restriction protocols, regular 
backups, and employee training 
to ensure compliance with data 
protection standards and mitigate 
cyber security threats.
Negative – Data breaches may 
result in penalties, regulatory action, 
reputational damage, and potential 
loss of stakeholder trust.
8
Customer 
Satisfaction & 
Marketing
Opportunity
There is a growing demand for branded, 
hygienic, and quality-assured food products in 
both domestic and international markets. GRM 
Overseas Ltd., with its strong brand portfolio 
(e.g., Himalaya River, Tanoush and 10X Classis) 
and wide distribution network across India and 
abroad, is well-positioned to capitalize on this 
trend and expand its customer base.
Not Applicable
Positive - Enhanced customer trust 
and satisfaction leads to increased 
brand loyalty, repeat purchases, 
market penetration, and improved 
margins.
9
Ethical 
Business 
Practices
Risk
Non-compliance with corporate governance 
norms, ethical standards, or regulatory 
requirements can lead to legal penalties, 
stakeholder distrust, and reputational damage. 
For a listed company like GRM Overseas Ltd., 
maintaining high standards of integrity is
essential for long-term sustainability, investor 
confidence, and global partnerships.
The Company has adopted a robust 
governance framework, including 
a Code of Conduct, Whistle-
blower Policy, Anti-bribery and 
Anti-corruption mechanisms, and 
compliance monitoring systems. 
Periodic trainings and board-level 
oversight ensure adherence to 
ethical standards across all levels 
of the organization.
Negative – Instances of non-
compliance or unethical conduct 
may attract financial penalties, 
litigation, or investor fallout. Positive 
– Strong ethical governance 
enhances brand reputation, investor 
trust, and regulatory goodwill.
