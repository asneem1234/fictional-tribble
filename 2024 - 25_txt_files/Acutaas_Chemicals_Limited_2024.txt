Management
Risk
Chemical production is a water 
intensive industry owing to its water 
usage in its day-to-day operations. 
Water scarcity is a significant risk for 
businesses that rely on water for their 
operations. Water scarcity can lead 
to disruptions in business operations, 
supply chains, and increased costs 
of raw materials, which can all have 
financial implications. Water scarcity 
can also pose a threat to the health 
and safety of employees and the 
local community, which could result 
in legal and reputational risks.
Water is a crucial resource and 
we are committed to conserve it. 
One of our plants has zero liquid 
discharge and treated water reused

To uphold these values, the company has implemented a robust Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy, which explicitly prohibits any form of

The Vigil Mechanism is equipped with adequate safeguards to protect the identity and rights of employees who report concerns, ensuring that 
they are not subject to any negative consequences for their actions. The company assures full protection for whistleblowers against retaliation, 
discrimination, or harassment.
To further reinforce our commitment to transparency and ethical governance, no personnel within the company have ever been denied access

10.	 Health and safety management system:
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No).
Yes, the Company has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) management system across all its manufacturing 
facilities. This system is designed to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all employees and contractors. The OHS management 
system is fully integrated into daily operations, with coverage extending to 100% of the Company’s facilities.
The system includes rigorous safety protocols, regular risk assessments, employee training, and ongoing monitoring to prevent workplace 
accidents and to promote the well-being of all personnel.
a.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
Yes. As part of our ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System and SA 8000 Standard, we have 
implemented a structured Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Risk Management (HIRAC) process. This process covers both 
routine and non-routine activities and includes qualitative and quantitative assessments of hazards related to our operations, including 
the handling and use of hazardous chemicals.
Assessments are reviewed regularly, and mitigation plans are developed for high-risk areas to ensure the safety of our workforce. To 
maintain compliance and identify opportunities for improvement, we also conduct third-party safety audits every two years, as required 
by applicable legal regulations.
Health and safety is recognized as one of the key material issues for the Company. We have established dedicated Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) and internal practices to carry out due diligence and risk assessments, ensuring robust safety governance across 
all operations.
The key processes involved in hazard identification and risk assessment include:
	y
Hazard and Risk Assessment – We conduct both qualitative and quantitative assessments to identify potential hazards across all 
operational activities, with particular focus on the use of hazardous chemicals and high-risk areas.
	y
Routine and Non-Routine Assessments – Hazards are evaluated regularly through routine assessments, as well as for non-routine tasks 
or changes in processes, to account for any new or emerging risks.
	y
Development of Mitigation Plans – For areas identified as high-risk, we develop and implement targeted mitigation strategies to 
minimize or eliminate the associated hazards. These plans are continuously monitored for effectiveness.
	y
Third-Party Safety Audits – In line with legal regulations and our commitment to safety, we conduct third-party safety audits every two 
years. These audits help ensure compliance with established safety standards and identify areas for further improvement.
This comprehensive approach ensures that all risks are appropriately managed, safety measures are effective, and we remain in compliance 
with health and safety regulations, safeguarding the well-being of our workforce.
b.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks?
	
Yes, the Company has established robust processes to empower workers to report work-related hazards and remove themselves from 
potential risks.
	y
Safety Committees – A dedicated safety committee is constituted at each plant location. Employees are encouraged to report any 
hazards or unsafe conditions to the committee, which is responsible for addressing these concerns promptly and taking corrective actions.
	y
Daily Safety Meetings – In addition to formal reporting channels, all employees are given the opportunity to raise work-related 
concerns and discuss safety incidents during daily meetings conducted at each plant. This platform ensures open communication and 
a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating risks.
	y
Right to Remove Themselves from Risks – Employees are empowered to remove themselves from situations that they perceive as unsafe 
without fear of reprisal. This aligns with our commitment to a safety-first culture and ensures that workers' well-being is always prioritized.

Operations work is conducted under controlled conditions with appropriate safety measures in place. This system is integral to preventing 
workplace incidents and maintaining a high standard of safety.
We have implemented a robust Accident Management System, requiring all employees to promptly report any accidents, incidents, near 
misses, or unsafe conditions/acts. Each report triggers a thorough investigation to determine the root cause, followed by the implementation 
of preventive and corrective actions to avert future occurrences.
Our Health and Safety induction program is mandatory for all new hires and is facilitated by our Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) 
department. This training includes comprehensive safety protocols and emergency procedures. In addition, we conduct regular safety mock 
drills to ensure that employees are well-prepared to respond swiftly and effectively in emergency situations.
Our commitment extends to adherence to all relevant standards and regulations, including ISO standards, the Factory Act, the Environment 
Protection Act, and the Pollution Prevention Act. We routinely implement best practices such as Risk Assessment, Workplace Exposure 
Measurement, and regular medical checkups to uphold a safe working environment.
Emergency preparedness is a critical component of our safety strategy. We have developed and regularly review emergency response plans 
to address potential unforeseen events, ensuring swift and effective action when needed.
By fostering a culture of safety and continuous improvement, we are dedicated to maintaining a secure and healthy workplace for all 
employees. Our proactive measures, training programs, and adherence to regulatory standards underscore our commitment to the well-being 
of our workforce.

harassment in the workplace.
To support the effective implementation of this policy, we have established Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs). These committees are

reporting channels, ensuring they can raise concerns without fear of retaliation. The policy also specifies the corrective actions to be taken 
against offenders, including appropriate disciplinary measures that align with the severity of the violation.
Crucially, our policy includes protections for the complainant. Employees who report incidents of discrimination or harassment are assured 
that they will not face any form of retaliation, discrimination, or adverse consequences from management or colleagues. We are committed to 
ensuring that employees who come forward with complaints can do so with confidence, knowing their grievances will be addressed impartially 
and without any negative repercussions.
The Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy is a key component of our broader commitment to creating a workplace where all employees 
feel safe, respected, and valued. We take all necessary steps to safeguard the rights and well-being of every individual in our organization, 
ensuring that any issues are swiftly and effectively resolved.
