Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with 
a comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and 
accountability.

1
Energy and 
Emission 
Management
Risk
Carbon 
emissions 
across 
Brainbees 
e-commerce 
and 
supply chain operations stem 
primarily from its reliance on 
electricity 
as 
a 
key 
energy 
source, fugitive emissions from 
air conditioning systems and 
fire extinguishers, and the use 
of diesel generators (DGs) as 
an alternative energy source. 
This creates risks related to high 
costs, increased emissions, and 
potential 
misalignment 
with 
evolving customer expectations 
for sustainable brands.
Conduct 
internal 
energy 
audits 
to 
identify 
inefficiencies. 
Upgrade 
to 
energy-efficient 
systems 
such as LED lighting and 
HVAC. Implement automation 
and sensor-based lighting to 
optimise energy use. Retrofit 
buildings with insulation and 
high-efficiency windows to 
minimise heating and cooling 
loads. Transition to renewable 
energy 
sources, 
including 
installation of solar panels at 
selected warehouses.
Work 
with 
third-party 
logistics (3PL) partners who 
have 
sustainability 
goals 
aligned with Brainbees to 
reduce emissions across the 
supply chain.

Opportunity Adopting 
circular

principles 
in 
product 
design, 
packaging, 
and 
end-of-life 
management enables Brainbees 
to minimise waste, extend product 
value, 
and 
reduce 
resource 
dependency. 
Initiatives 
such 
as recyclable packaging, take-
back programmes, and durable 
home brands products can lower 
environmental 
impact, 
drive 
operational efficiency, and appeal 
to 
sustainability-conscious 
consumers seeking responsible 
parenting choices.
Process optimisation to reduce 
packaging material usage and 
waste 
generation. 
Promote 
paperless 
operations 
and

authorised 
partners 
wherever feasible.

Climate 
Change
Risk
Brainbees has potential risks 
related 
to 
climate 
change, 
including 
both 
physical 
and 
regulatory 
impacts. 
Extreme 
weather events, such as floods, 
storms, and heatwaves, pose 
physical risks to its warehouses 
and stores across the country, 
potentially disrupting operations, 
damaging 
infrastructure, 
and 
increasing 
costs. 
Additionally, 
climate change-related regulatory 
pressures could lead to stricter 
environmental 
laws, 
further 
impacting operational efficiency 
and increasing compliance costs.
Enhance energy efficiency 
in 
warehouses 
through 
the installation of sensor-
based lighting. Deploy solar 
energy panels at a selected 
facility to reduce reliance 
on non-renewable sources. 
Design business continuity 
plans and climate-resilient 
infrastructure at warehousing 
and fulfilment centers to 
ensure operational stability.

Human 
capital 
development
Risk
The need for regular hiring across 
Brainbees 
stores 
nationwide, 
coupled 
with 
the 
continuous 
requirement 
for 
training 
and 
upskilling, presents a challenge 
in 
managing 
human 
capital. 
Risk of inefficient recruitment 
processes and limited employee 
development 
has 
a 
potential 
impact 
on 
service 
quality, 
decreased customer satisfaction 
and 
operational 
inconsistency 
and long-term business growth.
Comply with labour laws to 
ensure statutory minimum 
wages. 
Offer 
competitive 
salaries and ESOPs to retain 
key talent. Provide health 
insurance 
coverage 
to 
mitigate medical risks and 
improve employee wellbeing.
Implement 
structured 
onboarding, 
learning 
and 
development 
(L&D) 
frameworks

Human 
Rights and 
Labour 
Management
Risk
Human 
rights 
and 
labour 
management 
risks 
across 
Brainbees value chain, particularly 
due to its white labeling practices, 
pose challenges. Reliance on 
third-party manufacturers can 
result in potential risks such as 
exploitation of workers, 
poor 
labour conditions, and violations 
of human rights, which could 
result in reputational damage, 
legal consequences, and a loss 
of consumer trust in the brand’s 
ethical standards.
Apply 
EHS 
standards 
to 
ensure supplier and vendor 
compliance. Enforce strong 
policies against child labour. 
Maintain grievance redressal 
mechanisms

Brands 
products such as Tree-Free & 
Eco-friendly diapers, can result in 
improved product safety, reduced

Privacy and 
data security
Risk
Brainbees collects customer data 
across both online and offline 
channels, making robust privacy 
and 
data 
security 
practices 
essential to maintaining consumer 
trust. Weak data governance or 
cyber vulnerabilities could expose 
the Company to cyber incidents, 
leading to regulatory penalties, 
reputational 
damage, 
and 
customer attrition. Such breaches 
would 
undermine 
Brainbees’ 
digital platform credibility and 
threaten 
long-term 
business 
stability.
Encrypt all customer data 
immediately. 
Maintain 
a 
complete 
record

Risk
Brainbees

state, and national laws. The 
complexity of complying with 
diverse and evolving regulations 
poses a risk, as failure to adhere 
to these legal requirements could 
lead to penalties, legal disputes, 
and reputational damage.
Regularly 
monitor 
compliance with applicable 
laws. Deploy a compliance 
management 
tool 
and 
periodical certifications from 
relevant departments to track 
and ensure adherence to 
evolving legal requirements. 
Ensure regional teams are

To the Board of Directors of Brainbees Solutions Limited,
1.	
We have undertaken to perform Reasonable Assurance 
engagement, 
for 
Brainbees 
Solutions 
Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Company” or “FirstCry”) 
vide our engagement letter dated April 14, 2025 in 
respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed 
below (the “Identified Sustainability Information” 
or “BRSR Core indicators”) in accordance with the 
Criteria stated in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability 
Information is included in the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) of the Company for 
the financial year ended March 31, 2025.
	
This engagement was conducted by our multidisciplinary 
team including assurance practitioners, environmental 
engineers and specialists.
2.	
IDENTIFIED SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION
	
Our scope of Reasonable Assurance consists of 
the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to 
our report. The reporting boundary of the BRSR is 
as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General 
Disclosures of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed by 
way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, 
where applicable.
	
Our Reasonable Assurance engagement was with 
respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information 
only and we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to earlier periods, and any elements thereto, 
and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.
3.	
CRITERIA
	
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the 
Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
	
The criteria used is the “BRSR Core”, which is a subset 
of the BRSR, consisting of a set of Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”)/ metrics under nine Environmental, 
Social and Governance (“ESG”) attributes, as per 
the format of BRSR Core specified in Annexure 17A, 
read with the format of BRSR and the Guidance Note 
given in Annexure 16 and 17, respectively, of the SEBI 
Master Circular for ‘compliance with the provisions of 
the SEBI LODR Regulations, 2025 by Listed Entities’ 
dated November 11, 2024, and the SEBI Circular on the 
’Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core’ dated 
December 20, 2024 (collectively referred to as the “SEBI 
Circulars”).
4.	
MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
	
The Company’s management is responsible for 
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability Information including 
the reporting boundary of the BRSR, disclosing 
environmental information basis operational control 
approach, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations including the SEBI circulars, related to 
reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, 
identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of 
the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal controls 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the 
measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, 
which is free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
	
The Management and the Board of Directors of the 
Company are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s compliance with the requirements of LODR 
Regulations and the SEBI Circular in relation to the 
BRSR Core.
5.	
INHERENT LIMITATIONS
	
The absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non- financial information allows for different, but 
acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between companies.
	
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core 
metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG 
emissions, water footprint, energy footprint and waste. 
Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support 
our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the 
amounts and metrics.
6.	
OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
	
We have maintained our independence and confirm 
that we have met the requirements of the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/
