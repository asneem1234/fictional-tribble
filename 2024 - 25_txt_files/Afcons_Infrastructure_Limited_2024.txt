Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with 
a comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and 
accountability.

(Indicate

1.
Energy 
and GHG 
Emissions
Risk
The Company’s operations, including 
construction activities, rely heavily on 
energy-intensive processes and fossil 
fuels, leading to high energy costs 
and substantial GHG emissions. 
These 
emissions 
contribute 
to 
environmental 
degradation 
and 
climate change, subjecting Afcons 
to regulatory risks such as stricter 
carbon 
emission 
standards 
and 
carbon pricing. Additionally, failure 
to manage emissions effectively 
can harm the Company’s reputation 
among environmentally conscious 
stakeholders, reduce competitiveness 
in ESG-driven markets, and increase 
operational costs for compliance and 
energy efficiency initiatives.
•	 Regular 
analysis 
of 
operations with respect 
to 
the 
present-day 
technologies and adoption 
of 
technologies 
that 
reduce GHG emissions.
•	 Using grid power to the 
extent possible
•	 Working with experts to 
introduce 
tailor 
made 
solutions 
that 
ensure 
emissions from plant and 
equipment are within the 
applicable standards.
Negative
2.
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk
The 
Company’s 
operations 
rely 
heavily on water for activities such 
as concrete production, curing, dust 
suppression, and tunneling, leading 
to increased water consumption. 
This dependency may affect project 
timelines. Furthermore, inadequate 
wastewater 
treatment 
planning 
can result in improper discharge, 
causing environmental degradation, 
regulatory penalties, and reputational 
damage.
•	 Deploying 
conventional 
wastewater 
treatment 
systems at all project 
locations
•	 Prioritising 
the 
use 
of 
recycled 
water 
in 
operations to the extent 
possible
•	 Using 
additives 
such 
as High Range Water 
Reducing Admixtures in 
concrete and polymer-
based drilling fluids for 
conserving water
Negative
3.
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Occupational Health & Safety is a 
critical aspect of the Company’s 
operations, 
given 
the 
high-risk 
nature of its infrastructure projects. 
Hazards such as working at heights, 
excavation, 
and 
handling 
heavy 
machinery pose risks of injuries or 
fatalities if not managed effectively. 
These risks can lead to increased 
project downtime, legal liabilities, 
•	 Providing 
training 
on 
Occupational Health and 
Safety to 100% of work 
force
•	 Conducting regular safety 
audits in line with ISO 
45001:2018 
to 
ensure 
upkeep of robust safety 
management system

result in regulatory penalties and 
reputational damage.
•	 Providing 
training 
on 
Behavior-based 
Safety 
to all the employees to 
ensure the sustainability 
of 
Health 
and 
Safety 
systems
•	 Adoption 
of

4.
Workforce 
Well-being & 
Development
Opportunity
Prioritising workforce well-being and 
development enhances productivity, 
safety, and job satisfaction, fostering 
a more resilient and motivated 
team. 
Comprehensive 
training 
programs equip employees with 
advanced skills, driving innovation 
and efficiency in project execution. 
Health and wellness initiatives reduce 
absenteeism and improve overall 
performance, while a strong focus 
on diversity and inclusion cultivates 
a collaborative and adaptable work 
culture. Investments in workforce 
development not only strengthen 
employee loyalty and retention but 
also position the Company as an 
employer of choice, contributing to 
sustainable growth and long-term 
success.

5.
Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Risk
Maintaining 
high 
standards 
of 
product quality and safety is critical 
due to the scale and complexity of 
the projects handled by the Company. 
Any compromise in quality or safety 
can 
lead 
to 
structural 
failures, 
legal liabilities, and damage to the 
Company's reputation. Additionally, 
non-compliance with global safety 
standards or client expectations may 
result in project delays and financial 
penalties.
•	 Implementation of a robust 
Quality 
Management 
System in line with ISO 
9001:2015 and OHSMS in 
line with ISO 45001:2018

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Infrastructure is fundamental to building a sustainable world. Yet the construction sector’s dependence on resource-
intensive materials like cement and steel poses environmental challenges. Therefore, all stakeholders, share the 
responsibility of adopting smarter, more efficient solutions. At Afcons, we believe engineering excellence and sustainability 
are not competing priorities; they are mutually reinforcing goals.
For over six decades, Afcons has delivered complex infrastructure projects with an unwavering focus on operational 
excellence. Our teams go the extra mile to optimise methods, often working closely with clients to co-create solutions that 
are not only cost-effective but also reduce material use and environmental impact. Through these innovations, including 
the use of alternative materials like polymer-based drilling fluids or project-specific admixtures, we consistently pursue 
innovations that benefit both performance and sustainability.

A key driver of this consistency is our institutional knowledge. Afcons has been recognised as a Most Innovative Knowledge 
Enterprise (MIKE) every year since 2018 at Indian and Global levels and previously won its predecessor award, the Most 
Admired Knowledge Enterprise, at Indian, Asian, and Global levels. This sustained recognition reflects the maturity of 
our systems and the strength of our knowledge-driven culture. Through this platform, we capture insights from diverse 
geographies and domains and ensure our workforce receives comprehensive training.
We’re also embracing emerging technologies to future proof our operations. IoT based tracking is helping us monitor 
equipment performance and fuel efficiency in real time, while Building Information Modelling (BIM) is being piloted to 
enhance project planning and delivery.
These strengths are amplified by our growing Green Business in line with the FTSE Green Revenues Classification System 
2.0 (GRCS 2.0)*, which makes up, nearly 60% of our current order book lies in metros, water, rail, and hydroelectric projects. 
As policy and investment in sustainable infrastructure accelerate, we’re confident this share will continue to rise.
Afcons is at an inflection point. With strong systems, a culture of learning, and deep execution capabilities, we are well-
positioned to lead the next phase of our ESG journey with greater purpose and impact.
We thank you for your continued trust and support as we build a more sustainable future together.

10. 	 Health and safety management system	
a. 	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No)	
Yes
	
If yes, the Coverage such systems?	
	
Afcons has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) across 
all its operational locations, including project sites, camps, workshops, and offices.
	
This system is aligned with the requirements of ISO 45001:2018 and is underpinned by a robust Environment, Health, 
and Safety (EHS) policy.
	
To ensure consistent performance and risk mitigation, the OHSMS provides a structured framework for identifying, 
assessing, and controlling workplace hazards. The system undergoes periodic third-party audits and is certified for 
compliance with ISO 45001:2018, reflecting our commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for 
all personnel.	
b.  
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?	
	
The Company’s Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) embeds risk management as a core 
function across all operational levels. Each work location is required to integrate Health, Safety, and Environment 
(HSE) risk management practices into daily operations.
	
The risk management process includes five essential steps:
1.	
Hazard identification
2.	
Risk assessment and evaluation
3.	
Risk mitigation planning
4.	
Implementation of control measures
5.	
Monitoring and documentation
	
These processes are carried out routinely and adapted for non-routine activities, with active participation from cross-
functional teams including design and planning engineers, execution engineers, plant and equipment specialists, 
EHS personnel, and site workers.
	
For high-risk tasks, site-specific Safe Work Method Statements and Permit to Work systems are developed and 
implemented prior to commencement, ensuring preventive controls are clearly defined and communicated.	
c.  
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks? (Yes/ No)
	
Yes
	
Afcons has established formal processes that enable workers to report work-related hazards and withdraw 
from potentially unsafe situations without fear of reprisal. The AfconSafe mobile application facilitates 
real-time reporting of hazards, unsafe conditions, or near misses. Additionally, trained safety champions 
are deployed at work fronts to proactively identify and escalate risks for prompt corrective action.
Worker participation is institutionalised through multiple platforms:
•	
Project HSE Committees (with worker representation)
•	
Daily toolbox talks and safety briefings
•	
Weekly subcontractor and safety walkthrough meetings
•	
Monthly safety committee meetings
These mechanisms ensure continuous feedback, active involvement of the workforce in safety governance, and the 
integration of frontline insights into risk mitigation plans.

Every project location is equipped with Occupational Health Centres and first-aid facilities. In addition, the Company 
has established tie-ups with nearby hospitals and nursing homes to ensure priority access to medical services.

12.  Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
Afcons is committed to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment for all employees and workers across its operations. 
Safety is embedded as a core value and is driven by a collaborative approach involving HSE, Human Resources, 
Administration, and medical teams.
	
Recognising the high-risk nature of infrastructure projects, each site is mandated to develop a site-specific HSE Plan. These 
plans identify hazardous activities, evaluate associated risks, and define preventive and control measures. Compliance is 
ensured through regular internal audits and third-party assessments, with heightened focus on high-risk locations.
	
The Company leverages digital tools such as the AfconSafe app for real-time hazard reporting, learning dissemination, 
and performance monitoring. Additionally, Afcons has institutionalised advanced practices such as:
•	
The National Safety Rating System (NSRS) by the National Safety Council
•	
Behaviour-Based Safety (BBS) programs
•	
Role- and risk-specific training modules
•	
Innovative learning platforms like SME-led Masterclasses and Activity-Based Classrooms (ABC)
	
These structured efforts have not only enhanced on-ground safety performance but also earned Afcons multiple 
accolades, including the NSC 5-Star Rating, CII Safety Awards, British Safety Council (BSC) recognitions, ROSPA Awards, 
and national-level Safety Shields, affirming the Company’s industry leadership in occupational health and safety.

PRINCIPLE 4 Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders.
(This principle highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement. Companies should consider the interests and perspectives 
of all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate. They 
should also be responsive to stakeholder concerns and feedback.)
Essential Indicators
1.  
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
Stakeholder interaction is a key element of Afcons’ sustainability management practices. Through open, honest, and 
consistent dialogue, Afcons gains a deeper understanding of stakeholder concerns and expectations. These insights 
are vital in shaping ESG initiatives that are not only impactful but also truly aligned with what matters most to those 
the Company serves and works with. Afcons conducts stakeholder engagement at regular intervals and additionally as 
deemed necessary based on evolving priorities or emerging issues.
At Afcons, our stakeholder engagement process involves identifying key stakeholders across our projects and operations, 
ensuring purposeful communication to align expectations. We emphasise deliberate engagement through regular 
interactions, track and measure our engagement efforts, and strive to create shared value for all parties involved.

Leadership Indicators
1.  
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
At Afcons, stakeholder consultation on ESG topics is an integral part of our materiality assessment and sustainability 
governance framework. During the materiality assessment exercise conducted in FY 2024-25, we engaged a wide range 
of internal and external stakeholders through surveys and focused group discussions. This consultation helped identify 
key ESG topics relevant to both stakeholders and the business.
	
The insights gathered through these engagements were systematically analyzed and mapped using the double 
materiality approach. The outcomes were then consolidated and presented to the CSSR Committee of the Board, which is 
responsible for implementing the Sustainability Policy at Afcons. This ensures that the Board remains informed and aligns 
with stakeholder expectations, enabling strategic decision-making that balances business priorities with sustainable 
development goals.
2.  
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes/No).	
Yes
 
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated 
into policies and activities of the entity.  
	
Stakeholder consultation is actively used by Afcons to support the identification and management of environmental and 
social topics.
	
During the materiality assessment exercise for FY 2024-25, Afcons engaged with various stakeholder groups through 
surveys, interviews, and discussions. The insights gathered from these consultations helped validate and prioritise key 
environmental and social issues relevant to both stakeholders and the business. These inputs were reviewed by the 
internal teams and the CSSR Committee of the Board, and were incorporated into the Company’s policies, strategies, 
and sustainability initiatives to ensure they remain responsive to stakeholder expectations and evolving external 
challenges.	
3.  
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalised 
stakeholder groups.
	
At Afcons, engaging with vulnerable and marginalised stakeholder groups is a core component of our Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. We adopt a participatory approach, actively collaborating with local communities 
to understand their specific needs and challenges. Through ground-level consultations, we gather insights on issues 
related to education, healthcare, livelihood, and basic infrastructure. Based on these findings, Afcons implements targeted 
interventions, either directly or through partnerships with trusted agencies and local institutions. These initiatives are 
designed to create lasting, positive impacts, ensuring that our CSR efforts are inclusive, effective, and sustainable. 
Continuous stakeholder feedback is incorporated into the planning and execution of projects, reinforcing our commitment 
to responsible and equitable development.

Afcons follows a structured waste management process across all its project locations, with an emphasis on segregation, 
safe storage, and responsible disposal in accordance with applicable regulations.
	
Waste generated during daily operations is promptly segregated at the source under the supervision of activity-specific 
personnel. The segregated waste is collected and handed over to centralised site stores, where records are maintained 
by the designated stores in-charge. All waste materials are securely stored in designated areas until they are handed over 
to authorised recyclers or disposal agencies, in compliance with statutory requirements and supported by documented 
waste manifests.
