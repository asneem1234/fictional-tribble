1.
Air emissions 
and air quality 
management
Risk
The key parameter in 
measuring environmental 
performance is the control of 
emissions. The systems must 
be effectively maintained to 
ensure that emissions remain 
within the prescribed limits. 
Exceeding these limits could 
negatively affect community 
perception and result in 
regulatory consequences.
The Company is committed in 
preventing, reducing and mitigating 
air emissions and minimizing 
environmental impact through 
comprehensive policies. Initiatives 
include periodic air quality 
assessments, continuous monitoring 
of stack emissions to ensure effective 
emission control and continuous 
improvement in environmental 
performance.

2.
Occupational 
Health 
and Safety 
(OHS) and 
Environment 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Employees in manufacturing 
of ABS and SAN Resins 
are exposed to various 
inherent operational risk, 
including high pressure and 
temperature operations, 
hazardous substances and 
heavy machinery. Developing 
a strong safety culture 
is critical for proactively 
mitigating these risks, which 
if unaddressed, can lead 
to financial losses, medical 
costs, legal liabilities, and 
reduced productivity.
Leveraging our vast 
manufacturing expertise, 
we have safety culture that 
prioritizes employee well-
being. This not only enhances 
operational efficiency but 
also instils confidence in 
the workforce, leading to 
improved product quality and 
cost savings over time.
The Company is committed to 
achieve zero harm, for which it 
has established robust incident 
reporting and investigation 
procedures supported by a 
Corrective and Preventive Action 
(CAPA) system. Routine safety 
meetings are conducted to review 
plant inspections, risk assessments, 
job safety analyses, and the 
implementation of the permit-to-work 
system.
Advanced methodologies such 
as HAZOP studies, Quantitative 
Risk Assessments (QRA) and 
Environmental Impact Assessments 
(EIA) are also integrated into 
our safety framework. These 
discussions lead to the development 
of targeted remedial action plans 
aimed at mitigating operational 
risks and enhancing overall safety 
performance.

Business 
Ethics, 
Compliance, 
and 
Governance
Risk
Risk: Non-compliance 
with regulatory and legal 
requirements may impair	
the Company’s reputation.
Strong and fully embedded 
commitment to ethical 
business practices 
strengthens our competitive 
edge in the market. By 
fostering a culture of integrity 
and accountability, we build 
trust with stakeholders, 
investors and the 
communities we serve.
Non-compliance can result 
in serious consequences, 
including legal penalties, 
reputational damage, and 
operational disruptions. As 
such, maintaining robust 
compliance systems and 
regularly updating internal 
controls is critical to 
safeguarding the Company’s 
operations and long-term 
sustainability
Key Managerial Personnel are 
responsible and accountable for 
ensuring effective, timely, and 
appropriate compliance with 
regulatory and legal mandates.
We operate in accordance with 
a well-defined Code of Conduct, 
which sets the standard for ethical 
behaviour across the organization.
To ensure transparency and 
accountability, the Company has 
implemented a Whistle Blower Policy. 
This policy empowers employees, 
vendors, and channel partners to 
confidentially report any concerns 
related to unethical business 
practices without fear of retaliation.
The Company internally tracks and 
monitors applicable compliance 
obligations and renewal 
requirements. Regular internal 
and external audits, along with 
periodic reviews, are conducted to 
verify adherence to all regulatory 
mandates. The Company has 
also assigned Key Managerial 
Personnel with the responsibility 
of ensuring effective, timely and 
appropriate compliance with legal 
and regulatory requirements. This 
structured approach strengthens 
our governance framework and 
reinforces our commitment to 
operating with integrity and in full 
compliance with the law(s).

Waste 
Management
Risk
Manufacturing processes 
inevitably produce hazardous 
waste.
Effectively managing the 
transportation, treatment, 
storage and disposal of 
such waste has both legal 
and operational challenges, 
requiring strict adherence to 
environmental regulations
Waste management practices 
includes (i) segregation at source, (ii) 
responsible disposal of hazardous 
waste and (iii) reducing waste.
Waste disposal is carried out through 
appropriate methods ensuring that all 
waste is directed through authorised 
disposal channels adhering to laws 
and regulations of respective State 
Pollution Control Boards.
The Company is fully committed to 
efficient, safe and responsible waste 
management.

Water 
Stewardship
Opportunity
The Company’s operations 
require significant amount of 
water for various industrial 
processes, which may have 
a impact on local water 
resources. Recognizing 
this, the Company is 
committed to responsible 
water management as a 
critical component of our 
sustainability strategy.
The Company believes in ensuring 
optimum utilisation of water 
resources through efficient usage. 
There is ‘zero discharge’ outside 
the plants and the treated water is 
used for development of green belt. 
The Company propose to recycle 
and reuse through RO system in 
expansion project.
As part of our commitment to 
environmental sustainability, we 
have implemented a Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) system. It ensures 
that all wastewater is treated, 
recycled and reused within the 
facility, with no liquid waste being 
discharged into the environment. 
The treated water is then utilized 
for the development of our green 
belt, enhancing the ecological 
environment around our facility

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk and

Regular interactions with 
Stakeholders has helped in 
having long lasting business 
relationships resulting in 
responsible and sustainable 
operations.
Suppliers are an integral 
part of our business. We

performance and conduct of 
our supply chain partners.
By fostering relationships 
built on responsibility, 
integrity, and compliance, we 
strengthen the entire business 
ecosystem. Our approach 
ensures that all partners 
operate in alignment with 
our values and standards, 
contributing to ethical,

Recognizing this, we have embedded Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles at the core of 
our operations. The introduction of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) framework by 
SEBI for the top 1000 listed companies from FY 2022–23 marks a critical milestone in advancing sustainability 
reporting in India. We welcome this shift, which places non-financial disclosures on par with financial reporting, 
enhancing transparency and accountability in corporate performance.
	
We recognize that building a sustainable and resilient business is a long-term commitment. We continue to 
reassess and align our policies and practices with national and global ESG standards. Our Board and senior 
leadership remain actively engaged in steering these efforts, ensuring that we deliver value not just to our 
shareholders, but to all stakeholders.
	
As we move forward, we remain committed to transparency, accountability, and innovation in driving our ESG 
agenda, while contributing meaningfully to the broader vision of sustainable development.

process breakdowns and arresting spills & leakages, the Company was in a position 
to reduce waste generation by around 10%.
The packaging bags are used multiple (3 – 4) times for transportation of HRG. The 
bags are disposed in a phased manner, resulting in its reduced consumption.
E-waste
Disposed through authorized recycler base or through license vendor on requirement. 
Battery waste is returned to Supplier under buyback and records are maintained.
Hazardous waste
The Company has entered into agreement with PCB, Madhya Pradesh and Re-
sustainability Ltd, Udaipur for disposal of hazardous waste generated at respective 
plant site.

manufactures intermediate products that serve as input materials for downstream industries, the packaging 
materials used become pre-consumer plastic waste for our customers. These materials are either recycled by the 
customers or managed through authorized channels.
	
In alignment with its EPR obligations, the Company has implemented a robust waste management system. All 
waste packaging materials are handled through Waste Management Agencies (WMAs) and processed by CPCB-
certified recyclers, in accordance with the EPR plan submitted to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
