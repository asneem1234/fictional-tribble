move not only reduces our carbon footprint but also sets a great example for embracing renewable energy sources.
	
Moreover, our efforts to manage water resources responsibly are evident through reuse of wastewater for gardening within our premises 
after treatment in our Sewage Treatment Plants (STP).
	
Safety is at the core of all our operations, and our robust Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) system ensures that our employees and 
workers have a safe working environment. Our Safety initiatives, focusing on raising awareness and cultivating a safety-first culture 
through weekly dedicated training sessions, in nurturing a safe workplace.
