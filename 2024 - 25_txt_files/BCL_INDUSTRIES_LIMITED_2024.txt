Health and Safety Management System:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented 
by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage

Yes, BCL continues to strengthen its commitment 
to occupational health and safety through 
the development and implementation of a 
structured management system. This system is 
designed to ensure compliance with applicable 
legal requirements while fostering a safe and 
healthy work environment for all employees.
	
	
Recognizing that employee well-being is integral 
to operational excellence, the Company is 
focused on adopting industry best practices to 
proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks. 
Safety protocols are embedded across all work 
activities, and regular training sessions are 
conducted to build awareness and reinforce 
safe behaviors.
	
	
Periodic internal audits and evaluations guide 
the 
implementation 
of 
corrective 
actions, 
ensuring continuous improvement. Initiatives 
such as Safety Week and targeted awareness 
programs further promote a culture of safety, 
encouraging active participation and feedback 
from employees at all levels.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?  
	
	
BCL continues to advance its Environmental, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) practices through the 
adoption of a structured risk management 
framework. This framework is designed to 
systematically 
identify, 
assess, 
mitigate, 
and 
monitor 
EHS-related 
risks 
across 
all 
operational sites, with active participation from 
employees and workers.
	
	
As part of its proactive approach, the Company 
organizes regular health initiatives such as 
medical check-up camps including ECG, blood 
tests, dental screenings, and HIV & TB testing—to 
promote workforce well-being. Safety audits are 
conducted periodically to evaluate workplace 
hazards, and findings are used to inform targeted 
corrective actions.

training sessions and interactive programs 
such as “Spot a Hazard” exercises and Safety 
Week celebrations. Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) is routinely carried out 
across facilities, encouraging both employees 
and workers to contribute to risk elimination. 
Additional safety mechanisms, including the

structured 
mechanisms that empower employees and 
workers to proactively identify and report 
hazards. The Company has established clear

from potentially unsafe conditions and report 
work-related risks without hesitation.
	
	
To encourage active participation, initiatives 
such as the “Spot a Hazard” exercise are regularly 
conducted, fostering a culture of vigilance 
and accountability. Comprehensive training 
programs equip workers with the necessary 
knowledge to recognize hazards and take 
appropriate safety measures.
	
	
Workplace inspections are carried out at defined 
intervals—daily, weekly, or monthly—based on 
the nature of operations and associated risks. 
In addition, the Company has implemented 
an anonymous reporting system to ensure 
employees can report hazards, near-misses, 
and unsafe conditions without fear of retaliation. 
These efforts collectively support a safer, more

environment

continuous 
improvement in occupational health and safety.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
BCL Industries has taken a
significant initiative 
to produce ethanol 
exclusively from maize.
BCL Industries Limited’s decision to utilise maize as the principal feedstock 
for its ethanol production exemplifies its strong commitment to sustainability 
and environmental stewardship. By focusing on this renewable agricultural 
resource, the company is actively contributing to the development of 
cleaner and greener energy solutions. This strategic choice not only supports 
sustainable production practices but also aligns with BCL’s broader vision of 
fostering a more environmentally responsible future.
2.
BCL has proactively taken
initiatives to reduce 
the excessive usage 
of groundwater in its 
operations.
BCL is committed to minimizing excessive groundwater usage as part of its 
efforts to conserve vital water resources for future generations. This approach 
balances environmental stewardship with operational efficiency, ensuring 
that the company maintains effective processes while contributing positively 
to sustainable water management. By adopting responsible water use 
practices, BCL demonstrates its dedication to preserving natural resources 
and supporting long-term ecological sustainability.
3.
BCL has installed a power 
generation plant that 
runs primarily on paddy 
straw (parali) as fuel. This 
facility utilizes abundant 
agricultural residue to 
produce renewable 
energy, supporting 
sustainable operations. 
The initiative helps 
reduce environmental 
issues related to paddy 
straw burning by 
providing an eco-friendly 
alternative. Through 
this biomass-powered 
plant, BCL contributes to 
lowering dependence 
on fossil fuels and 
cutting greenhouse gas 
emissions, demonstrating 
its commitment 
to environmental 
sustainability and resource 
efficiency.
BCL leverages paddy straw, an agricultural byproduct, as a renewable fuel 
source to support sustainable energy production and decrease dependence 
on fossil fuels. This initiative helps alleviate the environmental harm caused 
by conventional disposal methods like open burning, which significantly 
contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By converting 
paddy straw into a valuable energy resource, BCL actively promotes 
cleaner energy solutions and reinforces its commitment to environmental 
sustainability and air quality improvement.
