Product Quality 
and Safety, and 
Data integrity
R
The 
Company 
acknowledges 
that issues related to product 
quality and safety, as well as 
data integrity, have the potential 
to affect its ability to meet 
customer demand and generate 
value 
for 
its 
stakeholders. 
The Company recognizes that 
problems concerning the quality 
and safety of its products, 
along with data accuracy, could 
potentially hinder its capacity 
to satisfy customer needs and 
create value for its stakeholders
A team of quality professionals is 
assigned 
to 
each 
manufacturing 
site, responsible for overseeing and 
facilitating 
the 
delivery 
of 
quality 
performance while ensuring continuous 
audit 
readiness. 
The 
Company 
leverages information technology to 
digitise and enhance the processes of 
quality assurance and quality control. 
It consistently adheres to a quality 
improvement and training programme 
that focuses on addressing historically 
known quality issues. Robust Corrective 
and Preventive Action (CAPA) procedures 
are implemented to investigate and 
address 
identified 
non-conformities. 
The Company also follows a stringent 
evaluation process for vendors and 
suppliers, assessing them against quality 
parameters and ensuring compliance 
with 
cGMP 
requirements 
mandated 
by 
industry 
regulatory 
standards. 
The Company uses technology to digitize 
and improve its quality assurance and 
control processes. It consistently follows 
a program for quality enhancement and 
training that targets previously identified 
quality issues.

Supply
R
Key raw materials are majorly 
single 
source 
dependency, 
and in case of stoppage of 
supply from vendor may impact 
operation/ 
procurement 
at 
higher prices
Procurement 
team 
identifies 
new 
vendors through various sources and 
has documented alternate approved 
vendors for few raw materials. The 
Company is in process to identify 
alternative vendor sources to mitigate 
risk 
of 
single 
source 
dependency. 
The 
procurement 
team 
finds 
new 
suppliers using a variety of methods 
and has a list of approved alternative 
suppliers for certain raw materials. The 
Company is currently working on finding 
more supplier options to reduce the 
risk associated with relying on a single 
source.

Yes. The Company operates an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) with a comprehensive three-stage system: primary,

operations. To enhance the treatment process, ozone is used as an additional method to remove organic compounds 
and contaminants. Following ozone treatment, a sophisticated two-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) process is employed. 
This process uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove dissolved salts, heavy metals, and other impurities from the 
treated water. The RO process is crucial for achieving high water purity and ensuring compliance with stringent quality 
standards. Additionally, the Company has a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) plant.

Yes, the Company has mad strategic changes to its energy sources. By transitioning to an LDO (Light Diesel Oil) fired 
boiler, it has optimized energy efficiency and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, a heat pump recovery chiller 
system now heats water up to 50 degrees Celsius for HVAC purposes, reducing dependence on the boiler. As a result, 
the Company has significantly reduced fossil fuel consumption, leading to a noteworthy decrease in greenhouse gas 
emissions. Furthermore, the Company has invested in a Solar Project to reduce reliance on traditional electricity sources, 
with further to expand its solar energy capabilities.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Solar Power Projects – 3 
MW & 0.625 MW (DC)
Commissioned renewable solar power 
plants to reduce dependency on non-
renewable electricity. Solar energy is 
utilized for plant operations
Achieved an average of 60-
70% annual electricity savings; 
substantial reduction in 
consumption of fossil fuel-based 
power.
2
Rainwater Harvesting 
During Monsoon
Captured and stored rainwater to 
reduce reliance on external borewell 
water during monsoon months. Water 
is filtered and stored in an underground 
tank system.
Reduced dependency on 
borewell water, contributing to 
groundwater conservation and 
cost savings.
3
Installation of 150 kg/hr 
Electrical Boiler Powered 
by Solar Energy
Installed a non-IBR electrical boiler 
for steam generation using excess 
renewable solar power, replacing 
conventional LPG or diesel-fired systems
For steam generation  renewable 
electrical powered used. Hence 
reduction in air pollution and use 
of more renewable electrical units 
rather than non renewable fuel

Installation of Variable 
Frequency Drive (VFD) 
for ETP Air Blower (24x7 
operation)
Implemented a VFD to modulate the 
blower speed based on the height of 
water in the equalization tank. Reduced 
energy usage and operational noise
Lowered electrical energy 
consumption and reduced noise 
pollution through demand-based 
operation.
5
Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP)
ETP comprises primary, secondary, 
and tertiary treatment stages, with 
additional ozonization to enhance 
treatment quality. Designed to comply 
with Maharashtra Pollution Control 
Board (MPCB) standards.
All effluent parameters meet 
MPCB norms, ensuring regulatory 
compliance and reduced 
environmental impact.
6
Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) System
Advanced ZLD setup with two-stage 
Reverse Osmosis (RO) and two-stage 
Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) to 
ensure no liquid discharge from the 
facility.
Zero discharge to CETP (Common 
Effluent Treatment Plant); 
complete recycling of wastewater 
within the plant
7
Reuse of RO Reject Water
RO reject water is sent to the ZLD 
system and reused in cooling tower 
operations.
Increased water reuse, 
minimizing freshwater 
consumption and promoting 
circular water use practices.
8
Auto tube cleaning system 
for Chillers
Automated tube cleaning for chiller 
condensers improves thermal efficiency 
and reduces electrical load. Cleaning is 
done in-line without system shutdown.
Reduced electrical energy 
consumption of chillers due to 
improved heat transfer efficiency.
9
Installation of Hour Meters 
for Ultra-Filtration and RO 
Systems
Hour meters track daily operating hours 
of UF and RO systems to estimate water 
usage and create awareness among 
teams.
Promotes water conservation 
awareness; enables monitoring 
and control of water usage 
through runtime analysis.
