assessment, we are in the process of setting measurable targets to address these material issues in a focused and strategic 
manner.
We continue to advance transparency in ESG reporting and actively welcome stakeholder feedback as we pursue our 
sustainability goals.
Key environmental initiatives include transitioning to renewable energy sources, implementing efficient waste management 
systems, and reducing our carbon footprint. We have also successfully achieved ISO 14001:2015 certification for 
Environmental Management System, underscoring our adherence to international environmental standards. Additionally, we 
have commenced reporting of Scope 3 emissions, marking a significant step towards comprehensive climate accountability.
On the social front, we have made tangible progress in promoting diversity and inclusion. Gender diversity in our workforce 
has increased to 24%, and we have taken steps to foster a more inclusive workplace by hiring differently abled employees. 
Our proactive focus on wellbeing and professional development has resulted in a reduction in the attrition rate to 25%. 
Furthermore, around 90% of the beneficiaries of our CSR initiatives belong to marginalized and disadvantaged communities, 
reaffirming our commitment to inclusive growth.
In governance, we have voluntarily adopted enhanced practices, including the limited assurance of BRSR Core disclosures, 
demonstrating our focus on transparency and accountability. We are also proud to have appointed an independent woman 
Chairperson of the Board, further strengthening board independence and diversity.
These achievements collectively highlight our leadership in sustainability, responsible governance, and inclusive development. 
We remain committed to building a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient future for all our stakeholders.
Our progress is reflected in the CRISIL ESG ratings released in December 2024, wherein IIFL Capital has been rated ‘Strong’ 
for its ESG performance.

IIFL Capital Services Limited
Annual Report 2024-25 
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified 
Sustainability Information are as per the format mandated 
by the SEBI vide circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/
CIR/2023/122 dated 12th July 2023.
Management  Responsibility
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or 
establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability 
Information, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Sustainability 
Information, Identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the 
criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation 
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation 
of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability 
Information, which is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non- financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have maintained our independence and confirm that 
we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and have 
the required competencies and experience to conduct this 
assurance engagement.
The firm applies Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, 
“Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and 
Related Services Engagement”, and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion 
on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the 
procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 
Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 
3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, 
issued by the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard 
requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain 
limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability 
Information is free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the 
suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the 
Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information 
whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks 
as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope 
than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both 
the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding 
of internal control, and the procedures performed in response 
to the assessed risks.
The procedure we performed were based on our professional 
judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, 
inspection 
of 
documents, 
evaluating 
the 
appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting 
policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling 
with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the 
procedures listed above, we:
	
Gained 
a 
comprehensive 
understanding 
of 
the 
Identified 
Sustainability 
Information 
and 
the 
corresponding disclosures
	
Reviewed Company's policies, and practices, pertaining to 
environment, social and governance.
	
Understood the appropriateness of the methods used for 
assumptions and estimations used by the Company for 
calculating and reporting purposes.
	
Identified potential risks of material misstatements in the 
Identified Sustainability Information.
	
Engaged with the Company’s management and relevant 
stakeholders to understand the reporting processes, key 
assumptions, and governance mechanisms in place.
	
Conducted substantive testing on a sample basis to 
verify the accuracy and reliability of the Identified 
Sustainability Information.
175
Statutory Reports
Annual Report 2024-25 
	
Examined underlying records and conducted testing 
procedures, including recalculations, to validate reported 
sustainability information.
	
Reviewed the disclosures in BRSR Core to identify and 
assess any significant discrepancies between reported 
performance and source data/information.
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we 
do not express a conclusion on the same:
	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in 
the “Scope of Assurance”.
	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information 
(qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information.
	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period 
i.e. financial year 2024-2025.
	
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, 
aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided 
by the Company.
Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the Company’s Identified Sustainability 
information included in the BRSR Core for year ended 31st 
March 2025 are not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Criteria.
Restriction on Use
Our limited assurance report has been prepared and addressed 
to the Board of Directors of IIFL Capital Services Limited 
at the request of the Company solely, to assist Company in 
reporting on Company’s sustainability performance and 
activities. Accordingly, we accept no liability to anyone, other 
than the Company. Our deliverables should not be used for any 
purpose other than addressees of our Deliverables. The firm 
neither accepts nor assumes any duty of care or liability for any 
other purpose or to any other party to whom our Deliverables
