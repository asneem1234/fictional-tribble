4.
Worker 
Health & 
Safety
R & O
Inadequate 
waste 
management 
infrastructure poses significant occupational 
health and safety risks for workers engaged 
in waste collection and disposal. Enhancing 
our waste management systems with 
advanced technologies and rigorous safety 
protocols not only protects our people but 
also ensures operational efficiency and 
regulatory compliance.
AWHCL 
implements 
regular 
safety drills and establish clear 
safety 
protocols. 
Continuous 
employee training and awareness 
programmes are essential to 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
safety 
practices. Additionally, a robust 
incident 
reporting 
system 
in 
place to address and investigate 
accidents 
promptly, 
with 
corrective 
actions 
taken 
to 
prevent recurrence.

5.
Supply Chain 
Management
R
Supply 
Chain 
Management 
involves 
mitigating risks associated with supplier 
sustainability and adherence to the Supplier 
Code of Conduct. Failure to effectively 
evaluate suppliers for ESG risks can lead 
to regulatory non-compliance, reputational 
damage, 
and 
operational 
disruptions. 
Additionally, neglecting local suppliers may 
result in missed opportunities for community 
engagement and increased supply chain 
resilience.
AWHCL needs to diversify their 
supplier 
network 
to 
reduce 
reliance on any single source. 
Implementing stringent supplier 
assessments 
and 
conducting 
regular 
performance 
reviews 
ensure quality and compliance. 
Additionally, 
developing 
and 
maintaining contingency plans for 
potential disruptions and fostering 
clear, proactive communication 
with suppliers are critical for 
risk 
mitigation 
and 
business 
continuity.
Negative
6.
Public 
Education 
and 
Awareness 
(IEC 
Activities)
O
By investing in educational initiatives and

on waste management, the organization

corporate citizen, drive positive social 
impact, and build stronger relationships with 
stakeholders.

engagement, improve productivity, and 
ensure

Regulatory 
Compliance
R
Regulatory 
compliance 
is 
critical 
for 
maintaining organizational integrity and 
avoiding legal repercussions. Failure to 
adhere to relevant regulations can result in 
significant financial penalties, legal liabilities, 
and 
reputational 
damage. 
Additionally, 
non-compliance may lead to operational 
disruptions and increased scrutiny from 
regulatory bodies.
Implementing 
comprehensive 
internal and external audits and 
monitoring systems helps ensure 
adherence and identify potential 
deviations 
early. 
Additionally, 
providing ongoing training for 
employees and maintaining clear 
documentation supports effective 
compliance and reduces the risk 
of violations.
Negative
9.
ESG 
Governance
R
ESG governance is integral to maintaining 
stakeholder trust and achieving sustainable 
growth. 
Inadequate 
governance 
in 
environmental, 
social, 
and 
governance 
(ESG) practices can expose the organization 
to reputational damage, regulatory penalties, 
and operational inefficiencies. Moreover, 
failure to effectively manage ESG risks may 
lead to decreased investor confidence and 
hinder long-term strategic objectives.
Regular audits and assessments 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
ESG 
standards and identify areas 
for 
improvement. 
Additionally, 
engaging 
stakeholders 
and 
integrating their feedback into 
ESG strategies help enhance 
transparency and effectiveness.
Negative
10.
Risk 
Management
R
Inadequate risk management practices can 
lead to unforeseen operational disruptions, 
financial losses, and reputational damage. 
Moreover, failure to proactively identify and 
mitigate risks may result in regulatory non- 
compliance and diminished stakeholders’ 
expectations.
Regular risk assessments and 
scenario planning help identify 
potential threats and evaluate 
their 
impact. 
Implementing 
robust monitoring and control 
mechanisms 
ensures 
timely 
detection 
and 
response 
to 
emerging risks, while ongoing 
training reinforces risk awareness 
across the organization.

5.	 Specific commitments, goals, and targets set by the 
entity with defined timelines, if any.
Antony Waste Handling Cell Limited has set clear ESG commitments 
with measurable targets and timelines, designed to be achieved 
in a phased manner. On the environmental front, the Company 
is progressively enhancing its Waste-to-Energy generation 
performance, with the goal of steadily reaching and ultimately 
surpassing a rated PLF of 80% over time. It is also scaling up the 
processing of Construction & Demolition (C&D) waste, with an 
initial target of 1,20,000 tonnes a year, which will subsequently 
be increased by 10% year-on-year. On the social front, AWHCL is 
working towards full coverage of employee and worker health and 
well-being, alongside phased implementation of comprehensive 
training on Human Rights and the Code of Conduct. The Company 
upholds strong governance through a code of conduct that applies 
to both its board members and senior management, establishing 
clear standards for ethical behavior and integrity at every level of 
leadership.
These commitments are being advanced by cross-functional teams 
comprising Business Development, Finance, Compliance, HR, IT, 
and Project Heads, with phased milestones in place to ensure their 
full realization eventually.
6.	 Performance 
of 
the 
entity 
against 
the 
specific 
commitments, goals, and targets along with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
At AWHCL, sustainability forms the core of our operations. We follow 
a circular approach by transforming Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) 
into Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF), Compost, and recyclable resources 
thus minimizing landfill dependency. Our transition to use cleaner 
energy continues to gain momentum, with share of renewable 
energy consumption increased from 48% in FY 2023-24 to 81% 
in FY 2024-25. We place the highest priority on workplace safety, 
having reported zero fatalities, and ensure that our infrastructure 
fosters a secure and enabling environment for all employees and 
workers across all facilities.
Strong governance practices guide our growth journey. To 
uphold integrity and transparency, our framework is overseen by 
Independent Director–led committees such as Audit, Nomination 
& Remuneration, and Stakeholder Relationship. These committees 
monitor critical functions, including overseeing the Vigil Mechanism, 
which provides employees and stakeholders with a safe channel to 
raise concerns and grievances responsibly.
We place importance on the ongoing growth of our workforce 
by offering regular training that strengthens their knowledge of 
responsible waste management practices. Alongside this, every 
employee participates in Code of Conduct training, reaffirming our 
commitment to ethics and integrity at all levels.

7.	 Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As the Director overseeing the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report at AWHCL, I am committed to embedding 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into every aspect of our operations. Over the past years, our journey 
has been defined by key milestones, valuable insights, and a culture of transparent reporting, enabling us to address both 
challenges and opportunities with clarity and purpose. 
Our focus remains on advancing sustainable waste management practices that reduce adverse environmental impact and drive 
resource efficiency. By lowering our carbon footprint, improving recycling outcomes, and leveraging innovative technologies, 
we continue to optimize resource utilization. Our waste-to-energy initiative exemplify this approach—converting waste into 
alternative fuel, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and reinforcing the circular economy. 
In FY2024-25, we achieved tangible progress across multiple fronts. More than 21,000 tonnes of high-quality compost were 
produced from organic waste and supplied to end-users. We have also supplied over 1.48 lakh tonnes of Refuse-Derived 
Fuel (RDF), resulting in more than 1.37 lakh tCO2e avoidance by cement companies. Further, our Construction & Demolition 
(C&D) waste processing facility recovered materials such as manufactured sand and aggregates, achieving an impressive 96% 
recycling rate. Through bio-mining of 300,000 MT of legacy waste, we reclaimed land and prevented leachate contamination. 
At our Kanjur facility, we have collected 18,524 kilolitres of rainwater, while PCMC utilized 86,762 kilolitres of treated water from 
the STP—significantly reducing our dependence on freshwater for operational needs. 
We place importance on creating safe, inclusive workplaces to enhance well-being for all our employees and workers. With 
full POSH compliance, comprehensive insurance coverage, and women-friendly facilities at the majority of our locations, we 
actively promote a culture of fairness and equity. Guided by our risk management approach, we have established SOPs across 
key functions to manage risks proactively, ensuring stakeholder views remain central to our actions.
We uphold the highest standards of governance through a strong foundation of ethics, adherence to regulations, and embedded 
risk management across all operations. A resilient governance framework ensures that every aspect of our operations remains 
closely aligned with our broader ESG priorities.

Leadership Indicators:
1.	
Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? 
(Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes; the Company is committed to proactively identifying and managing any conflicts of interest that may arise, particularly 
those involving members of its Board. In line with the Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI Listing Regulations, a comprehensive 
conflict-of-interest management protocol has been implemented. This framework requires directors to promptly disclose any 
material, financial, or personal interests in transactions or contracts with the Company, using the prescribed MBP-1 form. 
Such transparency allows the Company to evaluate and address any risks or partialities that might influence its governance or 
decision-making.
	
To maintain integrity and fairness, directors who declare a conflict of interest are required to recuse themselves from related 
discussions and voting procedures. The Company further reinforces ethical standards through a robust whistle-blower policy 
and a comprehensive code of conduct, encouraging the reporting of any violations, including undisclosed conflicts of interest, 
among directors and senior management. Collectively, these measures foster a culture of transparency, accountability, and 
exemplary corporate governance throughout the organization.

cut down on plastic waste through initiatives like source segregation and partnerships with local recycling centers.
	
A central pillar of our environmental commitment is preventing electronic products from ending up in landfills or being 
incinerated, as this can lead to pollution and health risks. Our e-waste management system channels used electronics to

of physical ability, to work effectively and comfortably. We deeply value the skills and contributions of our differently‑abled 
colleagues and remain committed to providing them with the highest quality facilities and support.
	
Building on our commitment to accessibility and inclusion, we are enhancing all remaining sites with ramps, handrails, and 
other physical aids in phased manner. These upgrades will ensure that future employees and workers with disabilities can 
navigate the workplace with ease and comfort. Beyond meeting the requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
Act, 2016, these initiatives reflect our genuine dedication to creating a supportive environment where everyone can thrive. We 
celebrate the richness of workforce diversity and remain steadfast in providing equal opportunities for all.

Yes, there is a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism available to all categories of employees

dedicated channels such as email addresses, contact numbers, HR portal access, and designated 
complaint boxes. 
Employees dissatisfied with the initial resolution may further escalate their concerns to senior management, 
ensuring every grievance receives appropriate attention and a timely response.
To reinforce transparency and protection, the organization conducts regular reviews of all received 
complaints. A specialized team investigates each issue thoroughly, compiling findings into reports for 
management follow-up. Regular audits help monitor the effectiveness of the process. 
The Whistle Blower Policy is available on the website of the Company at https://www.antony-waste.com/
docs/investors/corporate-governance/policies/Vigil_Mechanism_Policy.pdf which empowers employees 
to report concerns without fear of retaliation. 
Further, complete confidentiality is maintained throughout the redressal process, fostering a supportive 
and fair work environment for all employees and workers.

safeguarding its workforce and upholding the highest standards of workplace integrity. Through a blend of rigorous training, 
proactive risk assessment, and unwavering commitment to both physical and ethical well-being, the Company not only 
addresses immediate safety concerns but also nurtures a culture where respect, vigilance, and personal responsibility are 
integral to daily operations.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity? 
	
AWHCL actively engages employees in enhancing workplace safety by incorporating their feedback, analysing incident and

emerging risks, enabling swift and effective responses. Our comprehensive training programmes empower employees to 
recognise and address hazards, fostering a culture of safety that supports both operational resilience and employee well‑being. 
This integrated approach strengthens our governance practices, reduces operational risks, and reinforces our dedication to 
long‑term sustainable business performance.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
AWHCL is committed to fostering a safe and healthy workplace through robust safety measures, regular assessments, 
and continuous training. The Health & Safety Committee conducts periodic audits and reviews in high-risk areas to ensure 
compliance with regulations, supported by policy updates and a culture of continuous improvement based on feedback and 
incident reports. Daily Toolbox Talk (TBT) sessions, induction programmes for new workers, and regular safety pep talks with 
staff and contractors reinforce awareness across all levels of the workforce.
	
Employees undergo structured training on National Road Safety, First Aid, PPE usage, fire-fighting, multi-gas detection, 
boiler plant safety, conveyor safety, and snake-bite precautions. Sessions also address mechanical and electrical hazards, 
unsafe acts and conditions, Behaviour-Based Safety, Work Permits, Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), 
Lockout & Tagout (LOTO), and the use of insulated rescue sticks. Mock drills and HIRA documentation further strengthen 
emergency preparedness.
	
To safeguard operations, safety permits are issued only after verifying compliance with all requirements. Firefighting equipment 
is installed, maintained, and inspected regularly, while engineering controls such as safety guards on machinery, stringent 
illumination standards, and secured floor openings mitigate risks. Comprehensive records are maintained for first aid cases, 
incidents, lifting tools, pressure vessels, vehicles, insurance, and third-party audits, ensuring adherence to all EHS statutory 
requirements. PPE is issued with meticulous tracking, and first aid kits are inspected monthly.
	
Additionally, AWHCL addresses environmental health concerns through odour management and chemical application practices, 
backed by proper monitoring and documentation. Together, these measures demonstrate the Company’s unwavering commitment 
to the highest standards of workplace safety, health, and environmental responsibility.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation. 
	
At our PCMC WtE plant, over 86,750 kiloliters treated water from the sewage treatment plant is further purified through our 
in-house system and used as boiler feed water for steam generation, which powers turbines to produce electricity. Wastewater 
from this process is recycled for irrigation within the premises, supporting a green environment. This closed-loop approach 
not only conserves freshwater resources but also prevents water pollution, enabling us to achieve zero wastewater discharge. 
	
Complementing this, our other facility manages leachate generated from bioreactor landfills (BLF) and windrow composting. 
The leachate is collected through an HDPE pipeline network and directed to a raw collection pond for treatment. Using a 
microbe-based biological process followed by sand and activated carbon filtration, the effluent is purified to meet standards 
and reused for dust suppression and irrigation of green spaces.
	
To further enhance efficiency, we adopted a leachate recirculation system that reinjects treated leachate into BLFs through 
infiltration galleries. This maintains the necessary moisture levels for municipal solid waste decomposition, particularly in aging 
BLFs, while accelerating degradation and reducing emissions.
	
In FY2024-25, our Kanjur facility generated over 87,700 cubic metres of leachate, of which more than 53,900 cubic metres was 
recirculated and approximately 34,400 cubic metres was repurposed for dust suppression, compost washing, and gardening. 
These initiatives together reflect our strong commitment to closed-loop water management, reducing freshwater dependency 
and strengthening operational sustainability.

Yes, AWHCL has undertaken multiple initiatives to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In FY 2024–25, a total of 12,801 
tCO2e emissions were avoided through renewable energy deployment at the Kanjurmarg facility, PCMC WtE operations, and 
aerobic composting.
	
A key initiative includes the PCMC WtE Plant, commissioned in October 2023. This facility processes approximately 1,000 
tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day using technologies such as anaerobic digestion and biomass gasification. It 
generates around 14 MW of green energy, with 11.9 MW of net power exported to the grid. Notably, the Pimpri-Chinchwad 
Municipal Corporation became the first municipality to procure power under the Green Energy Open Access Rules, with over 
100 million units of green energy generated in FY2024-25.
	
At the Kanjurmarg site, AWHCL generated 4,342 MWh of renewable electricity. The facility has capacity to handle ~7,500 metric 
tonnes of waste per day through an integrated solid waste management system, including Material Recovery Facility (MRF) 
technology for waste segregation and bioreactor landfill. The landfill gas captured through BLF technology has generated 
approximately 960 KW of power, which is used for captive consumption.
