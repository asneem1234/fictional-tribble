Additionally, investors may raise their concerns through external grievance redressal platforms such as SEBI’s SCORES, the Centralized Public Grievance

In respect of bonds which are being serviced in-house at IFCI, all the complaints/grievances are replied by IFCI directly to investors. 
	
To ensure ease of access for investors, contact details of all R&TAs are also made available on IFCI’s website.
	
It is ensured that all investor grievances are resolved in a timely, transparent, and effective manner.

the investor complaints. Following steps are now in place to reduce investor grievances including proactive steps like updation of KYC, sending Buyback 
Intimation Form, sending details of unpaid/unclaimed amount, provision of online portal, offline request and request through email, simplification of
