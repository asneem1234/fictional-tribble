Environment
1
Air Emissions
Risk
Coal-based power plants emit a 
variety of pollutants, including 
sulfur dioxide (SOx), nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), and particulate matter (PM), 
which significantly contribute to air 
pollution. These emissions can lead 
to respiratory and cardiovascular 
diseases, thereby increasing 
morbidity and mortality rates among 
individuals residing in the surrounding 
communities.
We are consistently 
implementing innovative 
technologies to optimise 
coal utilisation and minimise 
air emissions. Additionally, 
we have installed Flue Gas 
Desulfurisation (FGD) units at 
all our operational plant sites.
Negative
2
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Improper disposal of waste can lead 
to the pollution of land, water, and 
air, posing significant regulatory and 
reputational risks over time. Sites 
with high pollution loads experience 
increased soil alkalinity due to the 
deposition of fly ash from thermal 
power plants. Additionally, these plants 
emit larger and heavier solid particles, 
which increase soil bulk density and 
subsequently decrease soil porosity. 
These pollutants can cause respiratory 
and cardiovascular diseases, thereby 
increasing morbidity and mortality 
rates among individuals residing in the 
surrounding communities. 
Effective waste management can be 
achieved through the reuse of waste as 
by-products.
We recognise the critical 
importance of waste segregation 
from the initial stages, and 
our control measures ensure 
that relevant information is 
meticulously tracked until the 
final disposal stage. 
We are committed to reducing 
single-use plastic usage, and 
approximately 88% of our 
power-generating units have 
received certification from the 
Confederation of Indian Industry 
(CII) for being single-use plastic-
free. 
Additionally, we have installed 
waste paper recycling units at 
our Tiroda, Kawai, and Udupi 
sites.

Lifecycle 
Management 
of Assets
Risk
Stranded assets in thermal power 
plants refer to those assets that are 
unable to achieve their original  
economic return due to changes 
associated with the energy transition. 
Several factors can contribute to 
as-sets becoming stranded, including 
new government regulations that 
limit the use of fossil fuels (such as 
carbon pricing), shifts in demand 
towards renewable energy due to lower 
energy costs, and legal actions against 
high emitters.
We consistently integrate 
technology-driven innovations 
and adopt relevant energy 
solutions to ensure business 
continuity.
Our efforts are dedicated 
to preserving our assets 
while enhancing operational 
efficiencies.

Biodiversity 
and Natural 
Resource 
Management
Risk
The construction of thermal power 
plants and extensive infrastructure 
can significantly alter local landscapes, 
impacting biodiversity and natural 
habitats. 
Coal-based power plants have an 
over-all detrimental effect on the 
environment. Species residing near 
these plants exhibit high mortality 
rates and reduced reproductive 
capabilities.
Our policy is committed to 
achieving the 'No Net Loss' 
goal. 
We have implemented a formal 
biodiversity management 
system to ensure the 
conservation of biodiversity 
across all our operations and 
projects.
Negative
5
GHG 
Emissions 
and Climate 
Change 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
operations can subject the business to 
scrutiny by regulatory bodies, NGOs, 
and activists for contributing to global 
warming, potentially impacting the 
company's financial performance. 
Shadow pricing enhances strategic 
planning and promotes low-carbon  
investments, energy efficiency 
solutions, and innovative technologies, 
thereby influencing internal behavior 
and capitalising on low-carbon 
opportunities.
We have developed a  
comprehensive four-fold 
strategy to mitigate the 
negative environmental 
impacts of our operations, 
there-by addressing climate 
change. This strategy includes 
strict compliance with 
standards and regulations, 
continuous measurement of 
our environmental footprint 
to set realistic targets, 
integration of emission 
reduction technologies across 
all operations, and diligent 
monitoring and reporting to 
ensure accountability for our 
performance and commitments.
Positive & 
Negative
6
Water  
Management
Risk
Water is a vital resource in thermal 
power plants, primarily used for 
cooling purposes. Ensuring responsible 
water consumption is essential to 
maintaining the business’s social 
license to operate. Implementing water 
conservation policies can help reduce 
water usage and minimise negative 
impacts on local water resources. 
Technologies such as closed-loop 
cooling systems and wastewater 
recycling can significantly enhance 
water efficiency with-in these plants.
We are dedicated to reducing 
our water footprint and 
minimising environmental 
impact through our Water 
Efficiency Management 
Programme. This initiative 
involves monitoring water 
usage, implementing efficient 
practices, and fostering a 
culture of conservation among 
employees. Key actions include 
the installation of low-flow 
fixtures, leak detection 
systems, regular audits, and 
process optimisation. We also 
prioritise wastewater quality 
through advanced treatment 
technologies and recycling 
programs, aiming to reduce 
reliance on potable water. 
Employee engagement is 
crucial, with regular training 
sessions and encouragement 
for suggestions. These 
measures are designed to 
promote sustainability within 
our organisation.

Risk and 
Crisis 
Management
Opportunity
Risk management is the systematic 
process of identifying, assessing, and 
mitigating threats or uncertainties that 
can affect an organisation. It involves 
analysing risks’ likelihood and impact, 
developing strategies to minimise harm 
and monitoring measures’ effectiveness. 
When an organisation develops a Risk 
management plan, it identifies risks 
across all attributes, which helps them 
to devise a strategy to manage and 
mitigate them. This helps in increased 
preparedness and awareness about 
possible risks in the future while 
creating long-term value for the 
stakeholders.

Security
Risk and 
Opportunity
Instances of information security 
breaches could lead to the loss of 
sensitive data of customers including 
personal information. It could also lead 
to negative publicity and increased 
media scrutiny resulting in a loss of 
stakeholder trust, company reputation 
and regulatory fines or penalties. 
By prioritising IT security and investing 
in robust defenses, APL can earn the 
trust of employees and customers, 
differentiate themselves from 
competitors and create a resilient 
foundation for long-term value 
creation.
We have implemented SOPs 
and policies, conducting 
periodic internal and external 
(third-party) audits and tests 
to check the resilience of the 
IT infrastructure from hackers, 
cyber-attacks, malware, etc.

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Effective supply chain management 
is essential in ensuring the smooth 
operation of thermal power plants. 
This involves sourcing high-quality raw 
materials, maintaining robust logistics 
networks, and fostering strong 
relationships with suppliers. Efficient 
supply chain management can reduce 
operational risks, lower costs, and 
enhance the overall reliability of the 
power plant.
Increased ESG risks across the 
supply chain leading to operational 
disruptions, reputational damage and 
affecting stakeholder relations
We have a Responsible Supply 
Chain Management Policy in 
place that our suppliers and 
contractors are required to 
comply. We prioritise sourcing 
materials and products from 
suppliers who share our 
commitment to ethical practices, 
social responsibility, and 
environmental sustainability. 
We work with suppliers who 
demonstrate a commitment to 
reducing their environmental 
footprint, conserving resources, 
reducing emissions, and 
minimising waste. By promoting 
responsible sourcing practices 
throughout our supply chain, we 
aim to create a positive impact 
on the communities where we 
operate, while upholding our 
reputation as a trusted and 
responsible business partner. 
Furthermore, we encourage 
procurement from local suppliers 
to boost the economic growth of 
local communities

Business 
Ethics and 
Integrity
Opportunity
Maintaining high standards of business 
ethics and integrity is fundamental to 
the operation of thermal power plants. 
This includes adhering to regulatory 
requirements, promoting transparency, 
and upholding ethical practices in all 
business dealings. A commitment to 
ethics and integrity builds trust with 
stakeholders and ensures the long-
term sustainability of the plant.
We have formulated an 
Anti- Bribery and Anti-
Corruption Policy (ABAC) 
comprising guidelines against 
unethical practices. This 
policy ensures compliance 
with all the prevailing laws. 
We have a zero-tolerance 
policy towards bribery, 
corruption, and unethical 
practices, and we uphold 
operational accountability and 
transparency. As a part of the 
man-date, every employee has 
to complete the ABAC course 
on our E-training module. The 
objective of this course is to 
create awareness about the 
Policy so that business can 
continue to run ethically with 
a zero-tolerance approach 
towards any kind of non-
compliance in this regard.

Innovation 
and R&D
Opportunity
Continuous innovation and research 
and development (R&D) are crucial for 
the advancement of thermal power 
plants. Investing in new technologies 
and exploring alternative energy 
sources can improve efficiency, reduce 
environmental impact, and enhance 
competitiveness. Collaboration with 
research institutions and industry 
partners can drive groundbreaking 
innovations that shape the future of 
thermal power generation
We are at the forefront of 
technological innovation to 
meet market demands, as 
demonstrated by our initiatives 
in ammonia co-firing and green 
hydrogen projects/pilots, which 
are aimed at maintaining a 
competitive ad-vantage.

Statement by director responsible for the

ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements
Dear Stakeholders,
It is with great pride and a sense of responsibility that I present to you the 
latest developments and achievements of Adani Power Limited (APL). Our 
journey has been marked by significant milestones, strategic initiatives, and 
a steadfast commitment to sustainable growth and value creation.
Performance and Strategic Initiatives
Adani Power Limited continues to systematically identify opportunities, 
manage risks with resilience, and secure the interests of all its 
stakeholders. Our robust financial performance, with a 15% year-on-year 
increase in EBITDA and an 11% increase in revenue, underscores our 
operational excellence and strategic foresight. With an operating capacity 
of 17,550 MW and an upcoming capacity of 13,120 MW, we are well-
positioned to meet the growing energy demands of our nation.
Commitment to Sustainability
APL strives to be a sector leader in reducing direct emissions and sourcing 
renewable energy for our operations. We are working diligently with our 
value chain partners to reduce indirect emissions. To achieve these targets, 
we have undertaken a rigorous mapping of our emission footprint and are 
committed to transparent disclosure and validation through internationally 
reputed platforms.
Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond environmental concerns. 
We are deeply invested in achieving our sustainability objectives, which 
en-compass societal and community well-being, health and safety, and 
responsible governance. Our initiatives, in partnership with the Adani 
Foundation, have touched millions of lives across thousands of villages, 
driving beneficial change in education, health, infrastructure, and 
sustainable livelihood development.
Operational Efficiency and Innovation
To serve our customers with an uninterrupted sup-ply of safe, affordable, 
and reliable power, we are determined to improve our operational efficiency 
through innovative technology. Our modern and efficient fleet of thermal 
generation assets, strategically located across India, and our expertise in 
project execution, including the commissioning of India's first transnational 
power project in Godda, Jharkhand, are testaments to our capabilities.
Future Outlook
As we look to the future, APL remains committed to enriching lives and 
attaining long-term sustainable growth through responsible value creation. 
Our strong cash flow generation capability, conservative leverage, and 
improvements in credit ratings position us well for sustained growth. We 
will continue to focus on operational excellence, self-funded growth, and 
adherence to ESG practices to ensure that we meet our sustainability 
targets and create lasting value for all our stakeholders.
In conclusion, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our 
employees, partners, and stake-holders for their unwavering support and 
trust. Together, we will continue to drive forward, embracing opportunities 
and overcoming challenges, to build a brighter and more sustainable future.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? 
(Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
Yes, the entity has processes in place to avoid and manage conflicts of interest involving members of the Board.
The APL Code of Conduct for BoD document outlines the guidelines for conduct, including the management 
of conflicts of interest. According to the code, all members of the Board of Directors and Senior Management 
are expected to dedicate their best efforts to advance the company's interests and make decisions based on 
the company's best interests, independent of outside influences. A conflict of interest occurs when a director's 
or senior management member's private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of the 
company as a whole. Any situation that involves, or may reasonably be expected to involve, a conflict of interest 
must be disclosed promptly to the Company Secretary. 
Additionally, there are mandatory declarations for the disclosure of conflicts of interest. Employees are required 
to submit their declarations, even in cases of no conflict of interest (Nil Submission). Failure to comply within the 
stipulated timeline may result in appropriate action being taken 
These measures ensure that conflicts of interest are identified, disclosed, and managed effectively to maintain 
the integrity and transparency of the company's operations.
Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.

Yes, 100% of our input was sourced in accordance with our supply chain management policy, which effectively 
governs our sustainable supply chain practices. We ensure that our supplier selection process integrates the 
prerequisites of sustainability.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct serves as a framework for assessing and communicating the company’s requirements, 
values, and culture to our suppliers. We also encourage our suppliers to adhere to social and environmental 
standards such as SA 8000, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018. Additionally, we have implemented a supplier 
screening and risk assessment program, which is a fundamental part of our vendor onboarding process.
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Social, and Governance) criteria for screening and prequalifying our suppliers. We have classified our suppliers 
and identified critical ones based on the value of business and nature of supply. Our supplier screening 
framework is used to assess these critical suppliers on predefined ESG parameters, which act as key enablers on 
our Responsible Supply Chain journey.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
Given the nature of our company's product and service offerings, specifically the generation of electricity, the 
scope for safely reclaiming products for reuse, recycling, and disposal at the end of life is NOT APPLICABLE.
In alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, we have 
defined comprehensive processes for managing waste at all our operational sites. Effective waste management 
begins with meticulous planning, ensuring that our waste management plan prioritises efficient and cost-effective 
techniques. This plan encompasses a range of activities, including waste collection, segregation, transportation, 
reprocessing, recycling, and disposal of different types of waste. Our thermal power plants generate various forms 
of waste, with fly ash (a by-product of coal combustion) being the largest solid waste component. Additionally, 
we handle other types of waste such as municipal or domestic waste, hazardous waste, biomedical waste, and 
e-waste. The disposal methods depend on the type and quality of waste generated.
Fly ash, being a significant solid waste produced from coal-based power generation, poses a landfilling challenge. 
To address this, our Tiroda plant has implemented a High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) system, which 
solidifies the ash for disposal. Furthermore, we have established infrastructure at other plants to transform fly 
ash into a valuable material in demand by industries such as cement and ready-mix concrete. This approach 
has substantially increased fly ash utilisation and supply, benefiting specialised agencies. We are dedicated to 
reducing single-use plastic usage, and 9 out of 12 of our power-generating units have received certification for 
being single-use plastic-free from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). At our Tiroda, Kawai, and Udupi 
plants, we have installed waste-paper recycling units.
Regarding hazardous waste, we generate a comparatively smaller quantity, which is stored in designated locations. 
As per regulations, non-recyclable hazardous waste is sent to a State Pollution Control Board (SPCB)-approved 
common treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) for proper management. We recognise the importance 
of waste segregation from the initial stages, and our control measures ensure that relevant information is tracked 
until the final disposal stage.
Additionally, the non-hazardous waste generated at our premises, comprising scrap metal, wood, glass, tires, 
e-waste, cardboard, and paper, is sold via auction.

Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes,

Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same
	
Owing to the nature of the Company’s product/service offerings, EPR is not applicable to the Company.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
In line with Adani Group’s target to meet India’s Climate Change (NDC) commitments of emission reduction, the 
Company has taken various initiatives such as:
	y
Replacing low energy efficient equipment with high energy efficient equipment
	y
Installing solar roof tops and other green energy projects
	y
Replacing fossil fuel-based vehicles by electric vehicles
	y
Optimisation of energy consumption in office buildings
	y
Using digitisation to improve monitoring and reduce losses
	y
Awareness creation related to energy conservation and GHG reduction
	y
Replacing high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerant with lower GWP refrigerant
	
APL aims to lead India’s initiatives in achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets by evaluating the possibility of 
potential implementation of ammonia as a fuel in thermal power generation that will utilise Green Hydrogen-derived 
ammonia in the existing thermal power plant. Kowa supported APL by conducting a global survey of hydrogen 
and ammonia-related technologies being utilised for power generation. IHI Corporation has already successfully 
demonstrated its ammonia co-firing technology at a large-scale commercial coal-fired power plant in Japan and 
responded to many inquiries related to ammonia co-firing globally.
	
To achieve de-carbonisation of APL’s coal-fired assets, the parties, by considering the possibility of ammonia 
co-firing through the studies, aim to de-carbonise APL’s coal fired assets with the objective to potentially 
implement the technology in other coal-fired units within India.
	
Outcome of initiative
	y
Successful implementation will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
	y
This modification targets achieving 20% liquid ammonia co-firing ratio and higher co-firing ratio up to 100% 
mono-firing at the Adani Power Mundra Coal Fired Power Plant

adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. We follow the basic 
principle of segregation of the waste at source & adopt the 3R concept of “reduce, reuse & recycle”. 
The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound 
manner through authorised vendors for recycling as required by regulation.	
Apart from hazardous waste, the most significant types of non-hazardous waste streams include scrap metal, 
wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard and paper. Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the 
generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through reuse and recycling wherever possible. All our site/
locations are working towards achieving Zero waste to landfill certification wherever feasible.
