safety is a risk area 
for 
the 
Company 
due 
to 
potential

the following:

with RKFL plant safety

Safety during the Financial

lead to fines, penalties, and 
legal fees. In severe cases, 
the 
Company 
may 
face 
lawsuits from employees or 
regulatory 
authorities 
for 
injuries, illnesses or fatalities 
resulting 
from 
unsafe 
working conditions.
b)	 Negative 
publicity 
surrounding 
workplace 
accidents 
or 
health 
and 
safety violations can damage 
the Company's reputation. 
This can result in decreased 
consumer 
trust, 
loss 
of 
business 
opportunities, 
and 
difficulty 
attracting 
and 
retaining 
talented 
employees.
c)	 Poor 
health 
and 
safety 
practices 
can 
negatively 
impact employee well-being,

business 
performance 
and

waste generation in Plants. 
To mitigate associated risks, 
the Company has undertaken 
the following:
1.	 Conducted 
waste 
management 
study 
to 
identify 
improvement 
areas.
2.	 Undertake waste disposal 
through 
authorized 
recyclers.
3.	 Engaging with vendors 
to 
increase 
use 
of 
waste 
generated 
as 
input material for other 
industries.
4.	 Hazardous wastes residue 
is kept at secured landfill 
by Treatment Storage and 
Disposal Facility (TSDF), 
specially 
designed 
for 
hazardous wastes.
5.	 Implementing 
a 
9R 
waste management plan 
that will help to reduce 
and efficiently manage 
Company’s waste across 
Plants.
6.	 Taken steps to control 
generation of waste.
Negative financial implication:
1.	 Improper waste disposal or 
failure to comply with waste 
management 
regulations 
can 
result 
in 
fines 
and 
penalties being imposed by 
regulatory authorities. These 
fines can be substantial and 
can 
significantly 
impact 
the 
Company's 
financial 
performance.
2.	 Inadequate 
waste 
management practices can 
lead to legal liabilities, such 
as lawsuits from affected 
communities or individuals 
due 
to 
environmental 
pollution or health hazards 
caused by improper waste 
disposal.
3.	 Poor 
waste 
management 
practices within the supply 
chain can lead to disruptions 
in operations, such as delays 
in production or distribution, 
which can result in increased 
costs 
and 
lost 
revenue 
opportunities.
7.
Board 
Structure and 
Management
Risk
Board structure and 
management 
are 
critical for effective 
d e c i s i o n - m a k i n g 
and oversight. Poor 
governance and lack 
of diversity can lead 
to conflicts of interest, 
mismanagement 
of 
resources and lack of 
strategic 
direction, 
resulting in financial 
losses, 
reputational 
damage 
and 
legal 
liabilities, 
posing 
significant risks to the 
company's 
stability 
and performance.
1.	 A diverse and independent 
board of directors that 
includes members with 
the appropriate skills and 
experience. 
The 
Board 
collectively 
contributes 
to fostering transparency, 
accountability, 
and 
sustainability in corporate 
operations, 
promoting 
trust among stakeholders 
and enhancing long-term 
value creation.
2.	 A robust policy framework 
guiding 
ethical 
and 
responsible 
business 
operations
3.	 Achieved 
18% 
women 
representation 
in 
the 
Board of Directors 
Negative financial implication:
1.	 If the board lacks diversity 
or 
expertise 
relevant 
to 
the Company's industry or 
challenges, it can lead to 
poor strategic decisions that 
might 
negatively 
impact 
financial performance of the 
Company.
2.	 Failure 
to 
comply 
with 
applicable laws, regulations 
and corporate governance 
standards can expose the 
Company 
to 
legal 
and 
regulatory risks, including 
fines, 
lawsuits 
and 
reputational damage.

various economic, social and 
environmental shocks. This 
can reduce the likelihood 
of financial losses due to 
disruptions in operations or 
supply chains.
3.	 Proactively 
managing 
ESG risks can lead to cost 
savings 
in 
several 
areas, 
such as energy and resource
