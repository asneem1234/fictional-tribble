Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
We firmly believe that our ESG-centric approach is a strategic differentiator—one that not only strengthens our 
leadership position but also aligns with our purpose of creating enduring value and joy for all stakeholders. At Asian 
Paints, Sustainability is not an initiative—it is our business imperative. Our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
priorities are central to our value creation framework, guiding how we innovate, grow, and engage with stakeholders. We 
are deeply committed to creating sustainable, long-term value by embedding ESG considerations into every facet of our 
business. From reducing our environmental footprint and advancing social equity to upholding the highest standards of 
governance, ESG is the lens through which we shape our future.
 
This fourth edition of our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) reflects this commitment, offering a 
transparent and comprehensive view of our ESG performance on a standalone basis. Recognizing the importance of trust 
and accountability, we go beyond compliance. In addition to the mandatory assurance of BRSR core indicators, we have 
voluntarily subjected select additional indicators to limited or reasonable assurance. This proactive approach underscores 
our dedication to credible disclosures and continuous improvement.

E-waste: We provide electrical and electronic equipment in the form of painting tools and appliances through 
our modular kitchens, wardrobes and fitted furniture business. In compliance with E-Waste (Management) 
Rules, 2022 (“E-Waste Rules”), the Company has implemented an EPR compliant E-waste management system, 
ensuring responsible collection, channelization, and end-of-life processing of such products through certified 
recyclers. 
	
3.	
Hazardous Waste:  The hazardous waste generated in operations of the Company are handled and disposed as 
per Hazardous and Other Waste (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016.
	
4.	
Other: No significant waste, other than packaging material and tools used for painting, remains after 
application of paints. However, other non-hazardous wastes generated in operations are channelized to 
authorized recycler.

Management Rules, 2016 (“PWM Rules”) and E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022 (“E-Waste Rules”). In FY 2024-25, 
the Company fulfilled its EPR commitments by collecting and responsibly channelizing over 7,800 metric tonnes of 
flexible plastic and 72,000 metric tonnes of rigid plastic waste. The collection and responsible channelization were 
ensured across 25 states.
	
Further, the Company met its e-waste EPR obligation of 264 metric tonnes, as stipulated by the Central Pollution 
Control Board (“CPCB”), through appropriate mechanisms in alignment with the provisions of the E-Waste Rules.

in regard to the environmental impact of the product over the years. This has been discussed in detail in the 
Sustainable Operations section forming part of this Integrated Annual Report on page 86. Some of the initiatives are 
as follows:
	
A.	 Scope 3 emission: The majority of emissions lie in scope 3 and hence multiple initiatives are being undertaken 
by the Company.
	
	
i.	
Emission reduction through formulation efficiency and process innovations: This results in emission 
reduction at the raw material stage which is a key contributor to Scope 3 emissions. During the year, the 
Company realized a reduction of 39,085 metric tCO2e.

ii.	
Multimodal Transportation: In line with national logistics policies, the Company has adopted multimodal 
transport, while also using cleaner fuel-powered vehicles. Such initiatives help in reducing the emissions 
in outbound logistics. These initiatives helped to reduce more than 5,200 tCO2e of GHG emissions from 
logistics footprint, while also optimizing freight costs.
	
B.	
Water Footprint: The Company continue to work extensively to reduce overall water footprint by driving 
water conservation activity within plants, harvesting and utilizing rainwater in process, and water recharge 
and conservation initiatives outside plants. During the year, the Company replenished 4.78 times freshwater 
consumption. The specific non-process water consumption reduced by 52% since 2013-14 to 0.46 Kl/Kl.
	
C.	
Sustainability Advantaged Products: The Sustainably Advantaged Products are products that are more 
sustainable than the current norm for the industry and bring tangible sustainability benefits to the customers. 
These include products that provide resource efficiency benefits in use-phase by reducing surface temperature, 
offering longer-lasting performance, providing health and well-being benefits, etc.
	
	
a.	
High Durability Products: The Company is committed to deliver products that surpass expectations by 
combining durability and environmental responsibility. Enhancing product longevity is vital in minimizing

Statutory reports
	
In line with the Company’s Environment Policy & Health and Safety Policy, there are various measures taken to 
ensure access to a safe and healthy work-place to all employees and workers. The Company invests in technologies 
and processes to avoid and minimise the manual interfaces with machines. The Company ensures that all statutory 
requirements are compiled and same is validated by third party safety audits.
	
The Company endeavours to design every facility by using latest technology and including all possible safety 
measure such that there is near zero risk to human health. At the existing facilities, newer mechanism, machines, and 
techniques are put in place. 
	
Performing internal and external studies and surveys: 
	
The Company performs various internal and external studies like ‘HIRA’, ‘HAZOP’, chemical risk assessment, fire risk 
assessment, manual material handling assessments, quantitative risk assessment for chemical storage tank and 
surveys relating to structural stability, noise survey, illumination survey, etc. to identify process safety hazards and 
controls. 
	
Safety Management Systems: 
	
The health and safety management system is based on ISO 45001 - the International Standard for Occupational 
Health and Safety and is also designed to cater to the ‘Five Star Integrated Audit’ by British Safety Council which 
is a leading global recognition in the field of Occupational Health and Safety Systems. This covers eight decorative 
manufacturing plants, one industrial paint plant, one chemical plant and Research and Technology facility. It covers 
our workforce including contractor workmen, drivers, cleaners as well as visitors etc. 
	
Training: 
	
The Company encourages and works on building Behaviour Based Safety (“BBS”) management to encourage 
adherence to safe behaviour and promote safety culture. It provides periodic trainings to employees on the manner 
of performing such assessments/surveys, handling hazardous chemicals and equipment. All employees and workers 
are trained on safety aspects which includes first – aid, fire – fighting, onsite emergency plan, work permit system, 
HIRA, HAZOP etc. 
	
Use of technology and other safety measures: 
	
Most of the paint manufacturing processes are automated/semi-automated and are controlled through Distributed 
Control System (“DCS”) and Manufacturing Excellence System (“MES”). All the new plants are highly automated with 
conveyors and robotics palletisation to reduce manual material handling, thereby creating safer work environment. 
Moving parts of machineries are equipped with machine guarding mechanism like separately demarcated routes for 
vehicles and pedestrians, installation of convex mirrors at blind corners for Material Handling Equipment (“MHE”) 
trucks, monitoring speed of all vehicular movements, installation of safety alarms, interlocks to eliminate hazards 
related to moving parts, etc. 
	
Over and above, it is ensured that fire protection equipment such as hydrant system, water monitors, foam monitors, 
fire extinguishers, fire detection and sprinkler system are in place as per relevant Indian Standards. Pre-employment 
and annual medical examinations are carried out for employees and contractor workmen. Personal Protective 
Equipment (“PPE”) are identified for various activities and maintained in the form of PPE matrix for each section in 
the plants conforming to relevant Indian/International Standard as applicable. 
	
Other safety initiatives:
	
1.	
The Company places a strong emphasis on safety measures not only at its plant locations but across all

10.	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The waste management is based on the systematic tracking of the material flows and adheres to a well-defined 
hierarchy. The Company aims to avoid waste to the best of our ability by continuously optimising our processes 
and production methods. If the avoidance is not possible, the Company assess whether they can be recycled or 
reused within it’s operations. For instance, wash water is used in our process, recover and reuse waste solvents, 
and manufacture economy-grade paint. With stringent processes, we ensure the safe, proper, and environmentally 
responsible disposal of materials that cannot be recycled and reused. At our paint manufacturing unit, specific 
hazardous waste and non- hazardous waste disposal (Kg/KL) has seen a consistent year on- year reduction since the 
baseline year of 2013-14.  Our specific hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste disposal has decreased by 79% and 
40% respectively from baseline year of FY 2013-14.
	
We follow legally prescribed procedures and apply environmentally sound disposal techniques for disposing of 
hazardous waste whereas the non-hazardous waste is sent to authorised recyclers. A detailed description has been 
provided in the Sustainable Operations section forming part of this Integrated Annual Report on page no. 86.
	
Safety and environmental sustainability are integral parts of the product development processes established by the 
Company. These processes are built on IT platforms which enable the Company’s Research & Technology Centre in 
Mumbai to screen and prevent the entry of potentially hazardous raw materials right at the development stage.

Asian Paints Limited
Assurance Report (Contd.)
5.	 Inherent limitations
	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect 
comparability between companies.
6.	 Our Independence and Quality Control
	
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Master Circular and its clarifications 
thereto and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
	
We apply Standard on Quality Control (“SQC”) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintain 
a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
7.	 Our Responsibility
	
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion and limited assurance conclusion on the Identified 
Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and Appendix II respectively based on the procedures we have 
performed and evidence we have obtained.
	
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 
3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements (SAE) 
3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (together the “Standards”), both issued by the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.
	
These standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the Reports are prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Criteria; and obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability 
Information listed in Appendix II and included in the Reports is free from material misstatement.
	
As part of both reasonable and limited assurance engagement in accordance with the Standards, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
8.	 Reasonable Assurance
	
A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in 
the circumstances.
	
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or 
measurements of the Identified Sustainability Information;
	
•	
Made inquiries of Company’s management, including the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) team, the 
compliance team, the human resource team, the finance team amongst others and those with the responsibility 
for preparation of the Reports;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls for 
recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate office and at other plants/
offices on a sample basis. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the engagement and determining 
whether they have been implemented by performing procedures in addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the 
Identified Sustainability Information;
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
551
Financial statements
	
•	
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures;
	
•	
Tested the key assumptions, emission factors and methodologies used for calculation of GHG emissions;
	
•	
Tested the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis; and
	
•	
Tested the consolidation for various plants and offices on sample basis under the reporting boundary for ensuring the 
completeness and accuracy of data being reported.
	
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable 
assurance opinion.
9.	 Limited Assurance
	
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the 
Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information as listed in Appendix II, assessing 
the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information.
	
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation 
to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal controls, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.
	
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents and evaluating the appropriateness of reporting policies and 
agreeing with underlying records.
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or 
measurements of the Identified Sustainability Information;
	
•	
Made inquiries of Company’s management, including the Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) team, the 
compliance team, the human resource team, the finance team amongst others and those with the responsibility 
for preparation of the Reports;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and 
controls for recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate 
office and at other plants/offices on a sample basis. This included evaluating the design of those controls 
relevant to the engagement and determining whether they have been implemented by performing procedures 
in addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the Identified Sustainability Information;
	
•	
Reviewed the key assumptions, emission factors and methodologies used for calculation of GHG emissions;
	
•	
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the nature, timing, and extent of further procedures; and
	
•	
Reviewed the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis.

assurance conclusion.
