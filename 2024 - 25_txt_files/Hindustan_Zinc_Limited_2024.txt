CEO STATEMENT
I am pleased to share the launch of Hindustan Zinc’s 
4th Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), 
a reflection of our unwavering commitment to environmental 
stewardship, inclusive community development, and ethical 
governance. At Hindustan Zinc, sustainability is not a 
parallel goal, it is embedded in our business strategy and 
fundamental to how we operate. Over the years, we have 
built a strong legacy of responsible practices, continually 
striving to make a meaningful difference across our 
operations and communities.
FY2025 has been a defining year – marked by accelerated 
progress, innovation, and impact. We have continued 
to align our ambitions with national priorities and global 
sustainability frameworks, guided by the principles of 
accountability and transparency. This year’s BRSR outlines 
our performance across the nine principles of the BRSR 
framework and highlights the milestones that define our 
journey of creating shared value.
It is with profound sadness that we acknowledge the 
loss of three of our business partner colleagues and one 
Hindustan Zinc employee in work-related incidents this 
past year. Our hearts go out to their families and loved ones 
during this difficult time. Each life lost is a stark reminder of 
the responsibility we carry. In the wake of these tragedies, 
we conducted thorough root cause analyses and are 
committed to applying every learning with utmost sincerity. 
Strengthening our safety culture is not just a priority – it is 
a promise. Guided by our ‘Zero Harm’ vision, we continue 
to embed safety deeper into every layer of our operations, 
striving to create a workplace where everyone returns home 
safe, every single day.
Our 
efforts 
in 
sustainability 
have 
received 
global 
recognition. We are proud to be ranked first globally in 
the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment 2024 
for the second consecutive year in the metals and mining 
sector, and featured in the S&P Sustainability Yearbook in 
the top 1% ranking. 
A robust, three-tiered sustainability framework drives 
our strategic goals, helping us monitor progress in critical 
areas such as energy efficiency, carbon reduction, 
biodiversity conservation, water stewardship, and inclusive 
development. This framework continues to guide our actions 
as we implement and advance our 2030 sustainability goals.
Our stakeholder engagement this year was enhanced 
through a comprehensive double materiality assessment 
aligned with global standards like Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). 
These insights are helping us sharpen our ESG strategy and 
deepen our disclosures.
FY2025 has been pivotal for environmental stewardship. 
We have made meaningful strides in our transition to a low-
carbon future, with a clear goal to achieve Net Zero by 2050 
or sooner. Some key initiatives include the commissioning 
of zero liquid discharge plants, the adoption of electric and 
liquified natural gas (LNG) fleets, a power delivery agreement 
(PDA) for up to 530 MW of renewable energy, and innovative 
water management solutions. In July 2024, we proudly 
launched Asia’s first low-carbon zinc, EcoZen, a milestone 
in product stewardship and sustainable innovation.
Through our CSR programmes, we have positively 
impacted over 2.3 million beneficiaries. Our focus areas 
of education, healthcare, skill development, and women 
empowerment, remain central to our social investment. 
Initiatives such as rural entrepreneurship and community 
infrastructure development continue to support our 
long-standing 
alignment 
with 
the 
UN 
Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).
Diversity and inclusion remain at the heart of our people 
strategy. From India’s first all-women underground mine 
rescue team to progressive parenthood policies, we are 
building a more inclusive workplace. Our commitment 
also extends across our supply chain through initiatives 
like 
‘Wednesday 
for 
Transition’ 
and 
sustainable 
sourcing frameworks.
To strengthen social accountability, we have established 
the Social Performance Management Committee at the 
corporate level. This will further enable effective stakeholder 
management and reinforce our focus on social performance.
At Hindustan Zinc, sustainability is not just a metric, it is a 
strategic imperative that fuels our growth and resilience. We 
remain committed to leading with responsibility, guided by 
our values and our belief that long-term business success is 
achieved by creating shared prosperity for all.

26.	Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to 
adapt or mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format:
	
This year, Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) conducted a comprehensive double materiality assessment, engaging over 400 
internal and external stakeholders via site visits, focused group discussions, and one-on-one interviews. We enhanced 
our approach to materiality assessment by identifying an extensive set of impacts, risks, and opportunities associated 
with each material topic. The outcome of the assessment has provided us with deep insight into the most significant 
financial and impact considerations associated with ESG issues for HZL.
	
We adopted the principles of double materiality established by the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) to identify and prioritise issues that are financially material to our business operations while also having 
significant environmental and social impacts on our stakeholders. The key focus of our materiality assessment in this 
cycle was to identify impacts (positive and negative), risks, and opportunities associated with the material topics. This 
analysis will enable us to align our sustainability strategy and disclosures with stakeholder expectations in a way that 
creates and preserves long-term value for HZL.
	
Our methodology followed a structured five-step process:
	
1.	
Identification of Material Topics: We began with 200+ ESG topics derived from peer benchmarking and leading 
standards, refining them to 22 potentially material topics.
	
2.	
Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities (IRO’s) Identification: Using internal risk registers, human rights reports, 
community impact assessment reports and industry standards (GRI, SASB), we mapped over 250+ IROs linked 
to these topics.
	
3.	
Stakeholder Engagement: We engaged with an extensive set of stakeholders to cover both the financial and 
impact materiality dimensions. On the former, we carried out structured consultations on the risks and opportunities 
with key institutional investors to understand their priorities. On the impact materiality dimension, we engaged 
with Hindustan Zinc's leadership and business partners, suppliers, customers, employees, civil society, regulators, 
media partners, and the local communities. These were the key stakeholder groups who provided us with detailed 
insights into the positive and negative impacts associated with our material topics. The modes of engagement 
included structured and semi-structured interviews, focused group discussions, and surveys.
	
4.	
Materiality Matrix Development: Stakeholder inputs were scored and weighted based on influence and interest to 
create a consolidated materiality matrix across the financial and impact dimensions.
	
5.	
Validation and Review: The outcomes were reviewed by senior leadership and this forms a part of agenda of the 
Sustainability & ESG Committee meeting discussion and has been part of the third-party annual assurance process.
This exercise has helped sharpen our ESG focus and ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations. Basis the analysis 
below are the topics identified as high priority issues.

Environment
1.
Air Emissions 
& Quality
Risk
Failure to comply with 
statutory emission norms 
could lead to negative/
inevitable long-term impact 
on the environment and 
society, with imposition of 
levies/fines, escalation in 
costs related to monitoring 
and reporting, among others.
Large-scale air emissions can cause serious 
impact on the environment and local 
communities. We continuously work towards 
reducing air emissions.
•	
Well-designed state-of-the-art air pollution 
control devices (APCD) are in place
•	
Effective fugitive emission management
•	
Continuous monitoring and reporting
Failure to comply 
with emission 
norms could 
lead to negative 
long-term impact. 
However, the 
Company is 
committed to 
taking positive 
steps in the right 
direction
2.
Tailings  
Management
Risk
The effective monitoring 
and management of tailings 
storage facilities (TSFs) play a 
significant role in minimising 
environmental impact on our 
local stakeholders. Tailings 
dam failure can lead to loss of 
life, environmental damage, 
and reputational cost for the 
Company. It can also entail 
significant financial costs/
losses and stoppages in 
production.
Failing of tailings dams can cause a huge 
environmental impact. Hence, we accord top 
priority to managing them responsibly.
•	
All the Company’s tailings facilities are 
designed and constructed to the highest 
engineering standards and best-in-class 
benchmarked practices, and design is 
certified by an external expert
•	
External and internal inspection and 
monitoring of the TSFs to review the 
integrity/stability of our TSF structures and 
their associated management practices
•	
Effectiveness of reclaim water system
•	
Onboarded independent tailings review 
boards (ITRBs) and Engineering of Record 
(EOR) for TSF facility
•	
Collection and recycling of supernatant 
water
•	
Conducting periodic TSF risk assessments 
and developing mitigation plans to minimise 
associated risks
•	
Surveillance of TSFs
•	
Effectiveness of emergency planning and 
response
•	
Utilisation of tailings in backfilling
•	
Replacement of wet tailing disposal system 
with dry tailing disposal
•	
Dam break analysis and emergency 
preparedness
•	
Company introduced a novel, satellite-based 
interferometric synthetic aperture radar 
(InSAR) monitoring technique to provide 
early warning of surface ground movements
•	
Various geotech instruments-like 
piezometers, inclinometers, prisms, and 
satellite monitoring are in use
•	
Renewal of CEO attestation bi-annually
•	
Critically reviewing monsoon management
There may be 
negative financial 
consequences in 
case of breach 
of tailings dam. 
However, the 
Company is 
committed to 
taking positive 
steps in the right 
direction.

Water 
Resources 
Management
Risk
Opportunity
Our operational activities 
involve processes in which 
water is an indispensable 
input, both for extraction and 
processing & smelting.
Thus, it is even more 
important for us to strive 
to reduce water use and 
increase reutilisation 
throughout the value chain.
According to our climate 
change assessment, climate 
change may result in an 
increase in extreme weather 
events and subsequent 
resource shortages.
Our operations are located in 
Rajasthan, which is one of the 
designated water-stressed 
regions in the country based 
on WRI’s Aqueduct tool. 
There is a high probability 
of experiencing situations of 
drought and extreme heat 
waves.
Since water is a critical 
input to our business, these 
factors have the potential to 
disrupt operations, to impact 
productivity of staff as well as 
our revenues and logistics.
Water conservation is particularly important for 
us as we operate in a water-stressed region. 
We are 3.32 times water positive company and 
have reduced the freshwater consumption by 
6% from base year 2020.
Company has taken several initiatives to reduce 
its dependencies on fresh water and enhance 
the availability of water for the communities 
surrounding our sites.
•	
Increasing efficiency in water usage and 
exploring less water-intensive technologies
•	
Strengthening water recycling and 
installation of zero liquid discharge plants 
across all locations
•	
Using alternative water sources to reduce 
dependency on freshwater using treated 
water from sewage treatment plant
•	
Replenish water within local watersheds and 
rainwater harvesting
•	
Establishment of dry tailings plants to re-use 
tailings water
•	
Water risk assessment using WBCSD’s India 
Water Tool and WRI Aqueduct
 This would 
have financial 
implications as 
the Company 
has already 
taken significant 
initiatives to 
reduce water 
consumption 
and recycle it 
efficiently in the 
past. However, 
due to initiatives, 
we are reducing 
dependency 
on fresh water, 
hence positive 
impact is also 
considered
4.
Circularity 
& Waste 
Management
Risk 
Opportunity
Waste generated from our 
operations poses challenge 
for us in terms of increasing 
our cost of production for 
disposal, its storage & risk of 
non-compliance.
•	
At Hindustan Zinc, we believe in ‘Zero 
Waste’ and have designed a comprehensive 
approach in managing waste generated. 
We have aligned our waste management 
practices to ‘4R’ strategy - Reduce, Reuse, 
Recycle and Reclaim
•	
Gainful utilisation of waste in terms of 
recovering minor metals & finding business 
sense in use of high volume-low toxicity 
waste in other industries (cement, road etc.)
•	
Fumer plant operation to minimise Jarosite 
generation from Hydro Zinc Smelter
Together with 
some negative 
implications, this 
would largely 
have a positive 
impact through 
waste to wealth 
initiatives
5.
Climate 
Change & 
Energy 
Transition
Risk
We are an energy-intensive 
industry due to the 
nature of our operational 
activities, logistics and 
transportation processes. 
That is why we seek new 
technologies and progress 
regarding sustainable 
energy generation. This can 
impact the overall market 
value of the products in the 
geographies with restrictions, 
thus impacting our revenues.
As a result, we keep track 
of all transition risks and 
changes in regional Climate 
Change Policy.
The rising challenges of climate change and 
resource scarcity have put us on a path of 
transformation to a low-carbon economy. Our 
strategies for mitigating these risks include:
•	
Reducing fossil fuel-based energy use in 
our operations by using innovative energy 
efficiency technologies and process 
optimisation
•	
Shifting to renewables and/or low-carbon 
solutions like biomass, where possible
•	
The company has committed to net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050 and has 
extended the power-purchase agreement 
up to 530 MW from previously signed 
450 MW
There may be 
negative financial 
consequences 
for failing to 
implement 
mitigation and 
adaptation 
strategies. 
However, the 
Company is 
committed to 
taking positive 
steps towards 
the journey of 
net zero

Opportunity
As per our physical risk 
assessment for the year 2030 
and 2050, Hindustan Zinc is 
likely to face natural disasters 
like droughts, heat waves 
and increase in extreme 
weather conditions. These 
would impose challenges to 
mining operations. Climate 
change may cause or result in 
increase in extreme weather 
events and subsequent 
resource shortages, 
impacting overall cost of 
acquisition of resources from 
alternative sources.
•	
Replacing diesel-fuelled transportation 
vehicles with electric vehicles. We have 
introduced India’s first underground mining 
electric vehicle
•	
Introduced 180 LNG-powered trucks and 10 
electric trucks for upstream and downstream 
transportation
•	
Business partners also introduced electrical 
vehicles, several forklifts, towing vehicles, 
and passenger vehicles
•	
100% RE power consumption at Pantnagar 
Metal Plant
•	
Climate change risk assessment
•	
Use of renewable electricity may result in 
lower Levellised Cost of Energy (LCOE)
•	
New market opportunities due to expected 
growth in solar photovoltaic panels and 
energy storage systems and batteries using 
zinc, lead, and silver
•	
Low-carbon metals, like EcoZen, may give 
differentiator and command premium well 
before 2030

Health, 
Safety & 
Well-Being
Risk
Safety remains a critical 
material topic due to the 
inherently hazardous nature 
of mining and smelting 
operations. Incidents in these 
environments can lead to 
severe injuries, fatalities, and 
long-term health impacts 
such as respiratory diseases 
and hearing loss, significantly 
disrupting operations and 
eroding stakeholder trust. 
The engagement of a large 
contractor workforce further 
amplifies the complexity of 
safety management. Any 
lapses in safety protocols 
can result in reputational 
damage, financial penalties, 
and operational delays, 
underscoring the need for 
proactive and robust risk 
mitigation strategies.
•	
Implementation of health and safety 
management system for cultural 
transformation across HZL
	
Critical risk management to ensure that 
all critical controls are in place for business 
high risks
•	
Infrastructure Inframatrix implementation to 
ensure that all critical risks are effectively 
managed across operational and project sites
•	
Implementation of engineering and digital 
solutions like detect technology for preventing 
the occurrence of fatal injuries
•	
Horizontal implementation of past incident 
learnings across all business units of HZL
•	
Provision for workers to report hazards and 
remove themselves from risks through online 
digital system, Enablon
•	
Effective safety governance system in 
place for timely action to improve working 
conditions and health & safety, involving the 
key business partners of our operation
•	
Adequate medical and healthcare services 
to all employees and workers of the 
organisation. Regular Periodical Medical 
Examination ( PME) and Initial Medical 
Examinations (IMEs) for monitoring

Community 
Engagement 
and 
Development
Risk 
Opportunity
Communities are identified as 
foremost stakeholder group. 
Stakeholders, especially 
communities, may get 
impacted at the socio-cultural 
and economic level due to 
our business operations.
Deficit of trust and 
relationship with the 
earmarked stakeholders may 
not only impede the progress 
on initiatives for furthering 
our societal impact, but may 
also lead to consequential 
loss of reputation, brand and 
business continuity.
Mismatch between 
expectations of community 
and actions deployed or 
lack of awareness or poor 
deployment of engagement 
initiatives may lead to 
discontented communities.
A proactive and 
sustained approach 
towards consultation 
with stakeholders 
including communities is 
critical to strengthen the 
engagement levels and 
sustained interactions and 
engagement platforms 
would lead to presenting our 
commitment to driving value 
for both communities and 
organisation.
We also are cognizant 
that each location has 
a different cultural and 
economic significance, which 
influences the expectations 
local communities have 
from us. Hence, community 
engagement for sustainable 
integrated land use planning, 
the training of community 
persons in specialised skills, 
importance to cultural values 
and its integration into the 
relationship, empowering and 
bringing women in leadership 
by focusing on equality, 
overall developing the 
assets within the community 
& intensely educating 
them thereby making self-
sustained communities’ local 
employment, local sourcing 
are few of the most important 
aspects for us to build a trust 
and uplift their standard of 
living.
•	
Proactive and sustained engagement 
platforms like “Community Connect” and 
“Community Leadership Connect” shall 
ensure two-way communication network 
and strengthen the trust element. Our 
approaches towards strengthening Social 
Performance Steering Committees (SPSC) at 
business locations with active involvement 
of the functional leaders across Hindustan 
Zinc, is key to monitoring the grievances 
and their resolution, key risks and their 
mitigation and creating strong relationships 
with the stakeholder base. This reduces the 
collective risks & immediately addresses the

Diversity, 
Equal 
Opportunity 
& Inclusion
Risk
Opportunity
People are our core 
assets and responsible for 
organisational success. 
By establishing a culture 
of safety, employee 
engagement and support 
for diverse groups in our 
workforce, we have been able 
to deliver in the top quartile 
of the business performance. 
We are an employer of choice 
and a company that continues 
to attract, develop and retain 
talent across all the levels.
Diversity is a business 
imperative for us and we 
firmly believe that healthy 
diversity mix is more likely to 
have financial returns above 
industry median.
While we see opportunity in diverse 
workgroups, there are apparent risks. The 
workplace has to be inclusive, safe, secure, free 
of discrimination, harassment and bullying.
•	
Mitigation: Policy on Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment, Anti-Discrimination Policy, 
Internal Complaints Committee
•	
Grievance Redressal Committee, Women 
Councils are in place which are channels 
to directly approach for any grievance, 
complaint, or suggestion
•	
Sensitisation and awareness on these 
policies, external and internal pulse 
surveys are taken care at central as well as 
independent business unit level to ensure 
mitigation of the mentioned risks
•	
Strategically, we focus on having a strong 
representation of women across levels and 
our diversity candidates currently constitutes 
25% of the strength in the executive cadre
•	
Simultaneously, we have successfully 
onboarded transgenders in front-end roles
•	
We have flagship programmes for 
identification and development of diverse 
workgroups such as V-Build, V-Lead, 
ACT-UP, She-Leads, V-Aspire, Winspire,

Talent 
Attraction & 
Retention
Risk
A high-quality talent 
pipeline paves the way for 
organisation excellence. 
Our talent management 
framework is conceptualised 
and implemented to maximise 
individual contribution by 
developing existing skills 
& experience. We believe 
in deploying best-in-class 
talent management practices 
that boost performance and 
help in building our brand to 
attract and retain talent.
We continuously work with 
a focused approach to 
get the right people in the 
right jobs, developing them 
and creating a great work 
environment, which in turn 
will build the foundation for 
an exceptionally talented and 
successful organisation.
The core operations at 
Hindustan Zinc include 
mining, smelting & refinery, 
require workforce with niche 
skills. Attrition in this talent 
pool is considered as a threat 
to the business deliverables.
We build and leverage the talent through a 
robust framework, as mentioned below:
• 	 Attraction and Acquisition - Empanelment of 
premier institutes across the country to tap 
the best talent, unique drives for attracting 
best talent from diverse work groups etc.

and be agile with both internal & external 
developments. We ensure the development 
of our people on technical & behavioural 
aspects through customised interventions
• 	 Driving Diversity - Diversity, equity and 
inclusion is a business imperative and our 
objective is to achieve gender parity across 
all levels starting from the Board
• 	 Performance Management - Cascading 
organisational goals to the last line to ensure 
that the entire workforce is aligned to 
achieve the business targets
•	
Our Employee Well-being & Assistance 
Program is designed to address mental 
stressors in both personal and professional 
spheres, ensuring holistic support for our 
workforce

Business 
Ethics and 
Governance
Risk 
opportunity
Business ethics is a critical 
issue for our company 
as it directly influences 
trust, transparency, and 
compliance with legal and 
regulatory frameworks. Lack 
of transparency in financial 
transactions exposes the 
company to corruption 
risks, which can undermine 
market trust and investor 
confidence. Non-adherence 
to governance standards 
can lead to severe penalties, 
reputational damage, and 
legal scrutiny, especially in 
regions prone to corruption. 
Additionally, politically 
influenced groups may pose 
risks such as targeted attacks 
or manipulation during 
vendor bidding processes.
Strengthening anti-corruption 
measures, transparency, and 
embedding sustainability 
KPIs for leadership provide 
opportunities to enhance 
investor confidence and 
secure long-term operational 
licenses. Responsible 
business practices are the 
foundation for sustainable 
growth and stakeholder trust, 
critical for safeguarding our 
reputation and business 
continuity.
We steadfast in our commitment to the highest 
standards of ethical conduct, integrity, and 
transparency. Central to this commitment is our 
comprehensive Business Ethics and Code of 
Conduct, which serves not merely as a policy 
but as a foundational guide that shapes our 
corporate culture and informs responsible 
decision-making across all levels of the 
organisation.
Our Code of Conduct outlines clear 
expectations for ethical behaviour and applies 
to all employees, directors, and business 
partners.
Probable

Hindustan Zinc’s Research and Development (R&D) cell consistently focuses on process 
innovations and promoting sustainable approaches towards achieving circular economy goals. 
R&D team’s innovative efforts, in collaboration with external technical expertise, are driving 
significant progress and positioning us at the forefront of industry advancements. Additionally, 
we have developed novel floatation reagents [i.e., cyanide reagent replacement] in mills and 
done modifications in hydro & pyrometallurgical circuits for improving the concentrate grade 
and metal purity. Further, to reduce our ecological footprint and recover valuable resources 
from waste, we have taken multiple waste/dross recycling initiatives including optimising metal 
recovery, secondary materials and reducing carbon footprint in our Waelz kiln operation in Zinc 
Smelter Debari. Additionally, R&D’s initiative towards mine site reclamation via hydroseeding 
technique has been a commendable step towards sustainability.
The Company’s dedication to sustainable innovation has been further affirmed by the 
acquisition of 2 Indian patents IN 530897 and IN 541547 in FY2025. These advanced 
technologies are designed to enhance silver recovery and optimise waste recycling in smelting 
and electrowinning processes, thereby significantly improving the Company’s operational 
efficiency and fulfilling goals towards sustainable industrial processing. In FY2025, R&D has 
filed an Indian patent on boosting lead and silver recovery from industrially generated wastes.

2. 	 a. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. The Company conducts business in a manner that improves welfare, health and safety of workers across our 
supply chain, ensures compliance with the law and adherence to ethical standards of governance and sustainability. 
To achieve this vision, we have put in place a Sustainable Sourcing policy that aligns our goals with our valued 
business partners and promote a culture of responsibility towards sustainability in all our stakeholders. The policy 
applies to all our Tier-1 suppliers including service and supply partners based on fundamental requirement of 
adherence to the Supplier’s Code of Conduct, which embodies our commitment to internationally recognised 
standards on five core principles - labour and human rights, occupational health and safety, environmental 
sustainability, business integrity, and governance. We are committed to working with our Tier-1 suppliers through 
collaborations and improvement in their process for responsible procurement based on global best practices. 
To ensure responsible sourcing Hindustan Zinc has established effective internal management of due diligence 
system to identify, assess and manage potential risks associated with our supply chains. This system enables the 
detection of red flags, prompting enhanced due diligence to evaluate the presence of serious risks such as human 
rights abuses, security-related concerns, support to non-state armed groups, money laundering, tax evasion, 
bribery, environmental violations, greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, social unrest, and misrepresentation of 
material origins. In response to identified risks, the company formulates targeted risk management plans, including 
a grievance mechanism to ensure timely prevention and mitigation. When red flags are detected, appropriate 
corrective actions are taken to address and resolve the issues effectively.
	
b. 	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
95% of our materials and services are sustainably sourced through our robust supply chain processes, i.e., 95% of 
our Tier-1 suppliers (by value) were assessed by a third party for ESG aspects during the year.
3. 	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The products manufactured by Hindustan Zinc are integrated into various products produced by their customers, 
making it impractical to separate or reclaim them individually. Therefore, the question does not apply to our products.
4. 	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
No, it is not applicable for our product/product packaging.
	
However, EPR is applicable for the plastic being received as packaging material for imported material goods. These 
materials are unwrapped in our stores and sent for further recycling and waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Board.

10) 	Health and safety management system:
	
a. 	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/No). 
If yes, the coverage of such system?
• 
Yes. We have implemented an Integrated Management System (IMS) across all our operational sites, aligned 
with the requirements of ISO 45001, and the Vedanta Sustainability Framework (VSF). This comprehensive 
system integrates quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management to drive continuous 
improvement, ensure compliance, and promote sustainable development. By adopting these globally 
recognised standards, we ensure a consistent approach to risk management, operational excellence, and 
stakeholder satisfaction
• 
Our Health & Safety Policy, endorsed by our CEO & Whole-time Director, serves as a guiding document for 
all our business operations. It is applicable to all Hindustan Zinc business units, including subsidiaries, joint 
ventures, acquired sites, licensed and outsourced operations, corporate offices, and research facilities. This 
policy extends its reach to HZL employees, business partners, contractors, suppliers, and other stakeholders 
associated with our business. It underscores our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of health, 
safety performance across all levels of operation
• 
Our Sustainability Framework reflects our alignment with global best practices, including the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) 
principles, and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles. The framework comprises a suite of 
policies, management standards, technical standards, performance standards, and guidance notes, addressing 
all aspects of sustainability. Emphasis is placed on occupational health and safety, ensuring that our operations 
are not only efficient but also safe and environmentally responsible
• 
Since its inception in 2013, Hindustan Zinc’s flagship programme for achieving safety excellence, Aarohan Safety 
Management, has been a cornerstone of our safety initiatives. This programme, developed in collaboration 
with DuPont, focuses on embedding a safety-first mindset across our workforce. Through training, awareness 
campaigns, and the establishment of robust safety processes, we strive to foster a proactive safety culture. 
Our efforts are aimed at minimising health and safety risks, enhancing compliance, and achieving operational 
excellence across all our sites. This partnership with DuPont has significantly contributed to elevating our 
safety standards, enabling us to protect our workforce and create a safer working environment
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
• 
We adhere to Vedanta Standard (GN 07: Risk Assessment) and Indian Standard 15656 for Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment (HIRA), which forms the foundation of our risk management practices. Depending on 
the complexity and criticality of the activity, we perform qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative risk 
assessments using industry-recognised tools such as Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) and Process 
Hazard Analysis (PHA). These tools enable us to identify potential hazards and implement effective control 
measures to mitigate risks
• 
Each site maintains a comprehensive HIRA register that serves as a living document, capturing all identified 
hazards and associated controls. These registers are meticulously updated at regular intervals to ensure 
alignment with operational changes, technological advancements, and emerging risks
• 
For all routine activities, we conduct detailed risk assessments and develop Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) to standardise safe work practices. These SOPs undergo periodic reviews and updates to incorporate 
lessons learned, audit findings, and feedback from the workforce, ensuring they remain effective and relevant
• 
Non-routine activities, which often involve higher risks, are managed through a robust Permit to Work (PTW) 
system. This system mandates a thorough risk assessment, including a Job Safety Analysis (JSA), before 
commencing any task. The PTW system ensures that all potential hazards are identified, and appropriate 
controls are implemented to safeguard employees and contractors
• 
Critical Risk Management (CRM) has been implemented to address 14 identified high-priority risks across the 
business. These risks are systematically managed through defined governance structures, ensuring consistent 
monitoring and control. Employees play an active role in this process by conducting regular inspections based 
on well-defined checklists tailored to major activities. This proactive approach reinforces a culture of safety and 
accountability, helping us mitigate risks effectively and enhance overall safety performance
	
c. 	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks? (Y/N)
	
	
Yes. We have implemented a robust digital platform, the V Unified Enablon System, to streamline the reporting 
of work-related hazards and incidents across all our operations. This platform empowers employees and workers 
to promptly report any unsafe conditions, near misses, or hazards they encounter during their daily activities. By 
leveraging this centralised system, we ensure that reported concerns are logged, tracked, and addressed in a 
systematic and timely manner, fostering a safer and more transparent working environment
	
	
In addition to the Enablon System, employees and workers have access to a formal safety whistleblower portal to 
report incidents, including safety concerns, unethical practices, or other workplace issues. This portal provides a 
secure and confidential channel, ensuring that individuals can voice their concerns without fear of retaliation. The 
system aligns with our commitment to fostering a culture of trust, accountability, and continuous improvement

To further strengthen our safety governance, we conduct regular Central Safety Committee Meetings and Pit Safety 
Committee Meetings across all operational units. These meetings serve as a platform for collaborative discussions 
on safety performance, hazard identification, and risk mitigation strategies. Participants include representatives 
from HZL management, union leaders, and contract and business partner employees, ensuring a diverse range of 
perspectives and active engagement from all stakeholders. By encouraging open dialogue and collective decision-
making, these meetings play a vital role in enhancing our overall safety performance and driving a culture of shared 
responsibility.
	
d. 	 Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. All employees of the company, including business partners, are comprehensively covered by our medical and 
healthcare services, ensuring their well-being and providing essential support during uncertainties, unfortunate 
incidents, or periods of distress. Our healthcare initiatives are designed to prioritise the physical and mental health 
of every individual associated with our organisation.
	
	
For emergency medical situations, we operate advanced life support (ALS) ambulances at all major locations. 
These ambulances are equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and staffed by highly trained paramedics 
and emergency response professionals. The ALS ambulance system ensures immediate and effective medical 
intervention, providing lifesaving support and transportation during critical emergencies. This comprehensive 
healthcare framework reflects our unwavering commitment to safeguarding the health and safety of our workforce.
	
	
To safeguard employee health, we have established well-equipped hospitals across all operational locations, 
staffed by skilled healthcare professionals. These facilities are equipped with advanced medical technology to 
address a wide range of health concerns. Additionally, our employees are covered under some of the best medical 
insurance and accident coverage policies, providing them and their families with financial protection during medical 
emergencies. Regular periodic health check-ups are conducted to monitor and maintain employees’ physical health.
	
	
Further, our Employee Well-being & Assistance Programme (EWAP), a comprehensive initiative designed to 
address mental stressors in both personal and professional spheres, ensures holistic support for our workforce. 
Through partnerships with mental wellness professionals and trained psychologists, EWAP offers 24x7 confidential 
counselling services to employees and up to three dependents, covering areas such as mental health, diet and 
nutrition, legal guidance, and financial advice.

• 
The Aarohan Safety Management System forms the foundation of our safety initiatives and includes key elements 
such as incident management, safety interaction programmes, standard rules and procedures, process safety 
management, and contractor safety management. These elements are implemented systematically to establish a 
robust and effective safety management framework across all our operations
• 
Our Critical Risk Management (CRM) programme has been launched to address the top 15 identified risks across 
our business operations. This programme focuses on mitigating high-priority risks through a structured approach, 
ensuring consistent risk management practices across all sites
• 
We have also implemented Infrastructure Inframatrix for managing high-risk activities. This system provides a 
structured framework for identifying, assessing, and controlling risks associated with infrastructure-related tasks, 
ensuring safe execution and compliance with safety protocols
• 
We have implemented a safety governance system, comprising the Corporate Safety Council at the central level and 
location Apex Committees at the unit level. These governance bodies play a critical role in monitoring, reviewing, 
and enhancing safety performance. Monthly safety performance reviews are conducted at the CEO level to assess 
progress, address gaps, and drive continuous improvement in safety standards
• 
Our advanced digital platform, V-unified Enablon system captures a wide range of safety data, including leading and 
lagging indicators. This platform has revolutionised our safety practices by enhancing data transparency. It allows 
us to record safety observations and track closure of safety actions. By automating data capture and analysis, the 
platform has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of our safety reporting processes
• 
To enhance the skills and capabilities of our workforce, we conduct competency enhancement programmes 
for employees. These include internationally and nationally recognised certification programmes delivered by 
competent third-party organisations. These initiatives ensure that our employees remain up to date with the latest 
safety practices and standards
• 
We have conducted five safety pauses across our business units in this financial year, which serve as focused 
initiatives to reinforce our commitment to a “safety-first” culture. These pauses involve comprehensive safety 
discussions and awareness sessions to realign everyone toward achieving our safety goals
• 
Comprehensive industrial hygiene assessments have been conducted across all our business units to identify and 
mitigate workplace health hazards. These assessments help us ensure a healthy and safe working environment 
for all employees

Process for the consultation with different stakeholders
	
Local Communities:
	
There is a continuous dialogue with the communities, which are reviewed at business unit levels at our Social 
Performance Management Committee meetings as well as the CSR Committee level. Their feedback is also taken every 
three years through the third-party engagement, impact, baseline and need assessment and same is presented to the 
CSR Committee. We have also established a Board-level ESG and Sustainability Committee where we present the social 
impact and related matters. An annual perception study is conducted by an independent third party to systematically 
gather feedback and assess stakeholder perceptions regarding the organisation and its social development projects.
	
Investors/Shareholders:
	
The Stakeholder Relationship Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing investor service standards and 
addressing the interests and grievances of shareholders, debenture holders, and other security holders. Hindustan 
Zinc’s Investor Relations department serves as a bridge between senior management and investors, facilitating regular 
interactions and feedback sessions through earnings calls, one-on-one meetings, investor conferences, and more. 
Annually, shareholders have the opportunity to engage with Board members during the Annual General Meeting. We 
have appointed Kfin Technologies Limited as our Registrar & Transfer Agent, who collaborates with the Secretarial team 
to address all investor queries.
	
Employees:
	
Hindustan Zinc participates in Annual Tripartite Committee Meeting under the aegis of Directorate General of Mines Safety 
(DGMS), with discussions among the dignitaries from DGMS, Hindustan Zinc, and Hindustan Zinc Worker’s Federation, 
revolving around health, safety, and welfare of the workers. While our employees and business partners interact with 
the CEO in the monthly townhalls, we also have regular visits by our Chairperson, where such consultations happen 
as well. Moreover, we have other functional and institutional mechanisms like:
• 
	Focused group discussions (FGDs) to capture grassroots-level feedback from the workforce
• 
	Joint consultation committee (JCC) to discuss key operational and people-related issues
• 
	Grievance redressal committees to raise individual or group grievances of employees
• 
	Canteen management committees to ensure employee welfare facilities like food and hygiene
• 
	Social performance committees to assess the social impact of our operations
	
Together, these platforms make stakeholder consultation not just a compliance requirement, but a core business practice.
	
Customers:
	
We prioritise maintaining strong connections with our customers, ensuring their needs and concerns are addressed 
effectively. We have established a structured protocol for customer interaction, led by various levels of management. 
Our regional managers and area managers actively engage with customers on a regular basis, serving as primary points 
of contact for addressing day-to-day enquiries, resolving issues promptly, and fostering positive relationships with our 
valued clientele. Their proactive approach ensures that customer feedback is acknowledged and acted upon swiftly, 
contributing to enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty. In instances where situations require escalated attention 
or involve significant concerns, our national sales heads and chief marketing officer (CMO) personally intervene by 
engaging directly with customers on a case-by-case basis, upholding our commitment to customer-centricity.
	
Suppliers: 
	
Hindustan Zinc regularly engages with business partners through one-on-one discussions on ESG topics, as well as 
training sessions and webinars, to gather their feedback. Relevant feedback is then presented at the monthly EXCO 
meetings, which is attended by the top management including the CEO.
	
Government and Regulatory Bodies:
	
The mining sector has a dynamic regulatory environment which solicits continuous engagement and knowledge-
sharing with the government stakeholders at all levels. Public policy advocacy is done through periodic connects 
and representations for ongoing policy pain points directly with apex institutions and the sector regulator as well as 
indirectly via national level industrial associations. To ensure minimal impact on business continuity in the event of 
any government or community-related disruptions, all engagements with the government are coordinated through the 
Corporate Affairs department, whose role is to undertake regular mapping of stakeholders and present as a single-
point-of-contact for the government and regulators to direct any concerns. The Head of Corporate Affairs presents 
updates on advocacy matters and day-to-day compliance status to the Board on case-by-case basis as required.
	
Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs): 
	
We regularly assess the progress and identify areas of improvement of our projects in collaboration with our NGO/
development  partners, fostering a more dynamic and responsive environment where perspectives of all stakeholders 
are valued. By actively seeking their input and feedback, we ensure that their insights and expertise are integrated into 
the process, which not only strengthens the project’s efficiency but also enhances its overall impact. As part of our 
standard assessment practices, we conduct due diligence on NGOs prior to their onboarding into the organisation. This 
process aims to identify potential threats and weaknesses associated with the NGOs, thereby facilitating systematic 
planning and risk mitigation.
2) 	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics.
	
In our regular interactions with the shareholders, we provide updates on all key aspects including ESG, monitor market 
reactions, identify their key concerns, and consider their advice/suggestions in our decision-making process. We also 
take their consent for major corporate actions at AGMs. We address all concerns, including workplace health and safety, 
of our executive employees and business partners’ employees in a monthly employee engagement session, Sampark 
(CEO townhall), where their efforts are also recognised.
	
During the double materiality assessment, we identify, shortlist and prioritise material topics based on their impact on our 
stakeholders and our business. We ensure that we integrate the inputs received from stakeholders into our processes 
and policies. We have framed our Sustainability Goals 2030 on material topics from our stakeholder consultations. We 
also take their input through public consultation prior to establishing any greenfield/brownfield projects.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Sewage 
Treatment Plant 
(STP) at Udaipur 
& Bhilwara
Company commissioned a 20 MLD STP in Udaipur in 
2014 under a public-private partnership, which is the first 
of its kind in Rajasthan. Further, Hindustan Zinc Limited 
and Udaipur Smart City Limited signed an agreement 
in June 2017 to extend the sewage treatment capacity 
by another 40 MLD. 25 MLD has been commissioned in 
January 2019. Another 15 MLD was commissioned in 
FY2021, taking the total to 60 MLD.
The replacement of fresh water for 
operations by STP treated water has 
led to increased availability of fresh 
water for the community. 32% of total 
water withdrawal was satisfied with 
treated sewage.
2
Dry Tailing Plant
India’s first dry tailing plant was set up at the Zawar Mines 
in Rajasthan and in 2024 at Rajpura Dariba Mine. The 
dry tailing technology is based on separating water from 
tailings slurry, which is generated in the beneficiation 
process. Company repurposes tailings materials and 
waste rock as backfill to stabilise our underground mining 
operations, while the remaining tailings are then placed 
in a specially designed tailings storage to minimise the 
environmental, social and economic risks. We externally 
review the integrity/stability of our dam structures and 
their associated management practices by global experts. 
The same is in progress in Rampura Agucha Mine.
Key benefits of the dry tailing 
technology include recirculation 
of more than 80% of the process 
water present in tailings, a faster 
rehabilitation, and restoration of 
storage site at mine closure and 
ensuring re-availability of water for 
further use.

4 MLD Zero 
Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) at Zawar
Treatment of poor-quality excess water at Zawar Mines by 
installation of 4000 cum/day effluent treatment plant with 
zero liquid discharge and recycling in the process. 
1. 	Reduction of freshwater intake from 
Tidi Dam on daily basis of c. 3800 
cum/day.
4
Rainwater 
Harvesting 
Structure
Company executed groundwater recharge intervention 
project across Hurda, Shahpura, Kotri, and Jahazpur 
blocks of Bhilwara district. We were able to complete 
the desilting of ponds, repairing, strengthening and 
increasing the height of damaged embankments, 
and construction of 358 recharge shafts for effective 
groundwater recharge in 83 ponds
Created a total groundwater recharge 
potential of over 8.7 million cubic 
meter/annum
5
Agreement for 
180 Liquified 
Natural Gas 
(LNG) vehicles
In a significant move towards green transportation, the 
Company has joined forces with Greenline, a subsidiary 
of Essar Group, by signing a contract for 180 LNG 
vehicles. All 180 LNG vehicles (alternate fuel vehicles) 
were launched to aid finished goods and interunit 
transport.
This initiative is to help reduce 
Company’s Scope 3 emissions and 
help achieve SBTi Scope 3 targets.
6
Paste Fill
Instead of conventional hydraulic filling, Company chose 
to use the paste fill technology. This technology ensured 
fast filling and practically no bleeding water in the 
stopes. The other benefits of paste fill technology have 
been water conservation, better stope stability, surface 
integrity in mines, and more recycling of tailings.
• 	 Metal recovery from secondary 
stopes
• 	 Reduced cement consumption with 
increased usage of fly ash
• 	 Reduced water consumption as 
paste solids content is high (77-79% 
solids)
• 	 Utilisation of nearly 39% of tailings 
in paste fill plant, helping in 
improving the stability of tailing dam

8
Jarofix Yard 
Restoration
Company follows the principle of reducing the waste, 
quantitatively as well as qualitatively, and performing 
recovery and recycling. The last priority is disposal 
in landfills. Company used Mycorrhiza technology 
for rejuvenation and reclamation of wasteland into 
productive land by increasing the green cover, enhancing 
biodiversity, controlling fugitive dust emission, and 
restoring site. It also makes plants less vulnerable to 
environmental stresses through optimum use of water 
resources
Development of green belt in an area 
of 6.25 hectares (10,000 plants). 
Provides overall stability to waste 
dump and dump failure due to heavy 
rains, ensuring safe and stable dump. 
Further, Phase 2 of area restoration of 
16 hectares is under progress.

3) 	 Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
Aligning with our Technical Standards (TS-04), structured grievance mechanisms are adhered to for receiving and 
resolving grievances. In line with sustainability strategy of establishing strong relationships with stakeholders and 
adhering to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), Organisation 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Standards for 
responsible stewardship, United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Principles & Vedanta Technical standards, Company 
has set up a robust Grievance Redressal Mechanism. Regular monitoring and reviewing of the mechanism established 
is undertaken at various platforms. To further strengthen it, effective stakeholder engagement is a continuous process 
taken up to reduce the grievances of the stakeholders.
	
Proactive and sustained engagement platforms like “Community Connect” and “Community Leadership Connect” 
are established to ensure two-way communication network and strengthen the trust element thereby reducing 
the grievances.
	
A grievance box has been placed outside the plant main gate for stakeholders to share their grievances in written form 
in the local language. All grievances are required to be resolved in maximum 15 days, failing which they are escalated to 
the senior management for its resolution and closure. Also, at each Company location, we have well established Social 
Performance Steering Committee, consisting representatives of major functions and chaired by respective IBU CEO/
SBU Director, through which all grievances are raised and discussed for their timely resolution and thereby reduction in 
the collective risk involved. Our approach to strengthening Social Performance Steering Committees (SPSC) at business 
locations involves active participation from functional leaders. This is crucial for monitoring grievances, resolving 
issues, mitigating key risks, and fostering strong stakeholder relationships. By addressing community feedback and 
grievances promptly, we reduce collective risks. At the corporate level, the Social Performance Management Committee 
consolidates and reviews progress at each site, enhancing our overall social performance management.

Approach to Cyber Security
	
To manage the information security in the Company, we have a well-entrenched and comprehensive Information

managing information security effectively covers the various relevant policies, standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) and technology standards. We have also established an effective security assessment and audit process for 
preventing cyber-attacks. Implementation of security-by-design in our business and technology landscape has further 
strengthened the framework.
	
The framework covers:
• 
A cyber resilience programme, with technical and business readiness to respond to or recover from critical incidents
• 
Comprehensive social engineering and security awareness for full-time employees and business partner employees
• 
Data privacy compliance, to implement best-in-class privacy practices and avoid regulatory penalties
• 
Operational technology security, by strengthening and monitoring plant technical system (PTS) assets to prevent 
compromise of critical PTS infrastructure
• 
Protection of the Company’s information assets hosted in the Vedanta cloud or external SaaS (software as a service) 
platforms, ensuring cloud security
• 
Comprehensive data leakage prevention, protecting all communication channels
• 
Third-party risk management, through mitigation of cyber risks posed by third parties, including strengthening of 
third-party contracts
• 
Governance, risk and compliance framework for audit and risk management, as well as continuous improvement
	
The framework guides the formulation of our information security strategy, as well as our long-term roadmap and annual 
information security plan. The Executive Committee reviews the framework annually, in consultation with external expert 
agencies. This helps in incorporating applicable regulatory requirements and prevailing industry knowledge and also 
enables consideration of newer threats and risks.
	
Company is compliant with ISO 27001 framework and is certified as per the defined Statement of Applicability (SOA) 
since the year 2018. Certification is applicable to all Infrastructure & Applications under the purview of Information 
Technology & Operational Technology functions across all sites of the Company. Subsequently, the Company has 
decided to implement an integrated framework covering various domains of Information Security, Disaster Recovery & 
Business Continuity Management, Risk Management and Data Privacy Management. Under this approach, the Company 
has achieved an Integrated ISO Certification consisting of ISO 27001 (Information Security), ISO 22301 (DR & BCP), ISO 
31000 (Risk Management) and ISO 27701 (Privacy Management) in the year 2024.
	
All the policies and procedures enforced in the Company environment are all-inclusive to manage the Information 
Security and Data Governance aspects. All these policies are reviewed annually by competent personnel in the 
Information Security Function. All the approved and enforced policies are made available to all employees and business 
partners over the Hindustan Zinc Limited Intranet Portal.
