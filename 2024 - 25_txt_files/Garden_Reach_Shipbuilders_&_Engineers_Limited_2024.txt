During FY 2024–25, the Company could not comply with 
Regulation 17(1) of the SEBI (LODR Regulations), 2015 
relating to the composition of the Board of Directors. This 
non-compliance arose due to the non-appointment of the 
requisite number of Independent Directors, including a 
Woman Independent Director, by the Government of India.
As a result, the Audit Committee (from 27 Dec 2024) and 
the Nomination and Remuneration (from 11 Dec 2024) 
remained not constituted till 31 Mar 2015, leading to non-
compliance of Regulations 18(1) and 19(1)/ 19(2) of the 
SEBI (LODR) Regulation, 2015.
As a CPSE, the Company does not have the authority to 
appoint Directors. Such appointments are made by the 
Government of India through Presidential Orders. The matter 
has been referred to our Administrative Ministry, i.e., the 
Ministry of Defence, and is currently under consideration.

During FY 2024–25, monetary penalties were levied by the Stock Exchanges due to non-compliance 
with 17(1) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI LODR 
Regulations”), arising from non-availability of the adequate number of Independent Directors including 
Women Independent Director on the Board of the Company. 
As a result, the Company was also unable to reconstitute the Audit Committee and the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee in accordance with Regulations 18(1) and 19(1)/ 19(2) of the SEBI LODR Regulations. 
Specifically, the Company did not have a duly constituted Nomination and Remuneration Committee from 11 
Dec 2024 to 31 Mar 2025, and the Audit Committee from 27 Dec 2024 to 31 Mar 2025. 
As a CPSE, the Company does not have the authority to appoint Directors, which is the prerogative of the 
Government of India through Presidential Orders. The matter has been referred to the Administrative 
Ministry, i.e., the Ministry of Defence, and is currently under consideration. The delay in appointments and 
the resulting non-compliance is beyond the control of the Company.
In reply to the penalty notices, the Company submitted quarter wise response to the Stock Exchanges 
through letters dated 22 Aug 2024, 22 Nov 2024, 18 Mar 2025, and 30 May 2025, requesting waiver of the 
penalties. However, as per SOP of SEBI, the Stock Exchanges are unable to consider such requests until the 
underlying non-compliances are complied/ resolved.

stakeholders through various platforms to ensure the feedback

established several committees dedicated to key areas of 
concern:
•	
The Safety, Health and Sustainability (SHS) Committee 
assesses our performance in safety, health and sustainable 
issues and overseeing the implementation of Company’s 
relevant policies.
•	
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee plays a 
pivotal role in formulating and recommending CSR policies 
to the Board. Additionally, it meticulously monitors CSR 
Budget allocations, activities and expenditures to ensure 
alignment with our commitment to Social responsibility. 
•	
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee is entrusted with 
evaluating statutory compliances and services related to

Hazardous wastes generated at units are disposed as per the regulatory requirement. 
	
The Company, as part of its operations, generates e-waste from old electrical and electronic systems, computer systems (IT) and 
communication systems, which needs to be disposed after their life expiry or damage. The e-waste generated and collected is stored in 
designated areas (under cover) and auctioned through with MSTC Limited for disposal through authorized dismantlers/recyclers/refurbishers.
