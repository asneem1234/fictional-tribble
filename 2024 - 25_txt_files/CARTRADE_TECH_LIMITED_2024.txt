Communities
The Company firmly believes that 
enduring, responsible business success 
relies on meaningful collaboration with all 
stakeholders—especially the communities 
in which it operates. It recognizes that 
thriving communities form the foundation 
of sustainable development. A thoughtfully 
designed stakeholder engagement 
process is critical to fostering development 
that is fair, inclusive, and cooperative. 
This requires ongoing, consultative, 
and adaptive dialogue with all involved 
parties. Stakeholders include individuals, 
groups, or organizations that influence 
or are impacted by the Company’s 
products, services, or operations. These 
span internal stakeholders—such as 
permanent and contractual employees, 
unions, senior leadership, and the board 
of directors—and external ones, including 
customers, suppliers, dealers, investors, 
shareholders, OEMs, regulatory bodies, 
NGOs, the media, and most importantly, 
local communities whose well-being and 
participation are central to the Company’s 
long-term vision. This policy is accessible 
at: https://www.cartradetech.com/
corporate-governance.html
The Company has also introduced a 
Stakeholder Grievance Redressal Policy 
that defines the processes for identifying, 
addressing, and resolving stakeholder 
concerns. It ensures a systematic and 
transparent approach to grievance 
management. This policy applies to 
both internal stakeholders (employees 
and workers) and external stakeholders 
(customers, dealers/business partners, 
suppliers, OEMs, investors, shareholders, 
communities, government and regulatory 
bodies, and media) who are affected, 
directly or indirectly, by the Company’s 
decisions.

influence or are influenced by its business. 
This includes internal stakeholders such 
as full-time and contractual employees, 
unions, senior and key leadership, and 
the board of directors. It also covers

Environmental 
Footprint of 
Hardware 
Infrastructure
Risk
The environmental footprint of 
hardware infrastructure poses 
a material risk due to rising 
regulatory expectations, 
increasing energy costs, and 
growing stakeholder scrutiny. 
Inefficient data centers and 
outdated equipment can 
lead to higher operational 
expenses, non-compliance 
with evolving environmental 
standards, and reputational 
damage. Additionally, 
the lifecycle impacts of 
hardware—from resource-
intensive manufacturing to 
e-waste disposal—expose 
the company to supply 
chain and transition risks. 
As ESG considerations gain 
prominence, proactively 
managing and disclosing 
the environmental impact 
of hardware infrastructure 
is essential to maintain 
compliance, operational 
efficiency, and stakeholder 
trust.
To address the 
environmental risks 
associated with its 
hardware infrastructure, 
CarTrade Tech has 
adopted a multi-faceted 
sustainability approach. 
The company has 
implemented a Sustainable 
Sourcing Policy to 
promote environmentally 
responsible procurement 
across its operations. 
These efforts reflect the 
company’s commitment 
to mitigating the 
environmental footprint 
of its infrastructure while 
aligning with broader ESG 
goals.

such negative financial

Data Security 
and Privacy
Risk
As digital adoption and 
technology integration 
across platforms accelerate, 
cyberattacks and data 
breaches have emerged 
as significant risks. 
Vulnerabilities within IT 
systems can jeopardize 
the security of critical 
data, intellectual property, 
and sensitive stakeholder 
information—including 
personally identifiable 
information (PII).
Such breaches not only 
pose regulatory and legal 
risks but can also severely 
impact stakeholder trust 
and damage the Company’s 
reputation. CarTrade remains 
focused on strengthening 
its cybersecurity posture 
to mitigate these evolving 
threats and protect the 
integrity of its digital 
ecosystem. 
The Company continues 
to strengthen its digital

Intellectual 
Property 
Protection & 
Competitive 
Behaviour
Risk
For a technology-driven 
platform like CarTrade 
Tech Limited, intellectual 
property—ranging from 
proprietary algorithms and 
databases to brand identity 
and customer insights—is a 
core asset that differentiates 
the business in a highly 
competitive market. Weak 
IP protection or inadequate 
enforcement mechanisms 
can expose the Company 
to risks such as imitation 
by competitors, data 
theft, or unauthorized use 
of proprietary content, 
potentially eroding market 
share and diminishing 
brand value. Additionally, 
non-compliance with fair 
competition laws, antitrust 
regulations, or unethical 
competitive practices can 
result in legal penalties, 
regulatory scrutiny, and 
reputational damage. As 
digital ecosystems grow 
more interconnected, the 
risk of IP infringement and 
anti-competitive behavior 
becomes more pronounced, 
making it essential for 
CarTrade to maintain robust 
legal safeguards, transparent 
business practices, and 
compliance frameworks 
to protect its competitive 
position and maintain 
stakeholder trust.
No formal certifications 
have been obtained; 
however, ISO 27001 
principles are adhered to 
in practice. Further, Privacy 
Policy and Data Security 
Policy are in place, and 
the trademark has been 
successfully registered.
Negative. There was no 
such negative financial

responsibilities for addressing the issue and tracking resolution progress. Once the grievance is resolved, the outcome is 
communicated via email, and stakeholders are invited to share feedback through a provided link to ensure transparency 
and continuous improvement.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
 
The Company’s Whistle-Blower and Vigil Mechanism Policy is designed to provide a safe and confidential platform for 
individuals to report concerns or unethical practices without fear of retaliation. It ensures that both the whistle-blower 
and the individuals involved in processing the disclosure are safeguarded from harassment, victimisation, or any form of 
adverse employment consequences.
 
The Chairperson of the Audit Committee plays a key role in overseeing this framework and is specifically responsible 
for addressing any retaliatory actions or threats. Such instances are treated as independent protected disclosures, 
warranting a thorough review. Based on the findings, the Chairperson may recommend appropriate measures to shield 
the whistle-blower from further risk and is responsible for ensuring the effective implementation of those protective steps.

India’s mobility sector. The 
platform 
facilitated 
over 
` 29.78 lakhs in critical 
financial support, connecting 
compassionate donors with
