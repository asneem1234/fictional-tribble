​Empowering Lives.
Building the Complete 
Sustainable Mobility Ecosystem.
Building on a legacy of over 165 years and a foundation of trust, Greaves Cotton Limited remains dedicated to creating 
sustainable value for all stakeholders. Through continuous innovation, the adoption of advanced technology, and the pursuit 
of new growth opportunities, we deliver high-quality, accessible and reliable solutions that cater to the needs of a rapidly 
evolving world. Committed to ethical business practices, transparency, and accountability, we integrate sustainability into the 
core of our operations, ensuring a lasting positive impact on the environment, communities, employees, customers, investors 
and other stakeholders.
As we present the third edition of our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), we reaffirm our commitment 
to transparency, accountability and enhanced disclosures. This year, we have strengthened our practices beyond our group 
by conducting due diligence of suppliers on ESG parameters.
Further underscoring our dedication to credible and reliable sustainability reporting, we have voluntarily engaged an 
independent assurance partner. While not mandated by regulations, this proactive initiative provides reasonable assurance 
on BRSR core indicators and limited assurance on other sustainability metrics. Through these measures, we continue to set 
new benchmarks in sustainability performance, reinforcing trust and delivering long-term value to all stakeholders.
Our contribution to Sustainable Development Goals are reflected in the disclosures made in this report

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
	
At Greaves, we view ESG as a key enabler of long-term growth, innovation and stakeholder value. Our ESG strategy 
is deeply embedded across all aspects of our operations, from business strategy and supply chain management to 
customer engagement and community impact. As a part of our sustainable initiative, we have reached another milestone 
of Go Green with inauguration of the fourth solar plant at Aurangabad, with estimated 5.1 mn. unit/ year.
	
Over the past years, we have proactively addressed several intricate ESG challenges, leveraging them as catalysts 
for growth, innovation and differentiation which include making our supply chains stronger and more resilient to ESG, 
creating a more inclusive and diverse workplace and leading the way in sustainable practices in our industry. These efforts 
have not only enhanced our ESG performance but also driven business value, fuelled innovation and reinforced our 
commitment to creating a more sustainable and equitable future.
	
Governance remains a cornerstone of our operations, anchored in our core values of Panchatatva—Transparency, 
Integrity, Responsibility, Passion for Excellence and Respect. We have reinforced ethical business practices by 
strengthening governance frameworks, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and implementing policies to 
enhance corporate accountability. Additionally, recognizing the critical importance of data security, we have put in place 
stringent policies and systems to protect customer data and mitigate cybersecurity risks.
	
Our workforce is the foundation of our success, and we are committed to their continuous growth and well-being. 
Through structured training programs, leadership development initiatives, and diverse career opportunities, we equip 
our employees with the skills and competencies needed to excel. Additionally, we prioritize workplace well-being by 
fostering an inclusive, safe and supportive environment.
	
As part of our commitment to ethical and responsible business practices, we conducted a human rights due diligence 
across our manufacturing facilities in collaboration with an independent firm. This initiative reinforces our dedication to 
upholding global labour standards and ensuring a fair, transparent and respectful workplace for all.
	
We are committed to fostering a responsible and sustainable supply chain by embedding ESG principles across our 
procurement processes. Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets clear expectations on environmental sustainability, ethical 
labour practices and governance, with suppliers required to adhere to these standards. To ensure compliance, we obtain 
declarations from suppliers, conduct due diligence during onboarding and periodically provide awareness sessions on 
the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGBRC) to help suppliers integrate best ESG practices. 
Through these measures, we aim to create a resilient, transparent and ethically driven supply chain that aligns with our 
sustainability vision.
	
Beyond our internal operations, we actively engage with the communities in which we operate, driving impact through 
skill development, education and well-being initiatives. Our commitment to sustainable community development aligns 
with our broader ESG goals, fostering inclusive progress and long-term socio-economic empowerment.
	
As we continue to integrate ESG into our business model, we remain focused on driving sustainable and profitable 
growth. Our ongoing initiatives are designed to create long-term value for all stakeholders while advancing our ambition 
to lead the industry in responsible business practices.

Greaves does not reclaim products at the end of their lifecycle. However, we do reuse and recycle packaging materials 
wherever feasible. For instance,
	
1.	
We reuse steel pallets for engine transfers to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), thereby minimizing waste 
generation. This practice of utilizing reusable steel pallets instead of disposable ones not only conserves resources 
but also promotes sustainability.
	
2.	
We use reusable and recyclable Polypropylene packaging boxes multiple times which is used for supplying our 
products to OEMs. This helps us to minimize corrugated box waste generation and promote sustainability.
	
3.	
We have employed a chip wringer to extract oil from scrap coolant, enabling us to reuse the coolant. This process 
efficiently recovers valuable oil while separating it from the coolant, reducing waste and maximizing resource 
utilization. By reusing the coolant, we not only minimize waste but also enhance environmental efficiency.
	
4.	
We have employed oil extractor and tramp oil cleaning machine to extract the oil from machining scrap coolant, 
enabling us to reuse this oil as machine coolant. This process efficiently recovers valuable oil while separating it 
from the scrap, reducing waste by removing tramp from coolant and maximizing resource utilization. By reusing the 
coolant, we not only minimize waste but also enhance environmental efficiency.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
workers? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief. 
Yes/ No
(If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
“Panchatatva” comprising of five values: Transparency, Integrity, Responsibility, Passion for Excellence and 
Respect, towards all our stakeholders is founding pillar to ensure that the business is carried within these 
boundaries ensuring positive workplace environment.
We have rolled out multiple platforms for addressing grievances, accessible to all employees and workers, 
providing them with opportunities to voice and report any complaints or concerns that they may have. 
‘SAMVAAD’ is one such platform where employees and workers collaborate and connect with each other for 
cooperation and better understanding.
We also conduct periodic Welfare Meeting and Safety Committee meeting, for effective grievance redressal 
and ensuring a healthy workplace environment. Unit meetings are periodically held for both contractual and 
non-contractual workers and employees to discuss any concerns or grievances.
Additionally, ‘Whistle Blower Policy’ acts as a grievance mechanism for employees, workers and senior 
management where they can approach the Compliance Officer or the Chairman of the Audit Committee in 
situations of misconduct or breach of code of conduct and any other issues which hamper the functioning of 
the organization. This policy ensures responsible whistle blowing through efficient redressal and disciplinary 
action.
This approach encourages candid feedback and open discussion of issues, without employees fearing of 
repercussions or reprimands.
We strive to ensure transparency and effective redressal through open communication and access for all 
employees and workers to voice their concerns to the Senior Management.
Besides the above we also have a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy to ensure a safe and secure 
working environment which can be accessed at https://greavescotton.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/

b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
	
We have developed an in-house system to identify work-related hazards. This system allows employees and workers 
to spot any hazards and dangers while they are working and once identified, a record of these hazards and risks 
is maintained and further discussed with respective unit heads on a weekly/fortnightly basis to explore scope of 
improvement to eliminate/mitigate the hazard.
	
	
Our risk management process comprises 5 phases:
	
	
1.	
Identification: Identifying potential hazards
	
	
2.	
Assessment: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified hazards
	
	
3.	
Mitigation: Implementing measures to eliminate or reduce hazards
	
	
4.	
Monitoring: Continuously tracking hazard controls
	
	
5.	
Reporting: Documenting and communicating hazard information
	
	
 To prioritize employee and worker safety at our plants, we have implemented proactive measures such as Gemba 
walks, robust reporting mechanisms for near-miss incidents and safety concerns, and active engagement through 
dedicated EHS Committees. Suggestion boxes at plant locations enable employees to contribute to continuous 
safety improvements, fostering a culture of vigilance and accountability. Additionally, we also identify work related 
hazards through job safety analysis, internal and external audits viz. safety audits, fire audits, safety patrolling 
and SMAT audits.
	
	
This structured approach ensures reduced environmental health and safety risks in our commercial operations. 
Stakeholder participation is integral to our risk management strategy.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks?
	
	
Yes, we have implemented several measures to empower employees and workers in identifying and reporting 
work-related hazards, ensuring occupational health and safety. Regular training and awareness sessions are 
provided to equip them with the knowledge and skills to report any hazards or risks they encounter in the workplace. 
Management representatives conduct regular inspections of manufacturing facilities to identify hazards and 
implement necessary corrective actions.
	
	
In addition, we have also established a local safety committee dedicated for overseeing workplace hazards and 
safety. The list of safety committee members is provided at every conspicuous place in the facility and employees 
are encouraged to report any safety related concerns to Committee. The safety committee periodically meets 
and discusses on all the safety incidents along with Corrective Action and Preventive Action Plan and implement 
measures to ensure safety of all employees and workers.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
	
	
Yes, as per the requirement of Factories Act, 1948, our plants are equipped with Occupational Health Centres 
(OHC) or alternate arrangements are made with independent healthcare professionals which can be accessed 
by employees and workers for non-occupational or occupational health problems. We also provide medical and 
health insurance for our employees and workers which helps them to claim their medical bills as per the medical 
insurance policy.

Provide the measures undertaken by the entity to ensure that statutory dues have been deducted and deposited 
by the value chain partners.
	
We prioritize compliance with laws and regulations regarding statutory dues across our value chain. We take our legal 
responsibilities seriously and expect the same from our partners. Before processing payments to contract labour supply 
agencies, we ensure their compliance with statutory obligations, like timely payments for Provident Fund, ESI/Workmen 
Compensation Insurance, Professional Tax and Labour Welfare Fund, if applicable.
	
To facilitate compliance, we withhold payment on agency invoices until they’ve fulfilled their statutory obligations. 
This approach ensures that our partners meet their legal requirements before receiving payments, showcasing our 
commitment to meeting statutory payment requirements.
	
As a part of good corporate governance and our commitment to Human Rights, we conducted ESG due diligence of 
100% of our contractors at plant site to ensure that statutory deposits are being deducted and deposited. This year the 
boundary of due diligence was increased to cover 50% of our suppliers by value, to ensure that the statutory dues are 
being deducted and paid by them.
	
We also took affirmations on compliances with Greaves’s Supplier Code of Conduct (which also covers compliance on 
labour laws, payment of statutory dues) from the critical vendors.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
	
We recognise the importance of water stewardship and have implemented a range of initiatives to optimize its water 
management practices. Plants located at Aurangabad, Ranipet and 2 plants located in Nagpur, have adopted a Zero 
Liquid Discharge approach to ensure the efficient use of water resources. Similarly, at the Talegaon plant located within 
a shared facility, water waste is directed to a centralized treatment plant onsite. Post the treatment, the reclaimed water 
is utilized for gardening purposes, thereby reducing water consumption and promoting environmental sustainability.
	
In a proactive effort to further enhance water resilience, we have established a rainwater harvesting pond at the onset 
of the monsoon season. This reservoir serves as a vital water source year-round, supporting various operational 
activities, including production processes. By reducing reliance on freshwater sources and alleviating pressure on local 
water supplies, we demonstrate our commitment to sustainable water management. These comprehensive initiatives 
underscore our dedication to environmental responsibility and resource efficiency.

that the Company’s staff involved with the preparation of 
the BRSR 2024-25 are adequately trained, systems are 
appropriately updated, and that any changes in reporting 
encompass all significant operational sites.
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
Our responsibility is to examine the BRSR 2024-25 prepared 
by the Company and to report thereon on the non-financial 
sustainability disclosures in the form of an independent 
reasonable assurance conclusion based on the evidence 
obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance 
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued 
by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards 
Board. The standard requires that we plan and perform our 
procedures to obtain a level of assurance about whether the 
non-financial sustainability disclosures in the BRSR 2024-25 
comply with the BRSR framework in all material respects as 
the basis for our reasonable assurance conclusion.
The Firm applies the international standard on quality 
management, which requires the Firm to design, implement 
and operate a quality management system, including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied 
with the independence and other ethical requirements of 
the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ 
International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
(including International Independence Standards) (‘IESBA 
Code’), which is founded on the fundamental principles of 
integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care, 
confidentiality, and professional behaviour. The assurance 
procedures selected depend on our understanding of the 
BRSR 2024-25 and other engagement circumstances and 
our consideration of the areas where material misstatements 
are likely to arise. In obtaining an understanding of the BRSR 
2023-24 and other engagement circumstances, we have 
considered the process used to prepare the BRSR 2024-25 
in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a 
conclusion as to the effectiveness of the Company’s process 
or internal controls over the preparation and presentation of 
the BRSR 2024-25.

Our engagement regarding the non-financial sustainability 
disclosures also included assessing the appropriateness 
of the BRSR 2024-25, the suitability of the criteria used 
by the Company in preparing the BRSR 2024-25 in 
the circumstances of the engagement, evaluating the 
appropriateness of the methods, policies, and procedures, 
and models used in the preparation of the BRSR 2024-25, 
and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company 
in the context of the non-financial sustainability disclosures. 
As part of this engagement, we have not performed any 
procedures by way of audit, review, or verification of the 
financial disclosures nor of the underlying records or other 
sources from which the financial statements and information 
were extracted.
ASSURANCE PROCEDURES
Our assurance process involves performing procedures to 
obtain evidence about the reliability of the disclosures in the 
BRSR 2024-25. The nature, timing, and extent of the selected 
procedures depend on our judgment, including assessing 
the risks of material misstatement of the non-financial 
sustainability disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, we have considered 
internal controls relevant to preparing the BRSR 2024-25 
to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances.
These procedures included; interactions with relevant 
officials to understand their sustainability vision; interaction 
with the Company’s management team to understand the 
translation of the Board of Directors’ vision into action; an 
assessment of the Company’s existing systems used for 
data collection and reporting relevant for fair presentation 
of the Company’s sustainability disclosures; review of 
the Company’s approach for stakeholder engagement 
and materiality assessment process including existing 
materiality scoring criteria; testing of evidence supporting 
the data; evaluating the appropriateness of the quantification 
methods used to arrive at the non-financial sustainability 
disclosures presented in the BRSR 2024-25; understanding 
the appropriateness of various assumptions, estimations 
and materiality thresholds used by the Company for data 
analysis; assessment of the consistency between the data 
for the selected sustainability performance indicators 
and the related written comments in the narrative of the 
BRSR 2024-25; interactions with staff responsible for 
data collection, collation and reporting; preparation of 
observation letter, if any, based on review and classification 
of findings for potential risk to sustainability framework; 
and discussion of the observations and findings with the 
management team.

made by Greaves Cotton Limited for the reporting period 
2024-2025. The scope included assessing the organization’s

LEVEL OF ASSURANCE
Our work resulted in a reasonable assurance engagement 
of BRSR Core indicators and Limited assurance on other 
sustainability indicators in BRSR. We conducted our 
procedures in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) and 
obtained evidence to support our conclusions.
