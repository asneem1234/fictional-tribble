7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure):
In a world where sustainability, responsible business practices, and stakeholder engagement are paramount, 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) has become a critical component of corporate management. ESG 
governance involves the systems and processes through which organizations integrate environmental, social, 
and governance considerations into their decision-making, operations, and risk management frameworks. At 
Finolex, sustainability has been our core value for years. Everything we do is done with excellence, considering 
both the present and the future. Guided by the wisdom of the farmers we collaborate with, we recognize 
that the innovative ideas we sow today will flourish in the future. We possess the patience and resolve to 
nurture these ideas until they come to fruition. With every step we take, we prioritize our stakeholders and 
the environment. We invest in their future and our shared future. 
Our ESG journey began with the goal of holistic growth as an organization, creating value for all our stakeholders. 
Our initial milestone was achieving the ‘Responsible Care’ accreditation from the Indian Chemical Council in 
FY 2021-22. This accreditation underscores our dedication to continuous improvement in safe chemicals 
management and excellence in environmental, health, safety, and security performance. We are committed 
to delivering products and services of the highest quality to our customers while minimizing harm to the 
environment and society. Our progress is evident, through increase in renewable energy share from 3.2% in 
FY23-24 to 11.14% in FY24-25. This contributed to reduction in our carbon footprint by more than 31,000 
MT CO2e (against last year’s 20,000 MT CO2e), along with other energy saving initiatives. Further to this, 
Carbon sequestration study conducted in FY 24-25, showed more than 22,000 MT CO2e carbon sequestered 
through Biomass. As part of our ESG stewardship, we have also recycled over 311,000 m³ effluent back into 
our processes and harvested over 467,000 Lakh m³ of rainwater. During FY 24-25, we have also extended 
Integrated Management System covering ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 to the remaining sites and 
recertification of Responsible care logo for next 3 years making it 100% coverage. 
We have also certified for ISO27001:2022 Information security management systems. Other areas of 
improvement include Great Place To Work (“GPTW”) certification for the 3rd year in succession, roll out of 
Biodiversity policy. Our CSR initiatives through our CSR partner Mukul Madhav Foundation (“MMF) support 
all the 17 SDGs with focus on Health, education, environmental protection, and community well-being, 
making a real difference where it matters most. In FY 24-25, one of the initiatives includes Olive ridley (Turtle) 
conservation project at Gaokhadi Ratnagiri Beach through collaboration with Forest Department.

Reflecting on the past 44 years, we realize that our journey is just beginning, with the most challenging work 
still ahead. This prospect fills us with purpose and excitement for the future. The legacy we’ve built has united 
a large, thriving family, creating a bright future filled with possibilities. We acknowledge that climate change 
poses the greatest business challenge in the coming years, as we face unprecedented extreme weather 
events like heatwaves, floods, and cyclones. To ensure a positive environmental footprint, we are committed to 
increasing the use of renewable energy resources and reducing specific energy consumption. It is our collective 
duty to care for Mother Earth and use natural resources efficiently at each of our manufacturing facilities.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system
Yes, the Company is committed to a safe and healthy workplace through its Safety, Health and 
Environment (SHE) policy, implemented across all plants and offices. It is certified under ISO 9001 
(Quality), ISO 14001 (Environment), and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety) as part of its 
Integrated Management System.
To mitigate risks and prevent work-related injuries or illnesses, the Company conducts regular safety 
initiatives, including National Safety Week, Fire Services Week, audits, inspections, mock drills, and first 
aid training, with active participation from all employees.
A robust Process Safety Management (PSM) system with 11 elements and 27 procedures guides risk 
assessment, hazard control, SOPs/SMPs, equipment reliability, and safe work practices covering material 
handling, transport, lifting, and PPE usage. All incidents and near misses are reported, investigated, and 
analysed for continuous improvement.
Remarks:
ISO 45001 system has been implemented as a part of an Integrated Management system.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
Pre-start up Safety Review (PSSR) is followed prior to start up to ensure that all safety systems are in place. 
Considering complexity of process and known hazards, the Company follows below methodologies to 
address the risks:
1	
Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study - Hazard & Operability study (HAZOP) is a systematic way 
to identify possible SHE hazards in the system and suggest recommendations. It is a process of 
examining Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&IDs) by applying guide words and parameters 
to all pipes and vessels in the process. This explicitly identifies the hazards, the potential failures, and 
the potential causes of failure and the recommended actions to address the issues.
2	
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - FMEA study is conducted for critical equipment and 
processes. The Company uses it to design a process, review and improve a process which further 
acts as an efficient process control. Its’ step-by-step approach identifies each failure mode, with the 
analysis, then estimating the effects of failure and devising ways of controlling the process so that 
failure can be prevented.
3	
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) - This analysis method is mainly used in Safety engineering and reliability 
engineering to understand how systems can fail and to identify the best ways to reduce the risk 
or to determine event rates of an accident or a particular system failure. This helps the Company in 
highlighting the critical components related to system failure and to prioritize the action items in 
order to solve the problems.
4	
What-if method - It is done for critical equipment where failure is possible by different modes and 
failure can cause a hazardous situation.
5	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA)/ Task Risk analysis - JSA is conducted for all jobs involving high risk & 
critical job.
6	
Reporting of unsafe condition - Any worker / employee from any department can report unsafe 
condition from the work premises related to safe operation of the process.
Statutory Reports
19
7	
Other Measures such as Safety Walk, Safety Audit and Safety Report are carried to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks. We strictly follow the Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) 
process and maintain HIRA register for each critical activity.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes. The Company regularly reviews and enhances its health and safety practices under the supervision 
of the Director – Technical cum Occupier. A Safety Committee comprising executive and worker 
representatives addresses safety concerns across office and plant locations.
A self-spot audit system enables employees to report unsafe acts and conditions. To strengthen HSE 
awareness, the Company organizes events such as National Safety Week, Fire Service Week, and World 
Environment Week, featuring safety training, fire drills, quizzes, poster competitions, and safety pledges.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No)
Yes. Employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. Medical 
centers and first aid facilities are available for both employees and workers. They are covered under group 
mediclaim and group accident policy.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights 
impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No): 
Yes. The Company has a clearly defined focal point at each office, plant, or location, with the Head of HR 
responsible for addressing human rights concerns. This structure is enabled by robust Human Rights and 
Whistleblower Polices that provides the guiding framework for managing and resolving such issues. Further 
strengthening this approach, “Dial HR - Happy to Listen” initiative offer employees a safe and confidential 
space to share feedback, raise concerns, and feel genuinely heard.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases: 
The Company has robust mechanisms in place to safeguard complainants in cases of discrimination and 
harassment. Through its Whistleblower Policy, employees are encouraged to report unethical behavior, 
misconduct, or non-compliance without fear of retaliation including incidents that may lead to reputational 
or financial harm. Complainants are protected from unfair treatment such as threats, demotion, suspension, 
or denial of promotion, and may escalate concerns directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Their 
identities are kept confidential to the extent permitted by law, and individuals assisting in investigations 
receive the same protection. The Company also ensures appropriate support is provided during legal or 
disciplinary proceedings. These safeguards are reinforced by a strong Code of Conduct, the Internal Complaints 
Committee (ICC) established under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013, and the Equal 
Opportunity Policy, which collectively promote ethical conduct, diversity, and a discrimination-free, respectful 
work environment.

value chain partners. This requirement is formally embedded within contractual documents, including 
Purchase Orders and Agreements. The code outlines essential human rights standards and ethical practices 
that suppliers are expected to uphold, reinforcing the Company’s commitment to responsible sourcing and

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community: 
The Company has established a dedicated CSR/PR team at each of its plant locations to facilitate effective 
grievance redressal, including concerns raised by the local community. Upon receiving a grievance, the issue 
is addressed through a clearly defined escalation matrix, which typically involves the Plant Operations Head 
and the Human Resources team, depending on the nature of the matter. Initial efforts focus on resolving the 
grievance at the local plant level to ensure timely and context-specific responses. However, if resolution at this 
level is not feasible or requires broader intervention, the grievance is escalated to higher levels of management. 
This structured and tiered approach promotes transparency, accountability, and responsiveness, reinforcing 
the Company’s commitment to addressing community concerns with integrity and care. Approach enables 
transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to the concerns of the community.
