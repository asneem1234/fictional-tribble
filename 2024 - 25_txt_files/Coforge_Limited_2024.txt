Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)
Introduction
Coforge considers sustainability to be one of its core 
values. We have been committed to fostering sustainable 
communities for a long time, and in the past few years, we have 
embedded sustainability across our strategic and operational 
framework. We are committed to aligning ourselves with the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and our leadership 
is unwavering in its dedication to realizing this ambition. As a 
result, we recently revisited our sustainability philosophy to 
clearly articulate our sustainability values, goals, and actions 
to our stakeholders. We are pleased to announce our ESG 
vision, “In Harmony with the Environment”, that will enable 
unidirectional strategy, lead our actions, and help us fulfil 
our commitments.
Our vision embodies our sustainability values of working for the 
planet, people, community, and prosperity, and indicates the 
core idea behind our sustainability strategy. It is our guiding 
force for integrating different sustainability dimensions to 
create an interconnected system, which is pivotal in steering 
our efforts to be a responsible organization ahead. We would 
leverage constant leadership oversight, innovation, and 
flexibility in adapting to evolving market needs to realize our 
goal of bringing harmony between the environment and us
Our ESG mission is defined across three core areas:
1. 
Climate action: We have committed to being:
•	 Carbon neutral by 2040: Coforge took a big step towards 
addressing the climate crisis. We have committed to 
setting near-term and net-zero emission reduction 
targets as per the guidance from the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi). The development underscores 
our dedication to driving meaningful climate action. 
The commitment reflects Coforge’s alignment with 
the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. As 
part of this pledge, we will set our emissions priorities 
across the key levers of energy, waste, transportation, 
nature, and supply chain. We have begun working 
on setting science-based targets and action plans 
to ensure accountability and transparency. We will 
continuously measure and monitor our progress and 
communicate it regularly to maintain trust.
•	 Water positive by 2040: We believe water is the 
most precious resource. Using this belief, we have 
implemented 100% recycling of wastewater at our 
Greater Noida and Kolhapur campuses. The treated 
water is used for landscaping, horticulture, and non-
potable purposes. The plan is to expand this initiative 
and become a water-positive organization by 2040.
•	 Zero waste by 2040: We have adopted circularity 
to minimize waste and maximize the efficiency 
of resources. We have completely transitioned to 
authorized recyclers and vendors to dispose of 
hazardous and e-waste, have zero food waste (all food 
waste is either converted to compost or used to feed 
livestock), and have sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 
all our owned locations (Greater Noida and Kolhapur). 
Our next milestone is to remove all single-use plastic 
from all our facilities to make a significant impact and 
move closer to our goal.
2. 
Social inclusiveness and community development: 
Our social and community development program is 
hinged on keeping our people engaged, promoting a 
bias-free culture, leading by example, and giving back to 
the community. We have a comprehensive community 
engagement programme, with a strong focus on 
education, skill development, and employability.
3. 
Good governance and business ethics: For us, ethics 
and integrity are non-negotiable. We govern each aspect 
of our business through stringent policies, procedures, 
and guidelines. Our board is diverse, empowered, and 
inclusive. We engage regularly and meaningfully with 
our partners and suppliers. We provide our clients with 
a thorough identification and assessment of upcoming 
risks, along with recommendations to mitigate them. We 
have established a robust framework to ensure ongoing 
policy assessment, keeping it current and relevant.

external stakeholders to report any 
concerns about ethics, unethical 
behavior, actual or suspected frauds,

victimization of those who use this 
mechanism. 
Furthermore, our company has a Policy 
on Prevention of Sexual Harassment 
of Women at the workplace, which is 
in line with The Sexual Harassment of 
Women at the Workplace (Prevention,

are prominently displayed in all units of 
Coforge. We are committed to providing 
a work atmosphere that is free from 
discrimination and harassment, 
regardless of caste, religion, marital 
status, gender, sexual orientation, etc.

relationship with the community 
through various Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) projects. These 
projects are characterized by a 
collaborative and interactive approach,

Data Privacy
Risk
The identification of potential 
privacy risks is paramount to our 
organization’s commitment to 
data protection. Failure to identify 
these risks could expose personal 
information to unauthorized access, 
misuse, or disclosure, potentially 
leading to data breaches with 
significant financial and reputational 
consequences. Furthermore, 
neglecting to identify and address 
privacy risks increases the likelihood 
of non-compliance with data 
protection laws and regulations, 
resulting in legal penalties and 
erosion of stakeholder trust. By 
prioritizing the identification of 
privacy risks, we aim to minimize 
potential harm to individuals whose 
data we handle and uphold our 
responsibility to safeguard their 
information.
•	
Our organization’s commitment to data privacy is 
demonstrated through a robust and multifaceted 
approach, designed to meet regulatory requirements 
and safeguard the personal information entrusted to us. 
Our strategy is built upon the following key pillars:
	−
A Foundation of Compliance and Best Practices: 
We operate under the guidance of a robust 
Privacy Information Management System (PIMS), 
ensuring adherence to all relevant legal, regulatory, 
and contractual obligations. This commitment 
is validated by our certifications under ISO/IEC  
27701:2019 (Privacy Information Management 
System), and SOC  2 Type II Attestation.
	−
Global Governance and Oversight: Our global 
privacy policy provides a consistent framework for 
data protection across all geographies, business 
units, and stakeholder relationships. This policy is 
actively managed and continuously improved by our 
dedicated Data Protection Officer and Privacy Team.
	−
Proactive Risk Management: We employ a 
comprehensive suite of technical and organizational 
measures to proactively identify and mitigate 
privacy risks. These measures include thorough PII 
inventories, Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), and 
robust incident and breach management protocols.
	−
Advanced Security Technologies: We leverage 
cutting-edge technologies to protect personal 
data from unauthorized access and misuse. This 
includes the deployment of Data Loss Prevention 
(DLP) systems, data classification tools, and strong 
encryption methods.
	−
Stringent Access Controls: Access to personal 
information is carefully controlled through the 
implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication 
(MFA), privileged access management, and regular 
access reviews, ensuring that data is only accessible 
on a need-to-know basis.
	−
Privacy-Centric Development: We integrate privacy 
considerations into every stage of the product 
development lifecycle, ensuring that new products 
and services are designed with privacy in mind.
	−
Vendor Accountability: We hold our vendors and 
third-party partners to the same high standards of 
data protection, conducting thorough due diligence 
and establishing clear contractual obligations.
	−
Data Subject Rights Management: We utilize 
specialized tools for data discovery, enabling us to 
efficiently identify and locate personal data across 
our systems. We also employ dedicated Data Subject 
Request (DSR) management tools to streamline and 
effectively respond to data subject requests, such as 
access, rectification, and erasure requests, in a timely 
and compliant manner.
	−
Continuous Education and Awareness: We foster a 
culture of privacy awareness through mandatory 
training programs, ongoing communication 
campaigns, and readily accessible resources.
	−
Independent Validation: Our commitment to data 
privacy is further validated through periodic reviews 
and audits conducted by independent audit firms, 
ensuring ongoing compliance and effectiveness.

b. 	
E-waste
	
c. 	
Hazardous waste
	
d. 	
Other waste
	
Coforge Limited’s business does not involve physical product manufacturing. Our core business is in IT/ITeS-related services, 
including design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance of software, system integration solutions, and IT/
ITeS/Telecom infrastructure structure management services. As a result, there are typically non-tangible products to reclaim, 
recycle, or dispose of at the end of their life cycle. The Company aims to develop and maintain software solutions that include 
services for our clients.
4.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) does not apply to Coforge Limited. However, the Company acknowledges its 
commitment towards waste management following the Plastic Waste Management Rules, E-Waste Management Rules, 
Battery Waste Management Rules, and regulations governing Hazardous and Other Wastes. To effectively manage the waste 
generated and ensure environmental sustainability, the Company has implemented comprehensive waste management 
practices, such as:
•	 Single-use plastics are prohibited within the facilities, aligning with the ban on such materials. Across facilities, the waste 
segregation process is facilitated by color-coded dustbins to ensure proper categorization before disposal, with waste 
directed to municipal authorities and third-party recyclers as needed.
•	 In the Greater Noida facility, to address food waste, the Company has established in-house processes to convert organic 
waste into valuable manure, minimizing the negative environmental footprint.
•	 The Company has adopted a sustainable approach to effectively manage battery waste by procuring batteries under 
‘buy-back terms,’ i.e., the same vendor responsible for procurement is also engaged in the environmentally safe disposal 
of batteries, at the end of their life.
•	 E-waste is managed through authorized e-waste recyclers by regulatory guidelines, reflecting the Company’s strong 
commitment to responsible handling and disposal of e-waste to minimize waste sent to the landfill.
	
By adhering to ethical practices, the Company complies with the relevant waste management regulations and actively 
contributes to environmental conservation and sustainable business practices.

Action Taken
This is not applicable for Coforge Limited. However, Coforge Limited acknowledges and addresses the environmental concerns 
associated with its operations. The Company’s key focus areas are managing carbon emissions from our transportation fleet, 
waste management and water management.
Management of Carbon Emissions from Transportation Fleet:
•	 Identified Concern: The large, outsourced transportation fleet for employee commute contributes to carbon emissions.
•	 Action Taken: In an initiative to reduce carbon emissions, the Company transitioned its transportation fleet in the NCR 
region from diesel to CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) to minimize the negative ecological impact.
Water Consumption Management:
•	 Identified Concern: The high headcount requirement leads to substantial water consumption in facilities.
•	 Action Taken: To curtail water consumption, the Company has implemented low-flow and sensor-based water taps, and 
water-less urinals (in one facility in the Greater Noida campus). In certain facilities, treated water from STPs is used for 
flushing and horticulture. This multi-faceted approach underscores the Company’s ESG commitment to efficient water 
usage and sustainable practices.

Lab where over 500 children from the community studied.
•	 300 women entrepreneurs received training in Pune through Centre for Youth Development and Activities (CYDA), Pune,

•	 In Noida, 3,138 activities were conducted on waste segregation, reduction of waste generation, and home composting, 
reaching approx. 4.5 lakh people. 5,000 sanitation workers were trained and provided with safety gear. 25,715 tons of solid

over the previous year. Coforge donated a litter collection machine, named Jatayu, to the Noida Municipal Authority, which 
collected 792 tons of street litter from the roads of Noida.
•	 Coforge sponsored the plantation of 111 trees in collaboration with Sankalp Taru foundation, Hyderabad.
•	 Environment conservation interventions at Pasali Valley to reduce deforestation, soil nurturing, entrepreneurship 
development among 7,000 below poverty line and marginalized villagers in Pune.

Conclusion
Bureau Veritas conducted a comprehensive review of 
Coforge’s BRSR core disclosures for the period April 1, 2024, 
to March 31, 2025, as presented in its Report. Based on the 
procedures performed, evidence obtained, and information 
and explanations provided by management, and subject to 
the inherent limitations outlined in the Report, in our opinion, 
Coforge’s BRSR core disclosures are, in all material respects, 
prepared in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India’s (SEBI) BRSR guidelines.
As part of our independent reasonable assurance engagement, 
we rigorously evaluated the robustness and appropriateness of 
the underlying reporting systems and processes used to collect, 
analyse, and validate the reported information.
Our assessment confirms that these systems are effectively 
designed and implemented to ensure alignment with SEBI’s 
BRSR framework, supporting the accuracy, reliability, and 
completeness of the disclosures.

identification of material topics, and data reporting structure.

responsibility of the management of “Coforge. Bureau Veritas 
(BV) was not involved in the drafting or preparation of the 
report and any other backup data for the reporting period. The 
responsibility of BV was to provide reasonable independent 
assurance for the sustainability of non-financial disclosures as

the data and information provided in the report are proper and 
without any discrepancy. Bureau Veritas shall not be held liable

Uncertainty

is inherent in the assurance process. Uncertainties stem from 
limitations in quantification models used, assumptions, or data 
conversion factors used or may be present in the estimation 
of data used to arrive at results. Our conclusions with respect 
to this assurance are naturally subject to any inherent 
uncertainty(ies) involved in the assurance process.
