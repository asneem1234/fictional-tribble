1
Climate 
Change 
Risk
Sugarcane cultivation necessitates 
significant considerations regarding 
climate change variability, as it 
is 
contingent 
upon 
consistent 
weather patterns.  The timelines 
for 
harvesting, 
sugar 
recovery, 
and crop yield may be impacted 
by 
fluctuations 
in 
temperature, 
altering monsoon behaviour, and 
occasional extreme weather events. 
Additionally, the significance of 
bolstering the Company's climate 
strategy to manage prospective 
compliance 
requirements 
and 
improve 
its 
sustainability 
performance is underscored by 
the growing emphasis on carbon 
emissions reduction from regulators 
and stakeholders.
The 
Company 
has 
started 
monitoring 
and 
tracking 
greenhouse gas emissions and is 
engaged in the exploration and 
implementation 
of 
alternative 
renewable energy sources to 
mitigate its environmental impact. 
The 
Company 
has 
replaced 
some of its existing equipment 
with 
more 
energy-efficient 
alternatives. Additionally, it is 
advocating sustainable farming 
techniques 
and 
investments 
in sugarcane varieties that are 
suitable for a variety of climatic 
and soil conditions as part of its 
climate resilience efforts.  
Negative
Opportunity
The 
bioethanol 
production 
of 
the sugar industry is a sustainable 
alternative to fossil fuels, which is 
well-suited to facilitate the transition 
to a low-carbon economy. The 
expansion of the use of sugarcane 
for ethanol blending is consistent 
with government policies, including 
the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) 
Programme, and bolsters national 
energy security efforts. This presents 
a 
strategic 
growth 
opportunity 
for the Company to enhance its 
role in the circular economy by 
incorporating 
by-products 
into 
renewable energy solutions.
Positive
2
Water 
Management 
Risk
The operations of sugarcane farming 
demands substantial water usage 
and 
sensitive 
to 
environmental 
risk such as  Water scarcity and 
contamination. These risks have 
the potential to disrupt supply chain 
continuity and lead to increased 
operational costs due to the need 
for alternative sourcing or water 
treatment measures.
ASEL 
has 
effectively 
implemented a Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) system across 
its distilleries, facilitating the 
reuse of water in an efficient 
manner. The treated water 
is repurposed for irrigation, 
substantially reducing exposure 
to 
water 
scarcity 
risks. 
Furthermore, the Company has 
introduced water harvesting 
initiatives, including the use of 
wells to enhance groundwater 
replenishment.

Waste 
Management 
Opportunity
Adopting 
effective 
waste 
management practices can enhance 
resource efficiency through the 
recycling, reuse, and repurposing of 
by-products such as bagasse, press 
mud, and molasses. This not only 
reduces dependence on virgin raw 
materials and lowers waste disposal 
costs but also opens up new revenue 
streams through the generation 
of bioenergy, compost, and other 
value-added products. Our bio-
fertilisers enhance soil fertility and 
crop yield by converting press-mud 
into an eco-friendly, cost-effective 
solution that supports sustainable 
agriculture.
Positive
4
Health and 
Safety of 
Employees and 
Workers 
Risk
The sugar sector is associated with 
health and safety risks for employees 
and workers due to the operation 
of heavy machinery, equipment, 
and intricate processes. Possible 
hazards include injuries, accidents, 
or occupational health issues, which 
may arise from equipment failures, 
inadequate training, or lapses in 
following safety procedures. These 
incidents 
can 
adversely 
impact 
employee and worker well-being, 
while also potentially damaging the 
company’s 
reputation, 
lowering 
morale, diminishing engagement, 
increasing 
attrition, 
and 
posing 
challenges in attracting and retaining 
skilled talent.
The Company reinforced its 
commitment to employee and 
worker health and safety by 
rolling out structured training 
sessions and awareness initiatives 
on safety protocols. The 5-S 
system was adopted to support 
safety objectives and enhance 
overall 
workplace 
conditions. 
Investments were also made in 
upgrading safety infrastructure 
and 
procuring 
necessary 
equipment to ensure a safer 
work environment. Efforts were 
made to foster active employee 
and 
worker 
participation 
by 
encouraging 
engagement 
in 
safety 
programmes 
and 
the identification of potential 
hazards.
Negative
5
Human Capital 
Development 
 Opportunity
Providing employees and workers 
with training and skill development 
opportunities 
can 
significantly 
enhance productivity and streamline 
operations. A well-trained workforce 
is more capable of executing tasks 
efficiently, resulting in higher output 
and 
Additionally, 
a 
well-trained 
workforce is more likely to uphold 
quality benchmarks and comply 
with safety guidelines, helping to 
minimise the chances of product-
related issues, recalls, and additional 
costs. minimised waste.

Product Quality 
and Safety 
Risk
Compliance-related risks such as 
false claims, customer grievances, 
and potential regulatory penalties 
can have considerable impacts. 
Any lapse in product safety or 
quality may lead to a loss of 
customer confidence and harm the 
company’s reputation. Additionally, 
adverse publicity stemming from 
safety 
concerns 
can 
negatively 
influence sales and weaken the 
brand reputation.
We have embedded strict quality 
control protocols within our 
production process to meet 
regulatory

Governance 
Risk
India’s sugar sector operates under 
extensive 
regulatory 
oversight, 
particularly in areas such as pricing, 
exports, 
and 
imports. 
Strong 
corporate governance is essential 
to ensure full compliance with 
these regulations and to avoid legal 
complications or penalties. It is also 
vital for the company to maintain 
business practices that reflect both 
ethical norms and legal obligations.
To enhance our governance 
framework, we have established 
and 
implemented 
internal 
Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) across all departments, 
customised to suit the specific 
demands of our sector. Our 
anti-corruption 
measures 
are 
strictly 
applied, 
helping 
to 
cultivate a culture rooted in 
integrity 
and 
accountability. 
Regular training sessions are 
conducted for employees and 
workers on ethical behaviour, 
the code of conduct, and anti-
bribery guidelines to reinforce 
transparency and compliance. 
We

standards, allowing only nominal commemorative items. The policy reaffirms ASEL’s dedication to anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery practices, necessitating the highest standards of integrity at all levels of the organisation. 
Furthermore, the Whistle Blower Policy establishes a formal process for reporting any concerns regarding unethical 
behaviour or unlawful practices. It delineates the procedures for contacting the Ombudsperson and the protections

Yes. 
ASEL has implemented explicit procedures to prevent and manage conflicts of interest that may arise among 
senior management, KMPs, and members of the Board, as delineated in its Code of Conduct. The policy mandates 
that these individuals consistently act in the Company’s best interest and refrain from any situation in which their 
personal interests may conflict with or appear to conflict with those of the Company. There is a requirement that 
KMPs and senior management disclose any actual or potential conflict to the BOD, and directors must disclose any 
such conflict to the Chairperson. In an effort to further reduce these risks, directors and KMPs are prohibited from 
accepting personal benefits from parties that are interested in conducting business with the Company, participating 
in decisions where they have a direct or indirect interest, or receiving remuneration related to their services from 
any source other than the Company. The objective of these measures is to guarantee transparency, impartiality, and 
integrity in all business transactions.

The Company sources nearly 100% of its sugarcane from local farmers situated in the vicinity of its manufacturing 
units, ensuring that raw material procurement remains both sustainable and efficient. This localized sourcing 
model significantly reduces the environmental impact and cost associated with long-distance transportation. In 
several regions, sugarcane is still delivered to the mills via bullock carts, also contributes to lower emissions and 
supports the preservation of rural livelihoods.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of

Plastics (including packaging)
Plastic is used for packaging certain products which is subsequently reclaimed by a 
CPCB-registered third party. Additionally, we ensure that all plastic we introduce into the 
market is offset by meeting our Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requirements 
as stipulated in the Plastic Waste Management Rule, 2018.
E-waste
The Company’s products and packaging materials do not contain electrical or electronic 
components, which means that no E-waste is generated during the production, use, or 
disposal of our products.
Hazardous waste
The packaging of our products sold does not generate any hazardous waste due to its 
characteristics.
Other Waste

EPR is applicable to ASEL under the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). ASEL has obtained

10.	 Health and Safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
Yes. 
ASEL has successfully implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System that 
is applicable to the entire workforce, including all employees and workers across operations. The system is an 
120
Avadh Sugar & Energy Limited
integral component of the Company’s Health, Safety, Security, Environment, and Quality (HSSEQ) Policy, which 
underscores a steadfast dedication to the preservation of exceptional workplace safety and employee well-being. 
The coverage system incorporates measures to identify, assess, and mitigate health, safety, and environmental 
risks by conducting regular audits, hazard identification, and risk assessments. The Company conducts regular 
audits and risk assessments, integrates HSSEQ parameters into decision-making processes, and provides the 
requisite financial and human resources for continuous improvement. Furthermore, it guarantees stakeholder 
engagement, communication, and training to improve HSSEQ awareness and proficiency. The Company’s ESG 
Policy serves to further solidify these commitments by guaranteeing a secure and healthy work environment that 
adheres to all occupational health and safety regulations.
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
ASEL regards the identification of work-related hazards and the conduct of routine risk assessments as essential 
components of its dedication to workplace safety. A structured system is in place to routinely identify and 
evaluate hazards, which encompasses both routine and non-routine activities. This encompasses unannounced 
examinations and planned audits conducted by internal and external experts to ensure a proactive approach. 
The safety committee, which is composed of cross-functional members, conducts periodic evaluations 
and risk assessments in all operational areas. The results of these assessments are then presented at senior 
management meetings.
In order to implement timely corrective and preventive actions, exhaustive investigations and root cause analyses 
are conducted in the event of incidents, near misses, or system failures. Hazard identification is also incorporated 
into the recruitment and deployment of personnel and service providers, as well as in the procurement of 
apparatus, equipment, and materials. The Company reinforces this process by conducting regular training 
sessions and awareness seminars, which enable employees and workers to more effectively identify and mitigate 
potential risks.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
Yes. 
ASEL has implemented transparent procedures within its HSSEQ system to facilitate the reporting of work-
related hazards and the expression of safety concerns without hesitation by employees and workers. They are 
able to identify and report potential hazards in their work environment through open communication channels, 
such as safety meetings and regular interactions. Corrective actions are actively developed with these inputs 
in mind. The Company also prioritises the well-being of its employees and workers by fostering a safety-first 
culture in which they are encouraged to remove themselves from potentially hazardous situations without fear 
of retribution.
d.	 Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
Yes. ASEL ensures that all its employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services.

12. 	Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
Several measures are implemented by ASEL to ensure that all employees and workers are provided with a secure 
and healthy work environment. The Company adheres to a transparent safety policy, which is supported by 
consistent measures, including annual safety assessments conducted by independent third-party experts. These 
audits adhere to the Manufacture, Storage, and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989, BIS-14489 standards 
and other relevant regulations. ASEL maintains a safety committee that convenes on a regular basis to evaluate safety 
protocols at its various locations, with a particular emphasis on boiler safety. An external agency is responsible for 
the development of emergency response plans, which encompass the potential varieties of accidents, associated 
risks, and the necessary actions in each scenario. Emergency procedures, communication, and the secure restart of 
operations are the subjects of safety training for all employees, including security and contract staff. Fire exercises 
are conducted periodically to simulate emergency situations, which encompass the use of alarms, firefighting, first 
aid, and the summoning of medical teams. These measures assist the organisation in safeguarding all individuals and 
preventing incidents. ASEL also guarantees a secure work environment by fostering respect and preventing any form 
of harassment.

1. 	 Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
ASEL conducts a structured process to identify its key stakeholder groups, which involves first mapping all individuals 
and entities that are impacted by our operations. This entails conducting internal evaluations to identify a diverse 
array of constituents, such as farmers, local communities, industry bodies, and supply chain partners. Subsequently, 
a stakeholder analysis is implemented, which assesses each group according to its influence, relevance, and 
vulnerability. This analysis assists the Company in prioritising engagement, with a particular emphasis on vulnerable, 
marginalised, and disadvantaged groups. These practices are regulated by ASEL’s Stakeholder Engagement and 
Advocacy Policy, which delineates the fundamentals of responsible communication, inclusive engagement, and 
systematic stakeholder identification..

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues 
caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No) 
Yes. The Company has established a focal point to address human rights concerns that are associated with its 
operations or supply chain. The Stakeholder Engagement Policy, Code of Conduct, Whistle Blower Policy, Equal 
Opportunity Policy, and Supplier Code of Conduct are all integral to the organisation’s dedication to human rights. 
The Company’s dedication to the dignity, rights, and well-being of all stakeholders, with a particular emphasis on 
vulnerable and marginalised groups, is comprehensively reinforced by these policies.
The Equal Opportunity Policy explicitly incorporates a human rights clause that guarantees that all individuals are 
regarded with dignity and respect, and that a work environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying is 
fostered. This is facilitated by the Code of Conduct, which guarantees equitable and impartial treatment based on 
individual capabilities, regardless of marital status, age, gender, disability, ethnicity, caste, or religion.
The Company is wholly committed to the principles of fair play, equity, and justice. It is dedicated to the preservation 
of a workplace that is inclusive and non-hostile, with a particular emphasis on the well-being of female employees. 
In order to safeguard against sexual harassment in the workplace, a specific policy has been established. This policy 
guarantees the prevention, redressal, and resolution of sexual harassment complaints in accordance with relevant 
laws and industry standards.
In addition, the Supplier Code of Conduct extends these expectations to the Company’s business partners, mandating 
strict adherence to labour and human rights standards, which include the prohibition of child labour, forced labour 
and discriminatory practices.

5. 	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues
The Grievance Redressal Policy of the Company establishes a structured and responsive framework for the resolution 
of stakeholder concerns, thereby enhancing trust and transparency at all levels.  This mechanism is applicable to 
all individuals affiliated with the Company, including directors, consultants, contractors, business partners, and 
employees/workers (permanent, transient, and contractual).  The primary contact point for registering grievances or 
enquiries is a dedicated email ID, and all matters are handled with confidentiality and fairness.
 The process is supervised by the Company Secretary & Compliance Officer, who guarantees that complaints are 
resolved in a timely and impartial manner.  Furthermore, a Labour Welfare Officer is appointed at each unit to 
directly address employee and worker-related grievances.  The Company consistently enhances the efficacy and 
effectiveness of this mechanism by soliciting feedback from stakeholders.
 The Legal Department and the Audit Committee are actively engaged in the facilitation of stakeholder concern 
resolution to further reinforce their commitment.  The Company also maintains an open-door policy, which 
encourages all employees, regardless of their employment status, to raise concerns regarding workplace conduct, 
human rights, or ethics without hesitation.

8. 	 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
Through robust policies that safeguard complainants in discrimination and harassment cases, ASEL maintains a 
respectful and inclusive work environment.  The Grievance Redressal and Whistle Blower Policies guarantee the 
confidentiality of the complainant’s identity and require unbiased investigations, with the Ombudsperson and Audit 
Committee providing oversight.  The Code of Conduct prohibits workplace harassment and establishes protections 
for complainants, with a particular emphasis on women.  In addition, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Policy 
serves to reinforce a zero-tolerance stance against discrimination and to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly, 
thereby preventing any negative repercussions for those who report concerns.

^ Revenue from operations has been adjusted based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using the latest conversion 
factor for India, as published by IMF. A PPP conversion factor of 20.66 has been applied for both the FY 2023–24 
and FY 2024-25.
*Waste intensity in terms of physical output has been calculated based on the total output of products (sugar, 
molasses, bagasse and ethanol) for FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 as per the SEBI’s guidance, dated December 20, 2024.
Note: : In the current year, the increase in non-hazardous waste compared to the previous year is attributed to 
the revamping and refurbishment activities across our plant units. Accordingly, the previous year’s data has been 
updated to ensure comparability.

mud and furnace ash, which are converted into organic manure. Bagasse is utilised for power generation.  These 
procedures contribute to the reduction of waste and the promotion of a circular approach to resource utilisation. 
Performance evaluations and audits are implemented on an ongoing basis to evaluate efficiency and pinpoint areas 
for enhancement.  Our commitment to minimising environmental impact is further illustrated by the operation of 
one of our manufacturing facilities as a ZLD unit.  
The guidelines outlined in our HSSEQ policy are adhered to in order to minimise the use of hazardous and toxic 
compounds.  This encompasses the implementation of safer alternatives whenever feasible, the establishment of 
appropriate systems to mitigate risks, and the provision of employees with the requisite training.  When selecting 
materials, equipment, and external service providers, we also consider HSSEQ considerations.
