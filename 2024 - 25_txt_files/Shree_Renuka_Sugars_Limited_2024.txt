THE FIVE CAPITALS MODEL 
In today's evolving marketplace, businesses must go beyond profit generation and 
actively consider their environmental, social, and economic impacts. It is not just 
about minimizing negative effects; it is about actively contributing to the restoration 
and well-being of communities and ecosystems. This shift in mind-set is essential 
for achieving genuine sustainability. Aligned with the principles of the International 
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), the Five 
Capitals Model presents a 
comprehensive framework for understanding the resources crucial for sustainable 
development. It emphasizes that capital extends beyond financial assets, 
encompassing interconnected forms of capital, and by effectively managing these, 
businesses can create value for all stakeholders and support a more sustainable 
future. 
• NATURALCAPTIAL 
The Company operates with a v1s1on that profitability and sustainability are mutually 
inclusive and hence, green initiatives are embedded into the business model to ensure the 
pursuit of profit aligns with long term environmental sustainability. 
l. The company has invested approximately INR 79 million to promote energy 
conservation across its units, leading to reduced energy use, greater operational 
efficiency, and better sustainability. Furthermore, it allocated INR 3.7 million for 
electricity-saving projects, such as installing LED bulbs in six units, a solar heater in one 
unit, and a solar power plant in another, contributing to an annual energy saving of 
2.849 million kWh. 
2. The Company utilizes distillery plant wastewater, specifically the spent wash produced 
during ethanol production, as an alternative energy source. Further to enhance spent 
wash utilization, the Company has installed incineration boilers at all its distilleries. The 
potash-rich fly ash generated from these boilers can then be utilized as a potash 
source for developing agricultural green belts. 
3. The Company has installed Condensate Pollution Units (Effluent Reuse Plants) to reduce 
both effluent discharge and water consumption. Additionally, the cogeneration plants 
convert bagasse, a by-product of sugar production, into electrical and thermal energy, 
operating within a circular economy model. This process significantly reduces 
greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the power generated is consumed by the plants, 
with the surplus being sold to state electricity grids. 
4.An inter-unit committee has been established with the objective of minimizing 
freshwater consumption by increasing the use of recycled water, thereby reducing 
overall water usage.

GHG Emissions 
Risk 
Entities within the Agricultural Products sector produce 
direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions primarily 
through the processing and transportation of goods. In 
the Company’s case, significant GHG emissions arise 
from the production of sugar and methane. Without 
effective strategies to manage these emissions, the 
Company may face increased capital and operational 
expenses, as well as reduced operational efficiency, 
particularly in light of stringent emission control 
regulations. 
 
The Company is proactively addressing greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by adopting innovative technologies 
that utilize alternative fuels and energy sources, 
including biomass waste from its own operations, and 
by enhancing fuel efficiency. Sustainability and 
innovation are central to its approach in tackling these 
environmental challenges. The Company has made 
significant progress in solar energy generation across 
various sites, effectively lowering its dependency on 
grid 
power 
and 
reducing 
related 
emissions. 
Additionally, 
through 
extensive 
green 
belt 
development, over 2 lakh trees have been planted at 
multiple locations, contributing to biodiversity, soil 
conservation, and carbon sequestration. The Company 
is also shifting to low Global Warming Potential (GWP) 
refrigerant gas R-32 and using LPG for Granulated 
Activated Carbon (GAC) production at select facilities 
to further minimize its environmental footprint.

Energy 
Management  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk 
The Company’s business operations are energy-
intensive, relying significantly on fossil fuels for power 
generation and electricity sourced from the grid—both 
of which contribute to environmental challenges such 
as pollution and climate change. Effective energy 
management is therefore critical, as it directly 
influences both current and long-term operational 
costs. Additionally, evolving climate regulations and 
sustainability considerations may lead to increased 
volatility or escalation in electricity and fuel prices, 
further impacting the Company’s operating expenses. 
To effectively manage energy-related risks, the 
Company intends to implement measures such as 
conducting energy audits, setting clear energy 
reduction targets, and investing in energy-efficient 
technologies. It is actively exploring the use of 
renewable 
energy 
sources 
as 
alternatives 
to 
conventional 
energy 
generation 
methods. 
Additionally, the Company is evaluating the adoption 
of energy monitoring and automation systems to 
optimize usage and improve overall efficiency. These 
initiatives are designed to reduce operational costs, 
enhance energy performance, and advance the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
environmental 
sustainability.

Water 
& 
Wastewater 
Management 
 
 
Opportunity 
The Company’s dependence on water for its 
processing operations, along with the generation of 
wastewater 
or 
effluents, 
contributes 
to 
its 
environmental footprint. To mitigate this impact, the 
Company is actively implementing Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) systems and has established both 
Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETPs). These initiatives are aimed at 
minimizing water-related environmental impacts. 
Additionally, practices such as water reuse and 
rainwater

Employee 
Health Risk & 
Safety  
 
 
 
Risk 
Employees may be involved in labour-intensive tasks 
that expose them to various occupational hazards, 
including 
falls, 
transportation-related 
incidents, 
equipment malfunctions, and heat-related illnesses or 
injuries. Non-compliance with health and safety 
regulations 
can 
lead 
to 
regulatory 
penalties, 
reputational damage, and increased costs associated 
with implementing corrective measures. 
To mitigate risks related to employee health and 
safety, the Company adopts a comprehensive 
approach that includes conducting regular risk 
assessments, providing safety training, enforcing 
proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), 
and implementing effective hazard control measures. 
Additionally, the Company promotes employee well-
being through health and wellness programs, 
continuously monitors safety performance, and 
actively engages workers in safety initiatives. These 
efforts not only enhance workplace safety but also 
contribute to strengthening the Company’s brand 
reputation, boosting employee morale, improving 
productivity, reducing turnover, and fostering positive 
community relations.

Supply 
Chain 
Management 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk 
As SRSL sources agricultural inputs from a wide network 
of suppliers, its approach to engaging suppliers on 
environmental and social matters can significantly 
influence consumer perception, demand, and brand 
reputation. Effective supplier engagement is also 
crucial for maintaining competitive pricing. Challenges 
within the supply chain—such as poor labour practices, 
inadequate 
environmental 
compliance, 
unethical 
behaviour, or corruption—can expose the Company to 
regulatory penalties and potentially elevate long-term 
operational costs. Hence, responsible and transparent 
supply chain management plays a vital role in mitigating 
risks and ensuring sustainable business practices. 
To effectively address and mitigate supply chain risks, 
the 
Company 
is 
committed 
to 
conducting 
comprehensive supply chain risk assessments. In 
pursuit of sustainability, it continues to explore and 
implement strategies for developing contingency plans 
and enhancing transparency across the supply chain. 
These proactive measures are aimed at building a 
more resilient, agile, and efficient supply chain—
minimising 
potential 
disruptions, 
safeguarding 
business continuity, and improving overall operational 
performance.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets 
and achievements 
 
The shift towards sustainable living is shaping emerging trends across all industries, including ours. Today, the growing 
diversity of products and continuous innovation push producers to enhance quality while simultaneously reducing their 
carbon footprint. Beyond financial metrics, broader sustainability factors play a vital role in fostering holistic business 
growth, emphasizing the need for formally recognizing best practices in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
standards. 
 
Our Company is committed to Zero Liquid Discharge and primarily generates operational energy from bagasse, ensuring 
minimal carbon emissions. As a key ethanol supplier to Oil Marketing Companies, we play a significant role in supporting 
the nation’s carbon reduction initiatives. Additionally, we undertake large-scale tree plantation projects and collaborate 
with farmers to promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as drip irrigation for sugarcane, efficient waste 
management through biogas/bio-digesters, and trash mulching. 
 
Looking ahead, we aim to strengthen our sustainability efforts by enhancing energy efficiency across our processes and 
exploring innovative ways to further minimize our carbon footprint.

Water Management and ZLD Mechanisms at Shree Renuka Sugars Limited 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) Initiatives: 
 
Shree Renuka Sugars Limited is actively progressing towards achieving sustainable water management through the 
implementation of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems at its select units: 
 
Ajinkyatara Unit: 
At this unit, a ZLD approach is practiced wherein acidic and alkaline water generated from the Water Treatment Plant 
(WTP) is neutralized in a dedicated neutralization tank. The treated water is effectively reused for ash quenching, 
thereby eliminating the need for discharge and conserving freshwater. 
 
Kandla Unit: 
The Kandla facility has implemented a comprehensive ZLD system, which includes an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) 
with multiple advanced treatment stages—anaerobic digestion, aeration, clarification, pressure sand filtration, and 
activated carbon filtration. The treated effluent is further processed through a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE). The 
condensate recovered is reused for recovery boiling, while the concentrate is blended with molasses for further 
processing, ensuring complete reuse and zero discharge of liquid waste from the premises. 
 
Advanced Effluent and Sewage Treatment at Non-ZLD Units: 
Shree Renuka Sugars operates advanced ETPs and STPs to treat and reuse wastewater in an environmentally 
responsible manner: 
 
Haldia Unit: 
Effluent from the sugar mill's cooling tower is treated through anaerobic digestion and aeration processes, achieving 
significant COD/BOD reduction. The final treated water, meeting State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) norms, is reused 
for greenbelt development.

Havalga Unit: 
A Sewage Treatment Plant (80 m³/day) is being installed to manage colony sewage. Treated water will be used for 
irrigating gardens, promoting circular water use. 
 
Panchganga, Pathri, Munoli, Raibag, and Athani Units: 
These units operate full-scale ETPs using a combination of anaerobic and aerobic biological treatments, followed by 
tertiary filtration (MGF/ACF). The treated effluent meets regulatory standards and is repurposed for greenbelt 
development, cooling tower reuse, or irrigation by local farmers. Notably, Athani Unit includes a Condensate Polishing 
Unit and employs closed-loop reuse in cooling towers and general services. 
 
These integrated water management practices across units demonstrate Shree Renuka Sugars Limited’s commitment 
to water stewardship, regulatory compliance, and sustainable operations in line with national and state pollution 
control frameworks.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes 
 
The Company follows a structured and environmentally conscious waste management approach, particularly for 
materials classified as hazardous. One key strategy involves the reuse of used oil as a lubricant across various machinery 
and equipment including bagasse conveyors, rotating biological contactors (RBCs), moving bed contactors (MBCs), 
warehouse shutters, and carts used for transporting cane by bullocks. This not only extends the utility of the material 
but also reduces the demand for fresh lubricants. 
 
In addition to reuse, waste oil residues are utilized as an alternative energy source. These residues are co-fired with 
bagasse in the Company’s boilers, contributing to internal energy production while minimizing waste. For other 
hazardous waste streams, such as used barrels, spent oils, and residual oil sludge, the Company partners with 
authorized recycling agencies for responsible recovery or disposal, in line with environmental regulations. 
 
To ensure full traceability and regulatory compliance, the Company maintains thorough documentation throughout 
the disposal and recycling process. This includes generating required manifests and maintaining disposal records. The 
overall system reflects the Company’s emphasis on resource optimization, circularity, and minimization of 
environmental impact through safe handling, reuse, and proper disposal of hazardous materials.
