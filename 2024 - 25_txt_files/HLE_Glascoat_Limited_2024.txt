Governance, leadership and oversight
7.   Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements 
 
 Dear Shareholders,
 
 At HLE Glascoat, we remain deeply committed to embedding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our business 
strategy, decision-making processes, and day-to-day operations. As industries across the globe navigate a dynamic sustainability landscape, 
we recognise both the opportunities and the challenges that come with this transition.
 
 During the year, we achieved a key milestone in our sustainability journey with the proposed acquisition of a 26% stake in Clean Max 
Agri Power Limited (CMAPL). Established as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), CMAPL will implement a captive open access model to 
supply renewable energy to our Anand Unit. Under this collaboration, CMAPL will develop a 2.31 MWp solar and 3.30 MW wind captive 
power facility, enabling us to enhance renewable energy usage at our Anand unit, optimise energy costs, and support India’s clean energy 
transition.
 
 We recognise that achieving our long-term sustainability goals comes with challenges, including constraints around renewable energy 
infrastructure, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the need for continuous innovation. Over the past year, we have taken decisive steps 
to address these issues by aligning our operations with global ESG best practices and stakeholder expectations. Our focus remains on 
increasing renewable energy adoption, reducing our carbon footprint, and strengthening climate resilience. Looking ahead, we aim to 
enhance our ESG performance metrics, set ambitious yet achievable sustainability targets, and invest in innovative solutions that minimise 
environmental impact while driving business resilience and long-term value creation.
our ESG journey while contributing meaningfully to a more sustainable and resilient future.
 
 Thank you for your continued support.
 
 Sincerely,
