Emissions 
(GHG) & energy 
management
Opportunity/
Risk
As a financial services 
provider, we acknowledge 
our role in promoting 
environmental 
sustainability, even in a 
non-traditional polluting 
sector. We prioritise 
efficient resource use, 
emissions reduction, 
and energy efficiency, 
demonstrating our 
commitment to a greener 
future.
The Company has 
transitioned its 
office operations 
to a certified Green 
Building, reinforcing 
its commitment 
to sustainability 
and environmental 
responsibility. This 
strategic move 
enables significant 
reductions in 
energy and water 
consumption, 
improved indoor 
air quality, and 
enhanced employee 
well-being. The 
green infrastructure 
also supports 
efficient waste 
management and 
use of renewable 
resources, aligning 
with our long-term 
ESG goals.
Positive:
-	
Implementing energy-efficient 
practices leads to reduced energy 
consumption, translating into 
significant cost savings for the 
organization.
-	
Strong emissions and energy 
management practices may lead to a 
better access to green financing, with 
favourable terms and conditions.
Negative:
Cost of transition to newer technologies in 
the short term may impact the bottom line.

Climate change Risk
Climate change poses 
a significant risk to 
FedFina by potentially 
impacting the financial 
stability of its borrowers 
and the long-term value 
of its secured assets. 
Increased frequency 
of extreme weather 
events—such as floods, 
droughts, and cyclones—
can damage properties 
used as collateral and 
disrupt the livelihoods 
of customers, especially 
those in agriculture, small 
enterprises, and informal 
sectors. This may lead to 
higher default rates and 
credit losses. Additionally, 
evolving regulatory 
requirements and 
stakeholder expectations 
around sustainability may 
necessitate operational 
changes. Proactively 
addressing climate-
related risks is therefore 
essential for FedFina’s 
risk management, 
business continuity, and 
long-term resilience.
At Fedfina, we 
are committed 
to understanding 
and addressing 
the multifaceted 
impacts of climate 
change across our 
business operations. 
Our approach 
emphasises energy 
efficiency, reduction 
of GHG emissions, 
responsible waste 
management, 
and employee 
engagement through 
climate awareness 
initiatives. By 
integrating climate 
and broader ESG 
considerations into 
our operational 
strategies, we aim 
not only to mitigate 
environmental 
risks but also to 
unlock opportunities 
through sustainable 
and socially 
responsible 
practices—
strengthening 
resilience and 
creating long-
term value for all 
stakeholders.
Negative:
-	
Upfront investments in technology, 
infrastructure, and training, 
pressurising profitability
-	
Business disruption due to extreme 
weather events, such as cyclones, 
hurricanes, heat or cold waves, or 
floods and resultant revenue impact
-	
Failure to comply with evolving 
climate-related regulations can result 
in financial penalties and reputational 
damage.

Specific commitments, goals and 
targets set by the entity with defined 
timelines, if any.
At Fedfina, we understand that setting clear goals is essential to driving meaningful change and 
measuring progress. While we are currently tracking our environmental practices, we are actively 
working towards establishing specific, measurable targets that align with our core principles. Our 
overarching objectives are centred around three key pillars: Environment, Social, and Governance.
•	
Environment: We aim to reduce our carbon footprint by implementing efficient energy 
management practices, reducing waste, and promoting responsible water usage.
•	
Social: We are committed to enhancing employee well-being through comprehensive 
wellness programs and fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion across all levels 
of the organisation.
•	
Governance: We strive to maintain the highest standards of governance by increasing Board 
diversity and independence, implementing robust cybersecurity and data privacy measures, 
and upholding ethical business conduct.
By establishing these ambitious goals, we are committed to driving progress, promoting 
transparency, and holding ourselves accountable for our actions, as we work towards creating a 
more sustainable, equitable, and responsible business model that benefits our stakeholders and 
the environment.
6.	
Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals, 
and targets along with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
At Fedfina, we are committed to aligning with all nine principles of the BRSR framework, ensuring 
responsible and transparent business practices. We are undertaking the measurement of our 
GHG emissions and are developing strategies for reduction in the coming years. Efforts are also 
underway to continue tracking water consumption, waste generation and strategies to reduce 
the same. We uphold fair labour practices, protect human rights, and foster a culture of diversity 
and inclusion across all levels. Customer satisfaction remains a top priority, and we actively 
support communities through partnerships with NGOs. Our governance framework includes 
robust policies on anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and data privacy. We ensure transparency through 
accurate disclosures on our website.

Governance, leadership, and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG -related challenges, targets, 
and achievements
	
Over the last 13+ years, Fedfina has played a pivotal role in extending affordable financial access across India through a 
rapidly expanding network of branches. As we continue to scale our impact, we acknowledge the growing responsibility 
to embed sustainability across every facet of our operations and ecosystem.
	
In FY 2023–24, we advanced our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) journey with renewed intent and continued 
the efforts in FY 2024-25. Recognising the complexities of climate-related risks and operational emissions, we undertook 
a baseline assessment of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, waste footprint, and energy use. In tandem, we also 
conducted a detailed ESG materiality assessment last year to understand stakeholder priorities and sectoral relevance. 
These inputs are shaping a structured ESG roadmap—with internal targets, timelines, and actions—to help us transition 
into a more sustainable future.
	
As part of our environmental initiatives, we also relocated one of our key office premises to a certified Green Building, 
underscoring our commitment to energy efficiency, reduced emissions, and sustainable infrastructure.
	
Our Board-approved ESG Policy anchors this transformation, and we have constituted a dedicated internal Climate 
Change Committee to steer focused action. On the social front, our efforts remain grounded in responsible lending, 
financial inclusion, and community development. We continue to uphold a strong people-first culture—validated by being 
certified a “Great Place to Work” for six consecutive years and recognised among the Top 50 Best Workplaces in India’s 
BFSI sector in 2023. 
	
As we move forward, Fedfina reaffirms its commitment to building a resilient, ethical, and inclusive institution. With ESG 
principles at the core of our strategy, we are determined to drive value not just for our stakeholders but for society and 
the planet at large.
