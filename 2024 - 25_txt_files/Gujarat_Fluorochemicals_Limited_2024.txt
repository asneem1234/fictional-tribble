Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets 
and achievements. 
We know that our success is closely tied to a sustainable future. Sustainability is not an option; it plays a pivotal role in 
the way we conduct our business. While shaping our strategy, we align with global sustainability frameworks and adopt 
principles such as the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care®.
We are committed to transparency and improvement and are involved with the leading global ESG disclosure organisations 
such as EcoVadis, CDP, and DJSI. Additionally, we are also members of the British Safety Council. We support India’s 
big target for carbon neutrality by 2070. To contribute to achieving this goal, we are introducing new ‘green’ businesses 
such as battery chemicals, solar energy, green hydrogen, and fuel cells. These initiatives complement our existing Wind 
business under the INOXGFL Group and aim to drive a cleaner energy future.
Sustainability is embedded in the Company’s values and principles and aligns well with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (UN SDGs). We are undertaking meaningful and decisive actions to create long-term value for our 
customers, employees, and communities through growth that includes everyone, and innovation that is intelligent and 
responsible.

` 1,13,08,480 The Company paid GST on Royalty at 12% while filing GST-3B 
returns, based on Notification No. 10/2017 dated 28th June 2017, 
believing this was the correct rate until August 2022. Later, during 
an internal review, the Company found that Notification No. 06/2021 
dated 30th September 2021 had increased the GST rate to 18% for 
these transactions, effective immediately. The Company then made 
a provision for the extra 6% tax from 1st September 2022 and paid the 
difference along with interest on 15th October 2022. However, despite 
this self-correction, the tax department issued an order on 13th May 
2025, imposing a penalty for the short payment of GST.

judgement of the honorable Supreme Court dated 28th April 2023 on 
the said issue, the assessee is entitled to take Input Tax Credit for 
duty paid. Further, on the basis of our assessment, we believe that the 
consequential demand for penalty and fine is not sustainable. The

career development reviews.
10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a)	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, the coverage such system?
	
	
Yes, we have established a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System, driven by our 
top management’s commitment to a foster safe and healthy workplace. Our approach is proactive and inclusive, 
involving every level of the organisation to build a robust safety culture.
	
	
Our system integrates meticulously crafted policies, standards, procedures, and practices aimed at identifying and 
addressing workplace hazards, promoting overall employee well-being, and ensuring stricter adherence to applicable 
health and safety regulations. We also involve representatives of our contract workmen at every stage, reinforcing our 
focus on a safe, supportive environment.
	
b)	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
We have a systematic approach to identify work-related hazards and assess associated risks on both routine and 
non-routine activities. The processes we adopted include regular workplace inspections to identify potential hazards 
and conducting risk assessments to evaluate the likelihood and potential consequences of these hazards and 
defining control measures for mitigation. We use tools such as PHA (e.g., HAZOP), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Qualitative Risk Assessment (QRA) and Safety Audits of work areas. We 
have a Permit to Work (PTW) system established for all non-routine activities. We conduct a preliminary JSA along 
with the workmen involved in the activity prior to issuance of the permit.
	
	
We encourage employees to report any safety concerns or near misses, ensuring that all incidents are promptly 
investigated to identify root causes and implement corrective actions. Additionally, we conduct safety audits through 
trained GFL employees and external experts periodically to monitor compliance with safety protocols. We use incident 
data and trend analysis to address emerging risks proactively. Any non-like-for-like modification is routed through 
the Management of Change (MoC) process and implemented only after a successful Pre-Startup Safety Review.

STATUTORY REPORTS
	
c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we have implemented robust processes that encourage and empower our employees and workers to report 
work-related hazards and take necessary actions to mitigate potential risks. Also, we have a Non-Retaliation Policy 
in place which empowers workmen to report any safety-related violation at the workplace fearlessly. Additionally, 
we foster a strong safety culture built on open communication and proactive risk identification. Monthly safety 
communication sessions and ongoing awareness initiatives help reinforce this commitment. Every individual is 
encouraged to take ownership of workplace safety.
	
	
Employees receive training and are urged to report unsafe acts, conditions, or near misses. They can do so through 
several channels, including a dedicated digital platform, workplace safety committees, and direct communication 
with supervisors. To maintain transparency and accountability, we monitor both leading indicators (such as unsafe 
acts and near misses) and lagging indicators (such as incidents, ill health, and injuries). All reported hazards are 
tracked and addressed systematically.
	
	
Hazard identification is carried out through a combination of structured approaches, including routine safety 
observations, Contractor Field Safety Audits, and Plant Monthly Safety Involvement activities. These initiatives allow 
us to systematically uncover risks and address them before they escalate into incidents.
	
	
We are also dedicated to creating a workplace where safety is a shared responsibility. Clear guidelines and support 
mechanisms are in place to ensure that employees feel empowered to escalate safety concerns and, when necessary, 
remove themselves from potentially dangerous situations without fear of reprisal. We believe that cultivating a 
proactive hazard-reporting culture is essential for safeguarding the health, safety, and well-being of all members of 
our workforce.
	
d)	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes, we go beyond occupational requirements to ensure comprehensive access to medical and health services 
for our employees and workers. We prioritise their well-being through regular pre-employment and periodic health 
check-ups (employees’ family members were encouraged to participate) for both employees and contractual staff. 
Additionally, we organise gynaecological, dental, and general health camps, conduct blood donation drives, and 
provide first aid training programs, empowering our workforce with essential life-saving skills.

At the S&A plant, two cooling water pumps were upgraded to energy-efficient models, saving 184.8 MW. Similarly, 
at the DPTFE utility, optimising chiller operations by installing a new 130 TR unit alongside an existing 170 TR chiller 
resulted in an annual power savings of 83.426 MW.
	
•	
The TFE 3 LP cooling tower was revamped with trickle flow fills, boosting its efficiency by 10%. The TFE 1 cooling 
tower’s changeover to TFE augment cooling saves 1,641 kW daily, equating to ₹ 51 Lakhs annually. At the CA plant, 
cleaning the VAM chiller tubes increased its load capacity from 250 TR to 450 TR, improving performance. In the 
CPP, de-stagging boiler feed pump No. 3 saves 900 kWh daily, and boiler operation optimisation yields 0.22 MWh 
auxiliary power savings. The FI plant reduced power consumption by optimising fume extraction and stopping idle 
pump operation, saving 237.6 MW annually.
	
•	
To utilise alternate energy sources, we increased our share of imported power through renewables in FY 2024-25.
	
•	
A significant capital investment was made at the CA plant, where replacing the electrolyser’s anode, cathode mesh, 
and membrane resulted in a substantial power saving of 7,280 MW per annum.
	
•	
At GFL Dahej-A, we successfully developed and commercialised two grades of fully fluorinated perfluoro elastomers 
(FFKM), FFR35PC and FFR75PC, improving equipment reliability and reducing energy losses. We are also developing 
a new FFKM formulation for extremely high-temperature applications (-10°C to 300°C), with improved compression 
set resistance. In parallel, we are working on specialised FFKM grades for stringent semiconductor applications to
