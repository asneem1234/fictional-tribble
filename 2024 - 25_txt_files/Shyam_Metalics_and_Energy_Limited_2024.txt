1
Environmental 
Impact Assessment
O
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) is an essential process used to 
assess the potential environmental, 
economic, and social effects of a 
proposed project or development. 
Through a comprehensive EIA, 
the Company can recognize both 
positive and negative impacts and 
implement appropriate measures 
to maximize the benefits while 
minimizing any adverse effects. 
This 
approach 
supports 
the 
adoption 
of 
more 
sustainable 
and environmentally responsible 
business practices.
Positive, a well-conducted EIA 
offers significant advantages, 
as it can help the Company 
avoid expensive environmental 
remediation or legal issues, while 
also uncovering opportunities 
for cost savings and improved 
operational efficiency.
2
Anti-corruption 
practices of the 
company
R
Corruption poses serious legal 
and 
reputational 
risks, 
along 
with potential financial losses for 
the Company. Inadequate anti-
corruption measures can leave the 
Company vulnerable to bribery, 
fraud, and other unethical conduct, 
potentially 
leading 
to 
fines, 
penalties, and a loss of stakeholder 
trust.
Corruption poses serious legal 
and reputational risks, along 
with potential financial losses 
for the Company. Inadequate 
anti-corruption measures can 
leave the Company vulnerable 
to bribery, fraud, and other 
unethical conduct, potentially 
leading to fines, penalties, and 
a loss of stakeholder trust.
Negative, failure to uphold 
these 
standards 
can 
have 
negative 
consequences, 
including 
substantial 
costs 
arising 
from 
legal 
actions, 
financial penalties, and missed 
business opportunities resulting 
from reputational harm.
3
Health & safety of 
employees
R
Failure to ensure a safe working 
environment can result in accidents, 
injuries, or fatalities, leading to legal 
liabilities, operational setbacks, and 
reputational harm.
To mitigate such risks, the 
Company has implemented a 
comprehensive 
occupational 
health and safety management 
system across all its facilities and 
work sites. 
Aligned 
with 
ISO 
45001 
standards, 
this 
system 
ensures compliance with legal 
requirements and promotes a 
safe and secure workplace for 
employees.
Negative, neglecting workplace 
safety 
can 
have 
adverse 
consequences, including expenses 
related to worker compensation 
claims, legal action, and reduced 
productivity due to work-related 
injuries or illnesses.
4
Development and 
well- being of local 
communities
O
Actively 
engaging 
with 
and 
supporting 
local 
communities 
enables the Company to build 
trust, strengthen its social license 
to operate, and contribute to the 
sustainable development of the 
regions where it functions.
Positive, as it can lead to better 
community relationships, lower 
operational risks, and an enhanced 
brand reputation.
5
Sustainability 
disclosures
O
Transparent and comprehensive 
sustainability disclosures enable 
the Company to showcase its 
dedication 
to 
environmental 
and social responsibility, build 
stakeholder trust, and appeal to 
investors focused on sustainability.
Positive, as it can help the Company 
secure 
sustainable 
financing, 
attract environmentally and socially 
responsible investors, and enhance 
overall 
financial 
performance 
through strengthened stakeholder 
confidence and brand reputation.
6
Environmental 
declaration of 
products
O
Offering environmental declarations 
for products allows the Company to 
showcase the sustainability of its 
products, comply with customer 
and regulatory expectations, and 
stand out in the marketplace.
Positive, because it can enable 
the Company to command 
premium 
pricing 
for 
its 
sustainable products, enter new 
markets, and boost its overall 
competitiveness.

GHG emissions and 
climate change
R
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
and 
climate 
change 
present 
substantial risks to the Company’s 
operations, 
supply 
chain, 
and 
reputation. 
Without 
effective 
mitigation and adaptation, the 
Company may face physical risks 
like extreme weather events and 
resource shortages, as well as 
transition risks including evolving 
regulations, market changes, and 
reputational harm.
Shyam 
Metalics 
is 
actively 
addressing these challenges 
through strategic initiatives. 
Their 
solarization 
project, 
with a capacity of 1.085 MWp, 
reduces CO2 emissions by 12.5 
lakh 
kilograms 
annually—
equivalent to planting trees. 
Furthermore, investments in 
emission control technologies 
and the adoption of electric 
vehicles 
highlight 
their 
dedication to sustainability and 
environmental responsibility.
Negative, 
as 
the 
Company 
may incur higher costs due to 
the physical effects of climate 
change, such as damage to 
assets 
and 
disruptions 
in 
operations and supply chains.
8
Adoption of 
innovative, resource- 
efficient and low 
carbon technologies 
and solutions
O
Embracing 
innovative, 
resource-
efficient, and low-carbon technologies 
can enable the Company to enhance 
its 
environmental 
performance, 
lower costs, and seize emerging 
opportunities in the clean technology 
and renewable energy markets.
Positive, as it may allow the 
Company to decrease operating 
expenses 
through 
better 
resource efficiency, qualify for 
green financing and incentives, 
and create new revenue streams 
by offering clean technologies 
and services
9
Life cycle assessment 
of products and 
processes
O
Performing life cycle assessments 
(LCAs) of products and processes 
allows the Company to pinpoint 
opportunities for enhancing the 
environmental 
performance 
of 
its 
offerings, 
cutting 
resource 
consumption, and minimizing waste.
Positive, because it can help the 
Company lower costs related to 
resource use, waste management, 
and 
regulatory 
compliance, 
while 
also 
boosting 
market 
competitiveness by creating more 
sustainable products.
10
Sustainability in the 
supply chain
O
Encouraging 
sustainability 
practices across the supply chain 
helps the Company manage 
environmental 
and 
social 
risks, strengthen operational 
resilience, and support the 
overall 
sustainability 
of 
its 
business.
Positive, as it may enable the 
Company to lower costs linked 
to supply chain disruptions, 
regulatory compliance, and 
reputational damage
11
Water and effluents
R
Failure to responsibly manage 
water resources can result in 
operational disruptions, regulatory 
non-compliance, and damage to 
the Company’s reputation.
The Company monitors and 
measures water consumption 
across all its locations and 
operations. Its commitment 
to water stewardship includes 
identifying opportunities for 
effective water conservation. 
Additionally, SMEL promotes 
the use of recycled water to 
reduce overall consumption. 
The Company also implements 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
systems 
at 
all 
plants 
to 
ensure thorough wastewater 
treatment in compliance with 
applicable 
standards 
and 
regulations.
Negative, 
as 
the 
Company 
may incur higher costs due 
to 
water 
scarcity—such 
as 
increased prices and supply 
interruptions—as 
well 
as 
expenses related to wastewater 
treatment 
and 
regulatory 
compliance.

Air pollution
R
Failure to effectively manage air 
emissions can lead to fines, legal 
issues, and community resistance to 
the Company’s operations.
To address this, the Company 
actively 
maintains 
power 
equipment and regulates the 
air-to-fuel ratio. This approach 
helps reduce the production 
of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), 
supporting more sustainable 
and environmentally friendly 
operations.
Negative, the Company may 
face higher costs related to air 
pollution control technologies, 
regulatory fines, penalties, and 
potential legal challenges.
