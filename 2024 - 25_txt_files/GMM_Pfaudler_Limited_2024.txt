Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk
A sustainable supply chain reflects a commitment 
to socially responsible business practices and 
plays a vital role in minimizing risks related 
to 
contracts, 
compliance, 
and 
operational 
continuity. Proactively identifying and engaging 
with suppliers and partners who deliver critical 
products and services is essential. Without such 
strategic collaboration, the organization becomes 
more vulnerable to disruptions making ethical 
sourcing and resilient supplier relationships a 
business imperative.
GMM Pfaudler uses structured screening tools 
and detailed checklists to carefully evaluate 
suppliers and identify potential social risks. 
The Supplier Code of Conduct outlines 
specific expectations, mandating compliance 
with applicable laws and standards related 
to governance, social responsibility, and 
environmental 
management. 
Through 
this 
approach, 
the 
Company 
promotes 
ethical practices across its supply chain, 
strengthening trust and accountability in all 
supplier relationships.

Ensuring a safe and healthy work environment 
is 
fundamental

maintaining 
operational 
effectiveness and supporting the well-being of 
our workforce.
At GMM Pfaudler, we prioritize workplace 
safety by integrating advanced technology, 
comprehensive training, and rigorous safety 
protocols. All our facilities are ISO 45001 
certified, equipped with Emergency Response 
Plans, and implement behavior-based safety

Climate 
Change
Risk
The rising occurrence of extreme weather events 
driven by climate change poses a real risk to our 
operations and could impact the safety and well-
being of our workforce.
We embed environmental sustainability into 
our operations through structured policies, 
frameworks, and enabling infrastructure. All 
operational sites are ISO 14001 certified, 
demonstrating 
adherence 
to 
established 
environmental management standards. 
To reduce our carbon footprint, we focus 
on energy efficiency and the integration of 
renewable energy sources.
Our water and waste management efforts 
are guided by circular economy principles. 
We reduce freshwater consumption through 
operational and engineering controls, treat 
and recycle wastewater, and utilize rainwater 
harvesting to optimize water use. Waste 
management practices emphasize minimizing 
generation, along with recycling and reuse, 
to extend resource life cycles and reduce 
environmental impact. These circular practices 
are 
supported 
by 
responsible 
sourcing 
strategies that promote sustainability across 
our supply chain.
To align with our overall sustainable journey 
and demonstrate 
proactive 
climate 
risk 
management, we undertook Climate Change 
Risk Assessment (CCRA) for our operational 
sites in Gujarat. The CCRA evaluates potential 
adverse 
impacts 
from 
climate 
change, 
focusing on physical risks as defined by the 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures.

around three key focus areas:

through 
preventive 
care 
initiatives

education quality by collaborating with Industrial 
Training Institutes (ITIs) and providing them with

support environmental sustainability.

Energy and  
Emissions  
Management
Opportunity
Energy plays a vital role in driving economic 
development and enhancing quality of life. Its 
availability and reliability remain a key concern not 
just for organizations but globally. The Company 
has developed a renewable energy capacity of 1 
MW through solar installations, which supplied 7% 
of its total electricity requirements in FY25 and 
enabled the avoidance of 887 tCO₂e emissions.
GMM Pfaudler remains firmly committed to its 
decarbonization roadmap. A Wind-Solar Hybrid 
Group Captive Plan has been initiated and an 
open access renewable power solution for the 
Karamsad facility is targeted for deployment by 
December 2025.
In addition to renewable energy adoption, GMM 
Pfaudler consistently implements a range of 
energy efficiency measures aimed at reducing 
overall consumption and lowering its emissions 
footprint.

Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
As a limited natural resource, water demands 
thoughtful planning, efficient distribution, and 
responsible management to ensure optimal 
use. Its availability and usage have far-reaching 
implications for both environmental sustainability 
and societal well-being.
GMM Pfaudler’s operational locations comply 
with all applicable pollution control board 
regulations. Our manufacturing facilities are 
equipped with wastewater treatment and 
recycling systems, which help reduce reliance 
on freshwater sources and lessen the impact 
on water resources essential for domestic and 
agricultural use.

Waste  
Managment
Risk & 
Opportunity
Efficient resource use involves reducing waste 
generation, promoting reuse, and integrating 
recycled materials wherever possible. Robust 
waste management practices such as proper 
segregation, 
collection, 
and 
disposal 
are 
critical to this approach. Adherence to waste 
management regulations is essential to enable 
safe reuse, recycling, and disposal, especially in 
light of the environmental risks posed by landfills 
and dumpsites to air, soil, and water quality.
GMM 
Pfaudler 
has 
adopted 
a 
holistic 
approach to minimizing waste generation 
across its manufacturing processes. Emphasis 
is placed on waste reduction at every stage 
to meet regulatory standards and reduce 
environmental impact. Waste materials are 
managed responsibly and sent to authorized 
Transport, Storage, and Disposal Facilities 
(TSDF) to ensure safe and compliant disposal. 
Additionally, the use of single-use, non-
biodegradable plastics is strictly prohibited 
across all premises.

Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk & 
Opportunity
Maintaining high standards of integrity and 
ethical conduct is a core responsibility for any 
organization. Failure to comply with regulations 
can result in penalties that may disrupt operations 
and place financial pressure on the business.
GMM Pfaudler places strong emphasis on 
ethical conduct and regulatory compliance. 
Our Code of Conduct serves as a guiding 
framework to promote integrity, transparency, 
and 
mutual 
respect 
throughout 
the 
organization. It reinforces legal compliance, 
the avoidance of conflicts of interest, and 
the protection of Company assets, while 
supporting a safe, inclusive work environment.
Backed by a sound governance structure, 
our compliance system is designed to remain 
responsive to changing regulatory landscapes 
and emerging risks. Ongoing training initiatives 
and accessible 
communication 
channels 
enable employees to uphold ethical behavior 
and report concerns confidentially, reinforcing 
our focus on responsible and compliant 
business practices

Innovation

At GMM Pfaudler, our R&D team is focused on 
developing solutions that integrate sustainability 
into product design and manufacturing. These 
efforts are aimed at enhancing operational 
efficiency while reducing our environmental 
footprint. By prioritizing innovation with a 
sustainability lens, we reinforce our environmental 
responsibilities and build stronger, long-term 
relationships with our stakeholders.

and safety management system

entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the 
coverage of such system?
Yes, GMM Pfaudler places strong emphasis on the safety and well-being 
of its employees and other relevant stakeholders. Both of our plants 
have implemented Health, Safety, and Environment Management 
Systems (HSEMS) that are certified to the ISO 45001:2018 standard.
b. 	 What are the processes used to 
identify work-related hazards 
and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
GMM Pfaudler ensures through identification of work-related hazards 
and the assessment of associated risks, for the safety of our workforce. 
Additionally, our manufacturing routine and non-routine activities are 
carried out through structured and proactive processes, including:
1.	 Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA):
	
This systematic approach involves evaluating the workplace, 
equipment, and operational activities to identify potential hazards 
that could pose risks to employees, visitors, or the environment. Once 
hazards are identified, each is analyzed to assess the likelihood 
of occurrence and the severity of potential consequences. Based 
on this evaluation, appropriate control measures and corrective 
actions are planned, implemented, and monitored to mitigate risks 
effectively.
2.	 Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Inspections and 
Audits:
	
This process includes a thorough evaluation of the organization's 
policies, procedures, and practices concerning environmental 
management, health, and safety. HSE inspections and audits help 
pinpoint opportunities for improvement, aiming to minimize the risk 
of incidents or accidents. They also serve to verify compliance with 
applicable regulatory requirements and industry standards. Based 
on the findings of these audits and inspections, corrective action 
plans are developed to address identified gaps and enhance 
overall performance.
c. 	 Whether you have processes 
for workers to report the work 
related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, GMM Pfaudler has implemented a user-friendly online App and 
Web Portal, along with a Hazard Report Card system, to empower 
employees/workers at all levels to promptly report any work-related 
hazards. This digital platform enhances accessibility and encourages 
proactive participation in workplace safety. All reported hazards are 
closely monitored and addressed by the Factory Heads and HSE 
Managers, ensuring timely resolution and fostering a culture of safety 
and accountability across the organization.
d. 	 Do the employees/ worker of 
the entity have access to non-
occupational medical and 
healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
Yes, all our employees/workers are covered under comprehensive 
Health or Accidental Insurance, which provides financial support for 
a wide range of non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
GMM Pfaudler has established a comprehensive framework to ensure a safe and healthy workplace, 
combining strict compliance, ongoing training, and emergency preparedness.

inspections. Contractor safety is prioritized with a dedicated Safety Induction program and an EHS 
training card system.
	
Our commitment to continuous improvement is evident in regular internal and external HSE audits, including 
third-party safety assessments and ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 certifications, with risk assessments and 
controls validated by TUV SUD. Emergency preparedness is supported by detailed, site-specific plans 
and frequent mock drills addressing scenarios such as fire, electric shock, and snake bites, alongside 
comprehensive training on hazard awareness and safe material handling. Employee health is monitored 
through pre-employment screenings and annual medical examinations.
	
An online platform enables swift reporting and management of work-related hazards, while workplace 
safety is maintained through "5S" practices. The organization’s strong safety culture is further nurtured by 
celebrating National Safety Week and recognizing safety achievements.

practices and working conditions. The safety infrastructure has been enhanced with the installation of 
guards on all grinding and cutting machines as well as rotating parts. Safety latches have been added 
to EOT cranes and material handling equipment, while gas cutting trolleys are now equipped with non-
return valves (NRVs) and flashback arrestors to minimize fire hazards. Additional improvements include the 
provision of trolleys for safer gas cylinder handling, electrical mats at control panels, covers for earthing 
pits, and regular inspections of safety valves on air receivers.
	
To ensure safe operations at heights, access ladders and secure working platforms have been installed, 
alongside lifelines on rooftops. Procedurally, a formal work permit system has been introduced for high-risk 
activities. Comprehensive safety guidelines have been developed, and a dedicated safety induction video 
has been created for visitors and new employees. Awareness efforts such as electrical safety campaigns 
and Gemba walks involving department heads on the shop floor further promote a proactive safety culture.
