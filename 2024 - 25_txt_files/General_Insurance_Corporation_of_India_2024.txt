INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER'S REASONABLE ASSURANCE REPORT ON IDENTIFIED SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION 
IN GENERAL INSURANCE CORPORATION'S (GIC) BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 
To, 
The Board of Directors 
General Insurance Corporation 
Suraksha, 170, J Tata Road, Churchgate, 
Mumbai-400020, Maharashtra 
We have undertaken to perform reasonable assurance engagement, for General Insurance Corporation of India (the"Corporation") 
vide our engagement letter dated July 16, 2025 in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed below (the "Identified 
Sustainability Information" or"BRSR Core indicators") in accordance with the Criteria stated in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability 
Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (the "BRSR" or the "Report") of the Annual Report 
(the "AR") of the Corporation for the year ended March 31, 2025. 
2. 
Identified Sustainability Information 
Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to our report. The reporting 
boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 and Question 23(a) of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR with 
exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable. 
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information only and we have not 
performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods, and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon. 
3. 
Criteria 
The Criteria used by the Corporation to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under: 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the "SEBI") (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;

4. 
Management's Responsibility 
The Corporation's management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability 
Information taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Sustainability Information, 
identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the Report and the measurement of Identified Sustainability 
Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
5. 
Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between companies. 
The assurance is limited to data and information within the defined Reporting Period. Any data outside this period is not 
considered within the scope of assurance.

6.

And 
Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls for
