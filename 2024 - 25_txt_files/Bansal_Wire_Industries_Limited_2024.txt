Water 
Management
Risk
Since water is a crucial 
resource for our operations 
and the growing water 
scarcity presents significant 
global challenges. Effective 
and responsible water 
management is essential 
to ensure the continued 
availability of this vital 
resource for various needs, 
including drinking water, 
agriculture and industrial 
purposes. Insufficient water 
supply could disrupt our 
operations, potentially 
leading to conflicts with 
local communities and 
stakeholders over access 
to shared water resources. 
Furthermore, failure to 
comply with water-related 
regulations could result 
in financial penalties, 
operational shutdowns 
and the possible revocation 
of our operating license.
The Company has adopted 
the following approach to 
mitigate the risk: 
• Reduction in Freshwater 
Withdrawal: By maximizing 
the recycling and reuse of 
treated effluents within the 
plant, the organization 
minimizes its dependency 
on freshwater sources.
• Comprehensive Water 
Risk Assessments: Detailed 
assessments are conducted to 
identify potential water losses 
and explore opportunities 
for water savings across 
operations.
• Rainwater Harvesting 
Infrastructure: Adequate 
storage capacity of 60 Lakh 
Litre has been established to 
harvest and store rainwater, 
enhancing water availability 
and installing zero liquid 
discharge (ZLD) technologies 
at our plant.
• Adoption of the 3R Approach: 
The Company actively follows 
the principles of Reduce, 
Reuse and Recycle to optimize 
water consumption and 
promote sustainable water 
management practices.

Air emissions 
management
Risk
Failure to meet air quality 
standards exposes the 
organization to regulatory 
risks including the possibility 
of legal actions, financial 
penalties, operational 
limitations and reputational 
damage.
The Company is committed 
to continuously reducing air 
emissions. Our mitigation 
strategy includes the following 
key initiatives:
• Effective Fugitive Emission 
Management: We implement 
robust systems for managing 
and minimizing fugitive 
emissions, ensuring minimal 
environmental impact.
• Continuous 
Emission 
Monitoring: Air emissions 
are continuously monitored 
and maintained in compliance 
with applicable standard 
norms. The company has 
systems in place to detect 
and control any deviations 
from the permissible limits.
• Regular Stack Emission 
Monitoring: We conduct 
routine monitoring of 
stack emissions to ensure 
compliance with air quality 
standards outlined in the 
Company’s Consent to 
Operate (CTO) license.

Health and 
Safety Risk
Risk
The company relies on 
a skilled and committed 
workforce across its plants, 
whose efforts are vital to 
the organization’s success. 
Prioritizing the health, 
safety and well-being of 
our employees, workers 
and local communities is 
essential. Any major safety 
incident or unfavorable 
regulatory 
outcome 
could lead to operational 
disruptions, negatively 
impacting 
employee 
morale, physical health 
and overall well-being. 
Moreover, such events 
could tarnish the company’s 
reputation and pose long-
term risks to its success.
The company is committed 
to fostering a collaborative 
approach with employees 
and local communities to 
maintain a safe and healthy 
work environment. 
The Company is  continuously 
monitoring and prioritizing 
the well-being of all our 
stakeholders. To ensure 
compliance with safety 
standards, 
we 
provide 
ongoing safety training for 
employees, equipping them 
with the knowledge and skills 
to meet all required safety 
protocols. Additionally, both 
pre-employment and routine 
medical check-ups are carried 
out for all employees, including 
new hires and existing staff, 
to monitor and safeguard 
their health.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation.
	
Bansal Wire Industries Limited Dadri facility, which accounts for around 90% of the company’s total water usage, is 
a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant. This means all the wastewater generated at Dadri is fully treated and reused, 
with no liquid waste released into the environment. The remaining three facilities situated at Ghaziabad , together 
use only about 10% of the total water. Since their water consumption is very low, the overall environmental impact 
is minimal. As a result, approximately 90% of the company’s total effluent is treated through ZLD, making the 
overall system highly efficient and sustainable.

Please provide details of air emissions (other than GHG emissions) by the entity, in the following format:
	
Our Nox and Sox emission are predominantly generated from our fossil fuel consumption especially diesel genset. 
While our emission is inherently of small quantum and well within permissible limits, we are still keen to improve 
our performance. Towards this , we are exploring by replacing diesel genset with other cleaner fuels gensets, install 
additional filtration systems at our stack emission outlets to capture emissions or replacing diesel with PNG where 
there is steady PNG infrastructure installed by government.
	
Another approach adopted by Company is to a stable electricity connect with minimum power cuts and load 
shedding so that Genset are used rarely.

Bansal Wire Industries Limited has adopted structured waste management practices across all its manufacturing 
units. Metal scrap generated during wire drawing and trimming is segregated at source and sent to authorized 
recyclers. Sludge from effluent treatment plants, along with used oil, grease and other hazardous waste, is stored 
as per statutory guidelines and disposed of through authorized handlers registered with the Pollution Control 
Board. To reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in wire processing particularly in pickling and surface 
treatment the company is progressively adopting low-acid and eco-friendly alternatives, along with closed-loop 
recycling systems to reduce fresh chemical input and wastewater. Regular process audits and chemical optimization 
initiatives help in minimizing environmental impact while ensuring operational efficiency.
