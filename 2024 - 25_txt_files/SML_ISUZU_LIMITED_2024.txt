Disaster management is an integral part of our EHS management system. The Company has implemented an
 
   
 
onsite emergency plan to tackle emergency situations, which covers emergency preparedness (EPPs)
 
   
 
addressing emergencies such as flooding, earthquake, major fires, disease outbreaks etc. These plans are
 
   
 
focused on mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery to ensure minimal disruptions to business
 
   
 
operations in case of emergencies. Key locations are equipped with emergency sirens, first aid, medical
 
   
 
treatment facilities, and identified assembly points. To maintain a high level of preparedness, relevant training,
 
   
 
and capacity-building programmes, including mock drills, are undertaken for employees and workers.
 
   
 
Disaster management plans are readily available and easily accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
