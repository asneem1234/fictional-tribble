Assessments (HIRA) preparations, safety walks, and share valuable feedback. At SKF India, health and safety 
committees are operated at the factory or unit level. These committees bring together worker and management 
representatives to discuss and agree upon essential measures for improving overall health and safety performance.
	
	
We provide trainings to employees and workers to equip them with the knowledge and skills to take necessary 
precautionary measures and remove themselves from any hazardous situations.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
a.	
We are deeply committed to waste management and sustainability, beginning with rigorous waste segregation 
at the source to maximize diversion from landfills. For non-hazardous waste, we ensure 100% recycling through 
partnerships with authorized recyclers, guaranteeing that these materials are reprocessed and reintroduced into 
the supply chain. In the case of hazardous waste, we strictly adhere to all government regulations and guidelines. 
Our approach prioritises diverting as much of this waste as possible from landfills by either recycling or repurposing 
it through waste-to-energy initiatives. These efforts demonstrate our dedication to minimising environmental 
impact and promoting a circular economy.
	
b.	
Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond managing waste generated within our campus to actively 
recovering waste from the broader environment that results from our business activities. Last year, we successfully 
collected and recycled over 750 metric tons of plastic waste associated with our product packaging. This significant 
effort underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and our proactive approach to addressing plastic 
pollution. By recovering and recycling post-consumer plastic waste, we not only mitigate the environmental impact 
of our products but also contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable planet.

Does the entity have a framework/policy on cyber security and risks related to data privacy? (Yes/No) If available, 
provide a web-link of the policy.
	
The increasing prevalence of information security threats, heightened customer awareness, and evolving regulatory 
requirements for data protection have led SKF India to prioritise robust due diligence practices aimed at preventing 
customer data loss.
	
SKF India employs a comprehensive Risk Management Policy that assesses and identifies potential risks across 
various areas, including financial, operational, sectoral, sustainability, information security, cyber security, and any 
other emerging threats. The Risk Management Committee actively identifies additional potential risks. Furthermore, 
Risk and Security Assessments connected to integrated security architecture facilitate the management of cyber risks. 
These assessments are also extended to suppliers and partners.
	
To mitigate information security, cyber security, and data privacy risks, SKF India is dedicated to the ongoing 
implementation of its Information Security Program. This program encompasses a set of controls outlined in SKF’s 
Information Security Management System (ISMS). In 2023, the information security function was merged with Group 
Infrastructure & Security to enhance the effective implementation of these controls. We have established security 
platforms for monitoring workplace security, on-premise/cloud server environments, network security, and identity 
management within SKF’s ecosystem. This includes event and alert monitoring, data collection for the asset management 
repository, and enabling security resolution across SKF environments. The program team has implemented a Security 
Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and a Security Incident Response for SKF to cover the entire 
organisation’s security needs.
