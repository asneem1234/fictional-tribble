4. We have performed assurance engagement on the Identified Sustainability Information for Reporting 
boundary as disclosed under Question 13 of Section A – General Disclosures of the BRSR.  
 
5. Our assurance engagement is with respect to the Identified Sustainability Information for the reporting 
boundary as mentioned above for financial year ended 31st March 2025 only unless otherwise stated 
and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements 
included in the BRSR and therefore, do not express any opinion/conclusion thereon. 
Criteria 
6. The criteria used by the Holding Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is 
summarised below (hereinafter referred to as ‘Criteria’): 
 
a. Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 
(‘LODR 
Regulations’) 
as 
amended, 
read 
with 
SEBI 
Master 
circular 
SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated 11 November 2024 and SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-
PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42 dated 28 March 2025; and 
 
b. SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated 20 December 2024 read with 
BRSR Core Reporting Standard formulated by Industry Standards Forum. 
Management’s Responsibilities 
7. The Holding Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for 
preparing the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, 
if any, related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of 
Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
Inherent limitations 
8. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities.  
Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control 
9. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ 
(‘IESBA’), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, 
and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. 
10. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for 
Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements” which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality 
management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
 
29th Annual Report 2024-25
121
 
 
 
 
Practitioner’s Responsibility  
11. Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on BRSR Core 
Information and express a limited assurance in the form of a conclusion on other selected indicators of 
BRSR other than BRSR Core Information, based on the procedures we have performed and evidence 
we have obtained.  
 
12. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information” (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the BRSR Core Information is prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria and limited assurance about whether the other 
selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information is free from material misstatement. 
 
13. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the BRSR Core Information, assessing 
the risks of material misstatement of the BRSR Core Information whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the BRSR Core Information.  
 
14. A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves assessing the 
suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of 
the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information, identifying areas where 
material misstatement is likely to arise in the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core 
Information whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing procedures to address identified 
risk areas as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall presentation of the other 
selected indicators of BRSR other than Core Information.  
 
15. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal 
control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. 
 
16. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records. 
17. Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
x 
Conducted physical discussion at the corporate office and virtual discussion with teams at GMR 
Hyderabad International Airport Limited and Delhi International Airport Limited, for data and 
document verification.  
x 
Interviewed senior executives to understand the reporting process, governance, systems and 
controls in place during the reporting period.   
x 
Reviewed the records and relevant documentation including information from audited financial 
statements or statutory reports submitted by the Group and its associate to support relevant 
performance disclosures within our scope. 
x 
Evaluated the suitability and application of Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied 
appropriately to the Identified Sustainability Information.

GMR Airports Limited
 
 
 
 
 
 
x 
Selected key parameters and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables 
and agreeing claims to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims such as 
source data, meter data, etc. 
x 
Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of claims,  
x 
Reviewed data from independent sources, wherever available,  
x 
Reviewed data, information about sustainability performance indicators and statements in the 
report. 
x 
Reviewed and verified information/ data as per the Criteria; 
x 
Reviewed accuracy, transparency and completeness of the information/ data provided; 
18. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion on BRSR Core Information.  
19. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are 
less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have 
been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express 
a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR 
Core Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. 
Exclusions 
20. Our assurance engagement scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion 
or conclusion on the same:  
 
x 
Aspects of the BRSR and data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information. 
x 
Operations of the Group and its associate other than those mentioned in paragraph 2 to 4 above 
on Scope of Assurance 
x 
Data and information outside the defined reporting period 
x 
Data related to Group and its associate’s financial performance, strategy and other related linkages 
expressed in Identified Sustainability Information. 
x 
The Group and its associate’s statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, 
expectation, forward looking statements provided by the Group and its associate and assertions 
related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues. 
x 
Mapping of Identified Sustainability Information with reporting frameworks other than those 
mentioned in Criteria above. 
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature 
and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on 
internal controls. 
 
The procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking 
aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems. 
Opinion 
21. Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core 
Information included in the BRSR report for the financial year ended 31st March 2025 is prepared in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.

Conclusion 
22. Based on the procedures performed and evidences obtained and the information and explanations 
given to us along with the representation provided by the management, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core 
Information included in the BRSR report for the year ended 31st March 2025, is not prepared, in all 
material respects in accordance with the Criteria. 
Other Matter 
23. The information pertaining to the financial year ended 31st March 2024, included as comparative 
information in the Identified Sustainability Information, was subject to reasonable assurance by previous 
assurance practitioner, who have expressed an unmodified opinion on those comparative information 
vide their report dated 9 August 2024.  
 
Our opinion and conclusion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
Restriction on use 
24. The Assurance Report is prepared by the Holding Company’s management solely for the purpose of 
inclusion in Annual Report of the Group and its associate for the year ended 31st March 2025. This 
report issued by us has been prepared and addressed to the Board of Directors of the Holding Company 
at the request of the Group and its associate solely, to assist the Group and it’s associate in reporting 
on the Group and it’s associate’s sustainability performance and activities. Accordingly, this report may 
not be suitable for any other purpose and should not be used by any other party other than the Board 
of Directors of the Holding Company. Further, we do not accept or assume any duty of care or liability 
for any other purpose or to any other party to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may

Increased frequency and intensity of
extreme weather events can cause
disruption in airport operations. The
sector's disruption due to the effects of
climate change will have an influence on
the entire global economy.
Storms, floods, or other disruptions
become more frequent and airports & air
traffic control operations must remain
dependable. The capacity of airport
operations and infrastructure to
withstand and recover from external
disruption brought on by the effects of
climate change is known as airport
climate resilience. Airport specific climate
change adaptation is essential to bolster
resilience to present or future climate risks
and its effects. Risk assessment and
adaptation planning are important steps
towards climate change management.

Safety and security of passengers and
employees is the responsibility of
airports. Poor safety and security leads
to occupational hazards, disruption in
airport operations and penalties from the
regulatory bodies.
Poor stakeholder engagement and
community relations can lead to negative
public perception, social unrest, and legal
challenges, affecting the reputation and
financial performance of the airport
sector. Building strong relationships with
stakeholders, 
including 
local
communities, customers, investors and
employees, can enhance public
perception, foster brand loyalty, and
improve workforce retention, leading to
increased revenue and profitability.
The increasing reliance on digital
technologies and the interconnectedness
of operating systems can lead to
cybersecurity breaches, data privacy
violations, and reputational damage.
Cases of data breach can have serious
impact on reputation and disrupt
financial stability.
The exposure to health and safety
hazards, as well as environmental risks
and liabilities, can lead to regulatory fines,
litigation costs, and reputational damage.
Implementing comprehensive safety and
security measures, including, surveillance
cameras, and emergency response plans.
Conducting regular safety audits and risk
assessments to identify and address
potential hazards and safety concerns.
We align with the safety standards set by

The exposure to risks related to code of
conduct, irresponsible and unethical
business practices lead to reputational
and financial losses.
GAL has developed a strong culture
focused on ethical conduct. This stems
from the GMR Code of Business Conduct
& Ethics (COBCE) which is supported by
a dedicated Ethics & Integrity team,
making ethics a competitive advantage
for GMR. This also supports the Group in
terms of strengthening its reputation and
trust across stakeholders, building
employee morale and avoiding any
related risks.
Poor air quality issues result in
occupational hazards to employees and
passengers and may lead to penalties if
regulatory requirements are not met.
The increasing demand for renewable
energy sources and the declining costs
of renewable technologies can lead to
new business opportunities, revenue
growth, and cost savings besides being
environmentally 
conscious. 
The
development of energy storage
technologies and solutions can enable
the integration of intermittent renewable
energy sources and enhance the
reliability and resilience of energy
systems.
The adoption of digital technologies and
solutions can improve operational
efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance
customer engagement and experience.
Additionally to manage environmental
aspects, our airports are also certified as
per ISO 14001 for effective environmental
management systems. Key environmental
KPIs are monitored by the asset teams
regularly and performance on these KPIs
is reported to the management. These
inlcude aspects around air quality, noise,
water, energy and waste.
GAL along with its' subsidiaries has a code
of business conduct, that cover facets of
business ethics such as child labour/
forced labour, corruption and bribery,
discrimination. Public disclosure on
breaches/ violations of code of conduct
at group level. Compliance audits are
conducted to ensure ethical standards are
adhered. 
Dedicated 
helpdesk,
Ombudsman, focal point and escalation
matrix to ensure effective implementation
of code of conduct.
Air quality abatement and management
initiatives such as ACDM, TaxiBot, BME,
Fuel hydrant system, Multimodal
connectivity, CNG filling station, Electric
buses and vehicles, charging stations etc.
are in place. By identifying and addressing
these 
material 
ESG 
risks 
and
implementing effective mitigation
measures, the airport sector can enhance
its resilience and ensure long-term
sustainability and financial performance.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements
GMR Airports Limited aims to truly imbibe GMR Group's vision of "making a difference to society through creation of value". This ethos drives our ESG progress to create long-term, inclusive and sustainable
growth across the airport ecosystem and is reflected not only through operational parameters but also through the marked improvements in our ESG ratings.
With strategic focus on enhanced disclosures and targeted ESG actions, GMR Airports Limited achieved a significant improvement in its ESG performance across key ESG ratings. Our S&P Corporate Sustainability
Assessment score improved by 12 points to 53, positioning GAL well above the industry average of 32 and placing us in the top 16 percentile globally within the transportation and infrastructure sector.
Additionally, Sustainalytics upgraded GAL's ESG Risk Rating from 'Medium Risk' to 'Low Risk'.
At GAL, we have a bold vision and are driving the achievement of the same through strong execution focus, which is one of our core strengths. Both Delhi and Hyderabad Airports received Level 5 Airport Carbon
Accreditation (ACA) from Airports Council International (ACI), making GAL the largest airport group globally with this recognition. Notably, DIAL is the largest ACA Level 5 accredited airport in the world. These
milestones underscore our intent to achieve Net Zero emissions, and we will continue to pursue this through a blend of energy transition, green infrastructure, and innovation in Scope 3 mitigation.
Additionally, all our airports continue to operate on the Zero Liquid Discharge model. Recently, new Terminal 1 at Delhi Airport and expanded terminal at Hyderabad Airport received LEED Platinum ratings for
New Construction and Major Renovations. Manohar International Airport, managed by GMR Goa International Airport Limited, undertook large-scale Miyawaki plantations reinforcing our focus on strengthening
local biodiversity.
Through GMR Varalakshmi Foundation, our CSR initiatives positively impacted over 1 lakh lives in FY 2024-25, with 95% of beneficiaries from vulnerable and marginalized communities. Our social development
efforts continue to strengthen local livelihoods, health, education, and sanitation.
We also remain focused on nurturing a safe, healthy, resilient and future-ready workforce through employee engagement, learning and development, workplace safety and mental well-being. Our adherence
to global best practices and strong safety performance remains central to operational excellence.
We acknowledge that building a resilient and future ready airport ecosystem requires a collaborative approach of working across our value chain. In FY 2024-25, we continued to strengthen our focus on
embedding sustainability into procurement and vendor management by aligning with ESG principles and engaging suppliers. This included assessments, capacity building and awareness sessions on factors
such as environmental compliance, ethical practices and labour standards. We also work with other airport ecosystem players such as the airlines and the ground staff towards a safer and greener operating
environment.
At the heart of these advancements is transparent and ethical conduct along with an accountable governance structure. Our Board-level ESG Committee is the guiding light for GAL and ensures that ESG is a
strategic imperative for the Company.
As we move ahead, we would continue to be guided by our belief that sustainable and inclusive growth is the only path forward for all businesses. GAL remains committed to partnering with our stakeholders
to deliver a positive legacy rooted in sustainability, resilience, and shared prosperity.

decision. The aggrieved employee who is not satisfied with the decision of the CEO / GCXO
has an option to appeal to BCM - GCD/ CCM/ BCM with the detailed reasons for the appeal.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices
adopted to manage such wastes.
GMR Airports Limited adopts a comprehensive approach to waste management with an aim to minimise waste generation and
move towards zero waste to landfill. Reduction at source is encouraged and waste is segregated through Integrated Solid
Waste Management system and Organic Waste Composters (OWCs) and baling machines to process biodegradable waste into
compost. At Hyderabad Airport, food waste is converted into compost for landscaping use, and any hazardous waste is disposed
through authorized recyclers. Delhi Airport follows a circular economy approach with a 4R strategy (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,
Recover) to manage Municipal Solid Waste, Hazardous Waste, E-Waste, Bio-Medical Waste, and Battery Waste in compliance
with government regulations, holding required authorisations and filing statutory returns. Additionally, DIAL was certified as a
Single-Use Plastic Free airport, demonstrating its commitment to reducing hazardous and toxic material use across its operations.
Given the nature of operations there is no toxic waste production and hazardous waste generation is also minimal.
