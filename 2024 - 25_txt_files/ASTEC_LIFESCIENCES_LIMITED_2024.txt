1.
Sustainable Supply 
Chain
Opportunity
The Company believes in 
bolstering the supply chain in 
terms of ethical, environmental 
and social stewardship. It 
understands that a sustainable 
supply chain is crucial for 
business 
continuity 
since 
it is heavily dependent on 
raw materials for production. 
Thus, the Company considers 
them as not just its vendors 
or suppliers but its “Business 
Partners” (BPs).
To achieve the Company’s 
business goals and ensure 
ethical conduct, it is empirical 
that 
its 
business 
partners 
share its values and vision; 
and raise the sustainability 
standards in the Company’s 
supply chain. The Company 
acknowledges that long-term 
sustainable development of 
its business partner is critical 
to joint success, and it values 
its relationship with them who 
share the same approach and 
vision towards doing business.
 
z Responsible Procurement Policy & 
Supplier Code of Conduct - In line 
with the Company’s commitment, 
it has developed a Responsible 
Procurement Policy, which is an 
extension 
of 
its 
values 
and 
is 
applicable to all its suppliers. The 
Company 
expects 
its 
business 
partners to operate in accordance with 
the principles outlined in this Policy 
and adhere to all applicable laws and 
regulations. This Policy outlines the 
Company’s expectations with regard 
to ethics, business integrity, human 
rights, health and safety, environment, 
the local community and quality of 
product and operations.
 
z Supply Chain Framework – The 
Company has meticulously woven 
ESG performance metrics in its 
screening criteria for new business 
partners and evaluation of existing 
ones. All 
business 
partners 
are 
required to sign the Responsible 
Procurement Policy and Supplier 
Code of Conduct at the time of award 
of contract / work to them, these are 
part of their contracts.
 
z Business 
Partners’ 
Assessment 
& Engagement – The Company 
has developed a robust process 
of conducting due diligence of its 
potential business partners on the 
criteria 
of 
financial 
capabilities, 
ethics, 
environmental 
and 
safety 
performance, climate actions and 
labour and human rights. Identified 
critical suppliers, existing / new, are 
mandatorily to undertake sustainability 
self-assessment on environmental, 
occupational health & safety, business 
ethics and human rights aspect. 
Based on self-assessment scoring 
criteria, business partners are further 
subjected for the on-site / off-site 
sustainability audit and engagement 
planning.

2.
Waste Management 
Risk and 
Opportunity
The Company is a responsible 
agrochemical 
manufacturing 
company 
and 
as 
nature 
of 
industry, 
it 
deals 
with 
substances that are inherently 
hazardous. Hence, efficient 
waste management is the 
most material aspect for the 
Company. 
Firstly, 
it 
helps 
mitigate 
environmental 
pollution by properly disposing 
off 
hazardous 
chemicals 
and preventing them from 
contaminating soil, water and 
air. Additionally, efficient waste 
management reduces health 
risks of workers and nearby 
communities. 
Moreover, 
it 
promotes 
resource 
conservation and sustainability 
by recycling or repurposing 
materials, contributing to the 
coast savings and overall 
equipment effectiveness. 
 
z Product Life Cycle Approach – The 
Company 
continuously 
strives 
to 
minimize waste throughout the life 
cycle of its products, aiming for waste 
reduction at the source. Approach 
encompasses several key stages that 
begin with the design phase and proceed 
through manufacture, distribution and 
primary use. Each phase in this lifecycle 
presents unique opportunities for policy 
intervention, allowing stakeholders to 
rethink the necessity of the product, 
redesign it to minimize its waste 
potential, and extend its useful life. 
Example - During the design phase, 
considerations can be made to ensure 
that products are created with fewer 
resources, are more durable and are 
easier to repair or recycle. 
 
z Collaboration with Pre-processor / 
Co-processor – The Company partners 
with pre-processor / co-processor / 
service provider to effectively divert 
waste that otherwise ended up going for 
landfill to resource and energy recovery 
process. 
Negative
3.
Occupational Health 
& Safety (OHS)
 Risk and 
Opportunity
Occupational 
Health 
and 
Safety (OHS) is vital for 
the Company as it  protects 
employees from harm, reduces 
accidents and illnesses, and 
ultimately boosts productivity 
and efficiency. Prioritizing OHS 
can lower costs associated 
with injuries and absenteeism, 
improve employee morale and 
enhance the overall reputation 
and brand image. 
The Company is committed 
to provide a healthy and 
safe 
working 
environment, 
equipment 
technology 
and 
systems to its teams and 
associated stakeholders. 
 
z Safety & Health Management System 
(SHMS) – It is based on 25 (twenty-
five) safety standards with various 
critical elements and sub-elements. The 
SHMS policy is designed to enhance 
the performance of the Company’s 
individual units through target setting 
and continuous monitoring of key 
performance indicators as well as 
promoting a safety culture across the 
organization.
 
z Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) 
Risk Management Framework - This 
is reviewed on a regular basis along with 
mitigation plans for identified routine and 
non-routine activities. The Company has 
implemented various techniques such as 
Hazard Identification Risk Assessment 
(HIRA), Hazard and Operability Analysis 
(HAZOP), green and brown field project 
audit, plant inspection checklists, etc. 
and 
other 
consequence 
modelling 
studies.

unsafe acts and unsafe conditions. A 
well-defined Safe Operating Procedure 
(SOP) is in place for defining nature 
and severity of the reported incident 
as well as necessary corrective actions 
and continuous status monitoring of

Climate Change 
Mitigation and 
Adoption 
Opportunity
India  is already experiencing 
a warming climate. Rising 
temperatures are leading to an 
increase in the frequency and 
severity of extreme weather 
events, which are expected to

which 
continue 
to 
grow

of the Risk or

(Positive

Governments around the world 
are actively working towards 
transitioning their economies 
to a low-carbon state and 
India is no exception. India 
has 
significantly 
enhanced 
its 
Nationally 
Determined 
Contributions (NDC), which 
includes even more ambitious 
renewable energy targets and 
transitioning to Net Zero by 
2070.
For 
industry, 
this 
implies 
accelerating 
their 
decarbonization 
journey 
as well as building climate 
resilience through localized 
climate risk assessments and 
adaptation strategies.
 
z Transition towards renewable energy 
portfolio - Targeting 80% of the total 
energy consumption through renewable 
sources by procurement of green power, 
solar captive projects and phased 
manner coal elimination.  
Positive
6.
Water and Effluent 
Management 
Risk
Rising 
population, 
urbanization 
and 
economic 
growth coupled with climate 
change 
significantly 
affects 
the availability, quality, and 
access to water in the world. 
In India, added dimensions 
of reliance on an increasingly 
unpredictable 
monsoon, 
diminishing 
groundwater 
resources and changes in land 
use patterns further accentuate 
the water crisis.
As the Company is a part of 
the 
agrochemical 
industry, 
water is used as a medium 
in 
chemical 
processing, 
resulting in significant effluent 
generation. Water is utilized for 
numerous purposes, such as 
heating and cooling, producing 
steam, preparing solvents and 
reaction media, extractive or 
absorptive reagents, product 
rinsing, distillation and washing 
in 
chemical 
processing 
operations.
 
z Water 
Risk 
Assessment 
– 
The 
Company has conducted detailed water 
risk assessments for its business. It uses 
WRI Aqueduct, WWF water risk tool 
and CGWA report for assessment and 
scenario development. The Company 
has considered various parameters for 
the assessment, which include water 
stress, water depletion, interannual 
variability, 
seasonal 
variability, 
groundwater depletion, riverine flood 
and coastal flood. Based on business 
significance, the Company has identified 
and prioritized plants and developed 
detailed action plan for implementation. 
 
z Company’s sustainability Strategy 
of “Good & Green” – The Company 
undertakes several initiatives to reduce 
our specific water consumption, reduce 
dependency on freshwater withdrawal,
