1.
Climate 
Strategy
Risk and 
opportunity 
Climate change is seen as a 
significant opportunity as the 
response to these global changes 
will require that the world gets 
ready for new and better products, 
with significant change in thought 
process.
The Company is aware of 
these shifts and proactively 
preparing itself for 
the changing business 
environment as a result of 
climate change. We will keep 
track of these opportunities 
as and when they arise.
Negative and 
positive
2.
GHG Emission 
and Energy 
Transition
Risk and 
opportunity
Carbon emission is considered the 
primary driver of global climate 
change. The scientific studies have 
proven that carbon emissions 
from industries strengthen the 
greenhouse effect, causing climate 
change. The construction and 
infrastructure industry are one of 
these industries.
The Company is working on a 
plan to reduce the emissions 
and align itself to the 
national emission reduction 
commitments.
Negative and 
positive
3.
Resource 
Efficiency and 
Circularity
Risk
The Company is in the construction 
business and the disruption in 
operations could lead to a risk 
of creating an adverse material 
economic and operational impact. 
Therefore, it is crucial for the 
company to ensure optimizing 
management of resource use and 
in-built principle of circularity 
from planning and design stage 
of project to ensure resource 
efficiency.
The Company has a robust 
mechanism to frame 
and update its ‘Standard 
Operating Procedures’ with 
protecting the environment 
a key priority. The Company 
in planning and designing 
stage, incorporates 
principles of circularity on 
resource optimization and 
management to minimize 
wastage and ensure 
efficiency.
Negative
4.
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
opportunity
Waste management is the general 
practice of using less material to 
minimize waste generation. Waste 
reduction leads to conservation 
of natural resources and savings 
in costs. By recycling, reusing, and 
safely disposing waste, waste is 
diverted from landfill, minimizing 
negative impact on environment 
and human health due to un-
managed waste accumulation.
The Company is committed 
to minimize waste to 
landfill and accomplish 
environmental and economic 
benefits. It potentially has 
both direct and indirect 
positive impact for the 
company.

5.
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk and 
opportunity
Efficient water usage and 
management leads to lower 
costs and helps in reducing 
negative impact of operations 
on groundwater depletion and 
pollution in water bodies. In 
addition, treating wastewater at 
premises reduces dependency 
on freshwater for auxiliary water 
consumption processes i.e., 
gardening and washrooms.
The Company has a 
mechanism to recycle 
wastewater and it is 
processed accordingly. The 
Company is also committed 
to efficient use of water. 
This will help in creating a 
more positive image for the 
company in the ecosystem, 
given that the Company’s 
primary water consumption 
comes from its Engineering, 
Procurement, and 
Construction (EPC) business.
Negative and 
positive
6.
Occupational 
Health, 
Safety, and 
Employee 
Well-being
Risk
In lieu of the nature of business 
operations, the Company’s 
employees and workers are 
exposed to risks, which involve 
jeopardizing the health and 
safety. This requires that DBL 
makes an objective assessment 
of hazards/ risks that can lead to 
the harm, injury, death, or illness 
of employees at the workplace or 
could harm workers at sites; and 
develop corrective actions.
The Company has ‘Zero 
Tolerance’ for any 
compromise or deviation 
from accepted safety norms 
and everyone is expected 
to abide by them. The 
Company endeavors and 
strives to fulfill all applicable 
compliance requirements 
related to health and safety. 
The health and safety of our 
people and customers was, 
is and will continue to be our 
topmost priority.
Negative
7.
Diversity, 
Equity, and 
Inclusion
Risk and 
opportunity
An organization’s long-term growth 
and its sustainability depends on 
how it creates opportunities for the 
workforce and how it integrates 
them in the system. As the modern-
day working environment continues 
to evolve, Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion (DEI) are closely linked 
to an important role in creating 
a cohesive workplace and high-
performance environment. There 
is an inherent unconscious biasness 
regarding DEI, clouding mind of 
employees, workers, and business 
partners, which can be a potential 
risk for diversifying human resource 
development activities.
The Company focuses on 
enhancing Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion (DEI) across 
the organization by driving 
behaviour change through 
training and capacity 
building sessions. The 
company has internally set 
target to enhance gender 
diversity within the Company 
at various employment 
levels/ grades, as applicable 
year-on-year.

8.
Labour and 
Human Rights
Risk
Owing to the business operation 
type, the Company engages with 
large number of contractors, 
workmen, extended workforce, and 
third-party business partners to 
meet its business obligations. This 
opens room for human rights risks 
and labour related non-compliances, 
leading to financial implications, 
increased compliance costs, and loss 
of brand value/ image.
The Company acknowledges 
this risk and has put in 
place policies, systems, and 
mechanisms to prevent 
non-compliance, primarily 
by contractors and other 
business partners. In case 
of any noncompliance, 
the Company has strict 
mechanism to investigate 
the matter and resolve it, 
within a stipulated period, 
in a systematic manner and 
corrective action is taken to 
avoid any such incident.
Negative
9.
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
The external and internal events 
could lead to difficulty in sourcing 
and transport of materials and 
products leading to loss of 
business operations and delays. 
However, promoting a sustainable 
supply chain management is 
an opportunity that reduces 
environmental footprint, builds 
resilience to external shocks, 
supports business continuity 
internally, and enhances 
competitiveness of the Company in 
medium-long run.
The Company promotes 
sustainable supply 
chain management 
i.e., partnership with 
suppliers/ vendors that 
abide with environmental 
norms, comply with social 
obligations, and have strong 
governance compliances/ 
ethics. In addition, the 
Company regularly evaluates 
its suppliers and vendors to 
optimize cost effectiveness 
and efficient deliveries. The 
materials are procured from

Ethics and

Risk
Business ethics risks are related 
to lack of ethical conduct in the 
organization. It is one of the 
most important dimensions of 
organizational risk and could lead 
to both financial and operational 
negative impact on the organization. 
Hence, it is crucial that these 
risks are regularly identified and 
managed appropriately.
The Company has ‘Zero 
Tolerance’ for corruption, 
bribery, or any unethical 
practices. This is part of 
the Code of Conduct. This 
is applicable for everyone 
including all the directors,

Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
The business requires a high trust 
environment for its functioning 
and adherence to strict regulatory 
compliance standards is one of the 
basic constituents for this. In the 
absence of compliance and stringent 
adherence, there are material 
implications for the Company.
The company’s corporate 
governance code is 
applicable to all associated 
with the Company. As part of 
accountability, transparency, 
and stakeholder trust 
building, ensuring 100% 
regulatory compliance is 
crucial and imperative. 
Non-compliance depreciates 
stakeholder trust, brand 
value, and adversely affects 
the financial standing of the 
Company in due course.
Negative

Risk 
Management
Risk
The Company operates in a sector 
that faces regulatory compliances, 
clearances, restrictions, and norms, 
which can undergo change, as 
required. This means, the sector’s 
regulatory norms are dynamic, 
posing potential threat of external 
uncertainty. In addition, the 
Company operates in rural and 
interior areas, which is prone to 
natural disaster leading to another 
layer of uncertain risk, which cannot 
be certainty predicted.
The Company’s Risk Team has 
developed a comprehensive 
Risk Framework 
incorporating the actual and 
potential threats and risks, 
covering both external and 
internal risks. The framework 
is designed identifying 
the type of risk, likelihood, 
magnitude, period of impact, 
and proposed corrective 
action.

Economic 
Performance
Opportunity
As an EPC company, DBL 
benefits from government 
infrastructure projects, public-
private partnerships, and increased 
infrastructure spending, which 
enhance revenue and profitability. 
Dependence on government 
contracts, fluctuating raw material 
costs, project delays, and financial 
liabilities (such as debt servicing 
and working capital constraints) 
pose significant risks to economic 
performance.
The Company enhances 
financial resilience by 
diversifying revenue 
streams, expanding into 
urban development and 
water supply projects to 
reduce sector dependence. 
It prioritizes operational 
efficiency through 
cost control and lean 
construction while ensuring 
financial risk management 
via hedging and optimized 
debt strategies, securing 
sustainable economic 
performance.

management system has 
been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/No) If “Yes”,

 Yes, Dilip Buildcon Limited is committed to maintaining a robust health and safety 
management system for all employees and workers. Our occupational health and safety 
system is certified for ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 standards and compliant

the Pollution Control Board and the guidelines provided by the Ministry of Forest and 
Environment.
Dilip Buildcon Limited is dedicated to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment 
for everyone involved in, visiting, or residing near our projects. The Company’s 
management across all levels is responsible and accountable for the occupational 
safety and wellbeing of our workforce. Our company employs a systematic approach

b.	 What are the processes used 
to identify work-related 
hazards and assess risks on a 
routine and non-routine basis 
of the entity? 
The purpose of the process of identification of hazards is to understand the 
occupational hazards that might arise during routine/ non-routine activities and 
ensure that the risks to people arising from these hazards are assessed, prioritized, 
and controlled to an acceptable level. As part of the process, the departmental risk 
assessment team is formed at the Project office. The team then identifies the main 
activities and divides them into sub-activities, also for both routine and non-routine 
activities. By understanding the workforce, plan and methodology of the activity, the 
team identifies the hazards, records it, and sends it to the EHS team for review. Later, 
following the risk assessments and assessment based on severity and probability (as per 
the matrix), the level of risk is determined to be high, medium, and low. Subsequently, 
the control measures of the risks are identified. All these details are furnished in the 
HIRA document, and it is periodically reviewed.
c.	 Whether you have processes 
for workers to report the 
work-related hazards and 
to remove themselves from 
such risks? (Yes/No)
Yes, workers are strongly encouraged to report any work-related hazards during daily 
toolbox talks or as soon as they encounter a potential hazard at the beginning of their 
tasks. Prompt reporting to the designated team is crucial. This proactive approach is 
reinforced by the EHS department through comprehensive safety training, including 
awareness videos, posters, and other educational materials. Upon receiving a hazard 
report, the responsible team promptly implements necessary measures to address 
and mitigate the risk, and these actions are clearly communicated to the workers. 
Supervisor/ Labour contractor is a part of the EHS committee at each operational 
site, who is responsible for circulating the minutes of meeting to the ground force/ 
workmen, capacitating them on health and safety measures.
d.	 Do the employees/ workers 
of the entity have access to 
non-occupational medical 
and healthcare services? 
(Yes/No)
Yes, both employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services. Employees are covered under the company’s group medical 
insurance policy, which provides for cashless treatment at our network hospitals 
nationwide. Workers are protected by a comprehensive workmen’s compensation 
policy. Emergency helpline numbers are prominently displayed on-site to facilitate 
immediate access in case of incidents.
In the event of an emergency, we coordinate with the HR department to arrange for 
prompt transportation to the nearest affiliated hospital for treatment. Additionally, we 
have allocated a budget for initial medical treatment at the site for injured workers. We 
also organize regular medical health check-up camps at our project locations to offer 
free health screenings to both employees and workers. Moreover, a fully equipped 
first-aid center is available at each project camp to address immediate medical needs.

Wash Sand
DBL produces construction sand in alignment with its 
environmental sustainability code. Over the years, DBL has 
decreased reliance on government-approved sand, thereby 
mitigating impacts on riverbanks. Concrete made with wash 
sand offers notable technological and commercial benefits. 
Natural sand has been entirely substituted in this process.
DBL has completely replaced 
natural sand with its wash 
sand, resulting in savings of 
approximately 1,276,478.75 
metric tons in FY 2024-25.

Solar Panels 
Installation
DBL is actively advancing its renewable energy portfolio. In the 
past year, DBL led several initiatives across multiple locations, 
reinforcing the Company’s commitment to diminish its carbon 
footprint and foster sustainability. The Company and its 
subsidiaries have successfully deployed solar panels at various 
project sites nationwide.
In the fiscal year 2024-25, DBL
successfully generated 9,89,389 
kwh of solar power. 
4.
Geo Green 
Initiative
DBL’s Geo Green initiative aims to mitigate soil erosion alongside 
road construction activities. During the construction phase, 
significant soil displacement poses a threat to the surrounding 
land quality. To counteract this, DBL strategically plants trees 
along dividers, cultivates grass on road surfaces and enhances 
aesthetic appeal throughout the construction process. By 
prioritizing energy efficiency and minimizing environmental 
impact, DBL actively addresses soil erosion concerns along 
under-construction roads. 
In FY 2024-25, we have 
successfully deployed this 
initiative across 7 project sites, 
spanning a total of 2,71,944 m² 
of land.
