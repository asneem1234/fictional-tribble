Risk
G M D C ’ s  o p e n - c a s t  m i n i n g 
operations generate substantial 
dust and noise from drilling, 
blasting, and transport, impacting 
worker health and surrounding 
communities. Non-compliance 
with air quality norms may result 
in legal penalties and reputational 
risks.
We have adopted real-time air 
and noise monitoring systems, 
expanded green belt coverage, 
maintaining haul roads, and 
deployed advanced dust 
suppression and noise control 
measures in high-risk areas. We 
conduct regular environmental 
audits and ambient air quality 
monitoring to proactively 
mitigate regulatory risks.

Biodiversity 
and Land 
Restoration
Risk
O p e n - c a s t  m i n i n g  l e a d s  t o 
significant ecological disturbances, 
including deforestation, habitat 
fragmentation, and loss of local 
flora and fauna. Regulatory bodies 
are increasingly tightening 
environmental clearance norms, 
especially concerning biodiversity-
sensitive areas. Failure to meet 
these expectations can result in 
p r o j e c t  d e l a y s ,  p e n a l t i e s , 
suspension of mining rights, and 
reputational damage.
GMDC integrates biodiversity 
considerations into mine 
p l a n n i n g ,  i m p l e m e n t s 
progressive mine closure plans, 
and undertakes large-scale 
reclamation and afforestation.
Negative
2.
Climate Change 
and 
Decarbonisation
Risk
Mining is energy intensive and a key 
source of Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
With growing regulatory pressure 
and investor expectations around 
decarbonisation, GMDC faces 
significant transition risks if 
emissions are not addressed 
proactively.
T o  n a v i g a t e  e v o l v i n g 
regulations and mitigate 
related risks, GMDC engages 
domain experts and technical 
consultants for compliance, 
identify potential issues, 
ensure compliance, and 
address environmental, safety, 
community, and reputational 
concerns.

Energy consumption forms a 
significant part of GMDC’s 
operational costs. To enhance 
efficiency and sustainability, 
the company is implementing 
energy-saving measures, 
collaborating with contractors 
to adopt high-efficiency 
equipment, exploring on-site 
renewable energy solutions 
where feasible.

Inadequate labour practices 
and failure to uphold human

p e n a l t i e s ,  r e p u t a t i o n a l 
d a m a g e ,  a n d  w o r k f o r c e 
dissatisfaction. Poor labour 
conditions, wage disputes, or 
safety incidents can disrupt 
operations and undermine 
stakeholder trust. Increasing 
expectations from regulators, 
investors, and the public 
demand greater accountability 
in labour and human rights 
performance.
GMDC follows a structured, 
c o m p l i a n c e - o r i e n t e d 
approach to labour and 
human rights management. 
All contracts are issued 
through a transparent online 
tendering system that 
mandates compliance with 
labour laws, wage norms, 
working conditions, and 
safety standards. Regular 
contractor audits, workforce 
sensitisation, safety training, 
and an accessible grievance 
redressal mechanism— 
including channels for 
reporting human rights 
concerns—ensure effective 
implementation.
Negative

Occupational 
Health, 
Safety and 
Wellbeing
Risk
Mining poses inherent health and 
safety risks including exposure to 
dust, noise, and hazardous 
environments. Accidents or 
unsafe working conditions may 
result in regulatory penalties, 
operational disruptions, and 
reputational loss.
Ensuring a safe and secure 
work environment is a core 
p r i o r i t y,  g u i d e d  b y  t h e 
principle of Zero Harm. The 
company conducts routine risk 
assessments to proactively 
identify workplace hazards 
and implements targeted 
mitigation measures to 
address them effectively. 
Regular safety training 
programs are organized for 
employees and contract 
w o r k e r s  t o  s t r e n g t h e n

safety culture, and ensure 
their health and well-being 
across all operational sites.

Opportunity
For GMDC, as a Government of 
Gujarat enterprise, robust 
business ethics and corporate 
governance is expected to 
uphold the highest standards of 
ethics and governance. This is 
not just a responsibility but a 
key enabler of public trust, 
regulatory compliance, and 
long-term value creation. Being 
subject to regular audits, 
legislative oversight, and public 
scrutiny, GMDC’s commitment 
to transparency, accountability, 
and ethical conduct not only 
ensures regulatory compliance 
but also enhances its reputation 
as a responsible and reliable 
PSU. This reinforces investor 
confidence, enables smoother 
regulatory clearances, and 
supports long-term sustainable

of emerging risks, the company 
not only protects its data but 
also reassures communities,

Risk
L a n d  a c q u i s i t i o n  p o s e s 
operational, financial, and

challenges in stakeholder 
engagement can hinder project 
timelines and increase liabilities. 
It also carries implications 
related to human rights, 
environmental impact, and 
social equity. Mismanagement 
may lead to legal challenges, 
reputational damage, and loss 
of investor confidence, making it 
a material risk for GMDC’s 
mining and infrastructure 
operations.

Dear Stakeholders,
At Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Limited (GMDC), we remain 
determined in our commitment to responsible mining and sustainable 
growth. As a state-owned enterprise, we recognise our strategic role in 
advancing India’s economic development and environmental priorities. 
Our strategic diversiﬁcation into critical minerals and rare earth elements 
aligns with the national agenda of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat. and positions 
GMDC as a key contributor to country’s green transition.
Environmental sustainability is central to our strategy. In FY 2024–25, we 
improved eﬃciency of our renewable energy assets and launched 
initiatives such as mine water recycling, digital fuel tracking, slope 
stabilisation using overburden, and adoption of energy-eﬃcient 
technologies. Water conservation eﬀorts, including rainwater harvesting 
and closed-loop systems, are also being scaled up.
To enable cleaner industrial processes, we are progressing on coal 
gasiﬁcation projects to produce syngas, methanol, and fertilizers, while 
also transitioning to electric and hybrid mining ﬂeets. Biodiversity 
preservation, integrated waste management, and circular use of

platform ensures transparency, regulatory and legal compliance, fair competition, and traceable documentation across all 
procurement activities.
 
In line with its commitment to responsible business conduct, GMDC has integrated ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) 
criteria into its vendor evaluation framework. This includes assessing environmental compliance, occupational health and safety,

Yes, GMDC has implemented an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
Management System across its mining and administrative operations. The 
system covers both employees and contract workers and includes hazard 
identiﬁcation, training, audits, and emergency preparedness. GMDC’s practices 
are aligned with statutory requirements under the Mines Act, 1952, Mines Rules,

GMDC identiﬁes work-related hazards and assesses risks through structured 
processes, including Hazard Identiﬁcation and Risk Assessment, regular site 
inspections, job safety analyses (JSA), and risk assessments for both routine and 
non-routine activities. High-risk tasks follow pre-task safety brieﬁngs and a 
permit-to-work system. Supervisors and safety oﬃcers conduct ongoing 
monitoring, supported by periodic safety audits and internal reviews to identify 
emerging risks. GMDC has developed a comprehensive Safety Manual that 
outlines these procedures and serves as a reference for all operational sites. All 
practices are aligned with applicable mining safety regulations.
c. Whether you have processes for 
workers to report the work-related 
hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Yes/No) 
Yes, GMDC has established processes that allow workers to report work-related 
hazards and withdraw from tasks they consider unsafe, without any adverse 
consequences. Workers may raise such concerns with designated safety 
personnel, supervisors, or during safety committee meetings. The system 
includes provisions for stop-work authority in case of perceived imminent risk. 
All reported concerns are formally recorded, investigated, and addressed as per 
the company’s occupational health and safety protocols.
d. Do the employees/ worker of the 
entity have access to non-
occupational medical and 
healthcare services? (Yes/ No)

check-ups as per Mines Rules 1955. 
•  Compliance with key statutory frameworks such as Mines Act, 1952; Mines Rules, 1955; and Vocational Training Rules, 1966; 
alongside ISO 45001 certiﬁcation under the iQEHS system.
•  Continuous monitoring and review via site-level safety committees, along with internal and external audits under QEHS 
protocols.
Through these measures, GMDC embeds safety and health into everyday operations, promoting a reliable and compliant work 
environment

safety teams conduct preliminary investigations and root cause analysis, followed by the implementation of corrective and 
preventive actions. For major incidents, cross-functional teams conduct in-depth reviews, and ﬁndings are discussed at 
corporate safety committee meetings.

Yes, GMDC provides transition assistance programs for employees at the time of retirement. As part of this, the company 
organises a dedicated training session titled “Life After Retirement”, which aims to help retiring employees plan for ﬁnancial 
stability, health, and overall well-being in the post-retirement phase. Additionally, all statutory retirement beneﬁts such as 
Provident Fund, Gratuity, and Leave Encashment are facilitated in a timely manner. This program is part of GMDC’s broader 
eﬀort to ensure a smooth and respectful transition for employees exiting the workforce.

Working Conditions
GMDC ensures that 100% of its value chain partners are assessed for compliance 
with applicable health, safety, and labour regulations as part of its structured 
procurement process. These requirements are embedded within the Request for 
Proposal (RFP) documents and contractual terms, forming a mandatory part of 
vendor eligibility and onboarding. All vendors and contractors are required to 
comply with statutory obligations related to occupational health, safety, and 
working conditions. This assessment is an integral part of our procurement due 
diligence and contract management process.
Additionally, GMDC is enhancing its supplier engagement framework by 
integrating formal mechanisms to evaluate value chain partners on key ESG 
parameters in a phased manner, reinforcing our commitment to responsible and 
sustainable sourcing.
6. Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address signiﬁcant risks / concerns arising from 
assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions of value chain partners.
 
As GMDC continues to strengthen its supplier engagement practices, no signiﬁcant risks have been formally identiﬁed to date 
through structured assessments of value chain partners’ health, safety, or working conditions. Compliance with statutory 
norms is currently ensured through clearly deﬁned contractual obligations and regular site-level supervision. Non-adherence 
to contractual conditions may result in penalisation, as clearly stated in the agreements. Suppliers are also required to submit 
an aﬃdavit aﬃrming that they have not been blacklisted by any government or private agency. Looking ahead, GMDC is 
working towards establishing a more structured monitoring and evaluation framework to proactively identify and address 
potential risks across the value chain. In parallel, the company plans to introduce targeted training and awareness programs for 
suppliers to promote best practices in occupational health, safety, and responsible labour practices. 
 
PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
 
GMDC engages with a wide range of stakeholders, including employees, local communities, regulatory authorities, customers, 
shareholders and value chain partners through structured and transparent channels. The company recognises the importance 
of understanding stakeholder expectations and incorporates their feedback into its decision-making processes wherever 
relevant. Engagement activities are carried out through public hearings, community meetings, statutory consultations, 
grievance mechanisms, and regular interactions with government bodies. GMDC also supports community development 
initiatives around its mining locations, focusing on education, healthcare, and livelihood enhancement. These eﬀorts reﬂect 
the company's approach to inclusive growth and responsiveness to stakeholder needs.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
 
GMDC has institutionalised structured processes to ensure stakeholder voices are systematically considered in shaping its 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy and decision-making. Recognising the diverse interests and inﬂuence of 
stakeholders on its operations, GMDC proactively engages with key groups—including employees, local communities, 
investors, suppliers, regulatory authorities, and civil society organisations—through transparent and formal channels such as 
public consultations, community meetings, investor brieﬁngs, vendor forums, and internal communication platforms. Inputs 
from these engagements are compiled by relevant functional teams and shared through structured reporting mechanisms 
with senior leadership and the Board. These insights inform strategic planning, operational decisions, and risk mitigation 
eﬀorts. The outcomes are integrated into GMDC’s ESG goals, sustainability roadmap, and policy frameworks, ensuring 
stakeholder expectations are embedded within the company’s governance systems and long-term value creation approach.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
 
Yes, GMDC actively uses stakeholder consultations to identify and manage environmental and social topics across its 
operations.
 
As mandated under India’s Environmental Legislative Framework, public hearings are conducted as part of Environmental 
Clearance (EC) process for mining and industrial projects. These hearings are facilitated by the respective State Pollution 
Control Boards and held in the presence of the District Magistrate and Collector. These hearings provide local communities in 
the project-aﬀected areas an opportunity to voice their environmental and social concerns directly to the company. The 
concerns raised are recorded formally. GMDC responds to the concerns raised by taking appropriate action and submits 
detailed reports to the relevant regulatory authorities at regular intervals.
 
To ensure continuous stakeholder engagement beyond the EC process, GMDC has deployed dedicated CSR teams across all 
project sites. These teams work closely with village representatives and community members to identify local issues and co-
develop solutions through participatory dialogue.
Key initiatives undertaken include:
• Infrastructure Development:
 
GMDC has constructed check dams in water-scarce villages, signiﬁcantly improving local water availability for both domestic 
and agricultural use. These structures have helped recharge groundwater levels and support small-scale farming. 
Additionally, solar-powered streetlights have been installed in underserved rural areas, enhancing safety, improving night-
time mobility, and reducing dependence on unreliable grid electricity. such as the construction of check dams and 
installation of solar-powered streetlights in rural and underserved areas.
• Education Support:
 
To promote inclusive education, GMDC has distributed educational materials such as books and stationery to students in 
government schools. Special focus is given to supporting girl students through scholarships, helping reduce dropout rates 
and encouraging higher secondary education. Sports activities are also supported to foster physical development, team 
spirit, and holistic growth among schoolchildren.
• Health and Hygiene:
 
GMDC operates mobile medical vans that provide basic healthcare services in remote villages lacking access to primary 
health centres. These vans conduct door-to-door health check-ups, distribute free medicines, and raise awareness on 
sanitation, nutrition, and preventive care. Thousands of villagers beneﬁt from these services annually, leading to early 
diagnosis and better health outcomes.
 
These initiatives collectively enhance the quality of life in GMDC’s operational areas while strengthening the company’s 
social license to operate. They reﬂect GMDC’s commitment to inclusive growth, responsible mining, and long-term 
community development.
3. 
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
 
GMDC, as an enterprise of the Government of Gujarat, qualiﬁes as a ‘State’ under Article 12 of the Constitution of India. In line 
with this status, the company aligns its operations and outreach programs with the constitutional vision of promoting equity, 
inclusion, and social development. GMDC’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy places focused attention on addressing 
the needs of vulnerable and marginalised groups, including Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), women, and 
economically weaker sections. These initiatives aim not only to enhance the quality of life for disadvantaged populations but 
also to contribute to the broader socio-economic development of communities in areas where GMDC operates. The company 
undertakes programmes in education, healthcare, skill development, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability, 
ensuring its CSR eﬀorts are both inclusive and responsive to local needs.

extends to matters of Equal Opportunity and Human Rights, reinforcing GMDC’s commitment to non-discrimination, fairness, 
and inclusivity across the workforce.
 
In addition, GMDC has an active HR Committee that supports the formulation and implementation of employee-centric policies 
and monitors issues related to workforce development, diversity, and workplace ethics. The Committee also plays an advisory 
role in ensuring alignment with applicable labour laws and HR priorities.
 
Further, GMDC has implemented a Whistleblower Policy that provides employees and stakeholders with a secure and 
anonymous channel to report concerns related to ethical misconduct, workplace harassment, or violations of internal policies. 
These mechanisms are reinforced by oversight from various State Legislative Committees, including those for Scheduled Castes 
and Scheduled Tribes, reﬂecting GMDC’s strong commitment to human rights, inclusion, and institutional accountability.
5. Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
 
GMDC addresses grievances related to human rights through formally designated committees and structured review 
procedures applicable to both internal operations and value chain partners. The company has constituted a POSH (Prevention of 
Sexual Harassment) Committee in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and 
Redressal) Act, 2013. This committee is responsible for handling complaints related to workplace harassment in a conﬁdential, 
timely, and impartial manner.
 
In addition, broader human rights issues—such as fair treatment, non-discrimination, and workplace dignity—are addressed by 
the Human Resources Committee, which reviews concerns raised by employees and contract workers. The committee ensures 
resolution in line with GMDC’s internal policies and applicable legal provisions.
 
Further, GMDC engages with vendors and contractors through its procurement process and onboarding mechanisms, where 
expectations related to ethical conduct and basic human rights compliance are communicated. Any concerns arising from value 
chain partners, including contract labour, are typically escalated through project-level administrative oﬃcers or site 
management and are addressed in coordination with the HR function.
 
This framework reﬂects GMDC’s commitment to upholding human rights principles across its ecosystem and promoting a 
responsible and inclusive working environment.

GMDC adopts structured waste management practices across its mining and industrial operations. The primary solid waste 
generated is Over Burden (OB), which is systematically dumped at designated sites and later repurposed for backﬁlling and 
biological reclamation of mined-out areas. Fly ash from power plants is similarly utilized in mine restoration.
 
Hazardous waste is managed through authorized channels:
 
•   Used oil is disposed of via registered recyclers or MSTC.
 
•   Bio-medical waste is handled by certiﬁed disposal agencies.
 
•   E-waste is centrally collected and sent to authorized vendors.
 
•   Battery waste is managed through a buyback arrangement with suppliers.
 
These practices ensure compliance with environmental norms and promote resource recovery and safe disposal.
11. If the entity has operations/oﬃces in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries,

Stakeholders can access comprehensive details about the company’s operations, product oﬀerings, pricing, and service-
related updates are available on the company’s oﬃcial website (http://www.gmdcltd.com). In addition, GMDC regularly 
publishes statutory disclosures such as annual reports, investor presentations, and press releases, which are accessible through 
its website. These documents provide stakeholders with transparent insights into business performance, strategic 
developments, and governance practices. By maintaining multiple touchpoints and ensuring timely updates, GMDC promotes

2. 
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services. 
 
GMDC follows a rigorous and structured customer onboarding process to ensure regulatory compliance and responsible usage 
of its mineral resources. Customer registration is completed only after a thorough veriﬁcation of all mandatory documents and 
clearances, including the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) Consent to Operate/Establish (CCA), Boiler Inspector 
Certiﬁcates, and relevant Installation Certiﬁcates. This ensures that customers meet all environmental and safety standards 
before beginning any commercial transactions.
 
To reinforce responsible mineral usage, GMDC conducts regular site visits to customer manufacturing units and plant facilities. 
These visits are intended not only for operational veriﬁcation but also to educate customers on safe handling, storage, and 
application of minerals. Customers receive detailed information on the quality parameters and chemical composition of the 
materials supplied, enabling them to use the resources more eﬀectively and responsibly.
 
Additionally, GMDC provides hands-on training and guidance to promote best practices in occupational safety and 
environmental stewardship. The company encourages compliance with environmental norms and supports customers in
