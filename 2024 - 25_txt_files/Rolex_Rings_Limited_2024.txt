 1
 Product 
Safety & 
Quality
 Opportunity
 Prioritizing product quality and safety 
allows manufacturers to address 
potential risks early on. By making 
quality and safety a core focus, 
companies distinguish themselves 
from competitors and establish a 
reputation for reliability and customer 
satisfaction. 
This 
commitment 
to 
delivering high-quality, safe products 
not only fosters customer loyalty but 
also drives repeat business, ultimately 
contributing 
to 
long-term 
profit 
growth.

Employee 
well-
being and 
engagement 
 Opportunity
 Employee engagement refers to the 
emotional 
connections 
individuals 
develop 
with 
an 
organization, 
influencing their commitment and 
sense of belonging. When employees 
are actively engaged, it often results in 
greater loyalty, reflecting positively on 
company policies and practices that 
enhance employee satisfaction and 
retention. On the other hand, a high 
turnover rate indicates dissatisfaction 
among employees.
 NA
 Positive
 3
Opportunities 
in Clean Tech 
 Opportunity
Clean technology offers a promising 
opportunity by incorporating various 
strategies to reduce or eliminate 
harmful environmental impacts, while 
also fostering economic and social 
progress. Its core aim is to reduce 
pollution and waste while improving 
productivity and efficiency. 
 NA
 Positive
 4
Community 
Relations 
 Opportunity
The industrial machinery and goods 
sector plays a vital role in the economy 
by 
providing 
employment 
and 
supporting community development 
through taxes and capital generation. 
However, it faces key challenges 
related to environmental policies, 
community 
health, 
and 
process 
safety. These issues have far-reaching 
effects on regulations, operations, 
finances, 
and 
the 
industry’s 
reputation. To effectively address 
these challenges, building strong 
relationships with local communities 
is 
essential. 
Such 
relationships 
can 
help 
prevent 
operational 
disruptions, reduce regulatory risks, 
retain skilled employees, minimize 
financial 
liabilities 
from 
process 
safety incidents, and maintain a 
solid social license to operate. It is 
important to recognize that process 
safety incidents not only jeopardize 
community well-being but also result 
in regulatory penalties, legal actions, 
and substantial mitigation costs.

(Indicate positive

 5
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
 Risk
Production, maintenance, repair work, 
and other on-site tasks in industrial 
environments often require significant 
manual labor. However, this reliance 
on manual labor introduces inherent 
risks. Workers' exposure to powered 
haulage 
and 
heavy 
machinery 
increases the likelihood of accidents, 
falls, fatalities, and injuries. Temporary 
employees, in particular, may face 
heightened risks due to their limited 
training and experience. Failing to 
protect workers' health and safety 
can lead to fines and penalties, 
while serious incidents can result in 
severe injuries and potential legal 
or regulatory liabilities. Additionally, 
health and safety issues can cause 
project delays and downtime, raising 
project 
costs 
and 
diminishing 
profitability.
At Rolex Rings, we regularly conduct 
health and safety audits to identify any 
gaps in occupational health and safety 
risks. These audits assess safety 
protocols, ensure the proper use of 
Personal Protective Equipment, and 
identify potential workplace hazards, 
all 
in 
compliance 
with 
industry 
standards. We also offer ongoing 
training and awareness programs 
focused on safe and healthy practices, 
particularly for the production floor. 
Furthermore, we provide systems for 
reporting and monitoring occupational 
health and safety hazards to effectively 
manage and mitigate risks.
 Negative
6
Material 
Sourcing 
efficiency
Risk
The industrial machinery and goods 
sector faces inherent risks within its 
supply chains due to its reliance on 
key materials used in production. 
Many of these critical materials are 
sourced from deposits concentrated 
in a few countries, some of which may 
be prone to geopolitical disruptions.
Additionally, the rising global demand 
for these minerals across various 
industries can cause price volatility 
and supply challenges, creating a 
competitive landscape for companies 
within this sector.
Implement strategies and practices 
to enhance the procurement and 
sourcing of raw materials, as it is vital for 
ensuring an uninterrupted production 
process. Cultivate strong relationships 
with our vendors and suppliers to 
promote long-term sustainability in 
material sourcing. Additionally, adopt 
sustainable sourcing practices to 
ensure the procurement of responsibly 
sourced raw materials. Implement 
lean manufacturing techniques to 
streamline production timelines and 
reduce reliance on suppliers.
Negative
7
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses are assessed on their 
performance in key governance areas, 
including ownership and control, 
board 
compensation, 
accounting 
practices, 
business 
ethics, 
and 
tax transparency. This evaluation 
examines how a company’s corporate 
governance and ethical practices 
influence its shareholders and other 
investors.
Rolex Rings Limited has established 
effective policies and practices to 
ensure strong corporate governance. 
We 
will 
continue 
to 
implement 
comprehensive systems and practices 
that 
promote 
ethical 
conduct, 
transparency, 
and 
accountability 
in our corporate decision-making. 
Ongoing 
monitoring, 
independent 
audits, and board oversight are crucial 
to maintaining sustainable operations 
and mitigating potential risks.

Labour 
Relations
Risk
Businesses with onsite workers must 
prioritize efficient labour management 
practices. Key factors to consider 
include workforce size and demands, 
operational locations, the quality of 
management-labour 
relationships, 
and 
the 
company's 
commitment 
to worker rights and engagement. 
The loss of skilled workers presents 
a significant operational risk for 
businesses.
We adopt strategies that foster 
positive labor relations, ensure equal 
opportunities, provide worker benefits, 
and maintain a safe and healthy 
workplace. 
We 
have 
established 
processes 
to 
address 
employee 
concerns. By creating transparent 
communication channels and actively 
engaging 
with 
employees, 
we 
enhance our labor relations.
Negative
9
Water 
consumption 
and 
wastewater 
management
Risk
Companies that rely heavily on water 
for their production processes face the 
risk of water scarcity. This could lead 
to operational disruptions, increased 
water procurement costs, and higher 
capital expenditures. Manufacturing 
processes generate wastewater that 
must be treated before being released. 
Failing to comply with water quality 
regulations can result in penalties and 
expensive compliance measures.
Rolex Rings factories are equipped 
with a sewage treatment facility that 
processes industrial effluent before 
it is discharged into the environment. 
In addition, we implement water 
conservation measures to reduce 
freshwater usage. We continuously 
monitor 
and 
report 
on 
water 
consumption to identify areas for 
improvement and adopt more efficient 
water management practices.
Negative
10
GHG 
Emissions
Risk
The 
manufacturing 
of 
industrial 
machinery and goods equipment 
directly contributes to greenhouse 
gas emissions. Scope 1 emissions 
arise from the combustion of fossil 
fuels 
during 
manufacturing 
and 
cogeneration processes. Additionally, 
manufacturing operations produce 
air emissions and harmful pollutants, 
posing potential operational risks. 
These emissions can lead to fines 
or costs associated with regulatory 
compliance. 
By 
prioritizing 
the 
management 
of 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions—through energy efficiency, 
alternative 
fuels, 
or 
improved 
production 
processes, 
companies 
can unlock financial benefits such as 
enhanced operational efficiency and 
reduced regulatory risks.
We have established robust emission 
monitoring systems to track and 
identify any harmful or toxic pollutants 
released into the atmosphere. Regular 
GHG emissions audits are conducted 
to evaluate the effectiveness of 
our current emission management 
strategies. 
As 
a 
responsible 
manufacturer of vehicle components, 
we have implemented solar rooftop, 
ground-mounted, and windmill energy 
systems to offset our emissions. We 
remain committed to further investing 
in GHG reduction initiatives and 
advanced technologies.
