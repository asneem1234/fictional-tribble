steady Investor confidence. As the year progressed. shifting 
global economic ltends and evolving regulatory frameworks 
brought phases of market volatility. Yet, u,e underlying growth 
fundamentals of our economy remained strong -
underpinned 
by rising financial literacy, deeper digital adoption. and a 
widening base of participation from semi-urban and rural India.

presence in underpenetrated Tier 3 and beyond markets. 
which contribute a growing share of new client Inflows. A 
sharper advisory-led approach, supported by an upgraded

Yes. the Company maintains a robust Code of Conduct

serves as a guiding framework for ethical behaviour and 
responsible decision- making. A central tenet of this Code Is 
the requirement that all Directors, in their capacity as 
fiduciaries, must prioritize the best Interests of the Company at 
all times. This means ensuring that any outside business 
ventures. personal relationships, or other affiliations they may 
have do not create, or even appear to create, a conflict of 
Interest with the Company's operations, strategies, or 
reputation. 
The Code of Conduct recognizes that Directors may l1ave 
diverse interests and involvements. Therefore, It establishes a 
clear process for managing potential conflicts. In the event 
that a Director Identifies an actual or potential conflict of 
Interest - whether it be financial, professional, or personal 
they are obligated to Immediately disclose the nature and 
extent or the conflict to the Board. Following disclosure. the 
Director Is required 10 seek the necessary approvals, as 
dictated by applicable laws, regulations, and the Company's 
Internal policies. This may Involve abstaining from voting on 
matters where t11e conflict exists. recuslng themselves from 
discussions, or, In certain circumstances, divesting from the

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT 
Global Economies 
Global growth is slowing due to a substantial rise in trade 
barriers and the pervasive effects of an • uncertain global 
policy environment. Growth has weaken to 2.3 percent in 
2025. with deceleration in most economies relative to last 
year. This would mark the slowest rate of global growth since 
2008, aside from outright global recessions. In 2026-27, a 
tepid recovery is expected. leaving global output materially 
below January projections. Progress by emerging market and 
developing economies (EMDEs) in closing per capita income 
gaps with advanced economies and reducing extreme poverty 
is anticipated to remain insufficient. The outlook largely hinges 
on the evolution of trade policy globally. Growth could turn out 
to be lower if trade restrictions escalate or if policy uncertainty 
persists, which could also result in a build-up of financial 
stress. Other downside risks include weaker-than-expected 
growth in major economies with adverse global spillovers, 
worsening contlicts. and extreme weather events. On the 
upside. uncertainty and trade barriers could diminish if major 
economies reach lasting agreements that address 
trade tensions. 
Conflicting developments over recent months-Including the 
imposition and swift rollback of US tariffs, the escalation and 
subsequent easing of US-China trade tensions, and ongoing 
trade negotiations of USA with major economies-have left 
the global outlook undergoing continuous realignment. In this 
uncertain environment, the US economy is estimated to have 
contracted by 0.3% (annualized) in 01 2025. Inflationary 
pressures remain sticky, stalling progress on disinflation. In 
response, central banks have become more cautious, seeking 
to balance growth and price stability amid worsening 
consumer sentiments and fall In global PMI indices. The recent 
passage of tax bill in the US has raised fresh concerns over 
fiscal sustainabiUty, with the US fiscal deficit at 6.4% of GDP in 
2024 and government debt at N124% of GOP. This comes in 
the context of the US sovereign rating downgrade by 
Moody's, compounding medium-term risks. Notwithstanding 
the temporary US-China trade truce. the overall growth 
outlook remains vulnerable to policy ambiguity. 
Domestic Economy Resilient Amid A 
Volatile Global Environment 
India remains one of the fastest-growing economies globally, 
attributed to factors such as demographic advantage, robust 
domestic demand. economic reforms. healthy GST collections, 
manufacturing and infrastructure development, technological 
advancements and digital push. Despite the challenges posed 
by global political instability. India's economy has shown 
remarkable resilience. In fiscal 2025, too, real GDP growth is 
estimated to be healthy at 6.5%, led by recovery in private 
consumption. The strong GOP growth boosts household 
income and savings, which, in turn. shores up investments. A 
spurt in GOP growth also gets built in market growth, 
supporting mark-to-market growth and acceleratlng 
asset growth.

Historically, asset classes such as equities, fixed income (debt}, and gold have performed differently in various market cycles. 
No single asset class consistently outperforms across all periods, Recognizing this. we structure diversified portfolios that 
intelligently allocate across these categories. This approach helps manage risk while capturing growth opportunities-reducing 
volatility and smoothing returns over time. 
For Instance, over the last ftve years, our carefully crafted mulU-asset portfolios have delivered a compounded annual growth 
rate (CAGR) of approxlmately 17.22%, while maintaining lower downside risk compared to pure equity portfolios. This reinforces 
our belief that thoughtful diversification Is not just about safety-it's also a powerful engine for growth. 
Importantly, our clients are increasingly embracing this philosophy, The share of multi-asset strategies in our overall assets 
under management (AUM) has grown from 15% to 30%, highlighting the rising confidence in this balanced approach.

India's Rnanclal services sector Is undergoing a structural shift,

Investment adoption, and credit access continue to lag In Tier 
3 to Tier 6 towns compared to urban centres. 
Tl1e growing preference for assisted Journeys, particularly In 
low-lncome and digitally less-savvy populations, Is reinforcing 
the importance of advisor-led distribution. Financial 
intermediaries who understand local needs. communicate In 
vernacular languages, and provide In-person support are 
becoming essential to bridge the last-mile trust and 
awareness gap.

making It economically viable lo seive smaller geographies 
through intermediaries. 
As the Industry matures, partnerships between platforms like 
Choice Connect and financial product manufacturers-banks. 
NBFCs. AMCs. and Insurers-are expected to deepen. 
Regulatory moves supporting point-of-sale agents, micro-
Insurance, and regional expansion of nntechs also strengthen 
the long•term relevance of the model.

2. NBFC SEGMENT 
Industry Trends 
NBFCs are expected to play a crucial role in the India growth story fueling formalized credit penetration among the 
underserved, Though the banking system dominates financial services, NBFCs have grown in importance by carving a niche for 
themselves by catering to customers in underbanked regions or those who would not be catered to by traditional financial 
institutions, due to absence of credit history or lack of proper collateral records.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement. whether due to fraud or error, 
and to Issue a11 auditor's report that Includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance Is a high level of assurance, but Is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted In accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material If, Individually or In the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to Influence the economic

the Standalone Flna11cial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that Is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
iraud Is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may Involve collusion, forgery, Intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
Obtain an understanding of Internal control relevant to the 
audit In order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate In the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(1) of

Directors. 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management and 
Board of Director's use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company's ablllty to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor's report lo the related 
disclosures In the Standalone Financial Statements or. If

such disclosures are Inadequate. to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 10 
the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a 
going concern. 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the Standalone Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures. and whether the Standalone Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events In a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance

ii. Functional and presentation currency 
The Company's presentation and functional ctirrency is 
Indian Rupees. All figures appearing in the Standalone 
financial statements are in Indian rupees in lakhs rounded off 
to two decimal places as permitted by Schedule Ill to the Act. 
Per share data are presented in Indian Rupee to two 
decimal places. 
Iii. Basis of measurement 
The standalone financial statements have been prepared on 
Hlstorlcal cost convention on the accrual basis as per the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")• except for 
certain financial assets and liabillties are measured at fair 
value as explained in the accounting policy. Historical cost is 
generally based on the fair value or the consideration given in 
exchange for goods and services. Further assets and liabilities 
are classified as per the normal operating cycle {determined as 
12 months). 
Iv. Fair value measurement 
Fair value is the price that would be received on sale of an 
asset or paid 10 transfer a liability In an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date In the 
principal or. In Its absence, the most advantageous market to 
which the Company has access at that date. 
The best estimate of the fair value of a financial Instrument on 
Initial recognition Is normally the transaction price. If the 
Company determines that the fair value on lniUal recognition 
differs from the transaction price and the ralr value Is 
evidenced neither by a quoted price In an active market for an 
ldentlcal asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique 
that uses only data from observable markets. then the financial 
Instrument is Initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer 
the difference between the fair value on Initial recognition and 
u,e transaction price. Subsequently that difference Is 
recognised In Slatement of Profit and Loss on an appropriate 
basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the 
Corporate Overview 
I Statutory Reports I Financial Statements I Notice 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (continued .. ) 
valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or 
the transaction is closed out. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the standalone financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows. based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole: 
Level 1 • Valuation using quoted market price In active 
markets: The fair value for financial Instruments traded In 
active markets at the reporting date Is based on their 
quoted market price, without any deduction for 
transaction costs. A market Is regarded as active, If 
transactions for the asset or liability take place with 
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing 
information on an ongoing basis. 
Level 2 • Valuation using observable Inputs: II there Is no 
quoted price In an active market, then the Company uses 
valuation techniques that maximise the use or relevant 
observable inputs and minimise the use or unobservable 
Inputs. The chosen valuation technique Incorporates most 
or the ractors that market participants would take Into 
account In pricing a transaction. 
Level 3 • Valuation with significant unobservable inputs: 
The valuation techniques are used only wllen lair value 
cannot be determined by using observable Inputs. The 
Company regularly reviews significant unobservable 
Inputs and valuaUon adjustments. Level 3 assets are 
typically very Illiquid. and ralr values can only be 
calculated using estimates. 
The Company uses valuaUon techniques that are appropriate 
In the circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable Inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable Inputs. 
v. Use of judgment and Estimates 
The preparation of the standalone financial statements 
requires the management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions In the application of accounting policies that 
affects the reported amount of assets, liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosures along with contingent liabilities as 
at the date of standalone financial statements and revenue & 
expenses for the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on the management's best knowledge of current 
events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes different from the 
estimates. Difference between actual results and estimates 
are recognised in the year in which the results are known or 
materialise i.e. prospectively, 
Estimates and judgements are continually e"aluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, The key areas involving 
estimation uncertainty, higher degree of judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the 
standalone financial statements include: 
a) Impairment of financial assets 
b) Estimation of fair value measurement of financial assets and 
liabilities 
c) Provisions and Contingencies 
d) Useful life and expected residual value of assets 
e) Tax position for current tax and recognition of deferred tax 
assets/liabilities 
f) Measurement of Defined Benefit Obligations and actuarial 
assumptions 
g) Share Based Payments 
h) Measurement of Expected Credit Loss allowance for Trade 
receivables 
A. Summary of significant accounting policies

sheet l)ased on current /non-current classification.

the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting 
period

Sate of services 
The Company recognizes revenue on accrual basis when the 
significant terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services 
have been delivered and the collectability is reasonably

the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest 
income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
appiicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
All items of property, plant and equipment having cost more

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on Initial

amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each financial 
year. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as 
either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are 
amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for 
impairment whenever there is an indication thal the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the 
amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful 
life are reviewed al least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the 
asset are considered to moclify the amortisation period or 
method, as appropriate. and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible

derecognised either when they have been disposed of or 
when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period 
of derecognition, 
5. Intangible Assets 
The cost Intangible assets at April 01, 2018. the Company's 
date of transition to Ind AS. was determined with reference to 
Its carrying value recognised as per u1e previous GAAP 
(deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS. 
Current taxes 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before tax' as reported in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
items that are never taxable or deductible. 
Current income tax is recognized at the amount expected to 
be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax 
rates and tax. laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. The Company offsets, on a 
year to year basis, the current tax assets and liabilities, where it

providing existing domestic companies with an option to pay 
tax at a concessional rate of 22% plus applicable surcharge 
and cess. The Company has irreversibly opted for the new tax 
rate i,e, 25.17%, 
Deferred taxes 
Deferred tax is recognized on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the standalone 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit and are accounted for using 
the balance sheet approach, Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and 
deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilized. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in o 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the profit 
and loss is recognised outside profit and loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity) 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probal)le that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered, 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities ancl when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Company 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis. 
7. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
At the end of each reporting period, the company reviews the 
carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment,

reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, 
corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-
generating units. or otherwise they are allocated to the 
smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable 
and consistent allocation basis can be identified. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible 
assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at 
least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired, 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of 
disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount. the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss, 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset ( or a cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset ( or cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in statement of profit and loss. 
8, Financial Instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity, 
Financial Assets 
a.) Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within a tlme frame established by regulation or 
convention in the market place (regular way trades) are 
recognised on tl1e trade date. i.e .. the date that the Company 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
Corporate Overview 
I Statutory Reports I Financial Statements I Notice 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (continued .. ) 
On initial recognition, a financial asset is measured at 
Amortised cost 
Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income - debt 
instruments 
Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income - equity 
instruments 
Fair Value Through Profit and loss 
Amortised cost • The Company's business model is not 
assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis. but at a higher 
level of aggregated portfolios being the level at which they 
are managed. The financial asset is held with the objective to 
hold financial asset in order to collect contractual cash flows 
as per the contractual terms that give rise on specified dates 
to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest 
{SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Accordingly, the 
Company measures Bank balances. Loans, Trade receivables 
and other financial instruments at amortised cost. 
FVOCI • debt instruments • The Company measures its debt 
instruments at FVOCI when the instrument is held within a 
business model, the objective of which is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; 
and the contractual terms of the financial asset meet the 
SPPI test. 
FVOCI • equity instruments • The Company subsequently 
measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or 
loss, unless the Company's management has elected to 
classify irrevocably some of its equity instruments at FVOCI, 
when such instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind 
AS 32 Financial Instruments and are not held for trading. 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial 
recognition, except if and in the period the Company cl,anges 
its business model for managing financial assets, 
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised 
cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all 
derivative financial assets, 
b.) Subsequent measurement 
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using effective interest method. 
The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest 
income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment 
are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, Any gain ancl 
loss on derecognilion is recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss. 
Debt investment at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair 
value. Interest income under effective interest method, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in 
Statement of profit ancl loss, Other net gains and losses are 
recognised in OCI. On derecognition. gains and losses 
accumulated in OCI are reclassified to Statement of Profit 
and Loss. 
For equity investments, the Company makes selection on an 
instrument-by-instrument basis to designate equity 
investments as measured at FVOCI. These selected 
investments are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the reserves. The 
cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to Statement of profit 
and loss on disposal of the investments, These investments in 
equity are not held for trading. Dividend income received on 
such equity investments are recognised in Statement of Profit 
and loss. Equity investments that are not designated as 
measured at FVOCI are designated as measured at FVTPl 
and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in 
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair 
value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend 
income, are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, 
c.) De-recognition of financial assets 
A financial asset (or. where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the company balance sheet) 
when; 
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or 
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third 
party under a 'pass-through· arrangement; and either (a) the 
company has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset. or (b) the company has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards 
of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained 
the risks and rewards of ownership, When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of the asset. nor transferred control of the asset, the 
company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the 
extent of the company's continuing involvement. In that case, 
the company also recognises an associated liability, The 
transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on 
a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the 
company has retained. 
Continuing involvement tl,at takes the form of a guarantee 
over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the company could be required 
to repay.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (continued .. ) 
d.) Impairment of financial assets 
The Company recognises impairment loss applying the 
expected credit loss (ECL) model on the financial assets 
measured at amortised cost, debt instruments at FVTOCI. 
lease receivables, trade receivables. other contractual right to 
receive cash or other financial asset and financial guarantee 
not designated as at FVTPL. 
The Company measures the loss allowance for a financial 
Instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit 
losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has 
increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk 
on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since 
Initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance 
for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months 
expected credit losses. 
For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash 
or other financial assets that result from transactions that are 
within the scope of Ind AS 115, the Company always measures 
the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected 
credit losses. 
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected credit 
loss allowance for trade receivables, t11e Company applies 
'simplified approach' permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial 
Instruments. This expected credit loss allowance is computed 
based on a provision matrix which takes into account 
historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward• 
looking information. 
In view of the fact that the entire trade receivables are from its 
subsidiaries and other group companies, there is no lifetime 
credit losses expected by the Company. 
Write offs - The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is 
written-off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is 
no reasonable expectation of recovering the asset in its 
entirety or a portion thereof, This is generally the case when 
the Company determines that the vendor does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient 
cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off and 
when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery from the 
collaterals held. However, financial assets that are written-off 
could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to 
comply with the Company's procedures for recovery of 
amounts due. 
Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Balance Sheet -
Loss allowances for ECL are deducted from the gross carrying 
amount of financial assets measured at amortised cost. 
Financial Llablllties 
a.) Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and. 
In Uie case, of loans and borrowings and payables. net of 
directly altributable lransaction costs. 
230 I Choice International Limited 
b.) Subsequent measurement 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification, as described below: 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include 
financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through 
profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for 
trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in 
the near term. This category also includes derivative financial 
instruments entered into by the Company tl1at are not 
designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as 
defined by Ind-AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are 
also classified as held for trading unless they are designated 
as effective hedging instruments. 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in 
the profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair 
value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of 
recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. 
For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses 
attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. 
These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. 
However, the company may transfer the cumulatlve gain or 
loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such 
liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. The 
Company has not designated any financial liability as at foir 
value through profit and loss. 
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method, except for contingent 
consideration recognized In a business combination which is 
subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. 
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from 
the Balance Sheet date. the carrying amounts approximate fair 
value due to the short maturity of these instruments. 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognised when and only when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by 
another from the same lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as the 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a 
new liability, The difference in the respective carrying amounts 
Is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. 
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

I Statutory Reports I Financial Statements 
I Notice 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (continued .. ) 
Loans and borrowings 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are 
derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate 
amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that me 
an integral part of the effective interest rate. Such amortisation 
is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. 
9. Leases 
ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is 
determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs, 
For lease liabilities at inception. the Company measures the 
lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that 
are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily 
The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 'Leases' with the date of 
determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease 
initial application being April 1, 2019, The Company's lease 
asset classes primarily consist of leases for Premises. The 
Company. at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the 
contract is a lease or not lease. A contract is. or contains, a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a time in exchange for a consideration. This 
policy has been applied to contracts existing and entered into 
on or after April 1, 2018, 
The Company evaluates each contract or arrangement, 
whether it qualifies as lease as defined under Ind AS 116. 
The Company as a lessee 
The Company assesses, whether the contract is, or contains, a 
lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
involves- a) the use of an identified asset b) the right to obtain 
substantially all the economic benefits from use of the 
identified asset, and c) the right to direct the use of the 
identified asset. 
The Company at the inception of the lease contract 
recognises a Right-of-Use (RoU) asset at cost and a 
corresponding lease liability, for all lease arrangements in 
which it is a lessee, except for leases with term of less than 
twelve months (short term) and low-value assets (assets of less 
than Rs. 10 Lakhs in value). Certain lease arrangements 
includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before 
the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities 
includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised. 
The cost of the ROU assets comprises the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made 
at or before the inception date of the lease plus any initial 
direct costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently, 
the right-of-use assets is measured at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. The ROU assets is depreciated using the straight 
line method from the commencement date over the shorter of 
lease term or useful life of ROU assets. 
payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing 
rate. 
The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement 
of lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. Where 
the carrying amount of the ROU assets is reduced to zero and 
there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease 
liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the 
remeasurement in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
For short-term and low value leases, the Company recognises 
the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term, 
The Company as a lessor 
Lease income from operating leases where the Company is a 
lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase 
in line with expected general inflation to compensate for 
the expected inflationary cost increases. The respective 
leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on 
their nature. 
10. Finance Costs 
Finance costs include interest expense computed by applying 
the effective interest rate on respective financial Instruments 
measured at amortised cost Financial instruments include 
debt and borrowing, Finance costs are charged to U,e 
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
11. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised only when: 
an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event: and 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligatlon; 
and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation 
Annual Report 2024-25 I 231 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (continued .. ) 
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted 
to reflect the current best estimates. 
Further, long term provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows specific to the liabinty. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. A 
provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present 
value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the 
contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the 
contract. Before a provision is established, the Company 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with 
that contract. 
Contingent liability is disclosed in case of: 
a present obligation arising from past events. when it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation; and 
a present obligation arising from past events, when no 
reliable estimate is possible. 
Contingent Assets: 
Contingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that 
developments are appropriately reflected in the financial 
statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow 
of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related 
Income are recognised in the financial statements of the 
period in which the change occurs. If an inflow of economic 
benefits has become probable, an entity discloses the 
contingent asset 
12. Commitments 
Commitments are future liabilities for contractual expenditure, 
classified and disclosed as follows: 
estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed 
on capital account and not provided for; 
uncalled liability on loan sanctioned and on investments 
partly paid; and 
other non-c:<1ncellable commitments. if any. to the extent 
they are considered material and relevant in the opinion 
of management. 
13. Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net 
profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outS1andlng 
during the year. 
DIiuted earnings per share adjusts the figures used In the 
determlnatlon of basic earnings per share to take Into account 
The after h1come tax effect of Interest and other financing 
costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares, and 
Weighted average number of equity shares that would 
have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all the 
dilutive potential equity. 
232 I Choice International Limited 
14. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with 
banks. Cash equivalents are short-term balances (with an 
original maturity of three months or less from the date of 
acquisition). and highly liquid time deposits that are readily 
convertible Into known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to insignificant risk of changes in value, 
15. Statement of Cash Flow 
Statement of Cash Flows is prepared segregating the cash 
flows into operating. investing and financing activities, Cash 
flow from operating activities is reported using indirect 
method adjusting the net profit for the effects of: 
i. changes during the period in inventories and operating 
receivables and payables transactions of a noncash nature; 
ii. non-cash items such as depreciation, provisions, deferred 
taxes, unrealised foreign currency gains and losses, and 
undistributed profits of associates and joint ventures; and 
Iii, all other items for which the cash effects are investing or 
financing cash flows, 
Cash and cash equivalents (including bank balances) shown in 
the Statement of Cash Flows exclude items which are not 
available for general use as on the date of Balance Sheet. 
16. Employee Benefits 
Short term employee benefits 
Employee benefrts falling due wholly within twelve months of 
rendering the service are classified as short term employee 
benefits and are expensed in the period in which the 
employee renders the related service, Liabilities recognised in 
respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the 
undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for the related service. 
Long term employee benefits 
Company's net obligation in respect of long-term employee 
benefits is the amount of future benefit tl1at employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods. 
Post-employment benefits 
a.) Defined contribution Plans 
Provident fund: Contributions as required under the statute, 
made to the Provident Fund {Defined Contribution Plan) are 
recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss, 
There is no obligation other than the monthly contribution 
payable to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, 
ESIC and Labour welfare fund: The Company's contribution 
paid/payable during the year to Employee state insurance 
scheme ancl Labour welfare fund are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (continued .. ) 
b.) Defined benefit Plans 
Gratuity liability is defined benefit obligation and is provided 
on the basis of an actuarial valuation performed by an 
independent actuary based on projected unit credit method, 
at the end of each financial year. 
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: 
i) Service cost (including current service cost. paS1 service 
cost. as well as gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements) 
ii) Net interest expense or income 
iii) Re-measurement 
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability, which 
comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets 
{excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, 
excluding interest), are recognized in OCI. net of taxes. Tl1e 
Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the 
net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying 
the cliscount rate used to measure the defined benefit 
obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net 
defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any 
changes in the net defined benefit liability {asset) during the 
period as a result of contributions and benefit payments, Net 
interest expense and other expenses related to defined 
benefit plans are recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The Company's net obligation in respect of gratuity (defined 
benefit plan). is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that the employees have earned in the current and 
prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair 
value of any plan assets, The retirement benefit obligation 
recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit 
or surplus in the company's defined benefit plans. Any surplus 
resulting from this calculation is recognised as an asset to the 
extent of present value of any economic benefits available in 
the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in the future 
contribution to the plans. 
Share based payment arrangements 
The cost of equity settled transactions is determined by the 
fair value at the grant date. The fair value of the employee 
share options is based on the Black Scholes model. 
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based 
payment granted to employees is recognized as an expense. 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting 
period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense 
is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the 
related service and non-market performance conditions are 
expected to be met. such that the amount ultimately 
recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the 
related service and non-market performance conditions at the 
vesting date. For share-based payment awards with market 
performance conditions and non-vesting conditions, the grant-
date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to 
reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences 
between expected and actual outcomes. 
Choice International Limited grants options to eligible 
employees of the Company under Choice Employee Stock 
Option Scheme 2022. The options vest over a period of four 
years. In case of Group equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions, where the Company grants stock options to the 
employees of its subsidiaries, the transactions are accounted 
by increasing the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings 
per share. 
17. Investment in Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has 
control. The Company controls an entity when the company 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of 
the entity. 
Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment. if any.

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring 
at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis presented above may 
not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions 
would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. 
Furtl1ermore. in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been 
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same method as applied in 
calculating the defined benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet. 
There is no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from previous year. 
Risk Exposure 
Through its defined benefit plans. the Company is exposed to a number of risks. the most significant of which 
are detailed: 
Investment risk 
Interest risk 
Asset liability 
matching risk 
Moratility risk 
Concentration risk 
Salary risk 
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate 
which Is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below tl1is rate, It will create a plan deficit. 
Currently. for the plan In India, It has a relatively balanced mix of Investments in 
government securities. and other debt Instruments. 
A fall in the discount rate which Is linked to the G.Sec. Rate will Increase the present value 
of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall In the discount rate generally Increases the 
mark to market vafue of the assets depending on u,e duration of asset. 
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines 
of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk 
Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age 
only, plan does not have any longevity risk. 
Plan ls having a concentration risk as all the assets are lnveSted with the Insurance antlty 
and a default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this Is very less as 
Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines. 
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the 
future salaries of members. As such, an Increase In the salary of the members more than 
assumed level will increase the plan's liability.

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of consolidated Financial 
Statements In accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and {3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
de1ection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the

(Continued .. ) 
v. Principle of Consolidation and equity accounting 
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements have comprised 
financial statements of the Company and Its subsidiaries, 
subsidiaries are all entlUes (Including sttuctured entitles) over 
which !he Group has control. The Group controls an entity 
when the Group is exposed to. or has rights to, variable 
returns from Its Involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through Its power to direct !he relevant 
acllvitles of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
!he date on which control ls transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolldated from the date that control ceases. 
The acquisition method of accounting Is used to account for 
business combinations by the Group. 
The Group combines the financial statements of !he Holding 
Company and Its subsidiaries line by line adding together like 
items of assets, liabilities. equity, Income and expenses. 
lntercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on 
transactions wllllln t11e Group are eliminated. Unrealized 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by 
!he Group. 
Non-controlllng Interests In the results and equity of 
subsidiaries are shown separately In the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes 
In equity and balance sheet respectively. Statement of Profit 
and Loss Including Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) Is 
attributable to !he equity holders of the Holding Company and 
to the non-controlling Interest basis the respective ownership 
Interest and such balance Is attributed even If this results In 
controlling Interest Is having a deficit balance. 
Associates 
Associates are all entitles over which the Group has slg111ficant 
Influence but not co11trol or Joint control. This Is generally the 
case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the 
voting rights. Investments In associates are accounted for 
using the equity method of accou11ting (see (Iii) below). after 
Initially being recognised at cost. 
Equity Method 
Under the equity method of accounting, the Investments are 
Initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognize the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or 
losses of the Investee In profit or loss. and the Group's share 
of other comprehensive i11come of the Investee In other 
comprehensive Income. Dlvictends received or receivable from 
associates and joint ventures are recognized as a reduction In 
the carrying amount of the Investment 
294 I Choice International Limited 
When the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted 
Investment equals or exceeds Its interest In the entlty. 
Including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the 
Group does not recognize further losses, unless II has Incurred 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity. 
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and Its 
associates and Joint ventures are eliminated to the extent or 
the Group's Interest In these entities. unrealized losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
Impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of 
equity accounted Investees have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by 
the Group. 
Changes in ownership Interests 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests 
that do not result In a loss of control as transactions with 
equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest 
results In an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the 
controlling and noncontrolllng Interests to reflect their relative 
Interests In the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount 
of the adjustment to non-controlling Interests and any 
consideration paid or received Is recognized within equity. 
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for 
an investment because of a loss of control, Joint control or 
significant Influence, any retained Interest In the entity Is 
remeasured to its fair value with the change In carrying 
amount recognized In profit or loss. This fair value becomes 
the initial carrying -amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as a11 associate.Joint 
venture or financial asset In addition, any amounts previously 
recognized In other comprehensive Income In respect of that 
entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed 
of tile related assets or llabllltles. This may mean that amounts 
previously recognized In other comprehensive Income are 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
If the ownership Interest In an associate is reduced but Joint 
control or significant Influence Is retained, only a proportionate 
share or the amounts previously recognized In other 
comprehensive Income are reclassified to profit or loss where 
appropriate. 
vi. Fair value measurement 
Fair value Is the price that would be received on sale of an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability In an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date In the 
principal or, In Its absence, the most advantageous market to 
which the Group has access at that date. The best estimate of 
the fair value of a financial Instrument on Initial recognition Is 
normally !he transaction price. If the Group determines that the 
fair value on Initial recognition differs from the transaction 
price and the fair value Is evidenced neither by a quoted price

I Statutory Reports I Financial Statements I Notice 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 
(Continued .. ) 
on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable 
markets, then the financial Instrument Is lnltlally measured at 
fair value. adjusted to defer the difference between the fair 
value on Initial recognition and the transaction price. 
Subsequently that difference Is recognised In Statement of 
Profit and Loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
Instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly 
supported by observable market data or the transaction Is 
closed out. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value Is measured or 
disclosed In the consolidated financial statements are 
categorised within the rair value hierarchy. described as 
follows, based on the lowest level Input that Is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole: 
Level 1 - Valuation using quoted market price in active 
markets: The fair value for financial Instruments traded In 
active markets at the reporting date is based on their 
quoted market price, without any deduction for 
transaction costs. A market is regarded as active, If 
transactions for the asset or liability take place with 
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing 
Information on an ongoing basis. 
Level 2 • Valuation using observable Inputs: If there ls no 
quoted price In an active market, then the Company uses 
valuatlon techniques that maximise the use of relevant 
observable Inputs and minimise the use of unobservable 
Inputs. The chosen valuation technique Incorporates most 
of the factors that market participants would take Into 
account In pricing a transaction. 
Level 3 • Valuation with significant unobservable Inputs: 
The valuation techniques are used only when fair value 
cannot be determined by using observable inputs. The 
Company regularly reviews significant unobservable. 
Inputs and valuation adjustments. Level 3 assets are 
typlcally very illlquld. and fair values can only be 
calculated using estimates. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate 
in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available to measure fair value. maximising the use of 
relevant observable Inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable Inputs. 
vii. Use of Judgment and Estimates 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
requires !he management to make Judgments, estimates and 
assumptions In the application of accounting policies that 
affects the reported amount of assets, llabllltles and the 
accompanying disclosures along with contingent liabllltles as 
at the date of consolidated financial statements and revenue & 
expenses For the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on the management's best knowledge of current 
events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result In outcomes different from the 
estimates. Difference between actual results and estimates are 
recognised In the year In which the results are known or 
materialise I.e. prospectively. 
Estimates and Judgements are contlnualty evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors, Including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas Involving 
estimation uncertainty, higher degree of Judgement or 
complexity. or areas where assumptions are significant to the 
consolidated financial statements include: 
a) Impairment or financial assets 
b) Estimation of fair value measurement of financial assets and 
llabllltles 
c) Effective Interest rate 
d) Business model assessment 
e) Provisions and Contingencies 
fJ Useful life and expected residual value of assets 
g) Tax position for current tax and recognition of deferred tax 
assets/llabllitles 
h) Measurement of Defined Benefit Obligations and actuarial 
assumptions 
I) Classification of tease and related discount rate 
J) Share Based Payments 
k) Measurement of Expected Credit Loss allowance for Trade 
receivables 
Further an entity Is consolidated as a subsidiary If the 
Company has control over the said entity based on the 
management evaluation of Investments and related 
agreements/ deeds and determines that the Group has control 
over the said entity in terms of Ind AS-110 on Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Conuol shall Include the right to appoint 
majority of the directors or to control the management or 
policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting 
Individually or in concert, directly or Indirectly, Including by 
virtue of their shareholding or management rights or 
shareholders' agreements or voting agreements or In any 
other manner.

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful fives on the same basis as owned assets. 
However. when there is no reasonable certainty that 
ownership will be obtained by the end of the lease term, 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of u,e lease term and 
useful fives. 
Depreciation Is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets 
less their residual values over the useful lives as prescribed In 
Schedule II of to the Companies Act, 2013, using the straight· 
line method ("SLM"). Residual value Is considered nil case of

of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of 
property, plant and equipment.

year. The useful lives of Intangible assets are assessed as 
either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are 
amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for 
Impairment whenever there Is an Indication that Ihe intangible 
asset may be Impaired. The amortisation period and the 
amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful 
life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes In the expected useful life or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied In the 
asset are considered to modify the amortisatio,, period or 
method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes In

exchange differences on monetary Items receivable from 
or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement Is 
neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part 
or the net Investment In foreign operation), which are 
recognised lnltrally In other comprehensive income and 
reclassified from equity to profit or loss on repayment of 
the monetary Items. 
Non-monetary 11ems that are measured In terms of hlstorrcal 
cost In a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates as at the dates of the Initial transactions. Non-monetary 
Items measured at fair value In a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair 
value was determined. The gain or loss arising on translation 
of non-monetary Items measured at fair value Is treated In line 
298 I Choice International limited 
with the recognition or the gain or loss on the change tn fair 
value or the Item (I.e. translation differences on Items whose 
fair value gain or loss Is recognised In OCI or profit or loss are 
also recognised In OCI or profit or toss. respectlvely). 
8. Income Tax 
Current taxes 
tncome tax expense is recognized in net profit in the 
statement of ptof1t and toss except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognized directly in other comprehensive 
income or equity, In which case it is recognized in ot11er 
comprehensive Income or equity respectively. Current income 
tax Is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or 
recovered from the tax authonties, using the tax rates and tax 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. The Group offsets, on a year to year basis, 
the current tax assets and liabilities. where It has legally 
enforceable right to do so and where rt Intends to sett1e such 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Deferred taxes 
Deferred tax Is recognized on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilrties In the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used In 
the computation of taxable ptofit and are accounted for using 
the balance 5nee1 liabihty method. Deferred tax liabllltle5 are 
generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. 
and deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all 
deductible temporary differences to the extent that It Is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against Which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utillled. Such 
assets and tiabllltles are not recogniled If the temporary 
difference arises from goodwlll or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) or other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax relating to items recogmsed outside the profit 
and loss is recognised outside profrt and loss (erther In other 
comprehensive Income or In equity). 
The canying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or pan or the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and habllities are offset when there is a 
tegally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authofity and the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabiht,es on a net basis.

9. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
At the end or each reporting period, the Group reviews the 
cairylng amounts or Its tangible and Intangible assets to 
determine whether there Is any Indication that those assets 
have suffered an Impairment loss. If any such Indication exosts. 
the recoverable amount of the asset Is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of Impairment loss (If any). When ft Is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an Individual 
asset. the Group estimates the recoverable amount or the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a 
reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be 
Identified. corporate assets are also allocated to Individual 
cash-generating units. or otherwise they are allocated to the 
smallest group or cash-generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be Identified. 
Intangible assets with Indefinite useful lives and Intangible 
assets not yet ava,labte for use are tested for impairment at 
least annually, and whenever there Is an Indication U1at the 
asset may be Impaired. 
Recoverable amount Is the higher of raIr value less costs or 
disposal and value 1n use. In assessing value In use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments or the time value or money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount or an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
Is estimated to be tess than Its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amounL An Impairment loss ts recognized In the 
profit or loss. 
When an Impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount or the asset ( or a cash-generating unit) Is Increased to 
the ,ev,sed esumate or its recoverable amount. but so that the 
Increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no Impairment 
toss been recognised for the asset ( or cash-generat,ng unit) In 
prior years. A reversal or an Impairment loss Is recognised 
lmmedlately In profit or loss. 
10. Financial Instruments 
A financial inStrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
llnancial asset or one entity nnd a financial liability or equity 
Instrument of another entity 
Financial Assets 
a.) Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial osse1s are recognised lnlllally at fair value plus. In 
tne case of financial assets not recorded at fair vatue through 
profit or loss. transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition or the financial asset. Purchases or sates of 
financial assets that require delivery or assets within a time 
frame established by regulation or convention In the market 
place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date. 
I.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
asseL 
On Initial recognition, a financial asset Is measured at 
Amortised cost 
Fatr Value through Other Comprehensive Income - debt 
Instruments 
Fair Value through Other Compret,ensive Income - equity 
Instruments 
Fair Value Through Profit and Loss 
Amortised cost • The Group's business model Is not assessed 
on an lnstn.1ment-bylnstrument basis, but at a higher level or 
aggregated portfolios being the level at which they are 
managed. The financial asset Is held with the objecwe 10 hold 
nnanc,al asset In order to collect contractual cash nows as per 
the contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash 
nows that are solely payment of principal and Interest (SPPI) 
on the principal amount outstanding. Accordmgty, the Group 
measures Bank balances. Loans. Trade receivables and other 
financial Instruments at amortised cost. 
FVOCI • debt Instruments • The Group measures ,ts debt 
lnStruments at FVOCI when the Instrument Is held within a 
business model. the objective of which Is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash nows and selling financial assets: 
and the contractual terms or the financial asset meet the 
SPPI test. 
FVOCI · equity Instruments • The Group subsequently 
measures all equity Investments at fatr value through profit or 
loss. unless the Group's management has elected 10 classify 
Irrevocably some of Its equity Instruments at FVOCI. when 
such Instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 
Ananclal Instruments and are not held for trading. 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their Initial 
recognmon, except If and In the period the Group changes Its 
business model for managing financial assets. 
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised 
cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL This Includes all 
denvauve financial assets. 
b.) Subsequent measurement 
Equity Instruments 
All equity Investments In scope or Ind />S 109 are measured at 
fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are 
classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity Instruments, the 
Group may make an Irrevocable election to present 
subsequent changes In the fail value In OCI. The Group makes 
such electron on an lnStrument-by-lnstrument basts. The 
classlflcatlon Is made on Initial recognition and ts Irrevocable. 
Annual Repon 2024-25 I 299 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 
(Continued .. ) 
Dividends from such Investments are recognized In profit or 
loss as other Income. There Is no recycling or the amounts 
from OCI to Profit and Loss. eve,, on sale or Investment 
However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss 
within equity. 
Equity Instruments subsequently measured at fair value 
through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all 
ct1a,1ges recognized In the statement of profit and loss. 
c.) De-recognition 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the group's balance sheet) 
when: 
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.or 
The Group l1as transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 
'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Group has 
transferred subs1antially all the risks and rewards of the asset. 
or (bl the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset. 
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
/lows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement. it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained 
the risks and rewards of ownership. When i1 has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset. the 
group continues to recognised the transferred asset to the 
extent of the group·s continuing involvement. In that case, the 
group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred 
asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the group has retained. 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee 
over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the group could be required 
to repay. 
d.) Impairment of financial assets 
The Group recognises impairment loss applying the expected 
credit loss (ECL) model on the financial assets measured at 
amortised cost. debt instruments at FVTOCI. lease receivables. 
trade receivables, and other contractual right to receive cash 
or other financial asset and financial guarantee not designated 
as al FVTPL. 
Expected credit losses are the weighted average of credit 
losses with the respective risks of default occurring as the 
weights. 
300 I Choice International Limited 
The Group measures the loss allowance for a financial 
Instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit 
losses If the credit risk on that financial Instrument has 
Increased significantly since Initial recognition. If the credit risk 
on a financial Instrument has not increased slgniflcantly since 
Initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for 
that financial Instrument at an amount equal to 12 months 
expected credit losses. 
For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash 
or other financial assets that result from transactions that are 
within the scope of Ind AS 115, the Group always measures 
the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected 
credit losses. 
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected credit 
loss allowance for trade receivables, the Group applies 
'simplified approach' permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial 
Instruments. This expected credit loss allowance Is computed 
based on a provision matrix which takes Into account 
historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-
looklng Information. 
Write offs- The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is 
written-off (either partially or In full} to the extent that there Is 
no reasonable expectation of recovering the asset in its 
entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when 
the Group determines that the vendor does not have assets or 
sources of Income that could generate sufficient cash flows to 
repay the amounts subject to the write-off and when there Is 
no reasonable expectation of recovery from the collaterals 
held. However. financial assets that are written-off could still 
be subject to enforcement activities In order to comply w,th 
the Group·s procedures for recovery of amounts due. 
Presentation of allowance for ECL In the Balance Sheet-
Loss allowances for ECL are deducted from the gross carrying 
amount of financial assets measured at amortised cosL 
For loan given measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI, except 
for investments In equity Instruments. Group follows a 'three-
stage' model for Impairment based on changes In credit 
quality since initial recognition. 
Stage 1 (Performing Assets)- Includes financial assets that 
have not had a significant Increase In credit risk since Initial 
recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date. 
For these assets, 12-month ECL ls recognised and hiterest 
Income Is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the 
assets (that ls, without deduction for credit allowance). 12-
month ECL are tile portion of ECL that results from default 
events on a financial Instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date, if the credit risk has not 
significantly Increased since Initial recognition.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 
(Continued .. ) 
Stage 2 (Underperformlng Assets with significant Increase In 
credit risk since Initial recognition)• Includes financial 
Instruments that have had a significant Increase In credit risk 
since initial recognition (unless they have low credit risk at the 
reporting date) but that do not have objective evidence of 
lmpalrmenL For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognised, but 
Interest Income Is calculated on the gross carrying amount of 
the assets. Lifetime ECL are tiie expected credit losses that 
result from all possible default events over the expected life of 
the Instrument. 
Stage 3 (Non-performing or Credit-Impaired assets)• 
Includes financial assets that have objective evidence of 
Impairment at the reporting date. For these assets, llfetlme 
ECL Is recognised and Interest Income is recognised on Net 
exposure (tllat Is Gross carrying amount les.s Provision for 
Expected credit losses). 
Financial Liabilities 
a.) Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and. 
in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of 
cllrectly attributable transaction costs. 
b.) Subsequent measurement 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification. as described below: 
Financial liabilities at fair value througl1 profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include 
financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through 
profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for 
trading If they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing In 
the near term, This category also includes derivative financial 
Instruments entered Into by the group that are not designated 
as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
Ind-AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as 
effective hedging Instruments. 
Gains or losses on llabilttles held for trading are recognised In 
the profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities designated upon Initial recognition at fair 
value through proiit or loss are designated at the initial date of 
recognition, and only if tl1e criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. 
For llabilitles designated as FVTPL. fair value gains/ losses 
attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. 
These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. 
However. the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss 
within equity. All other changes In fair value of such liability are 
recognised In the statement of profit or loss. The Group has 
not designated any financial liability as at fair value through 
profit and loss. 
Financial llabllltles are subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effectlve Interest method, except for contingent 
consideration recognized In a business combination which Is 
subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. 
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from 
the Balance Sheet date. the carrying amounts approximate fair 
value due to the short maturity of these instruments. 
Oerecognitlon 
A financial liability Is derecognised when and only when U1e 
obligation under the liability Is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. wI,en an existing financial llabllity is replaced by 
another from the same lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing llablllty are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as the 
derecognltlon of the original liablllty and the recognition or a 
new llab!llty. The difference In the respective carrying amounts 
Is recognised In the statement of profit or loss. 
Offsetting of financial Instruments 
Financial assets and financial llabllltles are offset and the net 
amount Is reported In the balance sheet If there Is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there Is an Intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the llabllltles simultaneously. 
Loans and borrowings 
After Initial recognltio,,. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effectJve interest rate method. Gains and losses are 
recognised In profit or loss when the liabilities are 
derecognlsed as well as through the effective Interest rate 
amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an Integral part of u,e effective Interest rate. Such amortisation 
Is Included as finance costs In the statement of profit and loss. 
Financial guarantee contracts 
Financial guarantee contracts Issued by the group are those 
contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the 
holder for a loss lt incurs because the specified debtor fails to 
make a payment when due In accordance with the terms of a 
debt Instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised 
lnltJally as a llablllty at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. 
Subsequently, the llablllty Is measured at the higher of the 
amount of loss allowance determined as per Impairment 
requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less 
cumulative amortisation.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 
(Continued .. ) 
c.) Derecognition 
A nnanc:lal llablllty Is derecognised when the obligaUon under 
the liability Is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing financial llablllty Is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially rnodified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as the derecognitlon of the original 
llablllty and the recognition of a new liablllty. The difference In 
the respective carrying amounts Is recognised in U1e 
statement of profit or loss. 
d.) Offsetting of financial Instruments 
Flnanclal assets and financial llabllitles are offset and the net 
amount Is reported in the balance sheet If there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to setue on a net basis. to realise the 
assets and settle the llabllltles simultaneously. 
11. Leases 
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116 'Leases' with the date of 
initial application being April 1, 2019. The lease asset classes 
primarily consist of leases for Premises. The Group, at the 
inception of a contract. assesses whether the contract is a 
lease or not lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the rigllt to control the use of an identified 
asset for a time in exchange for a consideration. 
This policy 
has been applied to contracts existing and entered into on or 
after April 1, 2018. 
Tile Group evaluates each contract or arrangement. whether it 
qualifies as lease as defined under Ind AS 116. 
The Group as a lessee 
Tile Group as a lessee the Group assesses, whether the 
contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains. a 
lease if the contract involves- a) the use of an identified asset. 
b) the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits 
from use of the identified asset, and c) the right to direct the 
use of the identified asset. 
The Group at the inception of the lease contract recognises a 
Right-of-Use (RoU) asset at cost and a corresponding lease 
liability, for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, 
except for leases with term of less than twelve mont11s (short 
term) and low-value assets. Certain lease arrangements 
Includes tile options to extend or terminate the lease before 
the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities 
includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised. 
The cost of the ROU assets comprises the amount of the initial 
measurement of tl1e lease liability, any lease payments made 
at or before the inception date of the lease plus any initial 
direct costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently, 
the right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
302 I Choice International Limited 
losses, If any. The ROU assets are depreciated using the 
straight-fine method from the commencement date over the 
shorter of lease term or useful life of ROU assets. 
ROU assets are evaluated for recoverablllty whenever events 
or changes In circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
Impairment testing, the recoverable amount (l.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-In-use) is 
determined on an indlvldual asset basis unless the asset does 
not generate cash nows that are largely Independent of those 
from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs. 
For lease llabillties at Inception, the Group measures the 
lease liability al the present value of the lease payments that 
are not paid al that date. The lease payments are discounted 
using the Interest rate implicit In the lease. If that rate Is 
readily determined. If that rate Is not readily determined, the 
lease payments are discounted using the Incremental 
borrowing rate. 
Tl1e Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of 
lease liability as an adjustrnent to the ROU assets. Where the 
carrying amount of the ROU assets Is reduced 10 zero and 
there Is a further reduction In the measurement or the lease 
llablllty, the Group recognfses any remaining amount or t11e 
remeasurernent In the Statement or Profit and Loss. For short-
term and low value leases, the Group recognises the lease 
payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. 
The Group as a lessor 
Lease Income from operating leases where the Group Is a 
lessor Is recognised In Income on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term unless the receipts are struclured 10 Increase 
In line wlth expected general Inflation to cornpensate for the 
expected Inflationary cost increases. The respective leased 
assets are Included In the balance sheet based on their 
nature. 
12. Finance Cost 
Finance costs include interest expense computed by applying 
the effective interest rate on respective financial instruments 
measured at amortised cost. Financial instruments include 
debt and borrowing, Finance costs are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Ancilla,y and other borrowing 
costs are amortised on straight line basis over the tenure of 
the underlying debt and borrowing, 
13. Goods and Service Input Tax Credit 
Goods and Services tax Input credit Is accounted for ln the 
books In the period In which the supply of goods or service 
received Is accounted and when there Is no uncertainty ill 
avalllng/ulillsing the credits.

(Continued .. ) 
14. Dividend distribution to equity holders of the Group 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity 
holders of the Group when the distribution ls authorised and 
the distribution Is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As 
pet the Act. final dividend is authorised when It Is approved by 
the shareholders and Interim dividend Is authorised when it Is 
approved by the Board of Directors of the Group. 
15. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised only when: 
an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event and 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; 
and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation 
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date c1nd adjusted 
to reflect the current best estimates. 
Further, long term provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. A 
provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present 
value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the 
contract and the expected net cost of continuing with tile 
contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with 
that contract. 
Contingent liability is disclosed in case of: 
a present obligation arising from past events, when It is not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation; and 
a present obligation arising from past events, when no 
reliable estimate is possible. 
Contingent Assets: 
Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements 
16. Commitments 
Commitments are future liabilities for contractual expenditure. 
classified and disclosed as follows: 
estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed 
on capital account and not provided for; 
uncalled liability on loan sanctioned and on investments 
partly paid; and 
Other non-cancellable commitments, if any, to the extent 
they are considered material and relevant in the opinion of 
management. 
17. Contingent Uabllitles 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation U1aI arises from 
past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation 
that is not recognized because it Is not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be ,·equlred to sellle the obllgatlon. 
The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but 
discloses Its existence In the consolidated financial 
statements. Payments In respect of such llablllties, if any are 
shown as advances. 
18. Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net 
profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the 
determination of basic earnings per share to take into 
account. 
The after income tax effect of interest and other financing 
costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares, and 
Weighted average number of equity shares that would 
have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all the 
dirutive potential equity. 
19. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with 
banks. Cash equivalents are shortterm balances (wlt11 an 
original maturity of three months or less from the date of 
acquisition), and highly llquld lime deposits that are readily 
convertible Into known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to insignificant risk of changes In value. 
20. Employee Benefits 
Short term employee benefits 
Employee benefits falling due wholly within twelve months of 
rendering the service are classified as short term employee 
benefits and are expensed In the period In which the 
employee renders the related service. Llabilltles recognised In 
respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the 
undlscounted amount or the benefits expected to be paid In 
exchange for the related service. 
Long Term employee benefits 
Group's net obllgallon In respect or long-term employee 
benefits Is the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned In return for their service in the current and pr1or 
periods. Long-term employee benefit primarily consists of 
Leave encashment benefits wherein employees are entitled to 
accumulate leave subject to certain limits for future 
encashment/ava!lment Long-term compensated absences are 
provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuaUon at the end of

(Continued .. ) 
each financial year using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) Method. 
Actuarial gains/losses, If any. are recognised Immediately in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Post-employment benefits 
a.) Defined contribution Plans 
Provident fund: Contributions as required unaer the statute, 
made to the Provident Fund (Defined Contribution Plan) are 
recognised Immediately In the Statement of Prom and Loss. 
There Is no obligation other U1an the monthly contribution 
payable to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner. 
ESIC and Labour welfare fund: The Group's contribution 
paid/payable during the year to Employee state Insurance 
scheme and Labour welfare fund are recognised In the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
b.) Defined Benefit Plans 
Gratuity liability Is defined benefit obligation and Is provided 
on the basis of an actuarial valuation performed by an 
Independent actuary based on projected unit credit method, 
at the end of each financial year. 
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: 
I) Service cost (Including current service cost, past service 
cost, as well as gains and losses on cunallments and 
settlemellls) 
II) Net Interest expense or Income 
Iii) Re-measurement 
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability, which 
comprise actuarial gains and losses. the return on plan assets 
(excluding Interest) and the effect of the asset celling {If any, 
excluding Interest), are recognised In OCI, net of taxes. The 
Group determines the net interest expense (Income) on the 
net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying 
the discount rate used to measure the defined benefll 
obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net 
defined benefit liability (asset), taking Into account any 
changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the 
period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net 
Interest expense and other expenses ,elated to defined 
benefit plans are recognised in Statement of Profit and loss. 
The Groups net obligation In respect of gratuity (defined

21. Share-based Payments 
The cost of equity settled transactions is determined by the 
fair value at the grant date. The fair value of the employee 
share options is based on the Black Scholes model. 
The grant-date fair value of equlty-setued sha,e-based 
payment granted to employees is recognized as an expense, 
with a corresponding Increase In equity. over the vesting 
period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense 
is adjusted to reflect the number of awards fo, which the 
related service and non-market performance conditions are 
expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately 
recognized Is based on the number of awards that meet the 
related service and non-market performance conditions at the 
vesting date. For share-based payment awards wrth market 
pertormance conditions and non-vesting conditions. the grant-
date fair value or the share-based payment Is measured to 
reflect such conditions and the,e Is no true-up ror differences 
between expected and actual outcomes.

transactions, where the Company grants stock options to the 
employees of lls subsidiaries, the transactions are accounted

each or the Group's cash generating units (CGU) that rs 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
A CGU to which goodwill has been allocated Is tested ror 
Impairment annually, or more frequently when there Is an 
Indication that the unit may be Impaired, if the recoverable 
amount of the CGU Is less than Its carrying amount, the 
Impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
or any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets or the units pro-rata based on the carrying amount of 
each asset In the unit, any impairment loss or goodwill ls not 
reversed In subsequent period. 
On disposal of relevant CGU the attributab1e amount of

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of 
the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method {present value of the defined benefit 
obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when 
calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet. 
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

Risk Exposure 
(fin lakhs) 
Through Its defined benem plans. the Company Is exposed to a number of risks. the most significant of which are detailed: 
Investment risk 
Interest risk 
Asset liability 
matching risk 
Moratlllty risk 
Concentration risk 
Salary risk 
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate 
which Is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
government bonds. If the return on plan asset IS below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. 
Currently, for the plan In India, it has a relatively balanced mix of Investments in 
government securities. and other debt instruments. 
A fall In the discount rate which Is linked to the G.Sec. Rate will Increase the present value 
of the liability requiring higher provision. A fail in the discount rate generally increases the 
mark to market value of the assets depending on the dur<1tion of asset 
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan Is Invested In lines 
of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk 
Since the benefits under the plan Is not payable ror life time and payable till retirement age 
only, plan does not have any longevity risk. 
Plan Is having a concentration risk as all the assets are Invested with the Insurance entity 
and a default wlll wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as 
Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines 
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability Is calculated by reference to the 
future salaries of members. As such. an Increase ln the salary of the membE!fs more than 
assumed level wilt increase the plan's liability.

The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The 
Group's policy is to keep balance between its borrowings at fixed rates of interest. The difference between fixed and variable 
rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.

enable e-voting to all the demat account holders, by way of a 
single login credential, through their demat accounts/ 
websites of Depositories/ Depository Participants. Demat 
account holders would be able to cast their vote without 
having to register again with the ESPs, thereby, not only
