and Energy 
Strategy
Opportunity
DICABS offers a diverse range of eco-friendly 
solar energy solutions in the domestic 
market, underscoring our commitment to 
sustainability. Our innovative power cables, 
and electron-beam irradiated cables cater to 
the growing global demand for sustainable 
products, driven by increasing consumer 
awareness of environmental issues.
We are going to increase our supply voltage 
from 11 KV to 66 KV, the system will become 
more energy efficient, reducing the need 
for excess electricity generation, fossil fuel 
consumption , and greenhouse gas emissions-
ultimately lowering the carbon foot print.
We are switching from boiler based XLPE 
curing to hot water generator curing. This 
improves energy efficiency, reduces fossil fuel 
consumption, minimizes water wastage – 
resulting in a lower overall carbon footprint for 
XLPE cable manufacturing.
We are increasing power cable production 
through CCV lines. This helps lower energy 
use , reduce fossil fuel dependence, minimize 
waste and optimize efficiency , all of which 
contribute to a lower carbon foot print.
Through advanced technology, we empower 
our customers and collaborate to combat 
climate change while enhancing energy 
efficiency. This transition to renewable energy 
reflects our dedication to environmental 
responsibility and green initiatives, ensuring 
the long-term sustainability of our business.

At Nation Building, our core purpose is to drive India’s economic growth in a way that directly enhances the wellbeing of its citizens. We 
achieve this by strategically investing in businesses that act as engines of national development.
We are deeply committed to embedding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into every facet of our operations. 
These principles are not just responsibilities — they are integral to our identity. By aligning our business with ESG values, we strengthen 
organizational resilience, foster a culture of responsibility, and create sustainable, long-term value. This approach enables us to proactively 
identify opportunities, manage risks, and safeguard the interests of all stakeholders. Our business inherently contributes to climate change 
mitigation, but our impact extends much further. Our initiatives bring about transformative change by generating local employment and 
building robust local supply chains, thereby accelerating regional economic development and promoting inclusive, sustainable growth. 
Beyond economic impact, we drive meaningful social change through focused programs in healthcare, education, women’s empowerment, 
water conservation, and community infrastructure. Strong governance underpins our leadership in ESG. It ensures accountability, 
transparency, and ethical conduct — the foundation upon which we continue to build a resilient and responsible future.
