To minimise the environmental impact, ICRA adopts a range of sustainable 
practices aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and promoting the well-being 
of individuals and the environment. Energy-efficient LED lighting is installed 
in common areas to reduce electricity consumption and operational costs. In 
locations with poor air quality, air purifiers have been deployed to mitigate the 
spread of airborne bacteria and viruses, thereby ensuring a healthier indoor 
environment for employees. 
To conserve water, automatic sensor-based faucets have been installed 
across office premises. In line with our commitment to reducing single-
use plastics, glass bottles have replaced plastic ones, offering a reusable, 
washable, and sterilisable alternative that prioritises employee safety. 
Additionally, indoor plants have been introduced to enhance air quality and 
contribute to a more sustainable and pleasant workplace environment.

3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of 
life, for
	
(a)	
Plastics (including packaging): Minimization and Reuse: Efforts are made to minimize the use of plastic 
packaging materials. Where used, materials are reused internally wherever feasible. Recycling: Segregated 
plastic waste is collected and handed over to authorized recyclers to ensure proper recycling and prevent 
landfill accumulation. Awareness: Posters and training modules encourage employees to reduce single-use 
plastics and adopt sustainable alternatives.
	
(b)	 E-waste: Safe Disposal: Obsolete electronic equipment, including computers, printers, and accessories, 
is disposed of through certified e-waste recyclers in compliance with applicable regulations. Battery 
Management: UPS and other batteries are responsibly disposed of to mitigate environmental hazards. 
Tracking: E-waste disposal is documented and tracked to ensure transparency and compliance.
	
(c)	
Hazardous waste (Identification and Handling): Although minimal, any hazardous waste (e.g., batteries, 
cleaning agents) is identified and handled with care. Authorized Disposal: Such waste is handed over to 
authorized hazardous waste handlers to ensure safe and compliant disposal. Employee Training: Awareness 
programs include guidance on identifying and safely managing hazardous materials.
	
(d)	 Other waste: Segregation at Source: Waste is segregated into biodegradable and non-biodegradable 
categories at all office locations. Recycling and Composting: Recyclables are sent to appropriate facilities, and 
biodegradable waste is managed through composting where feasible. Reduction Initiatives: Initiatives to reduce 
paper usage and promote digital work-flows have led to a measurable decline in overall waste generation.
	
Key awareness initiatives undertaken include:
	y Launch of an online training course on Environmental Sustainability and Health & Safety for employees, aimed at 
fostering a healthy, productive, and environmentally-conscious workforce.
	y Display of awareness posters across all office locations, highlighting actionable steps to reduce individual and 
organisational carbon footprints.
	y Environmentally responsible disposal of UPS batteries to mitigate potential environmental hazards.
	y Implementation of waste segregation practices, which has contributed to a measurable reduction in overall 
waste generation.
