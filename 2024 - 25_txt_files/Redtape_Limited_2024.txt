Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
Yes, in alignment with our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the company has implemented 
several environmentally responsible and energy-efficient measures. These include the deployment of battery-operated 
material handling equipment to replace conventional fuel-based systems and the successful installation of a 2.17 
MWP solar power plant, which significantly contributes to meeting our operational energy needs through renewable 
sources. 
As a result of these initiatives, the company has recorded a measurable reduction in the consumption of traditional 
hydroelectric power. In addition, diesel generator (DG) sets at our facilities are maintained in strict compliance with 
the emission and noise control standards prescribed by the CPCB. 
Our energy conservation strategy also involves the phased replacement of fluorescent lamps with energy-efficient 
LED lighting across production and utility areas. The architectural design of our shaft floors has been optimized to 
allow maximum natural daylight, thereby reducing reliance on artificial lighting during daytime hours.
