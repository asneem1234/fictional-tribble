26. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to 
environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for 
identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per 
the following format:
S.

Financial

(Indicate  
positive or

1
Customer 
satisfaction
Opportunity
Customer satisfaction presents a 
significant advantage for a retail 
company, offering the potential to foster 
stronger customer relationships, enhance 
brand differentiation in a competitive 
market, and drive revenue growth. By 
prioritising customer engagement 
initiatives, the Company can increase 
sales while solidifying its position in the 
market.
-
Positive
2
Talent and 
workforce
Risk
The retail industry excels in talent 
attraction, diversity, community 
development, and employee 
engagement. It naturally draws talent due 
to its comfortable working environment, 
local recruitment opportunities, and 
competitive wages, although it requires 
significant effort and dedication. With a 
strong focus on diversity and inclusion, 
the industry attracts a higher proportion 
of women employees, supported by 
safe workplaces, reduced commuting 
distances, and a broad geographical 
presence. Retail also plays a vital role in 
local community development by offering 
entry-level jobs with competitive wages, 
enabling individuals, especially in smaller 
towns, to acquire skills and progress to 
better careers. The Company’s emphasis 
on learning and development enhances 
career opportunities and fosters 
employee loyalty, while a culture of open 
communication and an independent 
Ethics Helpline ensure employees can 
voice concerns or provide feedback 
directly to management.
The Company focuses 
on enhancing talent and 
performance management 
to build organisational 
capacity and individual 
capabilities. Dedicated 
teams are established to 
drive growth and ensure 
succession planning for 
critical roles. A structured 
career path framework and 
leadership success profiles 
are developed to guide 
employee advancement. 
Additionally, the Company 
implements continuous 
and consistent long-term 
incentive plans, aligning 
individual achievements 
with organisational goals to 
ensure sustained success.
Negative
3
Sustainable 
Products and 
Services
Opportunity
The rationale for identifying this risk/
opportunity lies in the Company’s 
commitment to minimising 
environmental and social impacts 
throughout the product lifecycle. This 
approach includes curating a portfolio of 
responsibly sourced products, ensuring 
sustainable practices are integrated into 
sourcing, production, and distribution 
processes.

Health, 
Safety Risk 
and Well-
being of 
Employees
Risk
The health, safety, and well-being of 
employees are critical concerns, as they 
face risks associated with high foot traffic, 
potential exposure to infectious diseases, 
and operational accidents. Any lapse in 
addressing these issues could result in 
operational disruptions, diminished trust, 
and potential legal liabilities.
The implementation of a 
comprehensive health and 
safety programme can 
boost employee morale, 
reduce absenteeism, and 
strengthen the store’s 
reputation as a responsible 
employer, ultimately 
attracting both customers 
and talent over the long 
term.
Negative
5
Climate 
Change
Opportunity 
and Risk
Extreme weather events, including rising 
temperatures and shifting weather 
patterns, pose potential risks to business 
operations, causing disruptions and 
impacting supply chain activities. Climate 
change may affect sourcing partners, 
leading to product unavailability and 
increased costs of goods and services. 
Resource availability, particularly water, 
could present additional challenges 
for the Company and its value chain 
partners. Furthermore, the transition to 
a low-carbon economy may result in 
stricter climate regulations, driving higher 
compliance costs and necessitating 
adaptations in business operations.
The value retail industry is 
inherently less resource-
intensive, and our efficient, 
agile operations enable 
us to adjust various cost, 
risk, and business levers 
to mitigate the impacts 
of climate change. In 
line with the country’s 
overall development and 
per capita emissions, we 
have developed a market 
strategy matrix to address 
climate-related risks, 
integrating best practices 
in energy and water 
conservation, sustainable 
building materials, material 
recycling/reuse, and 
transportation efficiency.
Negative
6
Diversity and 
Equal
Opportunity
Opportunity
Diversity within the workforce enhances 
the company’s performance by fostering 
the presence of diverse individuals in 
the workplace. It is equally crucial for an 
organisation to prevent discrimination 
and uphold human rights in such a 
diverse work environment.
-
Positive
7
Business 
Ethics and
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Adopting best practices in corporate 
governance enhances investor 
confidence, strengthens brand 
reputation, and effectively mitigates risks.
-
Positive
8
Business 
Continuity
Risk
Ensuring business continuity is vital 
for the long-term sustainability of any 
organisation. Proactive planning for 
potential disruptions helps mitigate 
risks, maintain operational stability, and 
foster customer trust. By prioritising 
legal compliance, financial stability, 
supply chain efficiency, and employee 
well-being, businesses can build a 
strong brand reputation and secure a 
competitive edge.
The Company’s Business 
Continuity Plan (BCP) 
covers People, Facilities, 
and Critical IT Infrastructure, 
supported by Disaster 
Recovery (DR) sites that are 
periodically tested to ensure 
uninterrupted operations 
and preparedness for 
unforeseen challenges. 
Comprehensive training 
is provided to retail staff, 
managers, and leaders on 
their roles, leadership skills, 
and safety practices to 
uphold business continuity.

At Baazar Style Retail Limited, we actively engage with our value chain 
partners to promote ethical, transparent, and sustainable business 
practices. Regular interactions focus on encouraging vendors to adopt 
economically viable and environmentally responsible practices. We share 
industry best practices to help partners implement robust governance 
policies, reduce environmental impact, and enhance social equity. As our 
business primarily involves sourcing everyday products from reputable 
brands, many of our partners independently drive sustainability initiatives 
to refine their processes, products, and policies. Additionally, our year-round 
engagements cover a wide range of topics, including brand expansion, 
supplier evaluations (focusing on parameters like compliance, quality, 
design capability, and speed to market), store readiness, sustainability, 
warehouse efficiency, and fabric quality testing. These efforts collectively 
underscore our commitment to fostering a sustainable and high-
performing supply chain ecosystem.

been implemented to minimise water wastage.
