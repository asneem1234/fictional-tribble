Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a 
comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as 
environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

implications 
of the risk or

(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1.
Emissions &
Pollutants
Risk
As a crane rental service provider, SML’s 
operations involve significant energy use, 
especially during crane operation, which results 
in considerable direct and indirect Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions, such as carbon dioxide 
and methane from fuel consumption. If these 
emissions and related pollutants are not effectively 
managed, they could lead to potential legal and 
environmental risks for the company.
To address this risk, SML is dedicated to 
supporting the clean energy transition 
through a clear environmental policy. 
The company has invested in solar power 
installations and energy-efficient equipment, 
such as advanced air conditioning systems, 
helping to promote renewable energy use 
and conserve energy.
Negative
2.
Improve
Operational
Efficiency
Opportunity Operational efficiency focuses on achieving 
greater output with fewer resources. This involves 
reducing energy consumption, improving output, 
and making better use of equipment. By adopting 
optimisation strategies, companies can not only 
boost profitability but also support long-term 
sustainability goals.
-
Positive
3.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste is commonly produced during company 
operations, machinery maintenance, and 
administrative tasks, posing risks to the 
environment, air quality, climate, and ecosystems.
Improper waste management can endanger
personnel safety and result in substantial fines for 
non-compliance with regulations.
SML has implemented Waste Management 
and IT E-Waste Management Policies to 
support the circular economy. The company 
follows established systems and procedures 
to ensure responsible waste disposal, 
adhering to best practices and standards 
with a strong focus on sustainability.
Negative
4.
Climate Risk 
and Adaption
Risk
Climate change presents both physical risks, like 
floods and wildfires, and transitional risks, such as 
the introduction of mandatory renewable energy 
regulations. These factors can affect business 
operations, making it essential to evaluate and 
address these risks proactively.
Although our company has not currently 
identified any climate-related risks, we 
are proactively monitoring changes in 
environmental conditions and regulations. 
This ongoing vigilance ensures we remain 
informed and ready to respond to any future 
climate risks that may arise.
Negative
5.
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity The Circular Economy approach encourages the 
reuse, refurbishment, and recycling of materials 
and products. Moving towards this model will 
lead to changes in how buildings are designed and 
the types of materials used. Evolving regulations, 
changing market demands, and advancements 
in technology can help lower costs and drive 
efficiency.

Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk
In an industry that handles high-value projects, 
maintaining customer satisfaction is crucial. Poor 
customer experiences can threaten business 
continuity, whereas delivering a positive 
experience can boost profitability and strengthen 
the company’s brand reputation.
At SML, maintaining high service quality is 
our top priority. We have a clear escalation 
process to quickly address customer 
concerns and provide timely solutions. The 
company commits to delivering cranes to 
job sites on schedule and uses a strong 
monitoring system to ensure smooth 
operations. Our dedication has earned us 
numerous Certificates of Appreciation from 
customers for timely project completion 
and strict adherence to Health, Safety, and 
Environment (HSE) standards.
Negative
7.
Operational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Operations involve substantial manual labor 
for tasks like maintenance, repairs, and on-site 
activities, often in environments with heavy 
machinery and powered equipment. This increases 
the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities - 
especially among temporary workers who may 
lack sufficient training or experience. Failing to 
ensure proper health and safety measures can 
lead to fines, legal liabilities, and regulatory 
actions. Serious incidents may also cause project 
delays and downtime, raising costs and reducing 
overall profitability.
SML prioritises Employee Health and Safety 
(EHS) by upholding top Occupational Health 
and Safety (OHS) standards. As an ISO 45001 
certified organization, we have a dedicated 
EHS team that actively manages safety 
protocols across our offices and job sites. 
Regular training sessions are held to protect 
the well-being of employees and workers. 
Additionally, we organise Safety Week and 
conduct safety workshops throughout 
the year to foster a strong safety culture 
and raise awareness of best practices. 
The company strictly follows all required 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to 
ensure the highest level of health and safety 
for both employees and equipment at work 
sites.
Negative
8.
Employee
Well-being &
Retention
Risk
Higher employee retention rates reflect good
company policies and practices. Conversely, a high 
attrition rate indicates low employee satisfaction, 
which can concern investors. Ensuring employee 
well-being can boost morale and reduce hiring and 
onboarding costs.
SML is committed to the holistic growth 
of its employees through strong people-
focused practices. We focus on health and 
wellness initiatives, fair compensation, equal 
opportunities, and comprehensive training 
programs. Our performance appraisals 
and promotion processes aim to support 
employee retention. Moreover, we organise 
various activities, including annual sports 
events, festival celebrations, trekking 
trips, health check-ups, and 9.learning and 
development sessions, to create a positive 
and engaging workplace culture.
Negative
9.
Labour
Management
Risk
For businesses that rely on on-site workers, strong 
labour management practices are essential. This 
involves handling the complexities of workforce 
size, labour intensity, and various operational 
locations, while also strengthening communication 
between management and workers, protecting 
worker rights, and encouraging engagement. 
The loss of skilled labour, in particular, can create 
significant operational risks.
The company has strong labour 
management systems in place, featuring 
clear job descriptions and regular training 
sessions. We promote a positive work 
environment, prioritise employee well-
being, and ensure open communication 
channels to quickly address any concerns.

(Indicate positive

10.
Diversity &
Inclusion
Opportunity A strong focus on diversity and inclusion indicates 
that employees feel a sense of belonging and 
fairness within the organisation. Enhancing 
these practices allows companies to better 
support underrepresented groups, which in 
turn strengthens their reputation within the 
community.
The company plans to develop and 
implement strategies aimed at enhancing 
diversity and inclusion.
Positive
11.
Human
Rights
Risk
Companies that prioritise human rights show their 
dedication to fostering sustainable and positive 
relationships with all stakeholders affected by their 
operations - such as customers, communities, 
employees, and investors. This reflects a genuine 
commitment to the well-being of the people they 
interact with.
At SML, respecting human dignity is a core 
value. We are committed to providing 
equal opportunities, enforcing strict 
policies against sexual harassment, banning 
child and forced labour, and following a 
comprehensive code of conduct. These 
principles help us maintain full compliance 
with human rights standards across all our 
operations.
Negative
12.
Customer
Information
And Privacy
Protection
Risk
Companies are evaluated on factors such as 
the volume of personal data they gather, their 
exposure to changing or stricter privacy laws, their 
risk of data breaches, and how well their data 
protection measures perform.
SML values and safeguards customer 
data privacy. We have established a clear 
privacy policy and strong systems to protect 
customer information effectively.
Negative
13.
Corporate
Governance
Risk
Businesses are evaluated on their performance 
in key governance areas, including ownership 
structure, board compensation, accounting 
standards, business ethics, and tax transparency. 
This assessment looks at how a company’s 
governance and ethical practices impact its 
shareholders and other investors.
SML is committed to strict adherence to all 
relevant laws and regulations, with robust 
systems in place to monitor
regulatory compliance. We conduct our 
business ethically, transparently, and with
accountability, striking a balance between 
the interests of our shareholders and 
stakeholders. Our senior management
conducts regular reviews to ensure 
compliance and uphold these principles.
Negative
14.
Business
Ethics And
Compliance
Risk
Important business ethics concerns include 
fraud, executive wrongdoing, corruption, 
money laundering, and anti-trust breaches. 
Violations of ethical standards can result in police 
investigations, large fines, settlement expenses, 
and harm to the company’s reputation.
SML has put in place an Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption Policy, supported by a 
strong Vigil Mechanism and Whistleblower 
policy. Management regularly reviews these 
measures to maintain a firm commitment to 
preventing bribery and corruption.

achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
 
 At Sanghvi Movers Limited, we are deeply committed to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. We firmly 
believe that responsible business conduct is essential for generating long-term value for all stakeholders. This commitment 
is demonstrated through the policies and actions we have adopted to minimise our environmental footprint and support 
sustainable development.
 
 As we expand our operations, we continue to prioritise environmental stewardship, societal wellbeing, and transparent 
governance. Sustainability is integrated into our business strategy, and we view ESG as a key enabler of long-term value creation.
 
 We aim to maintain full transparency in our disclosures and believe that our ESG efforts are central to fulfilling our purpose 
of creating meaningful impact. Our environmental initiatives focus on energy efficiency, emission reduction, and responsible 
resource usage. A notable step towards clean energy is the installation of a 120-kilowatt solar power system, marking our 
commitment to a greener future.
 
 We also support the renewable energy sector by supplying cranes for wind farm construction and are actively expanding into the 
Wind Power EPC segment. In addition, we promote green infrastructure through regular tree plantation drives, having planted 
over 3,000 trees as of 31 March 2025.
 
 The health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees remain a top priority. We have implemented multiple initiatives to ensure a 
safe and healthy work environment. On the governance front, we uphold strong ethical standards and transparency in all aspects 
of our business.
 
 Our operations across the value chain are conducted in an ethical, responsible, and sustainable manner. We believe ESG 
considerations are integral to our long-term growth, and through collective efforts, we aim to contribute to a sustainable and 
inclusive future.

protocols by investigating incidents and near-miss reports. For non-routine tasks, we take additional precautions with a

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
 SML is committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from discrimination and harassment. Our Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH) Policy clearly outlines procedures for reporting incidents of sexual harassment and reflects our zero-tolerance 
approach to such behaviour.
 
 The policy applies to employees of all genders and sexual orientations, encouraging them to raise concerns without fear of 
retaliation. An Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is in place to ensure fair, confidential, and impartial investigations, protecting 
the rights of both the complainant and the accused. The ICC also recommends appropriate disciplinary actions and support 
measures to address and remedy any harm caused.
 
 Through this robust framework, SML fosters a respectful, inclusive, and safe work environment where all employees feel 
supported and empowered to speak up.
