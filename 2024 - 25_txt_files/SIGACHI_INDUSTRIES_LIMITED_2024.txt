(Indicate 
positive or

implications)
1.
Energy 
and 
Emissions 
Manage-
ment
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
As a pharmaceutical manufacturing 
company, 
our 
operations 
are 
energy-intensive 
and 
contribute 
to 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
Effective 
energy 
and 
emissions 
management is critical for ensuring 
regulatory compliance in India and 
global markets such as the EU, while also 
reducing production costs and improving 
process efficiency.
Opportunity: 
Implementing 
energy-efficient 
technologies and reducing emissions 
can lower operational costs, enhance 
compliance, and improve our brand 
image. It also opens possibilities for 
incentives and grants for sustainable 
practices.
Approach: 
We are in the process of exploring 
energy-efficient technologies and 
targeted emission reduction strategies 
across our manufacturing units, 
operations, and facilities. These initiatives 
are designed to significantly lower 
our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
while enhancing overall operational 
efficiency. By adopting advanced energy 
management systems and optimizing 
process-level energy consumption, 
we aim to reduce our carbon footprint 
and transition toward more sustainable 
production practices.
Goals: 
Reduce Energy Consumption Intensity 
by 20% by 2030.
Reduce Coal Consumption Intensity by 
20% by 2026 and 30% by 2030.
Risk: Negative 
(higher costs, 
regulatory 
penalties if 
unmanaged)
Opportunity: 
Positive (cost 
savings, 
incentives, brand 
value)
2.
Water 
Manage-
ment
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Water scarcity, regulatory pressure, and 
improper water disposal can lead to 
operational disruptions, penalties, and 
reputational harm.
Opportunity: 
Efficient water usage, recycling, and 
responsible water management reduces 
costs and enhance brand credibility.
Approach: 
1)	 The Company is deeply committed 
to minimizing its environmental 
footprint through strategic and 
sustainable 
water 
management 
practices.
2)	 To 
support 
this 
commitment, 
Sigachi 
has 
a 
well-established 
water 
treatment 
infrastructure 
across all its facilities, comprising 
Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP), 
Sewage Treatment Plants (STP), and 
Mechanical Vapour Recompression 
(MVRE) systems. These systems are 
further enhanced by the integration 
of Reverse Osmosis (RO) Recovery 
Systems, enabling the effective 
treatment and reuse of effluents.
Goals: 30% Reduction in Freshwater 
Consumption Intensity by 2032.
10% Increase in Amount of Water 
Recycled by 2028.
Risk: Negative 
(operational 
downtime, 
non-compliance 
costs)
Opportunity: 
Positive 
(cost savings, 
sustainable 
credentials)
3. 
Waste 
Manage-
ment
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Inadequate 
waste 
management 
may cause environmental pollution, 
regulatory violations, legal penalties, 
and deterioration of trust within the 
community. 
It 
also 
contributes 
to 
inefficiencies and increased disposal 
costs.
Opportunity:
Effective waste management can lower 
disposal costs, extract value from waste, 
enhance the company’s environmental 
reputation, 
and 
promote 
circular 
economy practices like recycling and 
waste-to-energy initiatives.
Source-level segregation of hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste is done at the 
sites. 
The company ensures that hazardous 
and 
non-hazardous 
wastes 
are 
meticulously segregated at their source 
and securely stored in dedicated 
segregated areas within its premises. 
These wastes are then responsibly 
dispatched to State Pollution Control 
Board, authorized vendors and recycling 
entities, for sustainable disposal, thereby 
contributing to a robust and sustainable 
waste management system.
Negative – 
Potential fines, 
environmental 
liabilities, and 
increased 
operational costs 
due to non-
compliance and 
inefficiencies.

Ethics
Risk
Risk: 
Corruption, conflicts of interest, and

Approach: 
The Company’s Code of Business Ethics 
and Conduct (COBEC) applies uniformly 
to all Directors and employees across 
its corporate offices, subsidiaries, and 
manufacturing 
facilities. This 
code 
serves as a cornerstone of ethical 
governance, providing a clear framework 
for 
responsible 
decision-making, 
fostering stakeholder confidence, and 
safeguarding the Company’s long-term 
interests.
COBEC mandates strict compliance 
with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and 
legal obligations. The Company has 
institutionalized 
this 
commitment 
through 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
comprehensive Code of Conduct, an 
Anti-Corruption Policy, and a robust 
Whistleblower Mechanism that ensures 
transparency and accountability at all 
levels.
Ethical expectations extend beyond 
internal operations, with all suppliers, 
contractors, 
and 
service 
providers 
required to adhere to formal Supplier 
and Service Provider Codes of Conduct. 
These standards are reinforced through 
regular training programs and internal 
audits, promoting a culture of integrity 
across the value chain.

Opportunity
Opportunity:
A diverse, equitable, and inclusive 
workforce 
enhances 
innovation, 
strengthens team performance, and 
enables 
better 
decision-making 
by integrating varied perspectives. 
Inclusive practices also foster employee 
satisfaction, improve retention, and 
enhance the company’s reputation 
among 
stakeholders, 
including 
investors, customers, and future talent.
Sigachi is actively working to embed 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) 
principles across its workforce and 
organizational culture.
The 
Company 
is 
focused 
on 
enhancing gender diversity through 
strategic hiring initiatives, internal 
sensitization programs, and inclusive 
communication practices that foster 
equal opportunity.
Sigachi is in the process of revamping 
its HR policies to promote greater 
inclusion 
of 
underrepresented 
groups—particularly 
women 
and 
persons with disabilities (PWDs)—
across various roles and business 
functions.
Goal: Achieve a 10% increase in 
women’s representation in the total 
workforce compared to the current 
year’s levels.
Ensure an inclusive workforce by 
taking steps to include individuals 
with disabilities.
To build a more inclusive talent 
pipeline, 
the 
Company 
is 
also 
exploring 
non-traditional 
entry 
pathways, such as apprentice hiring 
and targeted recruitment for positions 
where diversity has historically been 
limited.
DEI initiatives are further reinforced 
through ongoing employee awareness 
and training programs, aimed at 
cultivating 
a 
workplace 
that 
is 
respectful, inclusive, and empowering 
for all employees.
Positive – A 
more inclusive 
workplace leads 
to improved 
employee 
engagement, 
reduced 
attrition, 
and greater 
innovation. 
It also 
strengthens the 
employer brand 
and supports 
regulatory, and 
stakeholder 
expectations 
related to social 
performance.

Performance of the 
entity against the specific 
commitments, goals and 
targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
FY25 marks our second year of formal sustainability disclosures, enabling us to build on the 
foundation established in FY24. Our commitments across energy, emissions, water, waste, 
social and government inclusion are now being tracked with greater consistency. 
While overall production volumes rose sharply driving higher absolute energy consumption, 
emissions, and waste generation, our efficiency metrics highlight steady progress toward 
medium- and long-term targets.
Key Performance Outcomes (FY24 vs. FY25):
	y
Energy Efficiency: Energy intensity improved from 22.95 GJ/MTPA in FY24 to 20.93 GJ/
MTPA in FY25, reflecting operational efficiency gains and enhanced energy management 
practices.
	y
Water Stewardship (Revenue Basis): Water intensity per rupee of turnover reduced from 
0.00001746 in FY24 to 0.00001253 in FY25, showing more efficient water use relative to 
economic output.
	y
Water Stewardship (Output Basis): Water intensity in terms of physical output improved 
from 4.07 in FY24 to 2.64 in FY25, underscoring stronger circular practices and reuse 
efforts across facilities.
	y
Emissions: In FY25, Scope 1 and 2 emission intensity per rupee of turnover was recorded 
at 0.00001242, compared to 0.00001014 in FY24. The change is largely linked to increased 
production volumes, higher fuel usage, and variations in the energy mix. While absolute 
emissions rose in line with business growth, the company is strengthening its focus on 
energy efficiency and renewable sourcing to progressively reduce emission intensity over 
time.
Overall Assessment:
The production scale-up, while positive from a business standpoint, resulted in emissions 
and waste generation rising in tandem with production expansion. However, on an intensity 
basis, energy and water efficiency improved significantly, confirming that our sustainability 
strategy is working as intended. The variance in emission intensity highlights the need for 
accelerated decarbonisation efforts, with a focus on advanced energy efficient technologies 
and enhancing process optimisation.
None of our long-term targets are off track. Detailed target-wise disclosures, including 
corrective actions where needed, will be provided in subsequent reporting cycles.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
At Sigachi, we view sustainability not as a compliance requirement, but as a core driver of long-term business resilience. Our efforts 
in FY25 have been guided by the belief that growth and responsibility must go hand in hand... Our key ESG challenges include 
reducing environmental impact and enhancing supply chain sustainability, which we address through various initiatives. We are 
actively investing in advanced energy-efficient technologies, enhancing process optimisation, and embedding best practices 
across our operations. These initiatives are aimed at progressively improving resource efficiency and lowering our environmental 
footprint, without compromising business growth.
	
Looking ahead, we remain committed to strengthening our ESG practices, building safer and more inclusive workplaces, and 
creating shared value for our stakeholders. Our focus is on continuous improvement - learning from challenges, setting higher 
benchmarks, and ensuring that Sigachi contributes meaningfully to a sustainable future.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at  the end of life, for 
(a) 	 Plastics (including packaging) 
	
The recycling and disposal of plastic, including packaging materials, are carried out in full compliance with the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules and applicable central government regulations. Furthermore, all plastic waste is responsibly routed to 
certified vendors authorised by the government for environmentally sound recycling and disposal.
(b) 	 E-waste 
	
E-waste is responsibly managed through partnerships with government-registered recyclers. Efforts are made to ensure proper 
disposal and recycling of end-of-life electronic items, thereby promoting circular practices and minimizing environmental 
impact. 
(c) 	 Hazardous waste 
	
Hazardous waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner by ensuring disposal through vendors authorized 
by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). Hazardous wastes are systematically categorized and appropriately stored in 
specially designated hazardous waste storage areas. These wastes are then disposed of at facilities approved by the Pollution 
Control Board, strictly adhering to regulatory guidelines.
(d) 	 Other waste. 
	
Other non-hazardous waste is systematically collected and sent to authorised recycling partners. This ensures that reusable 
materials are recovered efficiently, contributing to the reduction of landfill burden and reinforcing Sigachi’s commitment to 
sustainable responsible waste management practices.

heads analyse material topics related to the economy, environment, and social aspects. The company identifies material issues

These material issues serve as a guiding framework for the non-financial disclosures through the Corporate Overview, Statutory 
Reports, and Financial Statements in the Annual Report 2023-24. The Sustainability Report adheres to relevant national and 
international guidelines and standards, disclosing the management approach, targets/goals, and non-financial performance in 
the reporting year for each identified material topic.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? (Y/N/NA) If Yes, then provide details.
	
Sigachi is proactively undertaking a range of initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of its sustainability agenda. 
The key focus areas include:
	
Strengthening Energy Data and Emissions Management:
	
Sigachi has been enhancing its data collection on energy consumption across its manufacturing sites as part of its ESG roadmap, 
which is a foundational step towards tracking and managing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions more effectively. While a formal, 
company-wide GHG reduction project is in early stages, these efforts reflect a proactive approach towards sustainability and 
reducing emissions within the pharmaceutical value chain.
	
Promotion of Sustainable Transportation:
	
To reduce transportation-related emissions and promote environmental sustainability, Sigachi prioritizes low-carbon logistics across 
its supply chain. A major share of product shipments is routed via sea transport to minimize emissions. Rail is used where feasible 
for domestic logistics. Air freight is limited to urgent consignments and is consciously avoided due to its high carbon footprint. 
The Company is also exploring the use of electric vehicles and supporting more sustainable public transport solutions to further 
reduce Scope 3 emissions.
	
Investment in Innovation:
	
Sigachi is strengthening its commitment to sustainable innovation by scaling up its R&D capabilities. Plans are underway to 
enhance R&D infrastructure and increase investment in research activities by 30% by FY28, with a focused objective of developing 
environmentally sustainable Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and excipients. This initiative reflects the Company’s 
proactive approach to reducing the environmental footprint of its products and processes while contributing to a more sustainable 
pharmaceutical value chain.
	
These initiatives reflect Sigachi’s strong commitment to climate action and its efforts to drive a low-carbon, sustainable future.

Annexure – Disclosure Regarding the Incident of 30 June 2025
On 30 June 2025, a tragic fire incident occurred at our Hyderabad unit (Pashamylaram facility), leading to loss of lives, injuries, and 
property damage. Immediate actions focused on evacuation, family support, medical care, and regulatory compliance. Insurance and
