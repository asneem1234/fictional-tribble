Our nation's agriculture is at a crossroads—rapidly modernizing, digitizing, 
but also grappling with climate uncertainties and resource limitations. 
Farmers encounter intertwined challenges: declining soil vitality, erratic 
rainfall, fragmented supply chains, and severe income pressures. At 
Dhanuka, we respond by equipping growers and dealers with science-
backed, field-ready knowledge. Our 'Dhanuka Doctors'—1,500 qualified 
agri graduates working across 75,000 villages—demonstrate soil test plans, 
green manures, hybrid seeds, drip or sprinkler irrigation, crop insurance 
schemes, and judicious agrochemical use; they also persuade communities 
to abandon stubble burning, protecting rural air and soil. Our long-term 
view of sustainability is grounded in simplicity—do the right thing for 
people, land, and livelihood. We've adopted the triple bottom 
line—People, Planet, Profit—not as a slogan, but as a filter for our everyday 
decisions. From how we design products to how we train farmers, and how 
we manage water, waste and emissions at our facilities, sustainability is a 
shared responsibility across teams. It is embedded in our manufacturing 
practices, our engagement with partners, and our communication with 
farming communities. We are now working to convert these values into 
measurable ESG targets. While some goals are still being refined, our 
direction is clear: reduce resource use, expand access to safe technologies, 
enhance traceability, and ensure our growth leaves a positive footprint. 
Internally, we're aligning processes to support this transition—setting 
benchmarks, reviewing progress, and encouraging cross functional 
ownership. The journey is iterative, but grounded in intent. Our CSR vision, 
'gaon ka paani, gaon mein; khet ka paani, khet mein', remains core to our 
outreach. Through water conservation drives, school programs, check 
dams, farmer training, and awareness campaigns, we're keeping our 
efforts rooted in local realities. We know impact takes time, but we believe

consistent steps, driven by purpose and participation, create lasting

https://www.dhanuka.com/corporate -governance/key-policies
 
At Dhanuka, integrity is more than a principle; it is a way of working 
that guides every decision we make. We maintain a strict zero-
tolerance approach toward bribery, corruption, and any form of 
unethical conduct, across all levels of the organization. Our Code of 
Conduct reflects this commitment and outlines clear expectations 
around fairness, transparency, and accountability. These values are 
not confined to policy documents; they are communicated through 
appointment letters, regularly reinforced on internal platforms like 
the HRMS portal, and embedded into how teams engage with one 
another and with external partners. We understand that ethical 
business practices must be supported by systems that encourage 
awareness, responsibility, and trust. That's why we have put in place 
strong internal controls, reporting mechanisms, and well-defined 
consequences for any breach of our standards. To ensure employees 
feel safe and supported in raising concerns, we also operate a 
confidential Whistle-blower mechanism giving individuals the 
confidence to speak up, without fear of retaliation or bias. Our 
approach goes beyond ticking compliance boxes. It is rooted in our 
belief that long-term success comes from doing business the right way 
by earning trust, acting fairly, and holding ourselves to the highest 
standards. As we grow and evolve, we remain committed to 
strengthening this foundation and ensuring that ethical conduct is not 
just encouraged, but actively practiced in every part of our 
organization.

We are committed to empowering farmers by promoting modern, sustainable agricultural practices that enhance productivity while 
conserving vital resources like water and energy. Our outreach initiatives focus on continuous engagement and education through close 
collaboration with State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), ICAR institutes, and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), ensuring that farmers across 
India have access to the latest advancements and expert guidance.
To support better crop outcomes, we conduct on-site seed treatment demonstrations using mobile treatment units, bringing 
technology directly to farmers' fields. Our awareness campaign, including the widely recognized jingle “Har Beej ko Suraksha Ka Teeka, 
Jaise Har Bache Ko Polio Ka Teeka,” has even been adopted by the Government of India as part of a national initiative.
We encourage lifelong relationships with the Farmers,  as part of which we started Dhanuka Krishi Mitra Programmes nationwide. 
Our R&D centre in Palwal, Haryana, plays a key role in offering scientific soil testing services, providing farmers with detailed insights into 
soil health and tailored recommendations to support optimal crop planning and long-term sustainability.
We also actively promote the safe and judicious use of agrochemicals. Regular training programs help farmers follow best practices in 
pesticide application, storage, and disposal, ensuring both human and environmental safety.
In response to water scarcity, we advocate for on-farm water conservation measures such as creating small ponds and have supported 
community efforts by constructing check dams in Rajasthan.
Further, we help spread awareness of government support schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). Our field teams 
are equipped to integrate information about the scheme during regular advisory services, field visits, and training sessions, ensuring 
that farmers are informed and prepared to protect their crops.

remains our highest priority in all procurement decisions.

specially review and validate the deduction and deposit of statutory dues 
by our value chain partners. This allows us to identify any discrepancies 
or non-compliance promptly. 
Contractual Obligations: Our contracts with value chain partners 
explicitly outline their responsibility to deduct and deposit statutory 
dues. We ensure that these contractual obligations are well-defined and 
communicated effectively to all parties involved.
Transparency and Documentation: We maintain a transparent and 
organized system for recording and documenting the deduction and 
deposit of statutory dues. This includes proper documentation of 
invoices, receipts, and other relevant financial records.

Audits and Internal Controls: We conduct regular audits and implement 
robust internal controls to verify the accuracy and completeness of 
statutory dues deductions and deposits. This helps us identify and 
rectify any potential issues or irregularities promptly. 
Collaboration and Communication: We maintain open lines of 
communication with our value chain partners, providing guidance and 
support regarding the correct deduction and deposit of statutory dues. 
This collaborative approach ensures that everyone involved is well 
informed and aligned with regulatory requirements.

chain partners, thereby upholding our commitment to compliance and 
legal obligations.

At Udhampur Keshwana and Sanand, the company recycles 100% of sewage treatment 
plant (STP) treated water of which is reused for gardening and floor cleaning. This ensures 
that no treated domestic wastewater is discharged externally, effectively achieving zero 
liquid discharge for this stream. At Udhampur Keshwana and Sanand , the company has 
optimized water usage by installing an orifice in the raw water and seal cooling lines.
At Dahej steam condensate and cooling water drained from reactor jackets are stored in a 
tank and recycled for use in cooling towers. 100% recycling of barometric acidic 
condensate water generated from the graphite ejector, which is reused in the HCl 
scrubber tank, achieving raw water savings and eliminating the need for external 
disposal. At Dahej, 100% of STP treated water is reused for gardening and in hot water 
generators for melting technical materials.
Process optimization, such as adjusting the concentration of HCl and DSS solutions in the 
process scrubber tank, further reduces water usage, thereby decreasing the potential for 
liquid waste generation. The installation of a drip irrigation system in Udhampur's green 
belt area reduces water consumption by 70-80%.
At Keshwana and Udhampur, water level sensors in day tanks automatically turn off 
motors when tanks are full, preventing water wastage and reducing the energy required 
for water treatment, which indirectly supports ZLD by lowering the volume of water 
entering the treatment cycle.
All facilities, including Sanand, Keshwana, Udhampur, and Dahej, have achieved ISO 
14001-2015 (Environmental Management) certification.

voltage to reduce equipment breakdowns. The introduction of a power factor 
panel at Sanand has significantly improved the power factor, enhancing overall 
energy efficiency and reducing electricity consumption. At Udhampur plant, the 
company has optimized energy consumption through process and batch size 
adjustments via an automated control system, which includes control valves and 
Distributed Control System (DCS) monitoring of reactor agitator RPM. The 
interlocking of cooling tower fans with outlet temperatures at Udhampur plant 
93
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
 
 
results in power savings by operating fans only when needed. The installation of 
Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) in motors across Udhampur and Dahej plants, 
including in the CALDAN 4G Binder vessel and DHANUVIT vessel, optimizes motor 
performance, reducing energy consumption by up to 30% in some cases, as VFDs 
adjust motor speed to match operational requirements. At Dahej, modifications in 
the Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) plant eliminated the use of an intermediate 
feed pump, saving 132 KWH per day and approximately 11,000 KWH in FY 2024-
25, directly contributing to reduced GHG emissions. At the Keshwana and Sanand 
plants, solar power installations of 243 KW and 225 KW, respectively. At the 
Udhampur plant, the company has implemented plant boundary area lighting 
automation through the installation of time switches, controlling 42 lights of 
120W each. This initiative has eliminated manual intervention and reduced power 
wastage, saving approximately 2.5 KWH per day, totalling 450 KWH annually. 
Further, the modification of electrical lighting power circuits and the installation of 
occupancy sensor-based lighting arrangements across all plant areas at 
Udhampur have resulted in electrical power savings of 338 KWH per day, 
amounting to 1,690 KWH from November 2024 to March 2025. At the Keshwana 
and Sanand plants, all the mercury based lamps were replaced by LED lights. The 
replacement of non-star-rated air conditioners with 5-star-rated units at Dahej. 
The company’s adherence to ISO 9001-2015 (Quality Management), ISO 14001-
2015 (Environmental Management), and ISO 45001-2018 (Occupational Health 
and Safety) certifications across all facilities ensures that environmental 
management systems are in place to monitor and reduce emissions, including 
GHG emissions, through structured processes.

The company has implemented a comprehensive array of waste management 
practices across its facilities, focusing on recycling, reuse, and waste 
minimization to enhance sustainability and reduce environmental impact. At 
the Udhampur plant, one standout initiative is the recycling of 100% of sewage 
treatment plant (STP) treated water, amounting to 4,766 KL annually, which is 
reused for gardening and floor cleaning. At Udhampur plant100% of barometric 
acidic condensate water is recycled from the graphite ejector in the HCl 
scrubber tank, achieving raw water savings and eliminating the need for 
disposal of this by-product. 9.9 MT of dry and liquid food waste is converted into 
3.0 MT of fertilizer for horticulture annually at Udhampur. At the Dahej plant, 
100% of STP treated water is reused for gardening and in hot water generators 
to melt RedHot™ technology ensures efficient heat utilization by recycling hot 
water drained from vessels into cooling towers, while paperless office practices 
at Sanand and Dahej reduce paper waste through minimized printouts and 
regular monitoring of consumption.
At Dahej the installation of a drip irrigation system in the green belt area has 
reduced water consumption by 70-80%, contributing to both water 
conservation and a decrease in wastewater output. This efficient irrigation 
method minimizes excess water use, which in turn reduces the volume of runoff 
that could carry pollutants or require treatment. The company also optimizes 
effluent treatment processes, as seen at Dahej, where Aeration Tank No.2 
(equipped with a 45 HP motor and variable frequency drive) replaced Aeration 
Tank No.1 (60 HP motor), saving 57,166 KWH of power in 2024-25 while 
maintaining effective treatment of low total dissolved solids (LTDS) effluent. STP 
sludge at Dahej is reused to cultivate microorganisms in aeration tanks for LTDS 
effluent treatment, reducing the need for external disposal and enhancing 
biological treatment efficiency. At Dahej, the solvent distillation system (FFE) for 
N-Hexane improves solvent recovery, decreasing the need for fresh solvent 
inputs and minimizing hazardous waste generation.
