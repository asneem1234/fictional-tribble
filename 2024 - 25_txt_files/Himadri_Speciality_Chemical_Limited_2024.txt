Group level objectives/KPIs to drive our Net-Zero 2050 
vision are
 
 
Reduce energy intensity/Mt of product sold by 10% 
by 2025 against baseline (2021)
 
 
Reduce Scope 1&2 CO2e emission intensity/Mt of 
product sold by 25% by 2025 against baseline (2021)
 
 
Reduce Scope 3 CO2e emission intensity/Mt of 
product sold by 5% by 2025 against baseline (2023)
Apart from the regulatory requirement, Himadri always 
recalibrate its efforts to push further its ambitions once 
a landmark is achieved. During the reporting year, all our 
group level targets are achieved with help of strategic 
guidance from the leadership and efforts made by our 
employees and workers .
As mandated by our comprehensive Energy Management 
framework, energy audit is to be conducted in every three 
years by engaging independent external third party. 
Additionally, our in house energy managers regularly 
conduct energy review as per instructions from Bureau of 
Energy Efficiency (BEE), Government of India. Moreover, 
GHG calculations/ Carbon accounting takes place every 
year by engaging external third party and internal team. 
GHG accounting data are subsequently verified by 
another independent third party verifier.
Aligning with the outcome of energy audit, we have 
begun implementation of digital energy management 
system at Carbon Black Division, Mahistikry location. We 
have installed Smart Comm software by L&T Electrical 
and Automation for energy management system. In 
Carbon Black Division, new smart meters are installed in 
generating unit and different Process distribution section 
and sub section to monitor auxiliary power consumption 
trend in different sections. Specific energy consumptions 
at different processes and sections can be easily analysed 
with the installed system.
Himadri has replaced the conventional fuel oil heating 
system with a steam heating system in its new 480Ton per 
day Coal Tar Distillation project. By switching to steam 
energy, the company benefits from improved heating 
performance, potentially lower energy costs, reduced 
GHG emissions, lower maintenance requirements.
Himadri has undertaken strategic initiatives to reduce 
energy 
consumption 
by 
implementing 
sustainable 
solutions across its operations.
Glimpse of capex undertaken in FY 24-25 to 
advance environmental stewardship
Reclaiming Waste Heat from Line #3 Secondary APH:
Previously, hot air (around 350°C) from our Line #3 
process was being released into the atmosphere. 
This waste heat stored valuable energy that could 
support our boiler operations. Following energy audit 
recommendations, we installed a duct to redirect this hot 
air into Boiler #3. This reduced the reliance on ambient 
air (~30°C), improving boiler efficiency and reducing fuel 
consumption. Steam generation increased from 69.14 to 
73.86 TPH using the same amount of fuel. The use of hot 
air also replaced diesel during maintenance and lowered 
the power demand of the fans. This initiative saved over 
9,559 MWh of energy annually and cut approximately 
4,588 tons of CO2 emissions.
Smarter Control of Boiler Feed Pumps Using VFDs:
Our boiler feed pump was previously delivering more 
pressure than necessary, leading to energy losses. To 
address this, we implemented an advanced control 
system that adjusts pump speed based on real-time 
demand. Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) were added 
to fine-tune the pump’s output. This optimization reduced 
the discharge pressure from 81 to 75 kg/cm2, bringing it 
closer to the actual requirement. As a result, the system’s 
energy use decreased by 204 MWh per year, and 98 
tons of CO2 emissions were reduced, enhancing both 
efficiency and environmental performance.
Optimizing CO Pump Pressure with Impeller De-staging:
Some of our CO pumps were producing more pressure 
than required, causing unnecessary energy use and

system wear. Instead of installing electronic controls, we 
applied a mechanical solution: removing two impeller 
stages from the pump. This reduced the discharge 
pressure to a more suitable 35 kg/cm2 and eliminated 
excess recirculation. The change lowered the pump’s 
energy consumption from 109 to 84 kWh, resulting in 
annual energy savings of 213 MWh and a CO2 emissions 
reduction of about 102 tons.
Sealing Leaks in the Compressed Air System:
A detailed survey revealed that 12.5% of our compressed air 
was being lost through undetected leaks. Using ultrasonic 
equipment, we identified and sealed these leaks, reducing 
overall air loss to 9.8%. This action recovered around 202.7 
CMH of compressed air and improved system efficiency. 
The improvement translated into an annual energy saving 
of 177.6 MWh and a reduction of 85 tons of CO2 emissions. 
This simple yet effective measure helped optimize one of 
our most energy-intensive utilities.
Installing Zero-Loss Drains in the Compressed Air 
System:
Earlier our air drainage system operated on a timer, 
releasing compressed air every minute regardless of 
actual need. This led to continuous loss of air and energy. 
We replaced these with zero-loss drains that only activate 
when moisture is present. This upgrade was implemented 
on both the 6-bar and 12-bar compressor lines. Together, 
the systems saved 320 MWh of energy per year and 
reduced 147 tons of CO2 emissions, all through a simple 
automation improvement.
Water Management
Himadri continues to focus on established water 
management initiatives, including monitoring water 
stress levels across relevant sites. Adequate water 
availability for cooling and production processes is 
essential. Himadri implemented regular analyses of short, 
medium and long-term water risks across sites. During 
the reporting period, Himadri widened its water stress 
assessments to encompass a comprehensive evaluation 
of water related risks. Himadri is committed to sustainable 
water management, adopting advanced technologies 
and practices to reduce freshwater consumption, recycle 
wastewater and mitigate environmental impact. 
Water risk analysis and reduction goals: Himadri utilises 
the WRI Aqueduct tool to analyse physical risks such as 
water stress, flooding and water quality. The Company 
conducts water risk assessments based on water basins 
and site-specific water use. With a goal to reduce specific 
freshwater intake by 20% relative to production volume 
between 2021 and 2026, Himadri has implemented 
various measures across its production sites.  All Himadri 
plants employ Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) technology 
through an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) integrated 
with a Water Recovery Plant (WRP). This system ensures 
wastewater recycling and efficient reuse, significantly 
reducing groundwater consumption. 
We also aim at enhancing water efficiency, by adhering 
to the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)
with advanced water-saving technologies for improved 
water management. We will align with the National 
Water Mission by monitoring and minimizing water 
withdrawal and consumption. Additionally, the purpose 
of this framework is to outline the procedures and 
responsibilities for monitoring and managing waste water 
quality at Himadri. The objectives are to: 
 
 
Achieve and exceed Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
objectives. 
 
 
Reduce the intensity of fresh ground water 
withdrawal by 20% by 2026 against baseline (2021). 
 
 
Reduce daily water consumption by 20% by 2026 
against baseline (2021)
 
 
Enhance capabilities to recycle and repurpose water 
resources, ensuring a minimal ecological footprint. 
 
 
Maintain consistent and transparent disclosure 
of advancements to uphold accountability and 
stakeholder 
trust. 
Himadri 
is 
committed 
to 
environmental 
sustainability 
with 
Zero 
Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) through the comprehensive reuse 
of wastewater from our processes. Our advanced 
Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and Water Recovery 
Plant (WRP) are pivotal in this endeavor.
As mandated by our comprehensive Water Management 
framework, water audit including water withdrawal, water 
consumption and waste, is to be conducted in every three 
years by engaging independent external third party. 
Additionally, our in house internal auditors regularly 
conduct water withdrawal and consumption review as 
per instructions from Ministry of Jalshakti, Government 
of India. Moreover, water conservation projects and their 
impact is monitored every year by engaging external 
third party and internal team. Water management data 
are subsequently verified by another independent third 
party verifier.
At Himadri, we have implemented an efficient condensate 
recovery system, which enables operation to recover 60% 
of the low-pressure (LP) steam used in all equipment, 
line tracing and coils. Through an efficient vapour trap 
system, we condense water from LP vapour, effectively 
reducing our groundwater usage.

Responsible Consumption
Himadri’s efforts to reduce production waste are guided 
by a principle: Avoid Waste. If avoidance is not possible, 
waste should be recycled or used in energy generation. 
If recycling or energy generation is not feasible, waste 
should be disposed safely. The need to establish high-
level circular economies that support sustainable 
economic growth is increasingly critical. Given the 
planet’s finite resources, rising lifestyle standards and 
growing resources demand on account of a rising global 
population, conventional one-way economic models will 
no longer be able to sustain prosperous lifestyles and 
cultures going ahead. To stimulate economic activity and 
move to a decarbonised society, it will be essential to 
reduce the use of fossil-based plastics while addressing 
a growing demand for plastics. In this context, Himadri 
acknowledges the growing importance of reducing 
plastic consumption and enhancing recycling. In addition 
to plastics and hazardous waste, Himadri’s waste 
management initiatives encompass a wide range of Key 
Performance Indicators (detailed below).
 
 
Achieve <1% waste to landfill intensity by 2026 
against baseline (2021)
 
 
Increase the use of non- virgin raw materials sourced 
externally to over 95% in production processes
 
 
Ensure 100% compliance with regulators
Process optimisation is central to Himadri. This includes 
processing of substance streams and the application of 
the 3R principle (reduce, reuse, recycle) across operational 
sites. Where waste cannot be avoided, the focus is 
on mechanical or thermal reprocessing. At Himadri’s 
sites, various types of recyclable waste — plastics, 
glass, paper, food waste, and wood—are segregated 
and dispatched to external recycling firms approved by 
regional pollution control boards. The Company monitors 
Water Intensity 
these firms through audits to ensure their corresponding 
compliance with statutory provisions. Himadri adheres 
to the recommendations of state government waste 
management authorities related to handling hazardous 
wastes like effluent sludge, oil-contaminated gloves, jute 
and soak sand. It employs vendors authorised by the 
pollution control boards. The Company reintroduced 
recycled products as inputs following the end-of-life 
phase of its products. Himadri leverages the benefit of 
integrated production sites and systems for systematic 
waste management. Byproducts from one production 
process are repurposed as raw materials of other 
products, widening the value chain. The Company sources 
raw materials from other sectorial by-products (coal tar 
and carbon black feedstock). In addition to reprocessing, 
waste with high calorific value (substitute fuel) is used 
to produce energy, reducing a reliance on primary fossil 
fuels and moderating Company’s carbon footprint.
In the context of a circular economy, using Anthracene 
oil derived from coal tar as a feedstock for carbon black 
production is an innovative and sustainable approach 
that significantly contributes to resource efficiency and 
environmental sustainability. Coal tar, a by-product of 
coal processing, contains a variety of valuable chemical 
compounds, 
including 
Anthracene 
oil. 
Traditionally, 
Anthracene oil had Limited scope industrially or got 
disposed of, contributing to environmental pollution. By 
redirecting Anthracene oil into the carbon black production 
process, Himadri is not only creating a valuable industrial 
product but also closing the loop in the life cycle of coal 
tar derivatives, ensuring that fewer resources go to waste. 
Additionally, the circularity of this process is critical for 
minimizing the carbon footprint of the carbon black 
industry. By integrating the use of a by-product into the 
production process, total emission reduction is achieved by 
45% compared to Anthracene Oil disposal and combustion.

diversity awareness through corporate media, open 
dialogue platforms, and specialized training programs. 
Employees across all levels receive diversity and 
unconscious bias training to recognize and eliminate 
barriers to inclusivity.
Aligned with the Company's vision—"Together, Towards 
Tomorrow"—Himadri integrates Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion (DEI) principles into its corporate framework. 
The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusiveness (DEI) Policy, 
effective 
from 
November 
2023, 
formalizes 
this 
commitment, establishing a structured and forward-
looking approach to fostering inclusivity across the 
workforce and community engagements. This policy 
strengthens ongoing DEI initiatives and sets a foundation 
for a more equitable and inclusive future, ensuring that 
diversity remains a key driver of business growth and 
sustainability. In addition to gender diversity, Himadri 
includes economically poor marginalized group in its 
value chain to advance economic prosperity. Himadri 
integrates DEI criteria into supplier selection processes to 
build a value chain that reflects its commitment to equity 
and inclusion. Himadri envisions a future where diversity, 
equity and inclusion are intrinsic to its organisational 
fabric. The Company’s DEI policy, framework and roadmap 
signify its commitment to making a meaningful impact on 
employees, stakeholders, and communities. As Himadri 
progresses along the DEI maturity curve, the Company 
remains dedicated to becoming a pioneer in inclusive 
business practices, sustaining a workplace where every 
individual is empowered to thrive.

efforts is driven by the belief that true corporate 
responsibility lies in fostering self-sufficiency, resilience, 
and long-term progress.
Himadri’s CSR initiatives are structured for maximum 
impact under the guidance of its CSR Committee, a 
dedicated Board-level body ensuring that every project 
aligns with the Company’s core values, sustainability 
objectives, and long-term community development 
goals. 
By 
prioritizing 
high-impact 
initiatives, 
the 
Company actively contributes to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), reinforcing its 
commitment to global sustainability standards.

to CSR, ensuring that every project is meticulously 
planned, implemented, and monitored from inception to 
completion. The dedicated CSR team ensures optimal 
resource utilization, maintaining the highest standards of 
transparency, accountability, and effectiveness.
To measure the tangible impact of its CSR programs, 
Himadri conducts rigorous assessments, beginning with 
internal evaluations, followed by third-party verifications. 
This dual-layer evaluation enhances the credibility of the 
Company’s efforts, ensuring that every initiative delivers 
measurable and lasting benefits to the communities it

Sustainable Value Chain
Himadri plays a vital role in shaping both environmental 
and social outcomes through its extensive global market 
presence. By collaborating closely with value chain 
partners, the Company is committed to preventing human 
rights violations and environmental breaches while 
fostering transparency and traceability across its entire 
supply chain. This commitment is deeply embedded 
in Himadri’s corporate philosophy, Together Towards 
Tomorrow, which underscores a collective and forward-
thinking approach to sustainability.
A strong advocate of circularity, Himadri has developed 
its value chain by upcycling by-products from industries 
such as steel and oil & gas. In its carbon black division, 
the Company harnesses process waste gas to generate 
electricity, a portion of which is used internally, while 
the surplus is exported to the grid—contributing to 
the replacement of coal-generated thermal power. By 
extending product lifecycle phases and embedding 
circular economy principles, Himadri has built a legacy of 
responsible manufacturing.
Supplier selection is another critical aspect of Himadri’s 
sustainability strategy. The Company not only ensures 
that suppliers meet high sustainability standards but 
also enhances the overall resilience and quality of 
the value chain. As a responsible speciality chemical 
company, Himadri acknowledges its duty to minimize 
environmental and social impacts. To achieve this, it has 
set ambitious sustainability targets and implemented 
stringent measures. Through a comprehensive materiality 
analysis, the Company has identified key focus areas, 
including mitigating climate change, reducing GHG 
emissions, upholding human rights and labor standards, 
and strengthening corporate governance. By integrating 
these priorities into its operations, Himadri continues 
to drive meaningful change, ensuring a sustainable and 
responsible future.
To effectively achieve this, we have developed robust 
management structures and control systems within 
our procurement processes, ensuring transparency and 
alignment with our sustainability goals. By implementing 
rigorous evaluation criteria for our suppliers, conducting 
regular audits, and integrating sustainability metrics into 
our decision-making, we ensure that every procurement 
decision supports our broader ESG objectives. This 
approach enables us to mitigate supply chain risks, 
promote ethical sourcing practices, and drive value 
creation throughout the entire value chain. 
Himadri’s Sustainable Procurement Framework is a 
cornerstone of its commitment to responsible sourcing, 
ethical 
business 
conduct, 
and 
advancing 
global 
sustainability objectives across the value chain. Aligned 
with international sustainability standards and the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), 
the framework integrates Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles into procurement practices 
to ensure a responsible, transparent, and future-ready 
supply network.

1. 	
Supplier 
Self-Assessment 
Questionnaire: 
The 
sustainable procurement journey begins with a 
Supplier 
Self-Assessment 
Questionnaire 
(SAQ), 
which is designed to assess the supplier’s adherence 
to 
Himadri’s 
sustainability 
expectations. 
This 
comprehensive questionnaire evaluates a supplier’s 
policies, practices, and performance across key 
sustainability dimensions, including:
 
 
Environmental management (e.g., emissions, 
waste, water use)
 
 
Labour and human rights (e.g., fair wages, child 
labour, workplace safety)
 
 
Business ethics (e.g., anti-bribery, data privacy)
 
 
Supply chain practices (e.g., subcontracting, 
traceability)
 
 
Governance and compliance
	
The SAQ enables suppliers to reflect on their 
sustainability maturity while providing Himadri 
with valuable insights into potential ESG risks and 
opportunities for improvement.
2. 	
Third-Party Audit (Online/Offsite): To ensure the 
integrity of the self-assessment process, the SAQ 
is followed by an online or offsite third-party audit. 
These audits are conducted by independent and 
globally recognized verification bodies who assess 
the accuracy of the responses submitted, validate 
documentation, and check compliance with relevant 
laws, industry standards, and Himadri’s Supplier 
Code of Conduct.
3. 	
Composite Risk Rating and Categorization: Based 
on the findings from both the SAQ and the third-
party audit, Himadri develops a composite risk rating 
for each supplier. This rating categorizes suppliers 
into various risk levels—such as low, medium, or 
high—based on their potential ESG risk exposure. 
The objective is to create a transparent view of the 
supplier landscape and prioritize risk mitigation 
efforts accordingly.
4. 	 Active Supplier Engagement and Risk Mitigation: 
Himadri takes a proactive and collaborative approach 
to risk mitigation. For suppliers identified as having 
medium or high-risk exposure, the Company initiates 
targeted engagement strategies that include:
 
 
Capacity building through customized training 
and knowledge-sharing sessions
 
 
Awareness programs to educate suppliers 
on 
sustainability 
expectations, 
compliance 
requirements, and industry best practices
 
 
Collaborative action plans, where necessary, 
are co-developed with suppliers to close ESG 
performance gaps through realistic, time-bound 
improvement measures
 
 
Monitoring and follow-ups to track progress 
and support continuous improvement
	
These efforts are geared towards empowering 
suppliers to enhance their ESG capabilities, align 
with global sustainability goals, and ensure long-
term value creation across the supply chain.
5. 	
Driving Collective Impact: Himadri views suppliers 
as strategic partners in its sustainability mission. 
By embedding ESG performance into procurement 
decisions 
and 
encouraging 
suppliers 
to 
take 
ownership of their sustainability journeys, Himadri 
not only strengthens its own value chain resilience 
but also contributes to broader systemic change.
	
Through its Sustainable Procurement Framework, 
Himadri 
is 
fostering 
a 
responsible 
sourcing 
ecosystem—one 
that 
upholds 
human 
rights, 
promotes environmental stewardship, and builds 
long-term partnerships rooted in shared values and 
mutual growth.
	
Moreover, we actively monitor evolving sustainability 
trends and engage in meaningful dialogues with 
our suppliers and stakeholders. This proactive 
approach allows us to regularly assess and update 
our procurement policies, ensuring they remain 
relevant and impactful. By embracing continuous 
improvement, 
we 
reinforce 
our 
commitment 
to 
maintaining 
high 
standards 
in 
sustainable 
procurement and positively contribute to our 
business ecosystem. Our guiding principles of 
“Integrity, Commitment, Passion, Seamlessness, 
and Speed” are embedded in every aspect of 
our 
procurement 
activities. 
The 
procurement 
functionaries, in collaboration with key stakeholders, 
provide comprehensive guidance on all supply chain 
operations, ensuring that our resource utilisation 
is efficient, sustainable, and fully aligned with our 
organisational vision and mission. By embedding 
these values and principles into our procurement 
strategy, Himadri envisions to gain edges as a leader 
in sustainable practices, setting new benchmarks for 
the industry and paving the way for a responsible, 
resilient, and sustainable supply chain that supports 
our long-term growth and value creation.

At Himadri, sustainability is a shared commitment, deeply 
embedded in the Company’s operations and extended 
across the entire value chain. Embracing a collaborative 
approach, Himadri actively engages with partners 
to minimize environmental impact while delivering 
sustainable solutions. Recognizing that its direct and 
indirect emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) contribute to 
the Scope 3 emissions of its customers, the Company 
continuously works to lower its carbon footprint by 
developing low-emission, customer-centric products. 
This integrated approach reflects Himadri’s dedication 
to not only advancing its own environmental goals 
but also supporting the sustainability ambitions of its 
stakeholders.
As part of its customer decarbonization initiatives, Himadri 
has developed low carbon footprint fuel oil (HLSFO) a 
cleaner and more efficient alternative to conventional 
coal tar used for combustion in furnaces at steel plants. 
This innovative solution significantly reduces greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions and enhances operational efficiency 
due to its high calorific value. By reducing overall material 
consumption, HLSFO directly contributes to Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption 
and Production, underscoring Himadri's commitment to 
resource efficiency.
Himadri's Integrated circular business model for the steel 
sector exemplifies its leadership in sustainable industrial 
practices. The Company sources coal tar from steel 
plants and upgrades it using proprietary technology into 
Coal Tar Pitch, HLSFO, and other high-value by-products. 
Among these, HLSFO is supplied back to the steel plants, 
enabling a closed-loop system that minimizes waste 
and maximizes resource reuse. This model reinforces 
sustainability across the value chain by lowering 
environmental impact, improving material productivity, 
and promoting responsible production.
Through such transformative initiatives, Himadri continues 
to drive measurable environmental progress across its 
operations. By embedding sustainable innovation and a 
customer-focused philosophy at the core of its strategy, 
the Company reaffirms its position as a responsible 
industry leader, committed to long-term value creation 
and environmental stewardship.

Way Forward
As Himadri advances on its journey towards a more 
sustainable and responsible future, it is driving forward 
a suite of transformative and forward-looking initiatives. 
Strategic projects such as Carbon Capture, Utilization 
and Storage (CCUS), fuel diversification, advanced 
energy management systems, and strong commitments 
to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I), human rights, 
and STEM education are at the heart of this progress. 
These initiatives not only reflect Himadri’s unwavering 
dedication to environmental and social stewardship but 
also position the Company as a pioneer of purposeful 
growth in the chemical industry.
By embedding sustainability deeper into every aspect of 
its operations, governance, and partnerships, Himadri is 
laying the foundation for long-term value creation—not 
just for its stakeholders, but also for the communities 
it serves and the planet it depends on. These forward-
thinking projects are designed to enhance operational 
resilience, accelerate the transition to a low-carbon 
economy, and empower people through education, 
equity, and innovation.
Looking ahead, Himadri envisions a future where business 
success and sustainability are inseparable. In collaboration 
with value chain partners, policymakers, and civil society, 
the Company is committed to shaping a resilient, inclusive, 
and regenerative future. With bold action, innovation, 
and purpose, Himadri is not just adapting to change—it is 
leading it, ensuring that progress today secures a better 
tomorrow for all.

In a significant strategy to engage more women into leadership roles, several sponsorship programmes are in 
place to enhance their skills and empowerment with comprehensive training, mentorship opportunities and 
professional courses to equip women with the necessary skills for leadership positions. We believe in empowering 
women to contribute significantly to the organisation’ success and sustainability. By 2030, Himadri aims for 25% 
representation of women and underrepresented groups across the Board of Directors, management and the 
workforce. 
	
Himadri’s commitment to advancing diversity extends beyond the workplace and into the communities where 
the Company operates. Therefore, Himadri actively identifies and collaborates with women-led businesses and 
enterprises owned by marginalised or vulnerable groups for the procurement of consumables, services, and 
operational needs.
22.	 Turnover rate for permanent employees and workers
	
Himadri successfully reduced the turnover rate of employees through a series of strategic initiatives aimed at 
enhancing employee satisfaction, fostering a positive workplace culture and implementing efficient retention 
programs. We initiated regular feedback sessions and open communication channels between employees and 
management which helped to address issues before they got escalated.  Himadri designs and offers various 
leadership training programmes, coaching and mentorship sessions and personalised career development 
programmes to boost employee morale through PRAGATI programme. Regular rewards, both monetary and non-
monetary were provided, fostering a sense of belonging and appreciation. Additionally, we ensured employees 
could balance their professional and personal lives, reducing burnout and enhancing job satisfaction by offering 
flexible work schedules, remote work options etc. We regularly review and adjust compensation packages to 
ensure they are competitive with industry standards.

26. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Our Sustainability initiative focuses on addressing the most significant sustainability challenges and opportunities. 
Himadri has restructured its material topics and adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive’s double 
materiality assessment. This methodology prioritizes issues based on their impact on the environment, society and 
Himadri’s business, creating financial risks and opportunities. On one hand, organisations must have an impact 
on people and the environment (inside-out). On the other hand, sustainability-related developments and events 
create (new) risks and opportunities for organisations (outside-in).
	
10. 	 Continuous Improvement: Continuously evaluate and improve the organization’s grievance handling processes 
based on lessons learnt and feedback received. Strive to build trust and foster positive relationships through 
ongoing engagement and responsiveness to concerns.

Bribery and 
corruption
Opportunity
A firm stance against 
bribery and corruption 
positions Himadri as 
a leader in corporate 
responsibility, 
transparency and 
integrity. Addressing these 
issues helps maintain 
stakeholder trust, avoid 
legal penalties, and ensure 
fair practices. Effective 
anti-bribery measures 
protect corporate 
reputation and stability
Tools such as audits and due diligence 
were employed to mitigate potential 
compliance risks related to sustainability 
topics including anti-bribery, corruption. 
In this regard, the Company considers 
group-wide business activities across 
all locations. To identify potential risks 
early, each business unit and function 
is required to conduct regular risk 
analyses. Based on analysis results, the 
ESG Council issues binding standards 
following deliberations. Himadri’s 
anti-bribery and corruption framework 
cultivates integrity across  business 
operations. This framework provides 
guidelines for employees, contractors 
and third-party stakeholders to prevent 
unethical practices (bribery, facilitation 
payments and gifts) that could influence 
business decisions.
The ABC framework protects 
Himadri from legal penalties, 
financial losses, and reputational 
damage. By ensuring transparent 
business practices, it enhances 
investors confidence, regulatory 
compliance, and stakeholder 
trust. This leads to stronger 
partnerships, improved credit 
ratings, and greater access 
to capital, ultimately driving 
long-term financial stability and 
sustainable growth.
12
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
 Effective waste 
management minimizes 
environmental pollution, 
reduces landfill use, and 
conserves resources 
through recycling 
and reuse. It helps 
companies address legal 
requirements, mitigate 
operational risks, and 
reduce disposal costs. 
Responsible waste 
management enhances 
corporate reputation 
and supports broader 
sustainability goals.
Waste management is a key activity 
which Himadri diligently carries out from 
the inception. Our entire value chain 
is based on the by-products of other 
industrial sectors. Through innovative 
technologies and constant research and 
development, we extract values out 
these otherwise waste materials. 
Additionally, our operational standards 
clearly outline the ‘Dos and Don’ts’ of 
waste management. Our constant effort 
is currently being employed to recover 
and reuse our operational wastes as 
well.
As our legacy is based on 
recovering values out of by-
products of other industrial 
sectors responsible waste 
management is very crucial for 
us. Effective waste management 
helps Himadri reduce disposal 
costs, optimize resource use, and 
enhance regulatory compliance, 
avoiding fines and legal risks. By 
implementing waste recycling and 
circular economy initiatives, we 
recover valuable materials, lower 
raw material expenses, and create 
new revenue streams. Additionally, 
improved waste management 
strengthens ESG performance, 
attracting sustainability-focused 
investors and customers, 
ultimately driving cost savings 
and long-term profitability.

Responsible 
Procurement
Opportunity
By prioritizing ethical 
sourcing and making 
environmentally and 
socially responsible 
procurement decisions, 
Himadri builds strong, 
long-term relationships 
with suppliers who 
share its value. It 
reduces risks associated 
with unethical labor 
practices, environmental 
degradation, and supply 
chain disruptions. By 
prioritizing suppliers who 
adhere to sustainability 
and ethical standards, 
organizations enhance 
reputation, regulatory 
compliance and social 
cum environmental 
outcomes leading to long-
term value creation.
By working closely with our value chain 
partners, we aim to prevent breaches 
of human rights and environmental 
violations. We strive to enhance 
transparency and adequate traceability 
in our value chain entirely. In line with 
the commitment, we have embedded 
‘Together Towards Tomorrow’ in 
corporate philosophy to underline 
our collaborative approach related to 
sustainability endeavors. Value chain is 
a function where although risks exist 
but they are not entirely under Himadri’s 
control. Therefore, we have taken a 
bottom-up approach of identifying 
value chain risks and opportunities not 
only decentralizing the process but 
also encouraging value chain partners 
to seek collaboration. Therefore, we 
have formed a cross functional team. 
The value chain partner engagement 
task force strengthens relationships 
with suppliers, ensuring an alignment 
with sustainability goals (particularly 
in reducing Scope 3 emissions). By 
training and assessing partners’ ESG 
performance, the task force drives 
responsible sourcing practices, 
enhances efficiency and promotes 
sustainability progress across the value 
chain. To ensure that sustainability is 
ingrained throughout our supply chain, 
Himadri employs a multi-stage process 
for selecting and evaluating Supply 
Chain Partners. This process includes:
•	 Non-disclosure agreement
•	 Self-assessment surveys
•	 Composite performance index
•	 On-site and online audits
•	 Collaborative mitigation approach
Sustainable procurement helps 
Himadri reduce costs, mitigate 
supply chain risks, and enhance 
operational efficiency by sourcing 
from environmentally responsible 
and ethical suppliers. It ensures 
resource efficiency, lower 
raw material costs, and waste 
reduction, leading to long-term 
financial savings. Additionally, 
strong ESG-aligned procurement 
attracts investors, enhances 
brand reputation, and secures 
premium market opportunities, 
driving profitability and business 
resilience.
14
Policy Influence
Opportunity

shape the regulatory and 
legislative environment 
in which a company 
operates. By engaging 
in policy discussions and 
advocating favorable 
regulation, companies 
can align public policies 
with objectives, mitigate 
regulatory risks, and 
enhance efficiency. 
Effective policy influence 
enables companies to 
contribute to broader 
social and environmental 
goals.
Capitalizing on policy influence involves 
actively engaging with regulatory 
bodies, industry associations, and 
sustainability initiatives to shape policies 
that align with Himadri’s business 
goals. By advocating for favorable 
environmental and industry regulations, 
Himadri can gain early compliance 
advantages, access incentives, and 
influence market standards.

Risk 
Management
Opportunity
Effective risk management 
identifies, assesses, 
and mitigates potential 
threats from financial 
uncertainties to 
operational disruptions. 
It ensures regulatory 
compliance, strengthens 
decision-making, 
and protects against 
unforeseen events. By 
proactively addressing 
risks, organizations can 
prevent losses, seize 
opportunities, and deepen 
stakeholder trust.
Himadri has conducted a comprehensive 
risk identification process (as directed 
by the Board). Although the Risk 
Management Committee is expected 
to take the lead in this effort, cross-
committee and common risks are 
being addressed in collaboration with 
other committees mandated by the 
Board. Besides, Himadri incorporated 
sustainability related risks, including 
responses to non-conformities, 
reputational risks and actions that 
could affect the Company’s brand. 
Himadri’s governance risk management 
employs decentralised controls to 
capture granular risks (including 
physical and transition risks). Executives 
are appointed at the operating 
business and group levels to ensure 
comprehensive risk management. 
At the group level, risk registers 
are aggregated to identify material 
risks across three factors: frequency, 
potential magnitude and impact. The 
established risk management system 
monitors quantifiable and non-
quantifiable risks for the prevailing 
year and the mid-term period. Risk 
reporting serves as the starting point 
and outcome of Himadri’s continuous 
risk management. Additionally, we have 
established a separate risk management 
committee. This Committee oversees 
risk identification, assessment and 
mitigation that could impact the 
Company. This Committee (Board 
members and senior executives) ensures 
a robust risk management framework 
aligned with industry best practices 
and regulatory requirements. The 
Committee’s responsibilities include 
monitoring the Company’s risk profile, 
reviewing risk management policies and 
ensuring the implementation of effective 
risk mitigation strategies. By conducting 
periodic risk assessments and stress 
tests, the Risk Management Committee 
ensures that threats are proactively 
addressed and goals achieved.
Effective risk management 
strengthens Himadri’s financial 
stability by proactively identifying, 
assessing, and mitigating 
potential threats across 
operations, compliance, and 
market dynamics.

Himadri’s ISO certifications are a testament to our 
commitment 
to 
globally 
recognized 
management 
standards and operational excellence. They signal 
to 
stakeholders—including 
banks, 
investors, 
and 
customers—that we are a well-structured, reliable, and 
growth-ready organization. Achieving ISO certification 
requires rigorous compliance with defined international 
standards, demonstrating that our processes meet best-
in-class benchmarks for quality and governance.
During the current reporting year, we continued to sustain 
our ISO certifications. The details are described below – 
ISO 9001:2015 certification (Quality)
Himadri operates with a robust ISO 9001:2015 certified 
Quality Management System (QMS), ensuring that its 
products and services consistently meet customer 
and regulatory requirements. The QMS framework 
emphasizes 
continuous 
improvement, 
risk-based 
thinking, and customer satisfaction, which are integral

ISO 14001:2015 certification (Environment)
The 
ISO 
14001 
certification, 
which 
focuses 
on 
Environmental 
Management 
Systems 
(EMS), 
is 
highly significant for Himadri, especially in terms of 
promoting sustainable practices, ensuring compliance 
with environmental regulations, and improving overall

ISO 27001 is the international standard for information 
security management systems (ISMS). Achieving this 
certification ensures that Himadri has robust security 
measures in place to protect its sensitive data, whether 
it’s related to intellectual property, financial information, 
customer data, or employee records. This is crucial in 
today’s digital age where data breaches can result in 
significant financial and reputational damage. ISO 27001 
helps identify potential security risks, vulnerabilities, and 
threats to information. By implementing the necessary 
controls and policies, Himadri can mitigate risks and 
reduce the likelihood of security breaches, cyberattacks, 
or data leaks. It ensures that all aspects of the company’s 
information security are addressed in a systematic and 
proactive manner
ISO 37001: 2016 certification (Anti-bribery)
The ISO 37001 certification, which focuses on Anti-
Bribery Management Systems (ABMS), is important 
for Himadri for several reasons, particularly as it relates 
to enhancing corporate integrity, improving ethical 
business practices, and ensuring compliance with anti-
corruption regulations. Here’s why this certification is 
crucial for Himadri. ISO 37001 provides a framework for 
Himadri to prevent, detect, and respond to bribery risks 
within its operations. This is important in industries like 
chemical, where business dealings may involve suppliers, 
contractors, and government agencies, all of which 
could present potential risks for corrupt practices. The 
certification helps establish clear policies and procedures 
to prevent bribery, ensuring the company operates with 
integrity. ISO 37001 helps improve Himadri’s overall 
corporate governance by establishing transparency and 
accountability in its operations.
ISO 45001: 2018 certification (Health & Safety)
The ISO 45001 certification, which is the international 
standard for Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)
management systems, is highly important for Himadri, 
especially in terms of ensuring the well-being of its 
employees, enhancing safety practices, and complying 
with regulatory requirements. ISO 45001 provides a

this means creating a safer working environment for 
employees, which is especially important in the chemical 
industry where workers are exposed to potentially 
hazardous materials and processes. By implementing 
ISO 45001, Himadri ensures that its operations are 
designed to protect the health and well-being of its 
workforce. One of the key benefits of ISO 45001 is its 
focus on accident and illness prevention. By identifying 
hazards and implementing controls to minimize risks, 
Himadri can significantly reduce workplace accidents, 
injuries, and occupational illnesses. This leads to fewer 
disruptions in operations, lower medical costs, and less 
absenteeism, contributing to a more productive and

commitment to ethical practices, such as respecting 
labour rights, ensuring a safe work environment, and 
promoting fair wages. This can enhance the company's 
reputation, fostering greater trust with customers, 
investors, and stakeholders. The SA8000 standard 
requires compliance with international labor laws and 
human rights guidelines. For Himadri, this ensures that 
its operations meet recognized ethical standards, which 
is important for reducing legal and reputational risks 
related to labor issues such as child labor, forced labor, 
discrimination, and unsafe working conditions.

of disruptions. The Stage 1 audit involved a thorough 
review of the organization’s preparedness, policies, and 
processes related to business continuity. Himadri is now 
preparing for the Stage 2 audit, scheduled for April 2025, 
which will assess the full implementation and effectiveness 
of the system. This step further strengthens Himadri’s 
ability to maintain operations and recover quickly from 
any unforeseen disruptions, ensuring minimal impact on 
its business activities.

Himadri’s Perspective on Corporate Compliance 
Disciplinary Action -  
 
 
The Primary goal is to ensure that all employees 
understand and follow the company’s code of 
conduct, policies, and regulatory obligations.
 
 
Disciplinary action, when justified by evidence 
is approached as corrective and educational 
tool rather than a punitive one, with the goal 
of nurturing a culture of responsibility and 
accountability
 
 
When non-compliance is identified, at Himadri 
investigation, documentation, and consultation 
with HR and legal teams are initiated.
 
 
The severity of action depends on the nature 
and frequency of the breach—ranging from 
verbal warnings to termination in extreme cases.
 
 
Consistent 
application 
of 
disciplinary 
procedures to avoid any perception of bias or 
favoritism.
 
 
Communication is key— Ensuring that the 
employee 
understands 
the 
violation, 
the 
expected standards, and the consequences of 
repeated non-compliance.
 
 
Maintaining a clear audit trail of all actions taken 
to ensure traceability and protection for both 
the company and the employee.
 
 
Training and awareness initiatives are rolled 
out post-incident to prevent recurrence and 
address gaps in understanding.

a crucial role in fostering economic growth, social equity, and sustainable development. While our core raw 
materials—by-products of large-cap industries like steel and oil & gas—cannot be directly sourced from these 
groups due to the specialised nature of their production, we have proactively aligned our procurement strategy 
to prioritise consumables from these groups wherever possible. This approach enables us to balance operational 
requirements with our commitment to inclusive growth.

not only meet our operational needs but do so 
in a manner that contributes positively to society 
and minimizes our environmental footprint. In line 
with our commitment to responsible sourcing, we 
have developed a comprehensive ‘Sustainable 
Procurement Policy’ designed to ensure that 
our suppliers uphold the highest standards 
of 
environmental, 
social, 
and

Process optimisation is central to Himadri. Himadri has initiated to introduce recycled products as inputs following 
the end-of-life phase of its products. Additionally, we have launched a pilot project to implement a reusable 
packaging solution, with the potential to eliminate plastics and wood from packaging. Himadri leverages the benefit 
of integrated production sites and systems for systematic waste management. By-products from one production 
process are repurposed as raw materials of other products, widening the value chain. The Company sources raw 
materials from other sectorial by-products (coal tar and carbon black feedstock) resulting into majority of non-
virgin materials in our value chain.

Circularity at Himadri is driven both by environmental and ethical aspects. And our value chain partners epitomises 
this principle. Himadri launched a pilot project to implement a reusable packaging solution, with the potential 
to eliminate plastics and wood from its packaging. Besides, the Company strives to achieve its ambitious waste 
management target (zero waste to landfill). Himadri leverages the benefit of integrated production sites and 
systems for systematic waste management. By-products from one production process are repurposed as raw 
materials of other products, widening the value chain. Himadri follows EPR practices by taking responsibility for 
the entire lifecycle of products, including the collection, recycling and disposal of packaging waste. Himadri is 
advancing tire recycling projects to convert waste tires into reclaimed rubber, recovered carbon black, low sulphur 
industrial oil, and reclaimed steel. This process reduces landfill waste and promotes sustainable material recovery. 
Himadri maintains regular communication with third-party vendors to monitor the final disposal and ensure proper 
management of the waste, reaffirming its commitment to environmental responsibility.
	
Product End-of-Life Management:
	
As part of Himadri’s ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship and circular economy principles, we 
are initiating a comprehensive Product End-of-Life Management Action Plan. This upcoming initiative aims to 
responsibly manage the lifecycle of Himadri’s products beyond their useful phase, ensuring minimal environmental 
impact and enhanced resource recovery.

Himadri has formalised and widely published its grievance mechanisms, which include a standardised hotline and 
reporting system. Relevant personnel are trained to ensure that all complaints are reviewed and escalated when 
necessary. If a complaint is justified, appropriate measures are promptly taken. Employees can report incidents 
confidentially through a toll-free number, email, or an internal portal. External stakeholders, such as contractors or 
suppliers, are also encouraged to report noncompliance. A team comprising the Chief Human Resources Officer, 
Chief Sustainability Officer and Company Secretary handles complaints with sensitivity and impartiality. Employees 
who report incidents are protected against retaliation, ensuring their safety and confidence in the system. Regular 
audits and feedback loops help identify areas for improvement and maintain a harassment-free environment.

Himadri’s Collective Bargaining Policy upholds the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right 
to collective bargaining. In this context, Himadri pays importance to the rights of individual to join, form or leave a 
group voluntarily without any interference from external Parties. In Himadri we have various internal committees 
which deal with empowerment of workers, improving Working Conditions, Fair wages and benefits, Job security 
and Promotion of Social Justice results in reduction of workplace conflicts. Labor representation is mandatory in 
these committees while some of the committees are formed by management and labor representatives. However, 
joining these committees are kept voluntary for the workers and there is a pledge of no coercive actions. As a 
SA 8000:2014 certified organization, Himadri has always taken care of all who access our workplaces. Therefore, 
labour welfare committees have representation from the contractual workers as well. Our hired security forces 
are not equipped with any kind of weapon to restrict any movement of workers inside our premises. Workers are 
regularly trained on identifying workplace risks with respect to social wellbeing. These awareness sessions are 
conducted by our team with an oversight from the Board. 
	
At Himadri, the Company recognizes that open dialogue and mutual respect are foundational to creating a positive, 
fair and inclusive workplace. While no political labour unions exist within the organization, Himadri upholds the 
principles of collective bargaining through a structured and transparent approach that values the voices of all 
employees and contractors, including third-party workers. To ensure meaningful representation and engagement, 
Himadri established various employee and worker committees that serve as vital platforms for discussion, feedback 
and collaboration.

harmed and how; 
 
 
Risk evaluation and precaution; 
 
 
Recording of findings;
 
 
Review and update.

sheet for logging injuries and incidents, with 
corrective and preventive actions shared across 
sites via a Lesson Learning Sheet (LLS). This 
helped mitigate similar risks across operations.

At Himadri, safety practices are marked by 
continuous 
improvement, 
periodic 
reviews 
and 
updated 
policies. 
Engaging 
workers 
(including third party) has helped percolate 
safety awareness across levels. During the 
year under review, the Company launched a 
new H&S Leadership training module, covering 
health and safety topics. During the reporting 
financial 
year, 
the 
Company 
covered 
all 
management category employees. Himadri 
prioritised a new Permit to- Work standard, 
training relevant employees and deploying it 
across divisions, integrating risk management 
into the system. The Company adopted the 8D 
(Eight Disciplines) Practical Problem Solving 
(PPS) method, a structured tool in accident and 
incident investigations. This method identifies 
root causes and implements corrective actions. 
Management 
employees 
received 
8D-PPS 
training to investigate incidents and implement 
solutions. 
	
	
During the last financial year, Himadri conducted 
approximately 25,018 man hours of safety 
training (classroom sessions, online courses, 
hands-on drills, interactive workshops and 
modules on its Utkarsh Learning Management 
System). This covered employees, workers 
and third-party contractors, and consumed an 
average 12 hours per person per year.

Monitoring and auditing for continual improvement:
	
	
Himadri’s rigorous approach to health and safety is marked by quarterly audits that cover key ESG areas. 
These audits are led by qualified internal auditors and members of the Health, Safety and Environment team. 
Regular evaluations are conducted across the Company’s manufacturing sites, with a focus on Safety Audits, 
Risk Assessment, Health and Safety Training and KPI-related action plans. In addition to quarterly internal 
audits, Himadri conducts annual external audits and third-party assessments on key statutory provisions, 
including IS 14489, which addresses Occupational Health and Safety management system. Moreover we 
periodically conducts Electrical Safety and Fire Safety Audits (third party) following national and international 
regulations. This layered audit structure helps the Company adhere to high Health and Safety management 
standards. By integrating internal audits, external reviews and third-party assurance, Himadri has established 
a comprehensive framework that promotes transparency, accountability and improvement. This approach 
empowers the Company to communicate advancements towards health and safety Management.
	
	
Himadri offers a number of procedures and 
platforms for employees to formally report 
work-related risks. The Safety Audit Tool is 
one such tool that our employees use on the 
job. Every week, all Himadri employees take 
part in the workplace audit and report issues 
to the relevant department for resolution. We 
have introduced a QR Code-based reporting 
system to make it easier for employees to 
report work-related hazards. Over 32 percent 
of our employees’ participation increased in FY 
24-25 who conducts regular safety audits on a 
monthly basis. In FY 24-25 we have captured 
over 9,638 number of safety audit points which 
has increased from 4,117 Safety Audit Points 
from the last FY 23-24. Moreover, the closure rate 
also increased to 86.5% overall which includes 
various Safety Improvement Opportunities 
(SIO) to upgrade the Safety Standard.
	
	
This led to an overall improvement in worker 
safety. Employees are involved in this audit 
program, including line managers, employees, 
top management and HSE staff. We will be 
applying the same rule to temporary and 
contract workers in the future.

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
	
Himadri’s occupational health strategy is structured around comprehensive safety initiatives. This encompasses 
risk assessment, standardisation of procedures, workplace health promotion, occupational health training, 
occupational hygiene management, occupational health services, rehabilitation and institutional support 
for work-related injuries / illnesses and audits (internal and external). The focus is on identifying potential 
hazards, assessing risks, establishing safety protocols and supporting wellbeing (physical and mental). Himadri 
emphasises hygiene standards, offers medical support and provides support (rehabilitation and institutional). 
This holistic approach underlines Himadri’s dedication to sustain a safe and healthy work environment. Risk 
assessment is key to occupational health at Himadri, ensuring the identification, evaluation and mitigation of 
workplace health hazards to protect employee safety and well-being. This process begins with identifying 
potential hazards, assessing their likelihood and severity and implementing control measures to reduce risks. 
Himadri’s general risk assessment comprises identifying, capturing and recording occupational health risks.
	
	
Himadri has implemented a comprehensive standard operating procedure (Framework) to manage industrial 
noise effectively, ensuring a safe, compliant and comfortable work environment for all employees. Several 
impactful noise reduction measures have already been implemented. For instance, acoustic hoods have been 
installed in high-noise areas such as the CETP and RC zones. Through continuous noise monitoring and the 
adoption of advanced noise mitigation technologies, the Company strives to reduce its environmental impact 
while supporting a quieter, safer workspace.
	
	
Risk assessment is key to occupational health at Himadri, ensuring the identification, evaluation and mitigation 
of workplace health hazards to protect employee safety and well-being. This process begins with identifying 
potential hazards, assessing their likelihood and severity and implementing control measures to reduce 
risks. Himadri’s general risk assessment comprises identifying, capturing and recording occupational health 
risks. Risks are categorised into high, medium and low levels based on the likelihood of prolonged exposure. 
High and medium risks are reviewed monthly by the senior management in the ESG Council level to ensure 
proactive oversight. Himadri prioritises controls, including elimination, reduction, isolation and exposure 
control. Personal protective equipment is provided at no cost to all employees and contractors, reinforcing 
the Company’s health-conscious environment.

Standard Activities-These are divided into 
repetitive 
and 
periodic 
categories. 
The 
process for managing standard and non-
standard activities enhances the safety focus. 
For standard activities, which occur either 
repetitively or periodically, the process begins 
with risk assessment to identify and mitigate 
potential hazards. Detailed instructions are 
developed to ensure safe operations and that 
employees undergo training and validation to 
confirm their related competence. The process is 
reviewed annually. Himadri’s Standardised Work 
Instructions (SWIs) provide a comprehensive 
framework that ensures consistency across 
operations. These SWIs are based on internal 
standards that are aligned with EN and ISO 
standards. The key elements of the SWIs 
include:
 
 
Safety-Protocols 
to 
protect 
workers 
(including third party contractors) and 
prevent accidents.
 
 
Quality-Guidelines 
to

Non-standard (non-routine) activities-Himadri 
addresses non-routine work through its Permit 
to Work (PTW) system. This structured process 
identifies, 
communicates, 
mitigates 
and 
controls risks in hazardous areas, non-standard 
situations and potentially dangerous conditions 
(shutdowns), enhancing frontline worker safety. 
In the Company’s 24x7 operations, PTW system 
is mandatory, typically used in maintenance. Non-
standard activities, while frequent, are exceptional 
and require a customised approach. These activities 
commence with risk assessment to address 
specific and unique risks. Before proceeding, PTW 
ensures safety. Workers are trained and participate 
in toolbox talks (TBT) to manage associated risks. 
There are seven main types of work permits: Hot 
work permits, General work permits, Confined 
spaces work permits, Electrical work permits, 
Height work permits, Excavation permits and 
Radiography work permits. Each work permit is 
categorised based on the nature of the job and 
associated hazards, ensuring appropriate safety 
measures are implemented.

c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to 
report the work related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, Himadri established multiple channels for 
workers to report work-related hazards. A key 
tool for this purpose is the Safety Audit Tool, 
used by employees to enhance workplace 
safety. Each week, all employees participate in 
workplace audits and promptly escalate any 
identified issues to the relevant department 
for correction. To simplify reporting, Himadri 
introduced a QR code-based reporting system, 
enabling employees to easily raise work-related 
hazard reports. Employees can access digital 
safety checklists and receive real-time updates 
on safety protocols and corrective status.
	
	
Himadri addresses the timely reporting of 
incidents (fires, explosions, material spills and 
other chemical releases). Himadri’s internal 
accident and incident reporting standards 
adopt stringent definitions for Lost Time 
Injuries (LTIs) and severe accidents compared 
to regulatory bodies. All manufacturing plants 
are required to report medically treated Injuries 
(MTIs), extending investigations to include all 
Dangerous Occurrences (DOs) and MTIs. Himadri 
investigates every accident and incident in its 
manufacturing plants and offices. First-aid cases 
and low severity DOs are addressed through 
the Line Practical Problem Solving tool, while 
MTIs, RSIs, LTIs and high severity DOs involving 
process-related incidents are managed using 
the 8D Practical Problem Solving (PPS) tool. 
The Company employs an internally developed 
incident reporting tool to communicate incidents 
to stakeholders across its manufacturing sites. 
Himadri targeted to reach a Lost Time Injury 
Frequency Rate (LTIFR) of below 1.0.
	
	
Comprehensive approach in Safety Audit and 
Risk Assessment - Himadri adopts a proactive 
approach to safety audits to find out the safety 
improvement opportunities (SIOs) and conclude 
with their preventive actions. In addition to 
it, workplace risk assessments particularly 
emphasizing risks with a Risk Priority Number 
(RPN) above 32 were conducted on regular 
basis to initiate actions and their closure for all 
the work related high risk areas. Such high-RPN 
scenarios indicate substantial risk and Himadri’s 
policies prioritize these areas to ensure effective 
control measures and mitigation strategies. 
Regular safety audits, in alignment with internal 
standards evaluate these risk zones to identify 
potential threats and enhance safety measures. 
This approach integrates continuous monitoring, 
assessment and improvement protocols aiming 
to safeguard both employee and non-employee 
workers through detailed action plans, training 
and regular follow-ups of audit points and 
their closure which is termed as SIOPA (Safety 
Improvement Opportunities with permanent 
Actions) in Himadri to manage risks effectively 
and uphold a secure work environment. 841 
nos. of total risk were identified for FY 24-25 in 
comparison to 471 nos. of total risks which were 
identified during FY 23-24 with high risk being 
440 in numbers. Closure percentage of all the 
risk captured from Risk Assessment is lying at 
83.82% and in FY 24-25 we have captured over 
9,638 number of safety audit points which has 
increased from 4,117 Safety Audit Points from 
the last FY 23-24. Moreover, the closure rate 
also increased to 86.5% overall which includes 
various Safety Improvement Opportunities 
(SIO) to upgrade the Safety Standard.

Businesses must operate in a manner that respects and upholds 
the inherent rights and entitlement of individuals without any 
discrimination. The core tenets of this principle are based on the 
Constitution of India and international Human Rights standards

Equal human right is a fundamental aspect of the Company’s business 
ethics and operational framework, which encompasses its policies, 
processes and practices. The Company’s commitment and respect for 
human rights is translated in its publicly accessible policies, including 
‘Labour and Human rights policy, ‘Code of Conduct’. For Himadri, "dignity

Himadri prioritizes to evaluate the value chain 
partners including suppliers, distributors, contractor 
and service providers to ensure that they align with 
our ESG goals and sustainability principles.
	
Himadri has recently embarked on a comprehensive 
downstream value chain sustainability assessment.
	
Training programmes on all pillars not only enhance 
the performance of our suppliers but also ensure 
that they are aligned with Himadri’s long-term 
sustainability objectives.
	
Sustainable supply chain framework: Outlines a set 
of carefully designed Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs). Through these KPIs, we evaluate suppliers 
on multiple dimensions such as their environmental 
impact, human rights policies, ethical practices, and 
overall alignment with sustainable development 
goals. This structured assessment enables us to 
identify potential risks, encourage best practices, 
and support continuous improvement across our 
supply chain.
	
Supplier code of conduct: Our supplier code of 
conduct establishes the foundation for responsible 
sourcing by requiring all suppliers to commit to a 
mandatory self-declaration. 
	
Self-assessment surveys: Each supplier is required 
to complete a detailed self-assessment survey that 
covers ESG, quality, delivery, and pricing aspects. 
	
Suppliers that are noncompliant with labor laws or 
exhibit poor labor practices, such as inadequate 
wages, lack of workers’ rights, or unsafe working 
conditions, are addressed through a focused labor 
management plan. Himadri ensures that corrective 
measures are in place to improve working conditions 
and uphold human rights.
	
Though we have engaged our upstream value chain 
partners – supplier, raw material consumables and 
service vendors, moving forward we have an action 
plan to engage our downstream value chain partners 
– customers and business partners as well.

ISO 50001:2018 standards and advanced monitoring 
technologies. Initiatives like capturing and reusing 
system, 
transforming 
to 
fuel 
diversification, 
optimizing process and operation all these contribute 
to keep energy consumption in check.
	
We are tirelessly endeavoring through our efforts to 
optimize energy consumption reducing associated 
environmental footprint. Therefore, ISO 50001:2018 
energy management system is applied in all of our plant 
locations. As a result, BU level “Energy Optimization 
Task Force” has been formed to drive our initiatives 
efficiently. Focused on energy-saving opportunities 
and implementing cutting-edge technologies, this task 
force ensures that the Company minimizes energy 
consumption while maintaining operational excellence.
	
Himadri is dedicated to promote sustainable practices, 
committed to a Net-zero vision aligned with India’s 
Net-zero goal, validated by the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) for 2050. Our efforts align with the 
principles of UNGC; and SDG 13 (Climate Action). 
Participation in the Taskforce on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP) highlights its commitment to manage 
climate related risks and explore environmental 
stewardship opportunities. 
	
At Himadri we consider energy management as 
a mainstream responsibility and all stakeholders 
are accountable for managing and monitoring 
energy consumptions. Himadri embarked on the 
implementation of a digital energy management 
system at the Carbon Black Division in Mahistikry.
	
The Company installed the SmartComm software 
by L&T Electrical and Automation directed to 
manage energy consumption. At the Carbon Black 
division, 140 smart meters were installed in the 
generating unit and process distribution sections / 
subsections. These meters monitor auxiliary power

equivalent to about 24 TPD at a pressure of 
20 kg. The full integration of this system is 
expected to further optimize boiler efficiency, 
ensure greater reliability, and enhance energy 
recovery capabilities, significantly contributing 
to overall plant sustainability and performance 
goals.
 
 
Hot air line duct is activated which connects 
the line #3 secondary APH to the Boiler #3 
combustor. 
The 
secondary 
APH 
captures 
residual heat from dirty gas streams, raising the 
air temperature to 350°C. By redirecting this hot 
air to the boiler, the energy required to heat the 
combustion air is reduced. Ambient air (~25°C) 
requires more power from the FD fan to achieve 
combustion temperatures. Using preheated 
air reduces the temperature gradient, leading 
to lower fan energy requirements and also 
subsequently reducing the fuel consumption in 
the combustor.

Himadri employs a multifaceted approach to reduce 
water withdrawals, integrating Rainwater Harvesting, 
Steam Condensation, Water Recovery through Water 
Recovery Plants (WRP), and Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) capacity expansion. We are committed in 
reducing daily water consumption by 20% within 
2026. Our Water Efficiency and Preservation 
Policy upholds our integrity towards delivering to 
a sustainable world. The pursuit of water positivity 
through a zero liquid discharge (ZLD) process helps 
moderate environment impact and enhance water 
resource sustainability. Our initiatives align with 
UNSDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation). 
	
In the fiscal year 2024-25,we achieved a significant 
reduction in our average daily water consumption 
which is a daily savings of 462KL
	
To accomplish this, we implemented several key 
initiatives:
	
•	
Arresting Steam Leakages: We focused on 
arresting 
steam 
leakages 
in 
the 
Captive 
Power Plant (CPP) and Central Boiler Division 
areas. This helped in reducing water loss and 
improving overall efficiency.
	
•	
Condenser Recovery System: We installed a 
condenser recovery system in the CPP, which 
allowed us to recover and reuse water that 
would otherwise be lost.
	
•	
Heat 
Exchanger 
in 
Blowdown 
Line: 
By 
integrating a heat exchanger in the blow down 
line of the CPP, we were able to recover heat and 
reduce water consumption for other processes.
	
•	
Minimizing Intermittent Blowdown (IBD) and 
Continuous Blowdown (CBD): We minimized 
the IBD (procedure to remove suspended 
solids, including any sludge formed in the 
boiler water) and CBD (continuous removal of a 
small amount of water from the boiler, typically 
from the surface, to control the concentration 
of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and maintain 
boiler water quality processes in the CPP as per 
water quality analysis, further reducing water 
wastage.
	
•	
Water Recovery System: We implemented a 
comprehensive water recovery system (New

Through this project, we collected and reused nearly 7,57,018 liter of rain water last year and percolated nearly 
31,500 liter of water. currently, we are in process to implement rain water harvesting at every operational sites after 
assessing the feasibility of the project.
	
Additionally, we regularly conduct awareness campaigns for internal as well as external stakeholders to save water.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? 
(Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency –
	
Yes, we have employed an independent third party to assess our overall water withdrawal and consumption. This 
particular assessment was carried out by TUV SUD South Asia Pvt Ltd. during the current reporting year. The audit 
report gave Himadri an overall view of the whole process from water withdrawal to distribution and also about the 
water recycling and ZLD process Himadri, has started working on all the findings and recommendation resulting 
into significant improvement in water management.
	
Himadri has introduced a double-stage cooling system with a Steam Generator and Heat Exchanger, replacing the 
previous single stage cooling system with a condenser. This transition has significantly reduced evaporation loss 
from the cooling tower, resulting in substantial water savings upto approx 8KLD. This initiative reinforces Himadri’s 
commitment to sustainable water management and operational efficiency, reflecting a proactive approach to 
environmental responsibility.
	
These initiatives collectively contributed to our daily water savings of 470 KL, demonstrating our commitment to 
sustainable water management and operational efficiency.
	
In our journey to achieve over all sustainability aspirations, we constantly thrive to conserve water resource. In line 
with our sustainability agendas we have installed rain water harvesting systems in our manufacturing locations. 
We are enhancing rain water harvesting capacity to reuse rain water with every passing year. Rainwater Harvesting 
(RH) captures and stores rainwater for multiple uses, reducing dependency on external water sources (ground- 
& third party water). Through our installed capacity, we are able to decrease third party water consumption 
significantly than last year. In one of our manufacturing plant in Korba, we have already implemented rain water 
harvesting system. Details of the project are as follows:

Water discharged from industrial activities can 
significantly disrupt local eco-systems, harming 
aquatic life and affecting the livelihoods of 
surrounding communities due to contamination. At 
Himadri, we recognize this critical challenge and 
have taken proactive, responsible steps to safeguard 
our environment.
	
We have successfully implemented Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) across all our facilities, reinforcing 
our strong commitment to water conservation and 
ecosystem protection. This initiative ensures that no 
untreated or contaminated water is released into the 
environment, thereby eliminating the risk of polluting 
nearby water bodies.
	
Aligned with our Water Efficiency and Preservation 
Policy, this approach is a key pillar of our sustainability 
strategy. To drive this initiative further, Himadri has 
established a dedicated Zero Liquid Discharge Task 
Force at the Business Unit level. This task force leads 
the way in implementing innovative water recycling 
and reuse techniques, contributing to both resource 
efficiency and environmental stewardship.
	
Through the adoption of advanced water treatment 
technologies 
and 
robust 
monitoring 
systems, 
Himadri continues to reduce water consumption 
while protecting natural ecosystems—demonstrating 
our unwavering commitment to sustainable and 
responsible operations.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ 
evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an 
external agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external 
agency –
	
Yes, we have employed an independent third party 
to assess our overall water discharge. This particular 
assurance was carried out by TUV SUD South Asia 
Pvt Ltd. during the current reporting year. Himadri 
is working on the findings and recommendations as 
per the audit report.
5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD)? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation
	
Yes, to support our wastewater recycling and Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system, Himadri has established 
an advanced Water Recovery Plant (WRP)—the final 
recovery stage of our Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). 
This innovative system is designed to maximize water 
reuse, minimize waste, and significantly reduce our 
reliance on freshwater resources.
	
The WRP receives treated wastewater from various 
sources, including the ETP, DM plant backwash, RO 
plant reject water, and cooling tower blowdown. 
These are collected in the WRP feed tank and 
then directed to a clarifier, where a carefully dosed 
combination of dolomite, polyelectrolyte, sodium 
hypochlorite, caustic, and coagulant helps settle 
Total Suspended Solids. The clarified, TSS-free water 
is then stored in a dedicated tank.
	
From here, the water undergoes several advanced 
filtration processes:
 
 
It is first passed through a Mixed Gravel Filter 
(MGF) with Hydrochloric Acid HCL dosing to 
eliminate any residual suspended solids.
 
 
Next, it enters an Ultrafiltration (UF) unit, which 
separates permeate and reject water into 
respective tanks.
 
 
The permeate water is then treated through a 
two-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) system—first 
stage with five membranes, second stage with 
two—after pre-treatment using a carbon filter 
and dosing with HCL, sodium metabisulphite, 
and anti-scalant.
 
 
Before reaching the final permeate tank, the 
water passes through a De-Gasifier unit to 
remove excess carbon dioxide, ensuring stable 
pH levels.
	
Fig: ZLD process
	
The final permeate water, with a daily recovery of 
1200 KL, is effectively reused for cooling tower 
makeup, process requirements, and RO plant feed. 
Meanwhile, the final concentrate water amounting 
to 50 KL per day, is sustainably utilized in various 
places of our manufacturing unit. This integrated 
system 
showcases 
Himadri’s 
commitment 
to 
responsible water management by significantly 
reducing groundwater consumption and reinforcing 
our vision for sustainable industrial operations.

Our company diligently plans to check, monitor and 
make significant initiatives to reduce the emission. 
Our Air Quality & Emission Control Policy are in place 
to execute the ESG related guidelines. Himadri have 
implemented a new innovative solution to reduce 
Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 and 10 with PURE SKIES 
2.0. This was a successful initiative that reduced 
the levels of PM from the last year as shown in the 
above data set. Our company diligently strategizes 
to check, monitor and make significant initiatives 
to reduce the emission. Our Air Quality & Emission 
Control Policy are in place to execute the ESG related 
guidelines. 
 
 
The 
Vehicle 
Management 
Standard 
(Framework) implemented by Himadri plays a 
vital role in reducing air pollution. By ensuring 
that all vehicles within the plant premises are 
roadworthy and fully compliant with local 
regulations, particularly those governing the 
transport of hazardous materials, the Framework 
minimizes the emission of harmful pollutants. 
Regular pre-operation safety checks, combined 
with a robust preventative maintenance system, 
ensure that vehicles operate efficiently, resulting 
in lower pollutant emissions. The Framework 
also mandates strict adherence to speed limits 
and prohibits the use of mobile phones while 
driving, reducing the risk of accidents and 
unnecessary idling, both of which can contribute 
to air pollution. By maintaining vehicles in 
optimal condition and enforcing stringent 
operational protocols, Himadri significantly 
reduces pollutant emissions, supporting cleaner 
air and demonstrating its commitment to 
sustainability and environmental stewardship.
 
 
The Hot Material Vapour Scrubbing Unit is 
designed to remove certain components from 
gases or vapours by washing them with a liquid 
absorbent called wash oil. The liquid, enriched 
with absorbed constituents, is then replaced 
with fresh liquid. The scrubber unit uses a 
packed tower where the gas enters from the 
bottom and the scrubbing liquid enters from the 
top, leading to absorption and condensation of 
vapors. To maintain the liquid temperature, a 
cooling coil with circulating water is employed. 
The unit follows a daily checklist, monitoring the 
level and temperature of the scrubbing liquid. 
If the temperature exceeds the limit, the water 
inlet valve is adjusted. 
	
	
Additionally, the cloud point of the liquid is 
tested, and if it goes beyond the specified 
temperature, the liquid is replaced. The optimal 
level range of the scrubbing liquid is 40% 
to 60%, with a temperature range of 45°C to 
55°C and a cloud point of 35°C. To control 
vapour emissions from light oil tanks, a nitrogen 
blanketing system is installed, reducing air 
pollution. The nitrogen pressure is regulated to 
maintain controlled pressure inside the tank. If 
the pressure increases, the tank vent actuator 
releases the excess pressure to the atmosphere. 
On the other hand, if the pressure decreases, the 
nitrogen actuator opens to introduce nitrogen 
and maintain the set tank pressure. 
 
 
The presence of nitrogen in the tank reduces 
air pollution by exhausting nitrogen first during 
vapour release, leading to the condensation of 
light oil vapour into liquid inside the tank. The 
NOx Abatement Process at Himadri aims to 
reduce NOx emissions from the cellulose nitration 
reactors at the site. The process consists of two 
main components: a scrubber/absorber tower 
and a reaction vessel with a catalyst bed. The 
scrubber/absorber tower comes in contact with 
NOx-laden fumes with water, producing nitric 
acid through absorption. Moreover, we regularly 
monitor POP across all our plants.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ 
evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an 
external agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external 
agency.
	
Yes, Himadri undertakes thorough and regular 
evaluations of major air pollutants to ensure 
adherence to environmental standards and to protect 
public health. Third-party experts are engaged 
to perform independent assessments, enhancing 
the credibility and transparency of the monitoring 
process. Periodic quarterly audits are conducted to 
verify our performance regarding air pollutants such 
as NOx, SOx, and Particulate Matter (2.5 & 10) etc. 
These quarterly audit results are submitted to the 
regulators by the appointed third party. The audit 
also verifies the compliancy of our operations as set 
by the regulators such as Central Pollution Control 
Board of India. The periodic analysis of air pollutants 
not only helps in maintaining compliance but also 
supports Himadri’s commitment to environmental 
stewardship. We have also carried out assurance 
by TUV SUD South Asia Pvt Ltd. for current 
reporting year.

Himadri’s Together Towards Tomorrow philosophy 
articulates the Company’s mission to ‘create a 
sustainable planet for all, providing care and 
enrichment for the life of all people and the planet.’ 
Himadri is implementing initiatives to mitigate and 
adapt to global warming across business strategy 
areas. During the reporting year, Himadri aligned with 
Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures, 
disclosing climate-related information to promote a 
dialogue with investors and other stakeholders. The 
Company participated in its first evaluation by the 
Carbon Disclosure Project. 
	
In our inaugural submission, CDP has rated us B 
in both Climate Change and Water Stewardship 
categories. The Company’s detailed Net Zero Target 
for 2050 is also under review for approval by the 
Science Based Target Initiative.  Himadri recognises 
that climate risk assessment is an evolving science, 
requiring periodic updates to physical and transition 
risk assessments. This approach empowers Himadri 
to align its strategy with the latest projections and 
build a responsive resilience framework to address 
climate change impacts.
	
Himadri’s greenhouse gas reduction task force helps

and focusing on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, 
the task force advances sustainability. Ongoing 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
ensure 
compliance, 
promoting environment responsibility.
	
We are aggregating GHG data, creating inventories, 
and reporting Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions outlined 
by the GHG Protocol Standard. We used the 
following methodologies for collecting activity data 
and calculating emissions: (1)IPCC Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 2006 (2)The 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) (3)The 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Scope 1, 2, and 3 Guidance

1 and scope 2 emission by 30% within 2030. Our 
Environment Policy and Energy Efficiency Policy 
provides assurance in our commitment towards a 
sustainable, pollution-free future.
	
Our commitment to achieve Net Zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 is at the heart of our sustainability 
vision. Committed target is under validation process 
by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), our 
interim targets include a 25% reduction in Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions intensity and a 5% reduction 
in Scope 3 emissions by 2025.
	
In our production line we have two major value 
chain- Carbon black and Coal tar. Scope-1 emission 
mainly comes from the Carbon black division. In the 
Coal tar division, there is fractional distillation. The 
electricity consumption for all the machineries and 
equipments is in house generated and also a net 
exporter of electricity.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ 
evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an 
external agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external 
agency –
Yes, we have employed an independent third party 
to account for our GHG emission. This particular 
assurance was carried out by TUV SUD South Asia Pvt 
Ltd. during the current reporting year. Accounting is 
done in accordance with the methodologies detailed 
by the Green House Gas Protocol which is a global 
standard.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing 
Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details.
	
Yes, at Himadri, we fulfill 90% of our power 
requirements through our 28MWh capacity power 
plant, showcasing our dedication to environment 
preservation. To reduce waste gas and off-gas venting 
during carbon black production, we’ve implemented 
an innovative process that recirculates and feeds 
off-gas into power generation, significantly lowering 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Our power plant 
features three boilers that adequately meet the 
energy demands of our West Bengal unit, with surplus 
electricity being sold to the local grid. This Financial 
year we have sold about 82,954.53 MW electricity 
to the local grid. With our low emission factor in 
generation of electricity the total emission avoidance 
is reported at 19,909 tCO2e for FY 2024-25.
 
 
Himadri 
Speciality 
Chemical 
Limited 
has 
replaced the conventional fuel oil heating 
system with a steam heating system in its new 
480 Ton per day Coal Tar distillation project. 
This transition from a fuel oil heating system to 
a steam heating system has brought significant 
improvements in efficiency and effectiveness 
while lowering associated emission. The fuel 
required for dehydration has been eliminated, 
leading to a substantial reduction in GHG 
emissions. By switching to steam energy, the 
Company benefits from improved heating 
performance, potentially lower energy costs, 
reduced GHG emissions. 
 
 
Himadri has successfully implemented a high-
performance 
multifunctional 
fuel 
additive 
across its reduction processes, targeting various 
fuel applications such as furnace oil, carbon 
black feedstock, light diesel oil and low sulfur 
heavy stock. This additive has led to significant 
improvements in fuel efficiency and carbon 
emission 
reduction, 
optimising 
production 
operations.
 
 
In lieu with our net zero roadmap, Himadri’s 
greenhouse gas reduction task force helps 
minimise carbon emissions  and achieve net-
zero. 
By 
optimizing 
processes, 
adopting 
cleaner technologies and focusing on Scope 
1 and Scope 2 emissions, the task force 
advances sustainability. Ongoing monitoring 
and reporting ensure compliance, promoting 
environment responsibility.
 
 
As Himadri has started integrating environmental 
impact assessments into the evaluation of each 
capital expenditure project, recognizing that 
these decisions significantly influence our long-
term sustainability, particularly in terms of GHG 
emissions. We incorporate an internal carbon 
pricing for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
into the payback calculations for investments 
requiring approval by the CMD-CEO. When 
evaluating capital expenditures or new projects, 
the potential CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 
2) are estimated. The internal carbon price is

Moreover, we identify that plantation drives offer a valuable opportunity to expand green spaces and promote 
environmental awareness. Himadri has initiated a significant plantation drive in collaboration with the forest, 
environment, and climate change department, aiming to enhance the green cover of the village by planting 
various tree species. The plantation of 6,199 native tree saplings this year is a remarkable achievement. Our 
plantation drive is designed to achieve enhanced biodiversity, mitigating soil erosion and improving air 
quality in association with local communities and external subject matter experts. The community’s active 
involvement in this initiative is truly commendable as it contributes to creating a greener environment. These 
trees will not only provide shade and clean air for future generations but also enhance the overall health of our 
ecosystem. Additionally, we regularly organize training for internal stakeholders and awareness campaigns for 
the external stakeholders on climate change and its effects.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage 
of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.
Himadri’s efforts to reduce production waste are 
guided by a principle: avoid waste. If avoidance is 
not possible, waste should be recycled or used in 
energy generation. If recycling or energy generation 
is not feasible, waste should be disposed safely. The 
need to establish high-level circular economies that 
support sustainable economic growth is increasingly 
critical. Given the planet’s finite resources, rising 
lifestyle standards and growing resources demand on 
account of a rising global population, conventional 
one-way economic models will no longer be able 
to sustain prosperous lifestyles and cultures going 
ahead. To stimulate economic activity and move to 
a decarbonised society, it will be essential to reduce 
the use of fossil-based plastics while addressing 
a growing demand for plastics. In this context, 
Himadri acknowledges the growing importance 
of reducing plastic consumption and enhancing 
recycling. As a speciality chemical manufacturing 
Company, Himadri takes a comprehensive approach 
to identify risks associated with various types of 
waste, including production waste, packaging waste, 
plastics and wood pallets. The Company considers 
a range of plausible scenarios through consultations 
with internal and external stakeholders.
	
Process optimisation is central to Himadri. This 
includes 
in-plant 
reprocessing 
of 
substance 
streams and the application of the 3R principle 
(reduce, reuse, recycle) across operational sites. 
Where waste cannot be avoided, the focus is on 
mechanical or thermal reprocessing. At Himadri’s 
sites, various types of recyclable waste — plastics, 
glass, paper, food waste and wood—are segregated 
and dispatched to external recycling firms approved 
by regional pollution control boards. The Company 
monitors these firms through audits to ensure their 
corresponding compliance with statutory provisions.
	
Himadri adheres to the recommendations of state 
government waste management authorities related 
to handling hazardous wastes like effluent sludge, 
oil-contaminated gloves, jute and soak sand. It 
employs vendors authorised by the pollution 
control boards. The Company reintroduced recycled 
products as inputs following the end-of-life phase 
of its products. Himadri launched a pilot project to 
implement a reusable packaging solution, with the 
potential to eliminate plastics and wood from its 
packaging.
	
Besides, the Company strives to achieve its 
ambitious waste management target (zero waste to 
landfill). Himadri leverages the benefit of integrated 
production sites and systems for systematic waste 
management. By-products from one production 
process are repurposed as raw materials of other 
products, widening the value chain. The Company 
sources raw materials from other sectorial by-
products (coal tar and carbon black feedstock). In 
addition to reprocessing, waste with high calorific 
value (substitute fuel) is used to produce energy, 
reducing a reliance on primary fossil fuels and 
moderating Company’s carbon footprint. Himadri 
is exploring alternatives to replace virgin materials. 
Annexure IX 
of the Board's Report (Contd.)

This includes initiatives to replace fossil-based plastics with alternatives like paper and metal. The Company is 
progressing to use plant-based plastics as an alternative to fossil-based plastics. At Himadri, all plant waste and 
process scraps are systematically collected and transported to the main waste yard for segregation into hazardous 
and non-hazardous categories. Disposal of these wastes is carried out in compliance with Pollution Control Board 
(PCB) regulations and through PCB approved third-party vendors under the supervision of the Health, Safety 
and Environment (HSE) function. Himadri maintains regular communication with third-party vendors to monitor 
the final disposal and ensure proper management of the waste, reaffirming its commitment to environmental 
responsibility.

Himadri has strengthened its climate action framework by formally including Scope 3 emissions in its greenhouse 
gas (GHG) accounting and disclosure process starting FY 2023–24. Recognising that a significant portion of its 
total emissions lies beyond its direct operations, this strategic inclusion marks a key milestone in Himadri’s journey 
towards comprehensive climate responsibility and alignment with global best practices.
	
The Company has undertaken a structured approach to Scope 3 management, beginning with detailed mapping 
of its value chain to identify hotspots and high-emission categories. Priority areas such as purchased goods and 
service, upstream transportation, and downstream transportation have been brought under focus for accurate 
data collection and emissions quantification. 
	
To drive meaningful impact, Himadri has set an ambitious yet achievable Scope 3 emission intensity reduction 
target of 5% by 2025, compared to its 2023 baseline. This target is aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) and supports the broader global goal of limiting temperature rise to below 1.5°C. It also reflects Himadri’s 
commitment to responsible growth by embedding sustainability deeper into its value chain.
	
Previously, industry average data were used to account Himadri’s Scope-3 emission. However, with the direction of 
our BoD members in this current year we embarked on a journey to enhance the granularity of data for a detailed 
emission profile. Therefore, praxis of data collection had been modified accordingly and Himadri launched a formal 
value chain engagement process. 
	
To ensure that sustainability is ingrained throughout our supply chain, Himadri employs a multi-stage process 
for evaluating Value Chain Partners. Each Value Chain Partner is required to complete a detailed self-assessment 
survey that covers ESG and other business aspects. Depending on the risk profile of each Value Chain Partner, we 
conduct either on-site or remote audits. These audits focus on key areas of performance, including environmental 
management, health and safety protocols, labor practices, and corporate governance. Then each Value Chain 
Partner is categorised on respective risk indexes and then corrective action plans are shared with the partners to 
mitigate any potential risk. As a environmentally conscious organisation Himadri takes a pro-active collaborative 
approach to carry out any environmental stewardship projects. One such initiative includes the planned shift from 
conventional diesel to biodiesel for both upstream and downstream logistics — a move that not only reduces 
emissions but also supports India’s national biofuel mission.  
	
By adopting this forward-looking and collaborative approach, Himadri is not only strengthening its Scope 3 
inventory but also fostering innovation and shared responsibility across the value chain. These efforts underline 
Himadri’s vision to lead by example in building a low-carbon, resilient and sustainable future for all stakeholders.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? 
(Y/N) if yes, name of the external agency.
Yes, we have employed an independent third party to account our GHG emission. This particular assessment was 
carried out by TUV SUD South Asia Pvt Ltd. during the current reporting year. Accounting is done in accordance 
of methodologies detailed by Green House Gas Protocol which is a global standard.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Nitrogen blanketing
This system controls pressure and minimizes 
vapor emissions, helping to prevent air 
pollution. It employs nitrogen pressure to 
control emissions, significantly mitigating 
odors by condensing light oil vapors into 
liquid form. By creating an inert atmosphere 
inside storage tanks, nitrogen blanketing 
minimizes the presence of oxygen, which in 
turn reduces the evaporation of VOCs from 
the liquid surface.
Presently, vent out vapor mixture 
is rich with nitrogen as it is more 
volatile than light oil vapor as a 
result air pollution has reduced 
from before. As tank is under 
controlled pressure so that vapor 
mixture emission has reduced 
resulting in lowering air pollution.
2
Waste Heat 
Recovery : APH, 
OPH,WHRB & Dryer 
APH to reduce GHG 
emissions
The system enhances heat recovery by 
capturing heat from hot smoke and utilizing 
it to generate hot air. This recovered heat is 
then effectively used in the Oil Pre-Heater 
(OPH)and Captive Power Plant (CPP) boiler 
combustor.
As a result, Himadri has achieved 
a total energy usage of1.20 GJ/hr 
in OPH and 5.45 GJ/hr in CPP. This 
initiative optimizes the utilization 
of waste heat, contributing to 
improved energy efficiency 
and promoting environmental 
sustainability.
3
Sludge to fuel
Himadri’s initiative to implement a reduction 
process for internal waste, such as sludge, 
represents a significant step forward in 
sustainable waste management and resource 
recovery The conversion process adopted by 
Himadri focuses on transforming the sludge, 
a by-product typically produced during 
industrial operations, into a valuable resource. 
Through this innovative process, the sludge 
undergoes a transformation, turning it into a 
usable fuel.
This fuel can then be utilized 
in auxiliary operations, such as 
powering certain machine or 
serving as an alternative energy 
source for specific industrial 
activities. 
By harnessing the energy potential 
of sludge, Himadri is promoting 
a circular economy model where 
waste is minimized, and valuable 
resources are recovered and 
repurposed.
4
Reduction of PM2.5 
& PM10 –Clean Air 
Mission
The technology uses pulsed radio waves 
(WiFi) to accelerate the natural clearance of 
these microscopic pollutants. This technique 
coagulates PM2.5 and PM10 through pulsed 
radio waves which presents several potential 
benefits for air quality improvement. By 
causing the particulate matter to coagulate 
and settle, the concentration of harmful 
particles in the air is reduced.
Air quality typically improves 
by 30-40% or more, leading to 
improved health and reduced 
risk of non-compliance with air 
pollution norms.
5
Application of 
Anthracene Oil 
in Carbon Black 
Production
In the context of a circular economy, using 
Anthracene oil derived from coal tar as a 
feedstock for carbon black production is an 
innovative and sustainable approach that 
significantly contributes to resource efficiency 
and environmental sustainability.
By redirecting Anthracene oil 
into the carbon black production 
process, Himadri is not only 
creating a valuable industrial 
product but also closing the loop in 
the life cycle of coal tar derivatives, 
ensuring that fewer resources go 
to waste.

Yield Improvement 
in Carbon Black 
Production
Himadri is producing Carbon black by partial 
combustion of the Anthracene oil, this yield 
gain process also reduces the extraction of 
energy transformation as we are converting 
the higher volume of mass to the finish 
product, which will help to reduce energy 
loss and reduce GHG emission also. We have 
achieved the yield gain of 4% due to process 
excellence process.
The yield gain is a sustainable 
approach to reduce the raw 
material consumption to achieve 
circular economy initiatives as well 
as to reduce the carbon footprint.

Environmental 
Impact Reduction 
: 480 TPD Project 
–New RC-Coal Tar 
Division
Himadri has implemented a strategic 
approach to energy reduction by transitioning 
from a single-stage cooling system (Old RC) 
to an advanced double-stage cooling system 
(New RC). In the previous system, the total 
heat load was forwarded directly to the 
cooling tower, leading to higher energy and 
water consumption. With the New RC system, 
the total heat load is divided into two streams: 
one directed towards RO (Reverse Osmosis) 
water and the other towards the cooling 
tower.
This division significantly reduces 
the heat load on the cooling tower, 
resulting in lower evaporation 
losses—saving approximately 8 KL 
of water per day. Additionally, the 
New RC system improves energy 
efficiency by converting excess 
heat into steam, which is forwarded 
to the LP steam header for reuse.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
Himadri has developed a robust Business Continuity and Disaster Management Plan (BCDMP), which is integrated 
into the Company’s comprehensive Risk Management Policy. This forward-thinking plan is a testament to Himadri’s 
unwavering commitment to operational resilience, long-term value creation, and sustainable business growth, even 
in the face of unforeseen disruptions. Himadri has successfully conducted the Stage 1 audit for ISO 22301:2018, the 
international standard for Business Continuity Management Systems (BCMS). This audit marks a significant step in 
Himadri's commitment to ensuring the resilience and continuity of its operations.
	
The BCDMP serves as a strategic blueprint to ensure uninterrupted operations during natural calamities, industrial 
emergencies, cyber threats, and other potential disruptions. It reflects Himadri’s focus on protecting stakeholder 
value, enhancing corporate governance, and aligning with its long-term strategic objectives. The plan outlines 
procedures to maintain critical business functions, secure employee and community safety, and preserve 
environmental integrity—minimizing harm to people, infrastructure, biodiversity, and ecosystems.
	
Himadri’s approach to risk management is proactive and data-driven. All financial and non-financial risks are 
continuously identified, assessed, and mitigated under the guidance of the Risk Management Committee, 
a dedicated oversight body that reports directly to the Board. This includes climate-related risks, operational 
disruptions, supply chain vulnerabilities, and emerging ESG concerns.
	
To ensure that the BCDMP remains dynamic and effective, regular simulations, risk assessments, and audits are 
conducted. These evaluations help identify gaps, incorporate learnings, and update response protocols in line with 
evolving business environments and global best practices. Employees across critical functions are also trained to 
respond efficiently during emergencies, reinforcing a culture of preparedness and accountability.
	
Through this integrated and forward-looking risk governance framework, Himadri not only safeguards its assets 
and people but also ensures that it continues to deliver value to customers and communities—even in times of 
crisis. This resilience is fundamental to Himadri’s sustainable growth vision and its ability to thrive in an increasingly 
complex and interconnected world.

At Himadri, we follow a structured and responsive approach to ensure that every customer concern is addressed 
promptly and effectively. When a complaint is raised, regional managers from the Marketing department register 
it, capturing essential details such as product and grade information, invoice number, nature of the issue, customer 
or agent details, and any supporting images. The complaint is immediately shared with the Head of Technical 
Services and the Head of Quality Control. Customers receive an acknowledgment from the Regional Marketing 
Manager, assuring them that their concern is being acted upon.
	
Within one working day, the Head of Technical Services forwards the complaint internally to the relevant department 
heads. These teams collect the necessary data and present their findings in a Corrective and Preventive Action 
(CAPA) meeting within two working days. Appropriate corrective steps are then initiated to resolve the issue. Once 
resolved, the outcome is communicated to the customer by the Marketing Manager. In cases where the complaint 
is found to be unjustified, the Head of Technical Services and Regional Marketing Manager engage directly with 
the customer to provide clarification and close the matter amicably.
	
The complaint closure form is completed by the Head of Technical Services and authorized by the Plant Head. If 
the resolution identifies any need for process improvements, necessary updates are made to procedures, work
