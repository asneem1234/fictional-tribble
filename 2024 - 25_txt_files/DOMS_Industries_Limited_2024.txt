Business Responsibility and  
Sustainability Report
Dear Stakeholders,
Sustainable growth has been the driving force of our vision. This year 
too, I am happy to report that our Company has made good progress 
across key sustainability parameters.
Environmental Stewardship
The Company started using solar energy, after having installed 1 MW 
of solar capacity in its premises. We plan to gradually increase our 
solar capacity and reduce our dependence on the grid. The Company 
generated close to 8,627 metric tonnes of briquettes (biofuel) 
which have an energy value of approximately 1.50 lakhs Gigajoule 
(‘GJ’). We also witnessed a reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emission 
intensity per rupee of turnover. We initiated third party ambient air 
quality assessments, noise monitoring and waste-water analyses to 
ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines. Sewage Treatment 
Plants were installed at select Umbergaon facilities to treat domestic 
waste water, further supporting our efforts to reduce freshwater 
withdrawal and promote sustainable water usage. Going forward, the 
Company plans to further expand coverage of such installations at its 
production facilities. 
Our People, our Strength
As at the end of this financial year, our Company employed upwards 
of 10,500 employees and workers, including contract workers. Our 
gender ratio continues to indicate a higher proportion of females, 
most of whom are hired locally. The Company also increased its 
strength of differently abled staff from 28 last year to 41 this year. 
DOMS is committed to providing fair and equal opportunity to all 
employees and workers, without any discrimination.
We are in the process of implementing ISO 9001 (Quality 
Management System), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management 
System) and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety 
Management Systems as part of our Integrated Management 
System. Health & safety of our people is of utmost priority, and we 
continue to make improvements in our systems and controls. 
Governance at the Center of Operations
We have always considered governance at the forefront of all our 
activities. We continue to make incremental improvements in our 
processes, controls and systems to build resilience and protect against 
non-compliance. Various members of the Board, key-managerial personnel 
and other senior managerial personnel have been tasked with leading 
matters on regulatory compliances, occupational health and safety, human 
resource management and development, risk management, IT security 
and controls, amongst other sustainability linked matters. The Company’s 
Stakeholder Engagement Policy also helps to protect stakeholder interests 
and instate formal grievance redressal mechanisms.
We are committed to build a Company that grows with 
purpose. We aspire to and shall continually strive to create 
value for our stakeholders, in a manner that is ethical, fair and 
environmentally conscious.
Warm Regards,
Santosh Raveshia
Managing Director

The Company conducted a materiality assessment to assess those sustainability-related matters which are of significance to the business as 
well as its stakeholders. The assessment involved the following processes:
	
1.	
Identification of stakeholders: We evaluated different categories of stakeholders based on their level of dependence and influence

employees and workers, suppliers, distributors, consumers and local residents.
	
2.	
Identification of sustainability matters: We shortlisted some sustainability-linked matters from a broader universe of risks and 
opportunities faced by the Company. These matters were selected based on the nature of business, applicability of the topics in 
practical sense and guidance given in Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards. 
	
3.	
Data Collection and Organisation: A survey was conducted amongst all stakeholders to assess the level of importance each group 
assigns to select sustainability matters. 
	
4.

Water 
Conservation
Risk
While our processes are 
not water intensive, we 
use water primarily for 
cooling, cleaning and 
domestic use. We are 
dependent on municipal 
water and groundwater 
bores for fulfilling our 
water requirements. Any 
shortage of water could have 
an adverse impact on our 
operations
We practice rainwater harvesting 
at our Umbergaon facility, 
using a catchment pond. The 
harvested water is directed to refill 
groundwater bores and replenish 
our fire hydrant tanks.
We further reuse water used for 
cleaning and cooling to limit our 
water withdrawal to the extent 
possible.
We have further installed effluent & 
sewage treatment plants at relevant 
sites for treatment of industrial 
and domestic water discharge. 
The treated water is reused in 
operations. We are also in the 
process of increasing our sewage 
treatment plant coverage.

Waste 
Management
Risk
The Company’s operations 
result in generation of 
different kinds of waste, 
primarily plastic waste. The 
Company is tasked with 
its proper disposal and 
adherence to applicable 
laws and regulations. We are 
susceptible to fines or legal 
action in case of violation.

Plastic Waste
Post-consumer Plastic Waste
In line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) norms applicable to our Company, we have tied-up with 
authorized third-party Plastic Waste Processors (PWP) for collection of post-consumer plastic wastes on our behalf.
Plastic waste so collected is suitably recycled and the Company is granted ‘Certificate of Recycling’ to this extent.
Pre-consumer Plastic Waste
The Company reuses most of its polymer-based waste generated in its manufacturing processes. The plastic-based 
waste that cannot be re-used internally, is either sent back to the suppliers or sent to plastic scrap dealers, in 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations for disposal of such plastic waste.
Electronic Waste
E-waste generated as a result of our operations is either reused internally or sold to authorised vendors who manage 
the waste suitably.
	
Note:
	
Research and Development Process:
	
Our research and development team ensure that our products are safe, non-toxic, user friendly, cost-effective and involve minimum 
wastage. Over the years, the Company has constantly built on its learning curve and has introduced numerous interventions that have 
a positive environmental and social impact. These include use of recycled material, inhouse recycling, product safety compliance and 
product reassessments.
	
The Company regularly undertakes Lifecycle Assessments (LCA) for its products with an aim to make our product formulations safer and 
environmentally friendly. We have further initiated projects to replace plastic / PVC based packaging with eco-friendly paper packaging in 
our products, wherever possible.
	
These processes have been developed over time and hence no research and development costs are specifically allocable to these activities. 
	
Capital Expenditure:
	
The Company regularly makes capital expenditure in technologies/ equipment that contribute positively to environment and other 
social factors. During FY 2024-25, The Company has invested in solar power generating systems, water treatment plants, and other plant

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
The Company has undertaken the following activities to reduce its Green House Gas Emissions:
	
i.	
Wood Briquettes as a ‘biofuel’: Wooden pencils contribute to about 23% of the Company’s overall sales. In the process of 
manufacturing these pencils, the Company collects a large amount of sawdust, a combination of leftover wood shavings and lead. The 
Company recycles the sawdust into briquettes, using its wood briquettes production plant. The briquettes so generated have a high 
calorific value and help the Company substitute other fuels for heating in its furnace. The Company successfully produced briquettes 
with an energy capacity of approximately 1.50 lakhs GJ during the current financial year. These briquettes are either used for heating 
(as a replacement to other forms of fuel/energy) or sold to dealers for resale.
	
ii.	
Use of cultivated wood: Defying the conventional perception, all wooden slats used in the production of wooden pencils are sourced 
through cultivated plantations and not through elimination of forest cover. Cultivation of these trees leads to negative greenhouse gas 
emissions or in other words, helps absorb CO2 till the trees are ready for harvest.
	
iii.	
Renewable energy sources: The Company invested in 1 MW off installed solar capacity and generated 1,285 GJ of solar energy during 
the year. The Company plans to expand its use of solar energy in the coming years.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
At DOMS, we have built a conscious culture to reduce waste as much as possible. Our manufacturing processes are designed in a way that 
ensure maximum use of raw materials, and reconditioning of leftover materials for reuse in processes.
	
Recycling
	
We recycle leftover polymer released after moulding polymer-based products in subsequent batches through various process interventions. 
A similar activity is done for other materials like graphite and calcium carbonate. The Company recycled close to 370 metric tonnes of 
polymer granules during the year.
	
Reuse
	
The Company reuses crates, metal containers, plastic drums and cartons used for storing and transportation. We often return these 
products to our vendors for reuse or undertake safe disposal of such products as per applicable regulations. The Company also reuses water 
from cleaning and cooling to reduce waste water discharge. The Company purports handling material with care, to ensure that we may use 
our resources judiciously and for a longer time. 
	
Disposal: Kindly refer to Question 3, under Principle 2 for disposal techniques adopted by the Company for different categories of waste.
