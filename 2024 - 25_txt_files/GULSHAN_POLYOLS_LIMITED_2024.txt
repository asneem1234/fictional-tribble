1. 	 Boregoan plants and Upcoming project at Assam are on ZLD basis technology. Company has installed the waste heat recovery and Multi 
effect evaporators to treat the ETP treated water for its use in the various process and then final concentrated effluent is being used in 
coal yard for Ash quenching.
2. 	 All mineral processing plants also operate on ZLD basis by using its water in back process. As effluent has the high Ph and less COD. Hence, 
it is good for using in the washing or in back process.
3. 	 Our plants at Muzaffarnagar and Bharuch are having moderated ETP backed by Multi effect evaporators. ETP treated water is being used 
in RO and RO reject is being processed in Multi effect Evaporators. RO reject and other qualified effluent, which is complying with the 
state pollution control board guidelines, are discharged in designated drain. We have the permission of effluent discharge. Hence, all 
discharge qualifies the norms set by the authority.
