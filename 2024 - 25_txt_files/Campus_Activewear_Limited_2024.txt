Statement by 
director responsible 
for the business 
responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement 
of this disclosure)
At Campus Activewear, we believe sustainability is integral to long-term value creation 
and business resilience. In FY25, we undertook significant ESG initiatives, including 
improving energy efficiency across our operations, implementing systematic waste 
segregation, responsibly managing e-waste through authorized vendors, and reinforcing 
workplace health and safety standards. We also strengthened our governance framework 
through robust policies such as Whistle-blower Mechanism, Code of Conduct, and 
supplier compliance protocols.
Going forward, we aim to accelerate renewable energy adoption, reduce our overall 
carbon footprint, and increase the use of sustainable materials in our product portfolio. 
Additionally, enhancing workforce diversity, expanding ESG compliance across the 
supply chain, and introducing circular economy practices will remain key focus areas. 
Through these efforts, we reaffirm our commitment to aligning with global sustainability 
goals and creating shared value for all stakeholders.

could potentially conflict with the interests of the Company. Additionally, Directors refrain from participating 
in deliberations or decision-making on agenda items where they are interested parties. In instances where a

Directors to the Board, and Senior Management Personnel to their reporting authorities—along with contextual 
details, to enable appropriate review and guidance.

8. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases
The Company has instituted a comprehensive and structured Whistle-blower Mechanism designed to 
safeguard individuals against any form of retaliation or unfair treatment. Proactive measures are embedded 
within the system to pre-emptively address potential challenges whistle-blowers may face. In accordance with 
the policy, when a whistle-blower is required to provide testimony in any criminal or disciplinary proceedings, 
their identity is maintained in strict confidence to uphold their safety, dignity, and privacy.
Furthermore, the Company has cultivated a secure and empathetic work environment that upholds zero 
tolerance towards sexual harassment. Guided by our internal policy, complaints are addressed with utmost 
confidentiality, sensitivity, and impartiality. The grievance redressal process ensures the complete anonymity 
of complainants and guarantees their protection throughout the investigation. In addition, the Company 
provides access to necessary support resources and implements strong safeguards against retaliation.

1
Installation of ETP 
(Effluent treatment 
plant) at Gannaur 
Factory
The water used for washing and in the sole 
colouring process undergoes treatment 
through an Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP). After filtration, the treated water is 
discharged into the drainage system.
1.	
Removal of hazardous 
chemicals from wastewater is 
carried out effectively
2.	
Treated water is reused for 
washing external areas
2
Installation of Wet 
scrubber unit in 
Ganaur
The air containing silicon particles is 
drawn through ducts and passed through 
a water curtain, which removes harmful 
chemicals. The treated air is then released 
into the atmosphere.

Reduction of volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) in the
