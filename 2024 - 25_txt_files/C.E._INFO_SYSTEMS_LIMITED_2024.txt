• An integrated approach seeks to incentivize behaviours through both organization-facilitated forums/programs and individuals compensation-benefit 	  
  structures. 
	
• Preventive measures include compliance with management systems and regulations, awareness building, communication and forum for consultation 
  and feedback, including reviews and audits. 
	
• Mitigation measures include post incident response handling and recovery measures. The Administration Team and HR department acts in case of fire 
  alarms, medical situations, and partial and total evacuations of the Company location in question. The Members of these teams receive relevant training 
  on an annual basis.

of society. All of our CSR projects, are intended to benefit the 
impoverished and members of the society’s marginalised and 
vulnerable groups in one way or the other.
