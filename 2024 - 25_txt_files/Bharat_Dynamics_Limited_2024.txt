Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
Headquartered in Hyderabad, Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL or 
“ the Company”) was incorporated on 16 July 1970 as a Public 
Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Defence, Government 
of India to be the manufacturing base for guided missile systems 
and allied equipment for the Indian Armed Forces.
Since its inception, BDL has been working in collaboration with 
DRDO & foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for 
manufacture and supply of various missiles and allied equipment 
to Indian Armed Forces.
The lead taken by the Nation to develop indigenous, sophisticated 
and contemporary missiles through the Integrated Guided Missile 
Development Programme (IGMDP), gave BDL an opportunity to 
be closely involved in the programme, wherein it was identified 
as the Prime Production Agency. This opened up a plethora 
of opportunities to assimilate advanced manufacturing and 
programme management technologies and skills.
Today, BDL has evolved as one among the few industries in 
the world having state-of-the-art facilities for manufacture and 
supply of Guided Missiles, Underwater Weapons, Air- borne 
products and allied defence equipment for the Indian Armed 
Forces. The Company also offers Product Life Cycle Support and 
Refurbishment / Life Extension of vintage Missiles.
BDL has graduated from being a missile manufacturer to a 
Weapon System Integrator and has emerged as a complete 
solution provider for the Indian Armed Forces.
BDL has three manufacturing units, out of which two are 
located in Telangana State (Hyderabad and Bhanur) and one 
in Andhra Pradesh (Visakhapatnam). As a part of expansion 
plan, the Company is in the process of setting up of additional 
manufacturing facilities at Ibrahimpatnam (near Hyderabad), 
Amravati in Maharashtra and Jhansi in UP which will be used to 
manufacture Surface to Air Missiles (including new generation 
Missiles), VSHORAD rockets and propellants for various Anti-
Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) respectively.
BDL has been constantly working towards upgrading its 
manufacturing technologies and processes to state-of-the-art 
including industry 4.0 / QA 4.0, Robotics operated workshops, 
latest Surface Mounted Devices assembly lines and has always 
maintained highest quality standards in its products by adopting 
to best QA practices like AS 9100, etc. The pursuit has resulted in 
reduction in production cost, benchmarking of productivity norms 
and modernization of management system and less dependence 
on imported technology.
The ‘ease of doing business’ approach adopted by the Government 
of India has paved the way to create a congenial ecosystem for 
the company to manufacture products indigenously and offer 
its products/services to the customers, both, the Indian Armed 
Forces and the global buyers. During last few years, the Company 
has forayed into international market by offering its products to 
friendly foreign countries.
BDL, with its over five decades of missile and allied defence 
equipment manufacturing experience, skill-sets developed and 
state-of-the-art infrastructure, is poised to enter new avenues of 
manufacturing covering a wide range of weapon systems such as 
Air-to-Air Missiles, Air-to-Surface Missiles, Air Defence Systems, 
Underwater Weapons and Mines.
The quest for technological excellence has been the guiding 
principle of BDL and living up to the sobriquet, ‘THE FORCE 
BEHIND PEACE’.

Reasonable Assurance 
A reasonable assurance engagement includes identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, whether due to fraud or error, and responding to the assessed risks as 
required by the circumstances. 
 
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed 
the disclosures presented within the Report and referenced information, and sampled the disclosures and were 
reviewed through the company’s customised sustainability information management system. 
The procedures conducted were based on professional judgement and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluation of quantification methods and reporting policies, 
analytical procedures, and reconciliation with underlying records. Given the circumstances of the engagement, 
in executing the procedures outlined above, we: 
 
• 
Obtained an understanding of the identified sustainability information and related disclosures; 
• 
Acquired knowledge of the assessment criteria and assessed their adequacy for evaluating and/or 
measuring the identified sustainability information; 
• 
Conducted inquiries with Company’s management, including the environment team, compliance team, 
human resources team, and other relevant personnel responsible for preparing the Report; 
• 
Developed an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of key systems, processes, and 
controls for recording, processing, and reporting the identified sustainability information at the 
corporate office and other locations. 
• 
Based on our understanding and the potential risks of material misstatement in the identified 
sustainability information, we determined the nature, timing, and extent of further procedures. 
• 
We tested the Company's process for compiling sustainability information by comparing or reconciling 
it with the underlying records. 
• 
We verified the consolidation of data from various plants and offices on a sample basis within the

We believe that the evidence we have gathered is both sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion.
