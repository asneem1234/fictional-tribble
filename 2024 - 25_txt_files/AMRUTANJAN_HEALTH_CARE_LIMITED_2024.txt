Contents
Rooted in the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, Amrutanjan’s approach to care finds 
resonance with the balance of the three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. 
This legacy is not defined by longevity alone, but by relevance 
and impact. Because at Amrutanjan, relief was our beginning. 
And the promise of tomorrow is to continue delivering wellness 
in tune with the body, nature, and time.
Our pain relief offerings 
help soothe the imbalances 
of Vata, bringing calm to 
restlessness and relief to 
musculoskeletal discomfort. 
In managing inflammation 
and digestive distress, our 
formulations cater to the fiery 
nature of Pitta, restoring 
harmony and cooling intensity. 
For Kapha, we offer 
solutions that invigorate 
and energize, helping ease 
congestion and support 
active, balanced living.
ounded in 1893, Amrutanjan began with a simple 
mission: to bring trusted, effective relief into everyday 
lives. What started as a pain balm crafted with care 
has, over a century, become a name synonymous with wellness, 
reliability and quiet reassurance.
F
Over the decades, we have evolved in step with the needs of our 
consumers. From pain relief and women’s hygiene to congestion 
care and hydration, our portfolio has expanded thoughtfully, 
grounded in science, inspired by nature, and driven by empathy. 
Yet, our core has remained unchanged: a deep commitment to 
wellness that is authentic, trusted, and time-tested.

Charting New Frontiers with a
Legacy of Innovation
At Amrutanjan, every new product is a reflection of our enduring promise 
to combine time-honoured wisdom with evolving consumer needs. 
In FY2025, our product introductions were guided by the same principles that have 
shaped our journey since 1893: efficacy, accessibility, and care. Rooted in nature and 
refined through the art of formulation, each offering—be it in pain relief, women’s hygiene, 
or hydration—was thoughtfully developed to extend our legacy of trusted relief while 
meeting the wellness aspirations of a new generation. 
Expanding Head Relief  
with a More Affordable, 
Accessible Format
In our flagship pain relief portfolio, we launched 
Amrutanjan Faster Relaxation Roll-on (AFRR) 2.5ml at 
an affordable price point of ₹20. This compact format is 
tailored for on-the-go relief, especially for headaches, 
offering the trusted efficacy of our formulation in a more 
accessible and portable option.
Driving Rehydration Solutions 
with Targeted, Science-Backed 
Innovation
In our continued efforts to address hydration and 
wellness, Electro+ expanded with two scientifically 
backed solutions: Electro+ Tetra and Electro+ Powder, 
both formulated with the WHO-recommended formula 
to address dehydration from conditions such as diarrhoea 
and vomiting. To increase affordability and reach, we also 
launched Electro+ Rehydrate 160ml at ₹25, providing 
effective hydration at an affordable price.
* This represents the amount of two interim dividends paid for FY25 and final dividend paid for FY24. Provision has not been considered for the proposed final dividend for FY25
** Includes a final dividend of ₹2.60 (260%) per equity share (F.V of ₹1 each) recommended by the Board of Directors for the financial year ended March 31, 2025.
Note: The Company has adopted IND AS from FY ended March 31, 2018. Accordingly the details provided above are as per IND AS from April 01, 2016.

That iconic balm was more

decades, this humble beginning 
gave way to a legacy built on 
reliability, simplicity, and the quiet 
art of everyday wellness needs.

Message from the 
Chairman & Managing Director
Your management team delivered 
double-digit profit growth, building 
on a similar performance to the 
previous year. This was a result 
of strong go-to-market execution 
combined with operational efficiency 
improvements. There was also an 
overall improvement in gross margin 
owing to growth in the share of the 
pain management category. 
The Company’s core business 
area of pain management saw a 
decline in consumer demand after 
a spike in demand during the Covid 
years. We saw the decline bottom 
out during FY2024, and growth 
slowly returned this year. Besides, 
we project the category to deliver 
low-end double-digit growth going 
forward, which would be in line 
with historical averages. Our brand, 
Amrutanjan, which holds market 
leadership positions in key Southern 
and Eastern states, has a vision of 
growing faster than the category 
via market penetration and product 
development strategies.
The brand is well-positioned to 
service all consumer segments via its 
innovative offerings, which include 
balms at various price points as well 
as new-age innovations like Roll-
Ons, Sprays, and Patches. Household 
penetration data shows balm 
penetration at only 37.5% (Source: 
Kantar), despite the category being 
in use for more than a century. This 
shows the potential for the category 
to evolve and improve usage, and 
this responsibility rests on leading 
brands like Amrutanjan that have the 
legacy, trust, and expertise to deliver 
on this task.
Our period care brand, Comfy, grew 
at a rate of 18% year-on-year and 
posted an all-time high revenue of 
₹128 crore. The brand continues 
to gain share in the markets it 
operates in by building on robust 
consumer demand for affordable, 
high-quality sanitary pads. The 
Company is investing in a sanitary 
napkin converting plant that will 
be commissioned by Q4 of FY2026. 
This strategic investment will 
offer flexibility in supply chains, 
operational efficiencies, and product 
innovations that are expected 
to result in brand profitability 
by FY2027.
Our rehydration and health-focused 
beverage brand, Electro+, saw new 
launches in the WHO-ORS segment. 
The industry as a whole faces 
regulatory changes that are acting 
as a short-term headwind. We are 
focusing on consumer education to 
deliver long-term, sustained growth 
in this segment. We strongly believe 
electrolyte drinks, as a category, 
will have great acceptance owing to 
environmental and lifestyle changes.
A small but significant strategic 
move saw the Company deploy a 
team of medical representatives to 
promote our brands with doctors. 
We believe this will drive brand 
equity and awareness of existing 
and new brands, and support overall 
organizational growth. 
Digitization continues to be one of 
our core strategic pillars. During the 
year under review, we successfully 
deployed SAP’s transportation 
module to digitize our supply chain 
up to the stockist point. We are 
seeing the deployment of AI in 
marketing and data mining, and we 
wish to expand its uses further to 
enhance operational efficiencies and 
drive innovation.
Driven by our commitment to social 
responsibility, our CSR program 
deploys profits from the Company to 
positively touch the lives of millions.

As Amrutanjan looks ahead, our vision remains anchored in the 
values that have defined us for over 132 years: trust, wellness, 
and innovation. 
In an ever-evolving health landscape, we see opportunity not just to grow, but 
to lead with empathy, agility, and insight. From scaling our presence in global 
markets to deepening our digital and product ecosystems, our focus is on building 
a future that honours our legacy while embracing the possibilities of tomorrow. 
Rooted in nature and the art of wellness, every step forward is guided by a single 
promise: to continue delivering relief that is relevant, responsible, and real.
A Century of Care,
A Future of Possibilities
Women’s Hygiene: 
Comfy
The women’s hygiene segment, 
Comfy, continues to be one of 
Amrutanjan’s fastest-growing 
categories, recording an 18% growth 
in FY2025. This growth is driven by 
the success of XL and Slimfit variants, 
as the brand is well-positioned for 
further expansion, especially with 
category penetration still below 40%. 
With its captive manufacturing unit 
expected to go live by Q4 FY2026, 
gross margins are projected to 
improve from 33% to 40%.
Rehydration: Electro+
The rehydration segment, mainly 
comprising Electro+, recorded a 10% 
growth despite facing regulatory 
and pricing challenges in the ORS 
segment. With a diversified range, 
including WHO-approved liquids 
and powders, Amrutanjan is focusing 
on consumer education and scientific 
credibility to ensure long-term 
category resilience and relevance.
Pain Management
Despite being one of the oldest 
categories, topical pain relief 
still offers untapped potential. 
Amrutanjan aims to deepen its 
presence through wider distribution, 
growth in roll-ons and sprays, and 
more accessible pack formats. The 
body pain portfolio, now contributing 
₹50 cr and 15% to Amrutanjan’s 
pain segment, is expected to triple 
by FY2028, marking a strong, long-
term commitment to comprehensive 
pain care.
Digital and  
Channel Focus
With 60% of its critical processes 
now digitized through SAP and allied 
platforms, Amrutanjan is becoming 
more agile and insight-led. The 
Company will continue to invest in 
e-commerce, general trade, modern 
trade, and quick commerce to stay 
aligned with evolving consumer 
behaviours, while improving 
operational efficiency and sustaining 
margin growth.

4.4% volume growth. While this performance was slightly 
subdued compared to the previous year (7.5% vs. 8.5%), 
price-led growth in FY2025 was notably higher than in MAT 
March 2024.
The industry showcased remarkable resilience in Q4 
FY2025, delivering 11% value growth compared to the 
same quarter in the previous year, its highest quarterly 
growth of the year. Notably, the sector’s unit growth 
outpaced its volume growth during the quarter, reflecting 
strong consumer demand through smaller pack sizes.
Rural markets remained the primary growth driver, 
outperforming urban markets for the fourth consecutive 
quarter. In Q4 FY2025, rural growth was around three times 
faster than urban growth, where consumption continued 
to soften.
From a channel perspective, traditional trade, which 
accounts for nearly 90% of the FMCG market, continued to 
be the key growth engine, especially in the last two quarters 
of the fiscal year, underscoring its enduring relevance in 
reaching the Indian consumer.

Indian Consumer Healthcare Industry
The Indian Consumer Health (CH) market is valued at 
$14bn, growing at 2.5x the global CAGR, OTC being the 
largest contributor (around 60%), followed by nutrition, 
personal care, and patient care categories.
The forecast for 2028 is that the Indian OTC market is 
expected to grow nearly twice the Global consumer health 
market and is expected to gain 1% share of the global 
consumer health market and 3% within APAC (4% global 
share and 14% in APAC in 2023)
Source : IQVIA
The Indian Consumer Healthcare (CHC) industry continued 
its robust growth trajectory in FY2025, supported by 
increasing consumer awareness, expanding product 
accessibility, and a rising preference for preventive and 
self-care solutions. According to IQVIA, the CHC market 
sustained healthy momentum, driven by heightened 
demand in categories such as pain management, digestive 
health, immunity boosters, and wellness supplements.
Urbanization, rising disposable incomes, and a shift 
in lifestyle patterns have further propelled category 
penetration, with millennials and Gen Z emerging as 
key adopters of health and wellness products. The 
post-pandemic focus on preventive healthcare has also 
strengthened the industry’s fundamentals, with consumers 
increasingly seeking OTC (over-the-counter) solutions and 
Ayurvedic/herbal alternatives for everyday health concerns.
From a distribution perspective, the industry benefited 
from omnichannel expansion, which combined the reach 
of traditional retail with the convenience of e-commerce 
and quick commerce platforms, witnessing rapid adoption 
across both metro and non-metro markets. Rural markets, 
aided by improved supply chain penetration and targeted 
awareness programs, contributed meaningfully to 
volume growth.

in six years after the COVID-19 surge in FY2022. This

Company Overview
Over-the-Counter (OTC) Business Performance
In FY2025, the Company’s Over-the-Counter (OTC) 
segment delivered gross sales of ₹462.48 crore, reinforcing 
its position as a key driver of overall performance. General 
Trade (GT) continued to be the dominant contributor, 
accounting for 84.6% of OTC turnover and registering 
a healthy 8.0% growth over FY2024. This growth was 
underpinned by a strong revival in the Headache category, 
with momentum largely driven by the Chemists channel. 
Notably, Amrutanjan Headache outperformed the overall 
category growth in value terms within this channel, a 
testament to the brand’s enduring consumer trust, visibility, 
and preference.
In parallel, the Company’s sustained investments in 
Modern Trade (MT) and E-Commerce yielded measurable 
results, with both channels increasing their contribution 
in OTC sales. These emerging channels not only provided 
incremental revenue streams but also expanded the 
Company’s reach to evolving consumer segments and 
shopping formats.

Category-Wise Performance
The Headache segment remained the cornerstone of 
AHCL’s domestic sales in FY2025, contributing ₹261.89 
crore, which represents 57.6% of the total domestic 
revenue of ₹454.29 crore. While the segment maintained 
its leadership position, its share witnessed a marginal dip 
due to accelerated growth in other categories, reflecting 
the Company’s strategic intent to broaden its portfolio.
The Women’s Hygiene category recorded robust 
performance, with its revenue contribution increasing from 
26% to 28% of domestic sales. This growth was driven by 
the flagship brand Comfy, which maintained its position as 
the second-largest contributor to the Company’s portfolio. 
Comfy achieved an 18% year-on-year growth, with revenues 
rising to ₹127.79 crore from ₹108.24 crore in FY2024, 
underscoring its brand strength and category relevance.
The Body category emerged as the third-largest segment 
within the OTC business, posting sales of ₹43.62 crore in 
FY2025. Its contribution to domestic revenue improved 
slightly from 9.2% to 9.6%, supported by steady consumer 
demand and increasing category acceptance.
The OTC business continues to benefit from AHCL’s 
multi-brand, multi-category strategy, which balances the 
strength of its legacy Headache portfolio with emerging 
high-growth segments such as Women’s Hygiene and 
Body Care. Strategic channel development, especially 
in MT and E-Commerce, is expected to further enhance 
penetration, category reach, and revenue diversification in 
the coming years.

Pain Management
Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) 
Strategy
In line with its commitment to strengthening the 
pain management portfolio, AHCL implemented a 
comprehensive Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) 
plan. This multi-channel approach leveraged television, 
print, in-shop branding, digital platforms, and large-
scale sampling to extend brand reach and drive consumer 
engagement. The overarching objective was to highlight 
the superior efficacy of the Company’s pain management 
solutions, thereby driving consideration and trials.
Brand Communication – ‘Har Dard Mitaye’ 
Campaign
During the year, AHCL developed a new communication 
idea for the Amrutanjan mother brand and launched the 
television campaign ‘Har Dard Mitaye’. Purpose-led and 
emotionally resonant, the TVC celebrated the power of 
simple acts of kindness, portraying relatable scenarios 
where individuals endure physical discomfort to help others. 
The campaign was rolled out across key states, marking one 
of the highest media investments ever for the brand.

Consumer Engagement through Sampling
Product sampling remained a cornerstone of AHCL’s 
consumer engagement strategy, enabling first-hand 
experience of its product efficacy and quality. Large-scale 
sampling initiatives were undertaken across:
•	 High footfall public areas
•	 Religious and pilgrimage sites
•	 Gated residential communities
•	 IT parks, targeting working professionals
Through these initiatives, the Company reached 
approximately 4 lakh consumers during the year, driving 
trial, strengthening recall, and fostering long-term 
brand adoption.
Visibility: Strengthening In-Store Presence
As part of its ongoing efforts to enhance brand presence at 
the retail level, AHCL strategically deployed Point-of-Sale 
Materials (POSM) across the country.
A focused initiative was undertaken to promote extra power 
balm (yellow balm), supported by the installation of high-
visibility displays in high-footfall retail outlets. These 
striking displays effectively drew consumer attention at the 
point of purchase, reinforced brand identity, and maximized 
impact in the competitive retail environment. This initiative 
played a key role in driving engagement and boosting 
offtake at the store level.

In line with its strategic objective to deepen penetration 
in lower-town classes, AHCL intensified its focus on the 
grocer channel for Amrutanjan Faster Relaxation Roll-On 
(AFRR). Recognising the need for affordable, accessible 
solutions for this consumer segment, the Company 
introduced a 2.5 ml low unit pack to drive trials.
The new pack was launched in a hanger format, improving 
on-shelf visibility and facilitating impulse purchase at the 
retail level.

Rural Van Operations: Expanding Rural Reach
In alignment with Amrutanjan’s strategic objective of 
enhancing rural market penetration, the Company launched 
targeted van operations across key states — Tamil Nadu, 
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Jharkhand.
Through this outreach, approximately 1,000 villages 
were successfully reached, introducing the Amrutanjan 
product range to previously untapped rural consumers. 
These villages are now slated for transition into regular 
coverage areas, ensuring sustained presence and long-
term engagement.
As a direct outcome of these initiatives, the Pain 
Management category witnessed notable growth in rural 
markets, with its contribution to overall AHCL revenues 
increasing in FY2025, underscoring the effectiveness of 
this targeted rural expansion.
All these integrated efforts enhanced brand recall, 
deepened consumer connection, and reinforced AHCL’s 
leadership in the pain management category.
Women’s Hygiene
Market Landscape & Opportunity
Menstrual hygiene remains a critical public health and social 
development issue in India. With an estimated category 
penetration of only 46%, and usage heavily concentrated in 
urban areas, more than half of women, particularly in rural 
India, still rely on unhygienic alternatives due to limited 
access, affordability barriers, and low awareness about the 
benefits of sanitary napkins.
This structural gap presents a significant long-term growth 
opportunity for affordable, quality sanitary napkins that can 
reach underserved markets.
Brand Performance: Comfy Sanitary Napkins
Amrutanjan’s flagship brand in women’s hygiene, Comfy, 
continues to bridge this gap by offering affordable, high-
quality menstrual hygiene solutions tailored to the needs 
of rural and lower-income urban consumers.
Key Highlights
•	 Retail reach: ~5 lakh outlets, with rural accounting for 
60% of distribution.
•	 Sales growth: +18% YoY, driven by strong 
penetration gains.
•	 Variant performance: XL variant up 59%, reflecting 
consumer preference for longer pads.
•	 Brand health metrics: Awareness, consideration, and 
usage all recorded notable year-on-year improvements.
These results reaffirm Comfy’s positioning as a high-impact, 
inclusive brand, contributing to both category expansion 
and women’s health outcomes.
Strategic Marketing & Consumer Engagement
Brand Building
•	 Continued partnership with Shraddha Kapoor as brand 
ambassador, amplifying the ‘The Power to Be You’ 
campaign in a fresh, modern voice.
•	 Regional marketing activation in Tamil Nadu with a 
popular local celebrity to deepen cultural resonance.
•	 Project Disha (5th consecutive year): On-ground 
awareness and sampling across Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, 
Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.
•	 Impact: Over 1.5 lakh students reached through 
menstrual hygiene education sessions and product trials, 
driving long-term behaviour change.
Innovation & Product Diversification
Recognising the widespread reliance on oral medication 
for menstrual pain – often with side effects, Amrutanjan 
launched the Comfy Period Pain Relief Roll-On:
•	 Ayurvedic, side-effect-free, topical solution—the first of 
its kind in India.
•	 Awareness driven through targeted college outreach 
in Chennai and Bangalore, in partnership with 
qualified gynaecologists.
•	 Reach: ~20,000 students engaged through product 
education and sampling.
•	 This innovation extends Comfy’s relevance beyond 
hygiene into holistic period care.
Visibility & Last-Mile Reach
To strengthen market presence and ensure availability in 
underserved regions:
•	 In-store activations and POS visibility tools (including 
product hangers) boosted retail enquiries and 
brand recall.
•	 Rural Van Program launched in Andhra Pradesh & 
Telangana to expand retail coverage, enhance availability, 
and deepen penetration in untapped geographies.

Outlook
With category penetration in India still under 50%, the 
long-term growth potential remains structurally attractive. 
Amrutanjan’s strategy for Comfy is anchored on:
1. 
Rural-first distribution expansion.
2.	
Sustained education-led adoption programs.

Rehydration Category: Electro+
Market Context and Health Relevance
The increasing impact of global warming characterized 
by rising temperatures and extreme weather events, 
has heightened the public health risks associated with 
dehydration and heat stress. Loss of fluids and electrolytes, 
particularly under high-heat conditions, can lead to a 
range of adverse health outcomes, including cognitive 
dysfunction, fatigue, malnutrition, chronic kidney disease, 
and heatstroke.
Despite growing awareness, the penetration of rehydration 
solutions in India remains low. Additionally, consumer 
confusion between WHO-formulated Oral Rehydration 
Salts (ORS) and rehydration beverages continues to pose 
a challenge, underscoring the need for sustained education 
on appropriate hydration solutions.
Product Proposition
Amrutanjan Electro+ is designed as a comprehensive 
rehydration solution to address these evolving health 
challenges. Each 200 ml bottle delivers a scientifically 
balanced blend of electrolytes, glucose, and Vitamin 
C, meeting 50% of the recommended daily allowance 
of Vitamin C. Uniquely formulated with a real fruit juice 
base, Electro+ is available in Apple, Orange, and Lemon 
flavors, offering both functionality and consumer appeal 
for everyday hydration needs.
Portfolio Expansion: Addressing Both General and 
Therapeutic Hydration Needs
AHCL expanded the Electro+ portfolio to address hydration 
requirements across usage occasions:
WHO-recommended ORS Formula introduced in two 
convenient formats:
•	 Tetra Pack – Ready-to-drink solution in apple and orange 
flavours for quick, on-the-go rehydration.
•	 Powder Format – Orange flavour for flexible home 
preparation and dosage control, particularly in medical 
or recovery settings.
 
 
TETRA PAK  
 
    SACHET (Powder) 
This expansion enables Electro+ to cater to both general 
lifestyle hydration and therapeutic needs, reinforcing its 
positioning as a holistic rehydration brand.
Affordability and Accessibility
In line with AHCL’s mission of wellness accessibility, the 
Company introduced Electro+ in a 160 ml pack at ₹25, 
available in apple and orange flavours. This strategic pricing 
was aimed at expanding penetration in smaller towns and 
making premium-quality hydration solutions available to a 
broader demographic.

Tour Partner status for the Professional Golf Tour of India 
(PGTI), enabling on-site sampling across multiple events.

Women Hygiene
In the women’s hygiene category, Comfy sanitary napkins 
have shown strong momentum, delivered through a 
successful private label partnership. This initiative has 
propelled the brand to cross ₹130 crore in revenue

issues also for the material supply issues in many times.
During the entire year, the shipping delays also disrupted 
most of the imported materials supply chain. Also, the same 
got impacted due to very frequent geopolitical situations 
across the globe.
However, due to the favorable reduction in crude oil 
prices and unfavorable bullish forex rates, with our best 
procurement strategies applied in sourcing of essential oils, 
Menthol crystals, paraffin waxes and polymers resulted us 
a substantial savings of ₹425 lakh in FY2025.
Apart from the above, we had marginal cost impact in 
sourcing some of our raw materials like sugar, Glucose, 
Orange juice concentrates etc., for various domestic and 
international reasons.
Additionally, as a part of an ESG initiative, we had 
modified our one of the molds for the reduction the plastic 
consumption to the extent of 25 Te per annum.
We maintained the continual materials availability 
throughout the year to meet the production requirements 
with meticulous planning and excellent coordination with 
the vendors at all times. The inventories of all materials are 
very well maintained for uninterrupted production despite 
many fluctuations. This also resulted in the limited stock-
out situation and seamless flow of the materials.
Logistics
For FY2025, we worked towards optimising over all freight 
cost to the company. We could reduce the overall freight 
by optimising Comfy's primary and secondary freight by 
carrying out the activities mentioned below.
•	 Reengineered comfy secondary carton to utilize the full 
capacity of the truck
•	 Increasing the number of packs in the secondary carton
•	 Long-term contracts and meticulous negotiation helped 
us to optimize the freight

Research & Development, Quality, and Safety
Our Research and Development team adheres to a Quality 
by Design (QbD) approach in the development of new 
products that are both efficacious and provide significant 
value to our customers. Our flagship products have 
undergone comprehensive clinical studies, which validate 
their efficacy and safety. Furthermore, we actively explore 
innovative technologies in the design of our packaging to 
enhance our competitive advantage.
Amrutanjan Health Care Limited prioritizes quality in all 
facets of our operations, guided by a steadfast commitment 
to quality management principles. Our foremost objective 
is to ensure the well-being of our consumers by adhering 
to stringent regulatory standards and consistently meeting 
their expectations for safety, quality, and performance in 
all our products.
To accomplish this, we have implemented standardized 
quality management systems at all our operational 
sites. These systems are designed to eliminate defects 
and enhance productivity, operating under the Good 
Manufacturing Practices outlined in the Indian Drugs 
& Cosmetics Act. Our Quality Management System 
for the Over-The-Counter (OTC) division and the Food 
Safety Management System for the Food and Beverage 
(F&B) division are aligned with ISO standards, further 
underscoring our dedication to quality and safety.
We are committed to building quality and safety into our 
products at every stage of production. This entails rigorous 
evaluation and continual monitoring of our suppliers and 
materials, as well as a keen focus on delivering the highest 
quality output to ensure consumer satisfaction.
We have established a robust Quality Management System 
(QMS) that spans the entire spectrum of our operations, 
encompassing research and development, raw material 
procurement, manufacturing, packaging, and delivery. This 
comprehensive approach ensures that quality is ingrained 
in every aspect of our business.
To demonstrate our unwavering commitment to quality and 
food safety, our management systems undergo rigorous 
annual audits by TUV certification bodies, ensuring ongoing 
compliance with established standards.
Furthermore, we have recently inaugurated a cutting-edge 
manufacturing facility for Allopathic products, equipped 
with advanced manufacturing and testing equipment in 
compliance with cGMP regulations. Products outlined in 
the USFDA OTC Monograph guidelines will be registered 
with the USFDA, enabling us to export these products to 
the USA and other nations.
World of Amrutanjan (WOA) Stores
AHCL’s World of Amrutanjan Stores are one-of-a-kind 
experience stores which invite consumers to try, buy and 
provide feedback on all Amrutanjan products. These 
concept stores at Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Chennai are 
supported by modern infrastructure and applications for 
quick billing and payment transactions using any of the 
online payment modes of convenience. The WOA Stores 
are under CCTV surveillance for improved user safety.
Information Technology
Our Go-Digital and Go-Global vision is the central theme 
for our digital transformation journey and adds value to 
AHCL customers and stakeholders alike.
SAP Enterprise process supports and controls our core 
functions and all areas critical for our business. General 
IT control plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the system 
controls are maintained and followed diligently. During 
FY2025, the SAP system process for Manufacturing, Supply 
Chain and Logistics, and Financial Accounting was refined 
and aligned with the business goals. Our transportation 
management module underwent improvements for further 
reduction of freight and transportation charges and it 
was deployed across multiple AHCL locations. Many of 
the manual business processes were replaced with SAP 
automated controls and benefits we observed in the 
overall business operations. Revalidating Segregation of 
Duties (SOD) ensured relevant user access control and 
authorization. Disaster Recovery, Backup & Restoration 
and maintaining Audit Trails was IT’s some of the priority 
activities. Proof of Delivery (ePOD) system went live and 
efforts are made to ensure that our stockiest confirms 
the timely receipt of goods and is also able to report any 
issues or concerns regarding supply which are noted and 
actioned immediately to address the specific concerns and 
promotes satisfaction.
Sales Force Automation (SFA) is one of the key foundation 
pillars and we are committed to continuously improve the 
same. We completed the implementation of the SFA for 
Modern Trade. We also completed the pilot deployment 
of Distributor Management System (DMS) across our 
distributors and stockists. User feedback from the DMS 
pilot has also been incorporated and the commercial 
deployment will be rolled out in due course.
We are in constant vigil of the internal and external threats 
and risks to Information systems. We continue to assess 
Amrutanjan’s security posture as information security 
continue to be our priority. We conducted Vulnerability and 
Penetration Testing (VAPT) of our environment, network, 
and applications. Regular security awareness trainings were 
conducted to ensure AHCL users are aware of the phishing 
and other social security threats and acts appropriately. 
With the deployment of various state-of-the-art defensive 
mechanisms like Bitlocker, End Point Detection (EDR), 
latest firewall, log analyzers and other partner tools, 
we were successful in minimizing our risk exposure. 
Information security requires continuous improvement and 
we are continuously modernizing our systems to ensure we 
provide a safe and secure environment for our employee 
and our customers.
Ongoing Initiatives
SAP Payroll and Travel and Reimbursement Automation is 
planned for the current year.
AHCL has formed a core team for exploring business 
goals and benefits which can be delivered through 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for 
our customers and stakeholders. We are in the process of 
training our employees and preparing the action plan for

(e) Risk and Concern
A risk is a potential event or non-event, the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of which can adversely affect the objectives 
or strategy of the Company or result in opportunities being 
missed. Risk is measured in terms of the likelihood of 
occurrence and potential impact if it materializes. COVID-19 
remains a potential risk, with any new variant potentially 
leading to hospitalizations and lockdowns, causing 
hardship for the population and disrupting the progress of 
the economic resurgence. The two greatest risks for the 
economy at this stage stem from inflationary pressures and 
supply-side concerns.
The unpredictable fluctuation in key raw material prices, 
risk of new product launches not panning out, supply chain 
disruptions, and major changes in government policies and 
regulations are some of the long-term risks associated 
with the business. At Amrutanjan, risks are classified under 
preventive, strategic, and external categories.
Risk Management
Risk management is a structured, consistent, and continuous 
process across the organization for identifying, assessing, 
and making decisions on responses to, and reporting on 
opportunities and threats that may affect the achievement 
of the Company’s objectives. Risk management does not aim 
to eliminate risks, as that would simultaneously eliminate 
all chances of rewards or opportunities. Instead, constant 
efforts are made to analyze their potential impact, assess 
the changes to the risk environment, and define actions to 
mitigate any adverse impacts.
Amrutanjan Health Care Limited (AHCL) has implemented 
a risk management framework that ensures timely 
identification, analysis, and assessment of risks and 
potential consequences, formulation of specific mitigation 
strategies, and their seamless execution. The framework 
recognizes that risks are highly interconnected and 
interdependent. This evolved approach views risks 
within a coordinated and strategic framework, integrated 
throughout the organization.
The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by 
the Chairman & Managing Director and comprises three 
Non-executive Directors, the CFO, and the COO, monitors 
organization-wide risk management activities and reports 
biannually to the Board of Directors.
(f) Internal Control Systems and their 
Adequacy
The adequacy of the internal control systems and key 
processes is audited quarterly in selected areas by qualified 
external auditors and is reported to the Audit Committee. 
The follow-up action is reverted on, with a timeline 
and status.
Statutory compliances are monitored through a fully 
automated compliance monitoring tool, and a quarterly 
compliance dashboard is presented to the Board.
The Company has also established an in-house Internal 
Audit wing, reporting to the Chairman and Managing 
Director (CMD) for conducting audits, internal checks 
on processes, and providing suggestions for further 
improvements in the areas audited. This team coordinates 
with the Internal Auditors to ensure the successful closure 
of their audit observations. The Internal Auditors have a 
free right to access all required information. The Audit 
Committee functions independently, with complete access 
to the Internal Auditors and Statutory Auditors.
The Audit Committee continues to monitor the effectiveness 
of internal control over the use of new technologies that 
impact the financial controls and reporting the risks.

and comprehensive framework.
The system empowers management to effectively identify 
high and low performers, ensuring that rewards and 
recognition are aligned with merit and performance, and 
that the right talent is acknowledged and nurtured.
Learning and Development
At Amrutanjan, we follow a systematic approach to 
identifying learning and development (L&D) needs. 
These are derived through performance reviews and in 
close consultation with function and department leaders, 
ensuring that development initiatives are aligned with both 
individual and organizational goals.
Given our culturally diverse workforce, we prioritize regular 
refresher training programs on the Code of Conduct 
to reinforce ethical standards across the organization.

both in-person and virtually, ensuring comprehensive 
coverage and compliance.
We have also rolled out training programs on:

A key focus of our L&D strategy has been on enhancing the

skills and work habits. These programs were tailored 
to address real-time challenges and elevate overall 
performance in the field.
Occupational Health and Safety

demonstrated a high level of safety performance, with zero 
fatalities reported during the year — a testament to our 
strong safety culture.

Outlook
The Indian FMCG industry is poised for steady growth in 
FY 2025–26, supported by a resilient domestic economy, 
improving rural consumption, and a gradual recovery in 
discretionary spending. While inflationary pressures in key 
commodity categories have moderated, stable pricing and 
continued demand for essentials are expected to sustain 
momentum. Rural markets, which have consistently 
outpaced urban growth in recent quarters, are likely 
to remain the primary growth driver, aided by higher 
agricultural output, government-led rural development 
programs, and improving income levels.
Urban markets are projected to witness moderate 
but steady expansion, with premiumisation, health & 
wellness trends, and digital commerce adoption shaping 
consumption patterns. E-commerce and quick commerce 
channels are expected to deliver high growth, enhancing 
product accessibility and convenience for consumers. 
Traditional trade will continue to dominate the distribution 
landscape, while modern trade formats will strengthen 
their contribution in urban centres.
Category growth will be supported by innovations 
in smaller, affordable packs to drive penetration. The 
integration of digital marketing, data-led consumer insights, 
and localized product strategies will be key enablers for 
sustaining growth.
To summarize, the following will be the growth enablers 
to drive growth
Rural penetration
Product affordability
Format innovation
Omni-channel engagement

OF 
GOVERNANCE
	
Amrutanjan is committed itself to honesty and 
accountability. The commitment is reflected in all 
business activities of the Company besides reflecting

government, etc. The Directors and the Senior 
Management Personnel are expected to conduct

of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the Code 
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India together with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Description of Key Audit Matter
Revenue recognition- See note 3(J) and 22 to the financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from sale of 
goods. The principal products of the Company comprise 
pain management, congestion management, beverages 
and Women’s hygiene that are mainly sold through 
stockists.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognized on transfer of 
control of the products to the customer. The Company 
uses a variety of shipment terms across its operating 
markets and this has an impact on the timing of revenue 
recognition. The performance obligations in the contracts 
may be fulfilled at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon 
formal customer acceptance depending on contract terms.
There is a risk that revenue could be recognized at a time 
which is different from transfer of control especially for 
sales transactions occurred on and around the reporting 
period. In view of this and since revenue is a key 
performance indicator of the Company, we have identified 
timing of the revenue recognition as a key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:
1.  Assessed 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
Company’s 
accounting policy for revenue recognition as per relevant 
accounting standard.
2. 	 Obtained an understanding of the Company's sales 
process and evaluated design and implementation of 
key internal controls in relation to the timing of revenue 
recognition. We also tested the operating effectiveness 
of such controls for a sample of transactions with special 
reference to controls over revenue recognized on and 
around the year end.
3. 	 For a sample of sale transactions selected using statistical 
sampling, performed detailed testing and in particular 
examined whether these are recognised in the period in 
which control is transferred. This included examination of 
the terms and conditions of the customer orders including 
the shipping terms, transporter documents and customer 
acceptances, as applicable.
4. 	 Performed analytical procedures on current year revenue 
based on trends and where appropriate, conducting further 
enquiries and tests to identify unusual transactions.
5. 	 We also tested sample journal entries for revenue 
recognised during the year, selected based on specified 
risk-based criteria, to identify unusual transactions.
Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the annual report, 
but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s 
report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made 
available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.
Management's and Board of Directors'/Board 
of Trustees' Responsibilities for the Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of 
the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, 
profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and 
Board of Directors of the Company / Board of Trustees of 
the ESOP trust are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company / 
ESOP trust and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the respective 
Management and Board of Directors / Board of Trustees 
are responsible for assessing the ability of the Company / 
ESOP trust to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the respective 
Board of Directors/Board of Trustees either intends to 
liquidate the Company / ESOP trust or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors / Board of Trustees are 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process 
of the Company / ESOP trust.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.)
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparation of financial statements and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the financial statements of 
Amrutanjan Health Care Limited for the year ended 31 March, 2025
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of 
even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of Amrutanjan Health 
Care Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in 
conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of 
the Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements and such internal financial controls 
were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based 
on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of such internal 
controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance 
Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 
Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements were established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements include 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the financial statements of 
Amrutanjan Health Care Limited for the year ended 31 March, 2025 (Contd.)
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only 
in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Reporting entity
	
Amrutanjan Health Care Limited (“AHCL” / “the 
Company”) was incorporated on September 9, 1936, 
with its registered office situated at Chennai, Tamil 
Nadu, India. The Company is engaged in the business 
of manufacture, supply, sale of products in pain 
management, congestion management, beverages 
and hygiene and services in pain management. The 
Company is a public listed company with its equity 
shares listed on National Stock Exchange of India 
Limited (NSE) in India.
2	
Basis of preparation
A.	 Statement of compliance
 
The financial statements comply in all material aspects 
with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified 
under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 
Act) [Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015] as amended from time to time and presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS Compliant Schedule III) 
and other relevant provisions of the Act.
 
The financial statements were approved for issue by 
the Company’s Board of Directors on May 15, 2025.
 
Details of the Company’s accounting policies are 
included in note 3.
B.	 Functional and presentation currency
 
Items included in the financial statements of the 
Company are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates ('the functional currency'). The financial 
statements are presented in Indian Rupee (`), which 
is Company's functional and presentation currency.
 
All amounts disclosed in these financial statements 
and notes have been rounded off to the nearest 
Rupees in lakhs, unless otherwise stated.
C.	 Basis of measurement
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for the following items.
Items
Measurement basis
Non derivative Financial 
instruments at FVTPL
Fair value
Net defined benefit 
(asset)/ liability
Fair value of plan assets less 
present value of defined 
benefit obligations
D.	 Use of estimates and judgments
 
In preparing the financial statements, management 
has made judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised prospectively.
	
Judgements
	
Information about judgements made in applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant 
effects on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements is included in the following notes:
 
Note 3(M), 3(R), 18 and 34 – provision for income tax 
litigations and related contingent liabilities.
	
Note 3(K) and 33 - lease term: whether the Company 
is reasonably certain to exercise extension options.
	
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
	
Information about assumptions and estimation 
uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting 
in a material adjustment in the year ended March 31, 
2025 is included in the following notes:
 
Note 3(D) – estimated useful life of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets;
 
Note 7 – measurement of Expected credit loss ('ECL') 
allowance for trade receivables: key assumptions in 
determining the weighted-average loss rate.
 
Note 17 – measurement of defined benefit assets and 
obligations: key actuarial assumptions;
 
Note 34 – recognition and measurement of provisions 
and contingencies: key assumptions about the 
likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources;
 
Note 31 – recognition of deferred tax assets: availability 
of future taxable profit against which deferred tax 
assets will be recovered in future periods;
 
Note 32 – fair valuation of financial assets; and
 
Note 33 – measurement of right-of-use assets and 
lease liabilities
E.	
Measurement of fair values
 
A number of the Company’s accounting policies and 
disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for 
both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
 
The Company has an established control framework 
with respect to the measurement of fair values. The 
Chief Financial Officer has overall responsibility for 
overseeing all significant fair value measurements.
 
The Chief Financial Officer regularly reviews significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. 
If third party information, such as broker quotes or 
pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the 
Chief Financial Officer assesses the evidence obtained 
from the third parties to support the conclusion that 
these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, 
including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which 
the valuations should be classified.
	
Significant valuation issues are reported to the 
Company’s audit committee.
	
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a 
fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the 
valuation techniques as follows:
 
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices).
	
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
	
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, 
the Company uses observable market data as far as 
possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value 
of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the 
fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement 
is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is 
significant to the entire measurement.
	
The Company recognises transfers between levels 
of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting 
period during which the change has occurred.
	
Further information about the assumptions made 
in measuring fair values is included in note 32 
– financial instruments and note 30- Employee 
stock compensation
3	
Material accounting policies
A.	 Operating cycle
	
Based on the nature of products and the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalent, the Company 
has considered 12 months as the operating cycle .
B.	 Foreign currency transactions
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded 
by the Company at their functional currency spot rates 
at the date of the transaction.
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Exchange 
differences that arise on settlement of monetary 
items or on reporting at each balance sheet date 
are recognised as income or expenses in the period 
in which they arise. Non-monetary items which are 
carried at historical cost denominated in a foreign 
currency are reported using the exchange rates at 
the date of transaction. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured based on historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange 
rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency 
exchange differences are generally recognised in profit 
or loss.
C.	 Financial instruments
i)	
Recognition and initial measurement
	
Trade receivables are initially recognised when they 
are originated. All other financial assets and financial 
liabilities are initially recognised when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
 
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without 
a significant financing component) or financial liability 
is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an 
item not at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to its 
acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a 
significant financing component is initially measured 
at the transaction price.

ii)	
Classification and subsequent measurement
	
Financial assets:
 
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as 
measured at:
	
−amortised cost;
	
−fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI)
	
−fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period 
the Company changes its business model for 
managing financial assets, in which case all affected 
financial assets are reclassified on the first day of 
the first reporting period following the change in the 
business model.
 
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it 
meets both of the following conditions and is not 
designated as at FVTPL:
	
a) 	
the asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets to collect contractual 
cash flows; and
 
b)  the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
A debt investment is measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income if it meets both the 
following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
	
a) 	
the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets; and
 
b)  the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
 
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not 
held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect 
to present subsequent changes in the investment’s 
fair value in OCI (designated as FVOCI – equity 
investment). This election is made on an investment 
by investment basis.
 
All financial assets not classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are 
measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the 
Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset 
that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured 
at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing 
so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting 
mismatch that would otherwise arise.
	
Financial assets: Business model assessment
 
The Company makes an assessment of the objective of 
the business model in which a financial asset is held at 
a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the 
business is managed and the information is provided 
to management. The information considered includes:
	
−the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio 
and the operation of those policies in practice;
	
−these include whether management strategy 
focuses on earning contractual interest, maintaining 
a particular interest rate profile, matching the 
duration of financial assets to the duration of any 
related liabilities or expected cash outflows or 
realising cash flows through the sale of assets;
	
−how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated 
and reported to the Company's management;
	
−the risk that affect the performance of the business 
model (and the financial assets held with in the 
business model) and how those risks are managed;
	
−how managers of the business are compensated;
	
−the frequency, volume and timing of sales of 
financial assets in prior period, the reasons for such 
sales and expectations about future sales activity.
	
Financial assets that are held for trading or are 
managed and whose performance is evaluated on fair 
value basis are measured at FVTPL.
	
Financial assets: Assessment whether contractual 
cash flows are solely payments of principal and 
interest
	
For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is 
defined as the fair value of the financial asset on 
initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration 
for the time value of money and for the credit risk 
associated with the principal amount outstanding 
during a particular period of time and for other basic 
lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.
	
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows 
are solely payments of principal and interest, the 
Company considers the contractual terms of the 
instrument. This includes assessing whether the 
financial asset contains a contractual term that could 
change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows 
such that it would not meet this condition. In making 
this assessment, the Company considers:
	
−contingent events that would change the amount 
or timing of cash flows;
	
−terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, 
including variable interest rate features;
	
−prepayment and extension features; and
	
−terms that limit the Company's claim to cash flows 
from specified assets
	
A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely 
payments of principal and interest criterion if the 
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid 
amounts of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable 
additional compensation for early termination of 
the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset 
acquired at a significant discount or premium to its 
contractual par amount, a feature that pertains or 
requires prepayment at an amount that substantially 
represents the contractual par amount plus accrued 
(but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also 
include reasonable additional compensation for 
early termination) is treated as consistent with this 
criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is 
insignificant at initial recognition.
	
Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains 
and losses
Financial 
assets at 
FVTPL
These 
assets 
are 
subsequently 
measured at fair value. Net gains and 
losses, including any interest or dividend 
income, are recognised in statement of 
profit and loss.
Financial 
assets at 
amortised 
cost
These 
assets 
are 
subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. The amortised 
cost is reduced by the impairment losses. 
Interest 
income, 
foreign 
exchange 
gains and losses and impairment are 
recognised in statement of profit and 
loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition 
is recognised in statement of profit and 
loss.
Equity 
investments 
at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured 
at fair value. Dividends are recognised 
as income in profit or loss unless the 
dividend clearly represents a recovery of 
part of the cost of the investment. Other 
net gains and losses are recognised in 
OCI and are not reclassified to statement 
of profit and loss.
	
Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent 
measurement and gains and losses
	
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified 
as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for trading, or it 
is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial 
liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net 
gains and losses, including any interest expense, are 
recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Interest expense and 
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised 
in statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on 
derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit 
and loss.
iii)	 Derecognition
	
Financial assets:
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the 
contractual cash flows in a transaction in which 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset are transferred or in which the 
Company neither transfers nor retains substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not 
retain control of the financial asset.
	
If the Company enters into transactions whereby it 
transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but 
retains either all or substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred 
assets are not derecognised.
	
Financial liabilities:
 
The Company derecognises a financial liability when 
its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, 
or expired.
 
The Company also derecognises a financial liability 
when its terms are modified and the cash flows under 
the modified terms are substantially different. In this 
case, a new financial liability based on the modified 
terms is recognised at fair value. The difference 
between the carrying amount of the financial liability 
extinguished and the new financial liability with 
modified terms is recognised in profit or loss.
iv)	 Offsetting
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, 
and only when, the Company currently has a legally

enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends 
either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
D.	 Property, plant and equipment
i)	
Recognition and initial measurement
 
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment 
including capital work-in-progress shall be recognised 
as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Company and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. Items of property, plant and equipment 
are measured at cost, (which includes capitalised 
borrowing costs, if any) less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
 
Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment 
comprises its purchase price, including import duties 
and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting 
trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable 
cost of bringing the item to its working condition for 
its intended use.
	
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant 
and equipment comprises the cost of materials and 
direct labour, any other costs directly attributable 
to bringing the item to working condition for its 
intended use.
 
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and 
equipment have different useful lives, then they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) 
of property, plant and equipment.
	
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is recognised in statement of 
profit and loss.
ii)	
Subsequent expenditure
 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company.
iii)	 Transition to Ind AS
 
The cost property, plant and equipment at April 01, 
2016, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, 
was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognized as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), 
as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
iv)	 Depreciation
	
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of 
property, plant and equipment less their estimated 
residual values over their estimated useful lives 
using the straight-line method, and is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. Freehold land is 
not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of items 
of property, plant and equipment for the current and 
comparative periods (in years) are as follows:

Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight 
line basis over the useful life of the asset or the lease 
period whichever is lower.
	
Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate. Based on technical 
evaluation and consequent advice, the management 
believes that its estimates of useful lives as given above 
best represent the period over which management 
expects to use these assets.
	
Depreciation on additions (disposals) is provided on a 
pro-rata basis i.e. from (up to) the date on which asset 
is ready for use (disposed of).
E.	
Intangible assets
i)	
Intangible assets
 
Intangible assets (including those acquired by the 
Company in a business combination, if any) are 
initially measured at cost. Such intangible assets are 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
ii)	
Subsequent expenditure
 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied in the 
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, 
including expenditure on internally generated goodwill 
and brands, is recognised in statement of profit and 
loss as incurred.
iii)	 Transition to Ind AS
 
The cost Intangible assets at April 01, 2016, the 
Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined 
with reference to its carrying value recognised as per 
the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of 
transition to Ind AS.
iv)	 Amortisation
	
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of 
intangible assets less their estimated residual values 
over their estimated useful lives using the straight-
line method, and is included in depreciation and 
amortisation in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets for 
the current and comparative periods (in years) are 
as follows:
Asset category
Management estimate  
of useful life
Computer software
3 - 10
	
Amortisation method, useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed at the end of each financial year and 
adjusted if appropriate.
v)	
Intangible assets under development
	
Intangible assets under development includes 
intangible assets which are in process of being ready 
for its intended use and it is probable that the expected 
future economic benefits that are attributable to the 
asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset 
can be measured reliably.
F.	
Inventories
	
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the 
weighted average cost basis and includes expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or 
conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing 
them to their present location and condition. Costs 
incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for as follows:
 
Raw materials and packing materials: Cost includes 
cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Cost is determined on weighted average cost basis.
	
Finished goods: Cost includes cost of direct materials 
and labour and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on the actual operating capacity 
for variable overheads and normal capacity for 
fixed overheads.
	
Traded goods: Cost includes cost of purchase and 
other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost is determined on 
weighted average basis.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less the estimated 
costs of completion and selling expenses. The net 
realisable value of work-in-progress is determined 
with reference to the selling prices of related finished 
products. Raw materials, components and other 
supplies held for use in the production of finished 
products are not written down below cost except in 
cases where the material prices have declined and it 
is estimated that the cost of the finished products will 
exceed their net realisable value. The comparison of 
cost and net realisable value is made on an item-by-
item basis.
G.	 Impairment
i)	
Impairment of trade receivables and financial 
assets
	
The Company recognises loss allowances for 
expected credit losses on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost.
	
At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether 
financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit 
impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when 
one or more events that have a detrimental impact on 
the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
have occurred.
 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired 
includes the following observable data:
	
−significant financial difficulty of the borrower or 
issuer;
	
−a breach of contract such as a default or past dues;

−the restructuring of a loan or advance by the 
Company on terms that the Company would not 
consider otherwise;
	
−it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy 
or other financial reorganisation; or
	
−the disappearance of an active market for a security 
because of financial difficulties.
	
Loss allowances for trade receivables are always 
measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected 
credit losses.
 
Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit 
losses that result from all possible default events over 
the expected life of a financial instrument.
 
12-month expected credit losses are the portion of 
expected credit losses that result from default events 
that are possible within 12 months after the reporting 
date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the 
instrument is less than 12 months).
 
In all cases, the maximum period considered when 
estimating expected credit losses is the maximum 
contractual period over which the Company is exposed 
to credit risk.
 
When determining whether the credit risk of a 
financial asset has increased significantly since initial 
recognition and when estimating expected credit 
losses, the Company considers reasonable and 
supportable information that is relevant and available 
without undue cost or effort. This includes both 
quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, 
based on the Company’s historical experience and 
informed credit assessment and including forward 
looking information.
 
The Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial 
asset has increased significantly if it is more than 90 
days past due.
 
The Company considers a financial asset to be in 
default when:
	
−the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations 
to the Company in full, without recourse by the 
Company to actions such as realising security (if 
any is held); or
	
−the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.
ii)	
Measurement of expected credit losses
 
Expected credit losses are a probability weighted 
estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured 
as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the 
difference between the cash flows due to the Company 
in accordance with the contract and the cash flows 
that the Company expects to receive).
	
Presentation of allowance for expected credit 
losses in the balance sheet
 
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at 
amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying 
amount of the assets.
	
Write-off
 
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is 
written off (either partially or in full) to the extent 
that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is 
generally the case when the Company determines that 
the debtor does not have assets or sources of income 
that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the 
amounts subject to the write off. However, financial 
assets that are written off could still be subject to 
enforcement activities in order to comply with the 
Company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.
iii)	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
At each reporting date, the Company reviews its 
non-financial assets(other than inventories, contract 
assets, and deferred tax assets) to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated.
	
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together 
into the smallest group of assets that generates 
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or 
Cash Generating Units ("CGUs").
	
The recoverable amount of an individual asset or 
CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair 
value less costs of disposal. Value in use is based 
on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
	
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They 
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the 
carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a 
pro rata basis.
	
In respect of other assets for which impairment loss 
has been recognised in prior periods, the Company 
reviews at each reporting date whether there is any 
indication that the loss has decreased or no longer 
exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only to 
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
H.	 Employee benefits
i)	
Short-term employee benefits
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-
monetary benefits that are expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related service are 
recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the 
end of the reporting and are measured at the amounts 
expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
The liabilities are presented as current employee 
benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
ii)	
Defined contribution plans
 
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and will have 
no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. The Company makes specified monthly 
contributions towards Government administered 
provident fund scheme. Obligations for contributions 
to defined contribution plans are recognised as an 
employee benefit expense in statement of profit and 
loss in the periods during which the related services 
are rendered by employees.
iii)	 Defined benefit plans
	
A defined benefits plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. 
The Company’s net obligation in respect of defined 
benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan 
by estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in the current and prior 
periods, discounting that amount and deducting the 
fair value of any plan assets.
	
The calculation of defined benefit obligation is 
performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. When the calculation 
results in a potential asset for the Company, the 
recognised asset is limited to the present value 
of economic benefits available in the form of any 
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future 
contributions to the plan (‘the asset ceiling’). In 
order to calculate the present value of economic 
benefits, consideration is given to any minimum 
funding requirements.
 
Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability, 
which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return 
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect 
of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are 
recognised in OCI. The Company determines the net 
interest expense / (income) on the net defined benefit 
liability / (asset) for the period by applying the discount 
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation 
at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net 
defined benefit liability / (asset), taking into account 
any changes in the net defined benefit liability / 
(asset) during the period as a result of contributions 
and benefit payments. Net interest expense and 
other expenses related to defined benefit plans are 
recognised in statement of profit and loss.
 
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a 
plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that 
relates to past service (‘past service cost’ or ‘past 
service gain’) or the gain or loss on curtailment is 
recognised immediately in statement of profit and 
loss. The Company recognises gains and losses on 
the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the 
settlement occurs.
	
Gratuity
 
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit 
retirement plan (the "gratuity plan") covering eligible 
employees. The plan provides payment to vested 
employees at retirement, death or termination of 
employment, of an amount based on the respective 
employee's salary and the tenure of employment 
with the Company. The Company provides the 
gratuity benefit through annual contribution to a fund 
managed by the Life Insurance corporation of India 
('LIC") and PNB MetLife India Insurance Co Ltd. Under 
this scheme the settlement obligation remains with 
the Company although the LIC administers the scheme 
and determines the contribution premium required 
to be paid by the Company. Liabilities related to the

gratuity plan are determined and accrued by actuarial 
valuation using projected unit credit method by an 
independent actuary as at the balance sheet.
iv)	 Other long-term employee benefits - 
compensated absences
 
Accumulated absences expected to be carried 
forward beyond twelve months is treated as long-
term employee benefit for measurement purposes. 
The Company’s net obligation in respect of other 
long-term employee benefit of accumulating 
compensated absences is the amount of future 
benefit that employees have accumulated at the end 
of the year. That benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value The obligation is measured annually 
by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit 
method. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or 
loss in the period in which they arise.
	
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in 
the balance sheet if the Company does not have an 
unconditional right to defer the settlement for at least 
twelve months after the reporting date.
v)	
Share-based compensation
 
The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based 
payment awards granted to employees is recognised 
as an employee expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employees 
unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The 
amount recognised as expense is based on the estimate 
of the number of awards for which the related service 
and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be 
met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as 
an expense is based on the number of awards that 
do meet the related service and non-market vesting 
conditions at the vesting date.
vi)	 Treasury shares
	
The Company has created a Trust, Amrutanjan Health 
Care Limited ESOP trust (herein after known as "ESOP 
Trust"), for administration of share-based payment 
to its employees. Own equity instruments that are 
reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost 
and deducted from equity. When the treasury shares 
are issued to the employees by the trust, the amount 
received is recognised as an increase in equity and the 
resultant gain / (loss) is transferred to / from reserves.
I.	
Provisions (other than for employee benefits)
	
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, 
the Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows (representing the best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the present obligation 
at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessment of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognised as finance cost. Expected 
future operating losses are not provided for.
J.	
Revenue
	
The Company earns revenue from sale of products 
in pain management, congestion management, 
beverages, women's hygiene and others. The 
Company also earns revenue from sale of services in 
pain management.
	
Disaggregation of revenue
	
The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts 
with customers by the nature of sale i.e. manufactured 
and traded goods and based on the reporting segments 
based on the information reviewed by the CODM. The 
Company believes that this disaggregation is the 
best description on how the nature, amount, timing 
and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are 
affected by industry, market and other economic 
factors. Also refer note 22.
	
Variable consideration
	
If the consideration in a contract includes the variable 
amount, the Company estimates the amount of 
consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange 
for transferring the goods to the customer. The 
variable consideration is estimated at contract 
inception and constrained until it is highly probable 
that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of 
cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the 
associated uncertainty with the variable consideration 
is subsequently resolved.
	
Stockist incentives, claims and schemes
	
Arrangements with customers includes a provision for 
stockist incentives, discount schemes and claims. In 
those instances, where there is a valid expectation from 
the customers to receive a incentive / discount / recover 
claims, the amount of variable consideration which is 
included in the transaction price may be constrained, 
unless included in the net sales price only to the extent 
that it is probable that a significant reversal in the 
amount of the cumulative revenue recognised under 
the arrangement will not occur in a future period. The 
Company applies the most likely amount method for 
determining the stockist incentives, discount schemes 
and claims.
	
Contract balances
	
Contract assets
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration in 
exchange for goods or services transferred to the 
customer. If the Company performs by transferring 
goods or services to a customer, before the customer 
pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract 
asset is recognised for the earned consideration that 
is conditional.
	
Trade receivables
	
A receivable represents the Company's right to an 
amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only 
the passage of time is required before payment of the 
consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of 
financial assets - note 3C - financial instruments - 
initial recognition and subsequent measurement.
	
Contract liabilities
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods 
or services to a customer for which the Company has 
received consideration (or an amount of consideration 
is due) from the customer. If a customer pays 
consideration before the Company transfers goods 
or services to the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made or the payment 
is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are 
recognised as revenue when the Company performs 
under the contract.
	
Performance obligations and revenue recognition 
policies
	
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of 
promised products or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration which the 
Company expects to receive in exchange for those 
products or services.
	
The following details provides information about the 
nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance 
obligations in contracts with customers, including 
significant payment terms, and the related revenue 
recognition policies.
i)	
Sale of goods and services
	
Nature and timing of satisfaction of performance 
obligations, including significant payment terms
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when 
control of the products being sold is transferred to our 
customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled 
obligations, depending on individual terms. The 
performance obligations in our contracts are fulfilled at 
the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer 
acceptance depending on customer terms. Revenue 
towards satisfaction of performance obligation is 
measured at the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration) allocated to that performance 
obligation. The transaction price of the goods sold 
and services rendered is net of variable consideration 
on account of stockist incentives, discount schemes 
and claims offered by the Company as part of the 
contract and any taxes or duties collected on behalf 
of the Government such as goods and services tax, etc. 
Accumulated experience is used to estimate provision 
for stockist incentives, discount schemes and claims. 
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable 
a significant reversal will not occur. Invoice are usually 
payable within the mutually agreed credit period 
depending on individual customer terms.
	
Revenue from services is recognised in the accounting 
period in which the services are rendered.
ii)	
Export incentives
 
Export incentives are recognized when the right 
to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is 
established in respect of the exports made and when 
there is no significant uncertainty regarding the 
ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.
	
Determination of transaction price and allocation 
to performance obligations
	
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, 
which is the consideration, adjusted for stockist 
incentives, discount schemes and claims if any, as 
specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue 
also excludes taxes collected from customers.
	
Refer note 22 for reconciliation of revenue recognised 
with contracted price.
K.	 Leases
	
The Company assesses whether a contract contains 
a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or 
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether 
a contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2)

(All amounts are in Indian Rupees lakhs)
the Company has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period of 
the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct 
the use of the asset.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short-term 
leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and 
low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease 
payments as an operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
	
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, 
which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the 
commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct 
costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount(i.e. The higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use)
is determined on an individual asset basis unless the 
asset does not generate cashflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the country 
of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Company changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or 
a termination option.
	
The Company determines its incremental borrowing 
rate by obtaining interest rates from various external 
financing sources and makes certain adjustments 
to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the 
asset leased.
	
Lease payments included in the measurement of the 
lease liability comprise the following:
•	 fixed 
payments, 
including 
in-substance 
fixed payments;
•	 variable lease payments that depend on an index or 
a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as 
at the commencement date;
•	 amounts expected to be payable under a residual 
value guarantee; and
•	 the exercise price under a purchase option that 
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, 
lease payments in an optional renewal period if 
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an 
extension option, and penalties for early termination 
of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain 
not to terminate early.
	
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising from 
a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in 
the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to 
be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the 
Company changes its assessment of whether it will 
exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or 
if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.
	
The Company presents right-of-use assets that do not 
meet the definition of investment property in ‘property, 
plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities separately in 
the balance sheet within ‘Financial Liabilities’.
	
Lease liability and right-of-use asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as financing cash flows.
L.	
Recognition of interest income or expense
 
Interest income or expense is recognised using the 
effective interest method.
 
The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts 
through the expected life of the financial instrument to:
	
−the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
	
−the amortised cost of the financial liability.
 
In calculating interest income and expense, the 
effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying 
amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-
impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.
 
However, for financial assets that have become credit-
impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest 
income is calculated by applying the effective interest 
rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the 
asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation 
of interest income reverts to the gross basis.
M.	 Income tax
 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is 
recognised in statement of profit and loss except to 
the extent that it relates to a business combination 
or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
i)	
Current tax
 
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or 
receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year 
and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in 
respect of previous years. The amount of current tax 
reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected 
to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, 
if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax 
rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date.
 
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are 
offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to 
realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis 
or simultaneously.
ii)	
Deferred tax
 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried 
forward tax losses and tax credits.
 
Deferred tax is not recognised for:
	
(a) 	 temporary differences on the initial recognition of 
assets or liabilities in a transaction that:
	
−is not a business combination; and
	
−at the time of the transaction
 
 
(i)  affects neither accounting nor taxable profit 
or loss and
 
 
(ii)  does not give rise to equal taxable and 
deductible temporary differences
	
(b) 	 temporary differences related to investments in 
subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements 
to the extent that the Company is able to control 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is probable that they will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future; and
 
(c)  taxable temporary differences arising on the 
initial recognition of goodwill.
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax 
losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which they 
can be used. Future taxable profits are determined 
based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary 
differences. If the amount of taxable temporary 
differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax 
asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted 
for reversals of existing temporary differences, are 
considered, based on the business plans for individual 
subsidiaries in the Company. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions 
are reversed when the probability of future taxable 
profits improves.
 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date. The measurement of deferred 
tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the Company expects, at 
the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying 
amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, 
the carrying amount of investment property is 
presumed to be recovered through sale.

Notes to the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts are in Indian Rupees lakhs)
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities 
and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by 
the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on 
different tax entities, but they intend to settle current 
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax 
assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
N.	 Operating segment
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) of the 
Company. The CODM is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments of the Company. For the disclosure on 
reportable segments see note 36.
O.	 Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and Cash equivalents for the purpose of Cash 
Flow Statement comprise cash and cheques in hand, 
bank balances, demand deposits with banks where 
the original maturity is three months or less and other 
short term highly liquid investments.
P.	
Earnings per share
	
Basic Earnings Per Share
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing 
the profit (or loss) attributable to the owners of the 
Company by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year. The weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the year is adjusted for bonus issue, bonus element in 
a rights issue to existing shareholders, share split and 
reverse share split (consolidation of shares).
	
Diluted Earnings Per Share
	
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the 
profit (considered in determination of basic earnings 
per share) after considering the effect of interest and 
other financing costs or income (net of attributable 
taxes) associated with dilutive potential equity shares 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
considered for deriving basic earnings per share 
adjusted for the weighted average number of equity 
shares that would have been issued upon conversion 
of all dilutive potential equity shares.
Q.	 Current/ Non-current classification
 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if 
their carrying amount is intended to be recovered 
principally through a sale (rather than through 
continuing use) when the asset (or disposal group) is 
available for immediate sale in its present condition 
subject only to terms that are usual and customary 
for sale of such asset (or disposal group) and the 
sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from 
the date of classification.
 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are 
measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell.
R.	 Contingent liability
	
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from 
past events and whose existence will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events not wholly within the 
control of the entity or a present obligation that arises 
from past events but is not recognized because it is 
not probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be 
measured with sufficient reliability. The Company 
does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses 
its existence in the financial statements.
S.	
Recent pronouncements
 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 
31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance 
Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, 
relating to sale and leaseback transactions, applicable 
to the Company w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Company has 
reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its 
evaluation has determined that it does not have any 
significant impact in its financial statements.

* The Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision 
matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience based on : a) Past trend of outstanding receivables over a 
rolling period of past 24 months and b) actual amount of outstanding receivables as on the reporting date. Trade receivables are generally 
on credit terms of 0 to 45 days based on the type of customer.
	
There are no unbilled receivables, hence the same is not disclosed in the ageing schedule. There are no trade receivables 
from related parties as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024. The Company's exposure to credit and currency risks 
and loss allowance related to trade receivables are disclosed in Note 32.

B. 	 Nature and purpose of reserves
	
a) 	 Capital redemption reserve
 
 
The Company has recognised Capital redemption reserve on buyback of equity shares from its retained earnings. 
The amount in this reserve is equal to nominal amount of the equity shares bought back.
	
b) 	 General reserve
 
 
The Company has transferred a portion of the net profit of the Company before declaring dividend to General 
reserve pursuant to the earlier provisions of Companies Act, 1956.
	
c) 	 Retained earnings
 
 
Retained earnings are the profits that the Company has earned till date, less any transfers to general reserve, 
capital redemption reserve, dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders.
	
d) 	 Share based payment reserve
 
 
The Company has established equity settled share based payment plans for certain categories of employees of 
the Company. Refer note 30 for further details on this plan.
	
e) 	 Treasury shares
 
 
When the ESOP trust purchases the Company's ordinary shares, the consideration paid including any directly 
attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or 
reissued. When treasury shares are sold or reissued, the amount received is recognized as an increase in equity, 
and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to / from the securities premium.
	
f) 	 Dividends

15	 Capital management
 
The Company’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and 
to sustain future development of the business. It sets the amount of capital required on the basis of annual business 
and long-term operating plans which include capital and other strategic investments. The funding requirements are 
met through equity and cash generated through operations. The Company does not have any external borrowings. 
The Company monitors capital using a ratio of ‘adjusted net debt’ to ‘total equity’. For this purpose, adjusted net debt 
is defined as total liabilities, comprising provisions, financial liabilities, other current liabilities less cash and cash 
equivalents. Total equity comprises all components of equity.
 
The Company’s adjusted net debt to equity ratio is as follows:

The Company operates the following post-employment defined benefit plans.
 
 
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan in India, governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The 
plan entitles an employee, who has rendered at least five years of continuous service, to gratuity at the rate 
of fifteen days wages for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months, based on the 
rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned. These defined benefit plans expose the Company to 
actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market (investment) risk. The plan is managed through 
"Amrutanjan Health Care Limited Employees Gratuity Fund". The funds maintained by "Amrutanjan Health Care 
Limited Employees Gratuity Fund" represent plan assets for the Company.
	
	
A. 	 Funding
 
 
 
The plan is fully funded by the Company. The funding requirements are based on the gratuity fund’s actuarial 
measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plan. The funding of plan is based on a separate 
actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions set out 
in (E). Employees do not contribute to the plan. The Company expects to pay `222.02 to defined benefit 
plan in 2025-26.
	
	
B. 	 Reconciliation of the net defined benefit liability

C. 	 Financial risk management
 
 
The Company's business activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, namely credit risk, liquidity risk 
and market risk. The Company's management has the overall responsibility for establishing and governing the 
Company's risk management framework. The Company's risk management policies are established to identify 
and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set and monitor appropriate risk limits and controls, periodically 
review the changes in market conditions and reflect the changes in the policy accordingly. The key risks and 
mitigating actions are also placed before the audit committee of the Company.
	
	
i. 	
Credit risk
 
 
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from Company's trade receivables and other 
financial assets.
 
 
 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure which is as follows:

 24,437.71 
	
	
	
Investments
 
 
 
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in debt securities and minimum investment 
being made in equity instruments. The credit worthiness of the counterparties of the investments made are 
evaluated by the management on an ongoing basis and is considered to be good with low credit risk.
	
	
	
Trade receivables
 
 
 
The Company has developed guidelines for the management of credit risk from trade receivables. The 
Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The 
demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer 
operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment.
 
 
 
Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and monitoring the creditworthiness 
of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company 
establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of the 
Company's trade receivables.
 
 
 
Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Company to 
determine incurred and expected credit losses.

Other financial assets
 
 
 
Other financial assets comprises of deposits with bank and financial institutions and interest accrued on such 
deposits These deposits are held with credit worthy banks and financial institutions. The credit worthiness of 
such banks and financial institutions are evaluated by the management on an ongoing basis and is considered 
to be good with low credit risk.
 
 
 
Other financial assets also comprise of export benefits receivable and rental deposits given to lessors and 
Electricity deposit given to Electricity Board. The Company is confident of collection the amounts and is 
considered to good with low credit risk. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance 
by these counter parties.
	
	
ii. 	 Liquidity risks
 
 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with 
its financial liabilities. The Company approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient 
funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management 
considers both normal and stressed conditions.
 
 
 
Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service and finance the financial liabilities on a 
day-to-day basis.
 
 
 
The Company regularly monitors the rolling forecasts to ensure that it has sufficient cash on an on-going 
basis to meet operational needs. Any short term surplus cash generated, over and above the amount 
required for working capital management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and cash 
equivalents (to the extent required) and any excess is invested in interest bearing term deposits and other 
highly marketable debt investments with appropriate maturities to optimise the cash returns on investments 
while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities.
 
 
 
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractually 
agreed undiscounted cash flows along with its carrying value as at the balance sheet date.

iii. 	 Market risks
 
 
 
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash flows that may result from a 
change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result 
of changes in the interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk 
sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including 
foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to 
foreign exchange rate risk (currency risk).
	
	
iv. 	 Currency risk
 
 
 
The Company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is mismatch between the currencies in 
which sales, purchase are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Company.
 
 
 
Foreign currency risk arise in transactions mainly from export of OTC products and import of raw materials 
and packing materials that gives rise to exchange rate fluctuation risk.

* excluding interest and penalty
	
(i) 	 Pending resolution of the respective proceedings, it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of 
cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above as it is determinable only on receipt of judgements/decisions pending 
with various forums/authorities. The Company has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has 
adequately provided for where provisions are required and disclosed as contingent liabilities where applicable, 
in its financial statements. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially 
adverse effect on its financial position.
	
(ii) 	 Lease rent in respect of lease hold land has been revised by Government of Tamil Nadu with retrospective effect 
from November, 2001. The Company has contested the said revision before the Madras High court in writ petition.
	
(iii) 	 During the earlier year, the Company had paid an amount of `11 to the Commissioner, Panchayat Union Thiruporur 
and during the prior years, the Company had paid an amount of `14.6 to Mamalapuram Urban Housing as 
contribution towards Tamil Nadu State Shelter Fund and an amount of `19.60 towards obtaining DTCP 
(Department of Town and Country Planning) approval for one of its Factories located in Alathur, Chennai, based 
on demand from the department. With respect to the above, the amounts payable towards property tax and other 
fees, are yet to be ascertained by the relevant authorities and the final assessment order is yet to be received 
by the Company. The Company could not ascertain reasonably the further amount payable and hence has been 
disclosed as contingent liability.
 
(iv)  In light of recent judgment of Honourable Supreme Court dated February 28, 2019 on the definition of “Basic 
Wages” under the Employees Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952, there are significant 
uncertainties in determining the liability including, period of assessment, application of present and past 
employees and assessment of interest and penalties. Considering these interpretive challenges, the amount 
of the obligation could not be measured with sufficient reliability for past periods and hence disclosed as a 
contingent liability.
