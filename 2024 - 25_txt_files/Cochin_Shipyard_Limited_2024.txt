Risk
Majority of the ship 
building 
projects 
undertaken by CSL 
are fuelled by fossil 
fuels. The increasing 
awareness 
of 
climate 
change 
across the globe will 
reduce the demand 
for 
such 
vessels 
and 
affect 
the 
operations of CSL.
CSL has embarked on Green Shipping 
initiatives. CSL has already built and 
delivered India’s first indigenously built 
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Catamaran Vessel. 
Further, CSL has also built and delivered 
2 Autonomous Electric Vessels for ASKO 
Maritime AS, Norway. The 67 Mtr. Long 
vessels were delivered as Full-Electric 
Transport 
Ferries 
powered 
by 
1846 
kWh capacity battery. CSL has built and 
delivered 19 out of 23 Hybrid Electric 
Catamaran Hull Vessels for the Kochi 
Water Metro Project, which is one of its 
kind, modern, technologically advanced, 
energy efficient and environment friendly 
vessel. CSL has built and delivered 2 out 
of 8 Hybrid Electric Catamaran Passenger 
Vessels for Inland Waterways Authority 
of India. Further, CSL is also building 2 
Commissioning Service Operation Vessels, 
2 Zero Emission Feeder Container Vessels 
and 2 Hybrid Service Operation Vessels for 
various European clients.

Increase in demand

Aligned with the global shift towards 
maritime green transitions, the Company 
has developed and built India’s first 
indigenous Hydrogen Fuel Cell Catamaran 
Vessel, a pioneering project funded by the 
Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways 
(MoPSW). This pilot project, based on Low 
Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane 
(LT-PEM) technology - also known as Fuel 
Cell Electric Vessel (FCEV) was spearheaded 
by CSL’s C-SAS division in collaboration with 
KPIT Technologies Limited, which handled 
the technological aspects of the design, 
development, 
and 
construction. 
This 
initiative is part of India’s broader efforts to 
embrace innovative, sustainable, and cost-
effective alternative fuel technologies. The 
project was executed in collaboration with 
Indian partners.

CSL leading the charge in Green Shipping 
initiatives to reduce marine pollution. 
As part of these green initiatives, CSL is 
constructing 23 Hybrid Electric Catamaran 
Hull Vessels for the Kochi Water Metro 
Project. This project represents a modern, 
technologically advanced, energy-efficient, 
and environmentally friendly solution that 
will enhance the urban water transport 
system, providing seamless transportation 
for Kochi’s citizens. Further, CSL is also 
building 8 Hybrid Electric Catamaran 
Passenger Vessels for Inland Waterways 
Authority of India. CSL’s dedication to 
green initiatives is further evidenced 
by its delivery of two Autonomous

CSL is planning to operate entirely on green energy by implementing a wind-solar hybrid power plant with a total capacity 
of approximately 14 MW and expanding rooftop solar installations inside CSL from 1.8 MWp to 4 MWp in a phased manner.
The implementation of wind-solar hybrid power plant is currently dependent on the acquisition of land, which is inherently 
time-consuming due to procedural complexities. As a result, at present, a definitive timeline for completion of the project 
cannot be ascertained. Further, the aforesaid expansion of rooftop solar installations inside CSL is expected to be completed 
by 2029.
These initiatives are expected to generate around 40 million units of renewable electricity annually, exceeding CSL’s current 
average annual energy consumption.
By transitioning to renewable energy sources, CSL aims to eliminate its Scope 2 emissions, reaffirming its commitment to 
sustainable energy practices. This strategy will significantly reduce CSL’s carbon footprint and contribute more towards a 
sustainable future.

The Company had reported its commitment to set up a wind-solar hybrid power plant. While the project has been approved 
by the Board of Directors, its execution is dependent on procurement of suitable land parcel. Since land acquisition is typically 
a time-intensive process due to procedural and regulatory complexities, at present, a definitive timeline for completion of the 
project cannot be ascertained. 
Governance, Leadership & Oversight

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements
	
CSL is committed to addressing the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) challenges facing the industry and aligning 
with India’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2070. As a CPSU under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, CSL 
has taken significant steps to contribute to sustainable development.
	
CSL is advancing sustainable maritime solutions through various initiatives. We have delivered India’s first Hydrogen Fuel Cell 
Catamaran Vessel to the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and have so far delivered 19 out of 23 Hybrid Electric 
Catamaran Hull Vessels for the Kochi Water Metro Project. Additionally, we have delivered two Autonomous Electric Vessels 
to Norway and are currently constructing vessels for European clients, including Commissioning Service Operation Vessels, 
Zero Emission Feeder Container Vessels, and Hybrid Service Operation Vessels. Furthermore, we are building eight Hybrid 
Electric Catamaran Hull Vessels for IWAI, of which two have already been delivered. All these vessels are designed for electric 
propulsion, reducing their environmental impact.
	
In our commitment to renewable energy, CSL is setting up a wind-solar hybrid power plant with a total capacity of about 14 MW. 
This project will generate more green energy than our current average annual consumption, enabling CSL to operate entirely 
on renewable energy and significantly reduce our carbon footprint.
	
These efforts reflect CSL’s dedication to sustainable practices and our role in driving the maritime industry’s green transition.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
The Occupational Health and Safety Management System at Cochin Shipyard, known as the HSE Governance System, fosters a 
positive safety culture by encouraging employees to adhere to safe work practices. To reinforce this commitment, employees are 
rewarded monthly and on National Safety Day for their safe actions. Each employee group selects a Field Safety Representative 
(FSR) to oversee workplace safety. Additionally, a dedicated team of approximately 250 Safety and Fire staff continuously 
monitor activities on vessels, workshops, and skids. These staff members are responsible for issuing work permits as needed 
and issuing violation tokens when unsafe practices are observed.

COCHIN SHIPYARD LIMITED
	
The commitment of top management to safety is further demonstrated through weekly walk-throughs and monthly pep talks 
at worksites by Section Heads, General Managers, and Chief General Managers. CSL meticulously evaluates its subcontractors 
based on their HSE performance and mandates adherence to CSL’s rigorous HSE policies and standards. CSL collaborate closely 
with our subcontractors, ensuring they are equipped with the requisite resources and training to execute their tasks safely. 
Continuously monitoring their HSE performance, CSL provide constructive feedback to facilitate improvement.
	
Recognizing the significance of subcontractors' HSE performance, CSL has implemented a robust evaluation process to 
ensure alignment with CSL’s HSE standards and regulations. The HSE Star rating represents the annual performance of CSL 
subcontractors in terms of Health, Safety, and Environment aspects. Additionally, an HSE and sustainability management 
supplier code of conduct has been published for suppliers.

* This is because the Company operates in the shipbuilding and ship repair industry, where the nature of output - such as ships and offshore 
structures - varies significantly in type, size, complexity, and scope from project to project. As a result, there is no uniform or comparable measure of 
physical output that would enable meaningful calculation of intensity ratios.
