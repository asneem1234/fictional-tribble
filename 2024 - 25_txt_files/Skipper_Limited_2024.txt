1
Climate 
Change 
and Energy 
Management
Risk 
Opportunity
Energy and climate change 
present 
both 
risks 
and 
opportunities for Skipper 
Limited due to its energy-
intensive 
manufacturing 
and EPC operations. Rising 
energy 
costs, 
power 
disruptions, and potential 
carbon taxes could impact 
operational efficiency and 
margins, especially in steel 
fabrication and galvanizing 
processes. 
Climate-related 
disruptions such as extreme 
weather events can delay 
project execution timelines.
Transition to a low-carbon 
economy 
opens 
up 
opportunities in renewable 
energy 
infrastructure, 
and green EPC projects. 
Strengthening 
energy 
management and aligning 
with climate policies can 
enhance 
competitiveness 
and attract sustainability-
focused 
clients 
and 
investors.
a.	
Implemented waste-to-resource 
initiatives to minimize landfill 
dependency. Ensures regulatory 
compliance and cost savings 
through material reuse.
b.	
Replaced LDO (Light Diesel Oil) 
with LPG, reducing emissions 
(SOx, NOx, PM) and improving 
combustion 
efficiency. 
Lower 
carbon footprint and compliance 
with stricter air quality regulations.
c.	
Shifted from conventional CO₂ to 
Argon-CO₂ blends in processes, 
reducing greenhouse gas impact. 
Enhances process efficiency while 
lowering Scope 1 emissions.
d.	
Conducted energy audits to 
identify hotspots and optimize 
consumption. Proactively reduces 
energy waste and operational 
costs
e.	
Prioritized IE4/IE5 motors over 
standard models for better energy 
performance. Ensures long-term 
savings and alignment with global 
efficiency standards.
f.	
Rooftop 
sheet-based 
daylight 
harvesting systems installed in 
work areas to maximize use of 
natural lighting, achieving 250–
300 LUX during daytime without 
electricity, significantly reducing 
energy demand from artificial 
lighting

Water and 
Effluent 
Management
Risk
Skipper's 
operations 
in 
Uluberia, 
Barunda 
are 
located in water-stressed 
areas, and water availability 
may pose a significant risk 
to business operations. The 
potential impacts include:
a. 	
Reduced 
operational 
capacity 
utilization, 
leading to productivity 
losses.
b. 	 Legal 
disputes 
that 
could 
damage 
the 
company’s reputation 
and credibility.
Failure 
to 
comply 
with 
effluent treatment will pose 
regulatory risk to Skipper.
Additionally, 
water-related 
conflicts with stakeholders 
may arise.
a. 	
Uluberia unit has installed state-of-
the-art systems to treat greywater 
from galvanizing, rolling mills, 
and polymer processing. Treated 
water is reused for non-potable 
purposes such as:
- GI-acid dilution
- Machine cooling
- I ndustrial cleaning
- Landscape irrigation
b. 	 Introduced real-time smart water 
metering and monitoring systems 
across production lines to track 
consumption and identify high-
usage areas. Data-driven insights 
allow us to optimize water 
efficiency and reduce wastage.
c. 	
Galvanizing 
and 
rolling 
mill 
operations 
at 
Uluberia 
have 
achieved freshwater neutrality, 
saving fresh water daily.
d. 	 Skipper's STP uses zero-sludge, 
chemical-free biotechnology with 
engineered bacteria.
	y
Utilizes 
engineered 
bacteria 
to break down organic waste 
without producing sludge (unlike 
conventional 
methods 
like 
activated sludge processes).
	y
The treated water is reused within 
the facility (e.g., cooling, cleaning, 
irrigation, or industrial processes).
	y
Integrates wastewater treatment 
with 
broader 
corporate 
environmental strategies (e.g., 
net-zero water usage, reduced 
carbon footprint)

Waste
Risk
Improper management of 
waste poses operational, 
environmental, 
and 
reputational risks for Skipper. 
Non-compliance with waste 
disposal norms can result in 
regulatory penalties, legal 
liabilities, and operational 
disruptions. 
Additionally, 
poor 
waste 
handling 
practices 
may 
lead 
to 
environmental degradation, 
affecting local ecosystems 
and community health.
Skipper is committed to minimizing 
environmental and regulatory risks 
through efficient waste and pollution 
management practices, with a focus 
on circularity, reduction at source, and 
operational improvements. Key actions 
include:
a.	
Waste Management & Circularity
b.	
Reduction in hazardous waste 
generation 
through 
process 
optimization 
and 
material 
substitution (e.g., reduced zinc 
usage).
c.	
Effective segregation, safe storage, 
and disposal of waste as per 
CPCB/SPCB norms; regular filings 
including Form 10 are maintained.
d.	
Plastic waste is recycled and 
reintroduced as raw material.
e.	
Wastewater is treated and reused 
within plant operations, reducing 
freshwater demand.
f.	
Continuous efforts to recover 
and recycle materials internally 
and through authorized partners, 
promoting 
circular 
economy 
principles.
Negative
4
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Adherence to strong ethical 
standards is essential to 
maintaining 
stakeholder 
confidence and regulatory 
compliance.
Skipper believes that any 
ethical conduct such as non-
compliance, corruption, or 
lack of transparency pose 
significant legal, financial, 
and reputational risks to the 
company.
Skipper 
has 
implemented 
a 
comprehensive Code of Conduct for 
its Board, Senior Management, and 
employees, and Supplier Code of 
Conduct for its suppliers, covering key 
principles such as governance, conflict 
of interest, confidentiality, equality, 
legal 
compliance, 
and 
financial 
transparency.
During the year, internal audits of 
control mechanisms were conducted 
to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-
bribery and corruption safeguards. 
These included reviewing procurement 
processes, financial approvals, and 
third-party interaction.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Ensuring the health and 
safety of employees is a 
critical business imperative 
for Skipper. Any lapse in 
maintaining safe working 
conditions 
can 
lead 
to 
serious 
consequences, 
including workplace injuries 
or illnesses that disrupt 
operations 
and 
reduce 
overall efficiency.
A lack of focus on safety can 
also undermine employee 
morale and trust.
Beyond operational impacts, 
the Company may face 
increased legal exposure, 
including 
compensation 
claims, medical costs, and 
litigation.
Skippers 
have 
a 
strong 
OHS 
management system. The company 
implements the following for its

safety 
are 
fundamental 
to 
sustaining 
customer 
confidence, 
meeting 
regulatory 
requirements, 
and 
maintaining 
a 
reputation in the market. 
Any 
compromise 
in 
these areas may result in 
operational 
disruptions, 
financial 
penalties, 
legal 
liabilities, or loss of business.

Human Rights
Risk
Respect for human rights is 
critical for Skipper, given its 
labour-intensive operations. 
Ensuring fair labor practices, 
safe 
working 
conditions, 
and respect for community 
rights is essential for legal 
compliance, workforce well-
being, and securing social 
license to operate.

8
Data Security, 
Privacy, and 
Cyber Security
Risk
Skipper 
increasingly 
is 
adopting digital systems 
for project management, 
supply chain coordination, 
and operational efficiency 
improvement. A cyberattack 
or data breach could disrupt 
operations, 
compromise 
sensitive client or project 
data, 
and 
damage 
stakeholder 
trust. 
With 
growing regulatory scrutiny 
on data privacy and security, 
non-compliance could lead 
to penalties and reputational 
risks.
a. 	
Annual training is conducted for 
employees on cybersecurity and 
privacy related topics
b. 	 The company is aligning its IT 
procedure with ISO 27001:2022
Negative

Community 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Skipper’s 
operations 
can 
have considerable social, 
cultural, 
and 
economic 
impacts 
on 
nearby 
communities. A lack of 
trust and no engagement 
with the local community 
can hinder the Company's 
social 
initiatives 
and 
damage 
the 
Company's 
reputation, 
brand, 
and 
business continuity. Hence, 
maintaining proactive and 
continuous dialogue with 
stakeholders is crucial to 
building trust and affirming 
our 
commitment 
to 
delivering shared value.
Skipper prioritizes building community 
self-reliance 
through 
targeted 
interventions in education, health, 
livelihoods, and infrastructure.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements
The global transition towards clean energy and the growing demand for reliable and sustainable infrastructure presents a prime 
opportunity to scale. At Skipper, we firmly believe that our biggest contribution to sustainability is through enablement of 
infrastructure that supports the establishment and smooth running of multi-source renewable energy grids, as well as, through 
performance improvement of existing and transitionary systems.
Global ambitions, stronger fundamentals
Skipper is strategically positioned to support this shift through our convergence of modern technology, automated state-of-
the-art equipment, and a culture of continuous innovation – thereby enabling best-in-class products, faster project delivery and 
greater cost-competitiveness. These advantages directly benefit our customers by accelerating their time to market and reducing 
project costs. Such strengths make us envisage a future where India can become a global sourcing hub for the power and telecom 
industries.
With this goal in sight, Skipper has been consolidating our engineering and design skills with a focus on enhancing ease of 
installation, durability and safety. All our designs are subjected to rigorous analysis using advanced simulation tools that identify 
potential weaknesses before deployment. Further, we ensure hassle-free fitment and full-scale load testing of every piece of our 
structural components. Use of very high-quality input materials also assures reliability of our products. Across our value chain, we 
are embedding smart technologies and advanced tools to accelerate decision-making, reduce downtime, and provide a seamless 
experience for our customers. Our ability to provide end-to-end solutions – from structural design to galvanizing, component 
fabrication and onsite support, is a true differentiator reducing customers’ dependency on third parties and drastically improving 
control over project timelines. We continue to enhance the capabilities of our in-house R&D Centre which is a Department of 
Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)-approved innovation hub and has successfully improved the performance of our products 
with every passing year. Energy efficiency, smarter’ grid integration, modular designs, superior conductivity and minimal loss, 
better recyclability are all evolving asks as our industries transition towards cleaner energy infrastructure, and we are working hard 
to fulfil these.
Integrating sustainability into our Product Manufacturing DNA
Internally too, we are constantly improving our production processes to become more sustainable. Skipper has begun the 
GreenCo certification process which will cover our complete production value chain. We have also adopted Life Cycle Assessment 
and Environmental Product Declarations, and these approaches help us better monitor and mitigate our energy efficiency and 
emissions. These initiatives have also thrown up insights for better water conservation, waste management, material conservation 
and recycling and we are instituting changes along different aspects of our production processes – right from improving material 
use to logistics. In keeping with our focus on customer centricity and sustainability enablement, many of our products now publish 
the environmental impact of production.
As the world slowly builds an alternate green ecosystem for societies to reduce their environmental impact, Skipper is taking the 
initiative of addressing several sustainability goals from manufacturing and installing greener infrastructure to realizing India’s 
growth potential and ensuring a carbon-light, development pathway for its billion-plus citizens.
Together, we are not just shaping infrastructure, we are shaping the future.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If 
yes, the coverage such system?
Yes, the Company maintains a structured Occupational Health and Safety Management System aligned with ISO 45001:2018 
that covers all operational locations. The system is designed to ensure compliance with defined safety procedures and to 
manage workplace risks effectively. The Company allocates adequate resources, including trained personnel, appropriate tools 
and equipment, and a safe working environment, to support the health and safety of its employees and workers.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
The Company’s Health and Safety team carries out regular site-level assessments, including Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment, to proactively identify and manage occupational risks. Risks are evaluated based on their severity and likelihood 
and are classified into low, medium, and high categories. Based on this classification, appropriate control measures are 
implemented, including risk elimination, mitigation, or acceptance where applicable.
Employee and worker participation is integral to the Company’s health and safety approach. Workers are actively involved in 
identifying hazards, assessing environmental and safety aspects and impacts, setting safety objectives, and participating in 
emergency mock drills. Toolbox talks are conducted every day in each shift to facilitate regular communication and awareness 
on site-specific safety topics.
To strengthen a culture of safety, the Company has established multiple channels for reporting unsafe conditions. Workers are 
encouraged to report hazards to their supervisors or designated safety teams. In addition, suggestion boxes are placed at key 
locations to enable anonymous reporting of incidents or safety concerns.
The Company follows a defined Incident Management process, which includes timely investigation, documentation, 
communication, and control measures. All incidents are recorded in an Incident Register and reviewed for corrective actions. The 
EHS team conducts root cause analysis for each reported incident and implements preventive measures to avoid recurrence.
This is integrated into routine operations to enhance overall workplace efficiency and hazard control.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
Yes, the Company has established robust processes to enable workers to report work-related hazards and withdraw from 
potentially unsafe conditions. Skipper fosters a proactive safety culture by encouraging all employees and workers to report 
unsafe conditions, unsafe behaviours, and near-miss incidents directly to their supervisors, line managers, job-in-charge 
personnel, or the Health and Safety team. Workers are empowered to stop work immediately if they perceive a safety risk, 
with operations resuming only after a thorough review, root cause analysis, and implementation of corrective actions by the 
respective process owners and cross-functional teams.
To ensure ongoing engagement, a two-way communication system exists between the employees/workers and the Company. 
Toolbox talks are conducted at the shop floor during each shift to maintain continuous dialogue on safety issues. Additionally, 
workers actively participate in periodic safety committee meetings where they are encouraged to voice concerns and suggest 
improvements. Skipper follows a defined procedural framework for hazard control and safe operations. A ‘Permit to Work’ 
system is implemented after conducting a Job Safety Analysis (JSA). Work is authorized only when adequate control measures 
are in place to manage any identified hazards. This structured approach ensures that all safety concerns are addressed promptly 
and contributes to a workplace culture where risk is systematically assessed and mitigated.
d.	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
Yes, the Company provides comprehensive access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services for all employees. 
Skipper demonstrates its strong commitment to employee health and well-being through an extensive group healthcare 
package that includes broad health insurance coverage. Workers are covered under the Employee State Insurance Corporation 
(ESIC) scheme.
Annual Report 2024-25  |  153
In addition to insurance benefits, Skipper has established partnerships with nearby hospitals, to offer regular outpatient 
department (OPD) services. This ensures continuous and easily accessible medical support for both employees and workers. 
The Company has also launched a worker health promotion program in collaboration with a partner hospital, which includes 
financial assistance for preventive health check-ups.
Skipper regularly organizes on-site health check-up camps. These initiatives reflect the Company’s proactive approach to 
promoting long-term employee well-being beyond occupational health requirements.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the company to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
The Company is deeply committed to ensuring a safe and healthy workplace, reflected through its structured safety management 
systems and comprehensive training initiatives. All employees and workers undergo regular health and safety training, guided by a 
monthly training planner that targets specific groups based on risk exposure and job roles. Newly recruited employees participate in 
induction training that covers both general safety protocols and job-specific risks. Continuous training sessions are also conducted 
on critical topics such as electrical safety, gas cutting, and gas handling.
Each operational facility is equipped with a dedicated Occupational Health Centre, staffed by paramedical personnel and a 
designated Factory Medical Officer to provide continuous medical support. Dedicated safety officers at each site oversee health 
and safety implementation, while a Safety Committee comprising workers and contractors meets quarterly to review practices and 
recommend improvements.
The Company integrates both engineering and administrative controls tailored to the risks identified during regular internal safety 
audits and walkthroughs. These controls include light curtain sensors for machine safety, physical guards to prevent man-machine 
interface, interlocking guards, proximity sensors with danger signage, hazard communication boards, audio-visual alarms in 
hazardous areas, and clearly displayed work instructions along with a do’s & don’ts list.
To ensure that all workers are adequately protected, a dedicated PPE matrix is defined for each department and division. Based 
on this matrix, appropriate PPE kits including heat-resistant gear and other specialized equipment are issued to workers, ensuring 
alignment with the specific hazards associated with their roles.
Routine audits of critical safety equipment such as fire hydrants, eye showers, and hand washers are conducted to maintain 
functionality and readiness. These combined measures underscore Skipper’s proactive approach to workplace safety and its 
commitment to protecting the health and well-being of its workforce.

significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions
To uphold a safe and well-prepared work environment, the Company gives high priority to corrective actions aligned with the 
risks identified through regular health and safety assessments. These actions involve implementing engineering controls, updating 
standard operating procedures, delivering focused safety training to employees, and providing suitable personal protective 
equipment (PPE).
In addition, to reduce critical risks and enhance operational safety, the Company has introduced key technical measures. These 
include the use of material stackers for secure storage, reverse cameras in mobile cranes to improve visibility and minimize blind 
spot hazards, and Safe Load Indicators in EOT and Goliath cranes to avoid overloading.
As part of continuous safety efforts, the Company also carries out quarterly mock drills at its sites. These drills aim to evaluate 
emergency response plans, pinpoint improvement areas, and ensure that all staff are familiar with the correct emergency protocols.

8.	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
Yes, the Company has implemented the following initiatives across its operations to reduce Green House Gas emissions.
	
¾
Heat Recovery & Reuse of Heat – Installation of Recuperator: Recuperators have been installed with rolling mills to recover 
significant quantities of waste heat (approximately 400–450°C) from flue gases and reuse it for preheating furnaces. This system 
reduces reliance on coal for reheating, and once fully implemented across all rolling mills, it is expected to yield substantial 
environmental and operational benefits. During FY 2024-25, energy consumption reduced, potential annual coal savings of 
4800 metric tons, and greenhouse gas abatement equivalent to 11,760 metric tons of CO₂ per year. Additionally, it contributes 
to non-tangible benefits such as reduced air pollution and reinforcing the company’s commitment to sustainability.
	
¾
A daylight harvesting system has been installed using rooftop sheets to enhance natural lighting in work areas, achieving 
250–300 LUX during daytime without electricity. This eco-friendly initiative reduces energy consumption by utilizing renewable 
natural light.
	
¾
The Company has initiated the phased replacement of pure CO₂ gas with an Argon-CO₂ mix (80:20 ratio) in MIG welding which 
significantly lowers the carbon footprint. Once fully implemented, it is expected to eliminate approximately 200–250 MT of CO₂ 
consumption annually, contributing to improved organizational sustainability and GHG emission reduction.
Moreover, during FY 2024-25 Skipper received carbon offset certificate for offsetting 2,266MT of CO2 by switching to LPG.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
Decarbonization 
in Welding 
Processes
At our Uluberia unit, the phased replacement of CO₂ gas 
with Argon-CO₂ (80:20) gas mix has been initiated for 
MIG welding. Argon mix offers a lower carbon footprint 
compared to conventional CO₂ usage Through this initiative 
alone, we expect to eliminate approximately 200–250 MT of 
CO₂ emissions annually which will contribute considerably 
towards greater process sustainability, marking a real 
progress towards our emission reduction targets.
Our CO₂ use has steadily decreased 
from 381.135 MT in FY 2022–23 to 
98.250 MT in FY 2024-25.

Heat Recovery 
and Waste Heat 
Reuse in Rolling 
Mills
Under this initiative, heat recuperators have been installed to 
recover high-temperature waste heat (between 400 – 450°C) 
from flue gases. Captured heat is reused for preheating 
furnaces. This reduces the need for fresh energy.
Significant coal savings were achieved 
across both mills:
	y
Mill-1 reduced coal consumption 
from 135 kg/MT in FY 2023-24 to 
122 kg/MT in FY 2024-25
