4. 
Occupational

Risk
Effective Health and Safety 
practices 
are 
essential 
to 
maintain 
a 
Company’s 
reputation among employees, 
clients, investors, and the 
broader 
community. 
News 
of workplace accidents or 
occupational 
illnesses 
can 
diminish 
employee 
morale 
and 
cast 
doubt 
on 
the 
organization’s 
dedication 
to 
ensuring 
safety 
and 
wellbeing and hence a strong 
commitment towards health 
and safety improves employee 
morale.
The Company has implemented a range 
of strategies to effectively manage risk, 
including:
i.  A robust safety policy based on the 
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.
ii.  Routine evaluations of the plant and its 
infrastructure to detect and address 
unsafe or substandard conditions that 
could cause injury or harm.
Adoption of practices like Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment, 
along 
with 
systems 
for 
reporting 
hazards, incidents, and near misses, to 
proactively identify workplace dangers 
and evaluate associated risks.
Negative- No negative 
impact in the reporting year.
3  Material issues identified are referred from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 2023-24 version. SASB Standards are maintained and enhanced by

Supply chain
Risk
Procurement of raw material 
in a prompt manner or on 
favorable commercial terms 
from third-party suppliers is 
essential as any failure could

fulfill orders.
The 
Company 
follows 
its 
defined 
Standard Operating Procedures for 
sustainable procurement and maintains 
daily monitoring of sanctioned Purchase 
Requisitions, open Purchase Orders 
for materials in transit, and inventory 
levels of key items such as Major Raw 
Materials, Consumables, Critical Spare 
Parts, and Project-specific materials.
Negative- No negative 
impact in the reporting year.
6.
Labor 
Relations
Risk
The company must comply 
with 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
requirements concerning its 
labor force as non-compliance 
could lead to tarnishing the 
company’s 
reputation 
or 
increased litigation.
A multi stakeholder approach has 
been instituted in the company which 
is 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
the 
Company’s compliance with regulations, 
ensuring to restrict the employment 
of child labour or forced labour. 
Furthermore, GHFL ensures that all 
labour compliance requirements are 
adhered in timely manner.
Negative- No negative 
impact in the reporting year.
7.
Statutory and 
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
GHFL operates in a very 
strictly regulated environment 
and hence ensures adherence 
to all laws and regulations, 
which is key to upholding its 
strong reputation.
The Company has established  a 
structured mechanism for managing, 
reviewing and monitoring the Company’s 
adherence to statutory and regulatory 
requirements.

Specific commitments, goals and targets set by the

Sustainability is deeply embedded in our long-term strategy, beyond compliance

resource conservation, and waste management. We are focused on reducing 
emissions, improving air quality, preserving biodiversity, and enhancing energy 
efficiency. As part of this vision, we are committed to cutting our total emissions 
by 63% by 2034-35, using FY 2022-23 as the benchmark, positioning ourselves as a 
responsible and forward-thinking enterprise.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG  related challenges, targets and achievements
	
At Garware, sustainability is deeply embedded in our business philosophy as we strive to create long-term value while minimizing our carbon 
footprint. Our commitment to responsible growth is driven by innovation, efficiency, and a vision for a greener future. By integrating ESG 
principles into our operations, we not only strengthen our competitive advantage but also contribute to a more sustainable and resilient global 
economy.
	
We have made significant strides in advancing eco-conscious product innovations, including energy-efficient films, solar-control window 
solutions, UV resistance films and recycled PET-based materials. Our efforts in reducing energy use, maximizing the use of renewable 
resources and post-consumer recycled materials, minimizing production waste, fully recycling production waste, and cutting down 
on non-recyclable waste reinforce our commitment to environmental sustainability. These initiatives helps to reduce carbon emissions, 
enhance energy savings, and promote a circular economy. Additionally, we have implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems to 
eliminate wastewater discharge, ensuring responsible water management within our operations. These initiatives align with our broader vision 
of transitioning toward a circular economy while enhancing operational efficiency.
	
In addition to our sustainability goals, our corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts remain focused on education, healthcare, and 
community welfare, ensuring that our impact extends beyond business success to societal development. We recognize that ESG challenges, 
including climate change, resource scarcity, and regulatory shifts, demand proactive solutions. Our long-term goal includes enhancing 
energy efficiency, reducing overall waste generation, and reducing total emissions by 63% compared to FY 2022-23 by 2035.
	
As we move forward, we remain committed to deliver innovative solutions, maintain the highest standards of governance, and shape 
a future where business growth and environmental responsibility go hand in hand. Through strategic investments and continuous 
innovation, we aim to lead the way in sustainable manufacturing and set new benchmarks in ESG excellence.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes
	
Garware Hi-Tech Films Ltd. has instituted robust and comprehensive waste management protocols to ensure the safe handling, storage, 
and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated from its operations. The Company adopts a systematic approach to 
waste processing, partnering exclusively with certified recycling agencies and authorized entities to facilitate responsible waste treatment 
and minimize environmental impact. Internally generated plastic waste is efficiently recycled and reintegrated into the Company’s production 
processes, thereby promoting resource circularity and reducing dependence on virgin materials. Plastic waste that is not suitable for in-house 
reuse is diverted to authorized third-party recyclers to ensure environmentally compliant recycling practices. Additionally, post-consumer plastic 
waste that may be present in the community is managed under the Company’s Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) obligations, with 
collection and disposal carried out through designated EPR-compliant agencies in accordance with prevailing environmental regulations.
	
The Company’s manufacturing operations do not involve the use of toxic chemicals, further reinforcing its commitment to product safety and 
environmental sustainability. For hazardous waste such as used solvents, oils, and empty chemical containers, the Company ensures proper 
channelling to licensed recyclers for safe recovery and reuse. Chemical sludge, a by-product of certain processes, is transported to a common 
hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) authorized by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, where it is securely 
landfilled in compliance with statutory requirements.
	
Through these targeted waste management strategies, Garware Hi-Tech Films Ltd. continues to uphold its environmental responsibilities, align 
with national and state-level waste governance frameworks, and contribute meaningfully to the principles of sustainable industrial development.
