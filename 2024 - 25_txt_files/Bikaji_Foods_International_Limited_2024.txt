5.	 Specific commitments, goals and targets set by the entity with 
defined timelines, if any.
At all our facilities, sustainability isn’t just a goal — it’s a part of how 
we work every day. We’re focused on conserving water, using energy 
more efficiently, and managing waste responsibly. Our efforts focus 
on responsible water usage, enhanced energy efficiency and robust 
waste management systems. Furthermore, we remain steadfast in our 
dedication to transparency concerning the environmental and social 
implications of our operations.
6.	 Performance of the entity against the specific commitments, 
goals and targets along-with reasons in case the same are 
not met.
Through engagement with internal stakeholders, we have identified our 
key Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) material topics for the 
year. As a next step, we are in the process of finalizing our sustainability 
roadmap to guide future initiatives.
Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure).
At Bikaji, sustainability is not just an initiative - it is a core principle that 
guides every aspect of our operations. We recognize our responsibility 
to reduce environmental impact while ensuring the safety, quality, and 
integrity of our products for consumers around the world.
Energy efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
remain top priorities as we strive to lower our carbon footprint and 
support the transition to a low-carbon economy. To advance our 
sustainability goals, we have implemented a variety of initiatives, 
including comprehensive waste management programs. Notably, we 
have partnered with a waste management company to better manage 
plastic waste, with a focus on reducing, reusing, and recycling across our 
operations. In January 2025, we have also launched an ambitious project 
to establish a state-of-the-art wastewater treatment plant, which is set 
to be fully operational in coming months, to re-cycle and re-use 3,00,000 
Liters of water per day, which shows that we are actively working to 
reduce water consumption and enhance our water stewardship practices.
Our sustainability journey is anchored in four key commitments: 
addressing climate change, improving plastics and packaging practices, 
promoting responsible sourcing, and strengthening water management.
Beyond environmental stewardship, we are equally committed to social 
responsibility. We strive to make a positive impact on the health and 
well-being of our employees and the communities in which we operate.
Ethical conduct forms the foundation of our business. We uphold the 
highest standards of integrity and are unwavering in our commitment to 
protecting human rights across our value chain. This includes working 
closely with our suppliers to ensure ethical labour practices and the fair 
treatment of workers at every level.
At Bikaji, our sustainability journey is ongoing and it reflects our broader 
vision of building a responsible, transparent and future ready business.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.  
	
The Company maintains an unwavering commitment to responsible waste management across its operations and value chain. In line 
with its sustainability objectives, the organization emphasizes the use of lighter, stronger, and more environmentally friendly materials to 
minimize environmental impact while enhancing operational efficiency.
	
As part of its integrated waste management approach, the Company is actively engaged in reusing and recycling waste materials. This 
is achieved through ongoing evaluations of available resources, technologies, and processes, enabling the organization to adopt best-in-
class solutions that support circular economy principles.
	
To ensure continuous improvement, waste management processes are regularly assessed and optimized through targeted initiatives. 
Their effectiveness is monitored via defined performance metrics and periodic reviews.
	
Some of the key waste management and recycling practices include:
 
 
Laminate Cartridge Recycling: The Company facilitates the recycling of laminate cartridges (Bamboo) by returning used cartridges 
to the supplier. These are then refurbished through a process of layering new laminates over the used ones, extending the lifecycle 
of materials and reducing waste generation.
 
 
Transformer Waste Oil Reuse: Waste oil generated from transformers is repurposed as lubricant for in-house machinery, promoting 
resource efficiency and reducing the need for virgin lubricants.
 
 
Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) Sludge Utilization: Sludge waste produced from the STP is effectively reused as fertilizer or 
agricultural manure within the plant premises, contributing to soil enrichment and reducing the dependency on chemical fertilizers.
 
 
Strategic Partnerships Driving Circular Innovation: The Company has entered into a progressive strategic partnership with 
a visionary, eco-conscious brand under the #HarGharSustainable initiative. This alliance is built on a shared mission to make 
every home more sustainable by transforming waste plastics—including laminates and packaging materials—into innovative, eco-
friendly products.

sustainable business practices. The Company fosters a strong culture of safety by promoting behavioural change initiatives and 
delivering comprehensive training to all employees and workers. The Company is committed to safeguarding the health, safety, and 
well-being of all employees, contract workers, and other stakeholders by embedding safety into every aspect of its operations.
	
	
We actively promote a culture of safety through well-structured behaviour change programmes and continuous training initiatives. 
These efforts are designed to raise awareness, instil safe work practices, and empower individuals at all levels to take ownership 
of health and safety responsibilities.

Statutory Reports
	
	
Our primary objectives are centred around the prevention of work-related injuries and illnesses. We strive to create and maintain 
safe and healthy workplaces by identifying, assessing and systematically eliminating hazards. Where elimination is not feasible, 
we implement robust preventive and protective measures to minimise OHS risks, in line with industry best practices and 
regulatory requirements.
	
	
Bikaji mandates the implementation of its OHS policies in all manufacturing locations, including its subsidiaries and contract 
manufacturing facilities. The Company’s Safety Management Framework is aligned with the recognised Health and Safety 
Management standards and is fully integrated into all operations. This framework covers all employees and workers and provides 
complete coverage of all aspects of the business regarding safety.
	
	
To reinforce safety culture and promote employee engagement, the Company organizes annual initiatives such as 'Safety Week' 
across all sites. This includes safety drills, workshops, hazard identification activities and open forums for safety-related discussions. 
These efforts complement the formal safety management system by increasing awareness, encouraging safe behaviours, and 
identifying opportunities for continuous improvement.
	
	
Regular audits, risk assessments, incident investigations and continuous improvement initiatives form part of this framework, 
ensuring that safety performance is regularly evaluated and enhanced. Bikaji is dedicated to building a resilient safety culture where 
every individual contributes to a zero-harm workplace.
b)	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? 
	
	
The Company has established an Employee Health and Safety (EHS) Committee that meets periodically with active participation 
from employees. These meetings are dedicated to the formulation and implementation of proactive measures aimed at preventing 
accidents, injuries, occupational illnesses, and managing emergencies—thereby ensuring the continuity and resilience of operations.
	
	
In alignment with its commitment to workplace safety, the company has implemented a comprehensive Health and Safety 
Management System ("HSMS") across all its facilities. As part of the HSMS framework, the company conducts continuous monitoring 
and documentation of various occupational hazards. These include, but are not limited to, noise levels, temperature fluctuations, 
ambient lighting conditions, air quality, near-miss incidents, and high-potential safety risks.
	
	
To further foster a culture of safety and open communication, the company has installed a suggestion box at a discreet location 
beyond the range of surveillance cameras. This initiative encourages workers to freely and anonymously report potential hazards 
or share safety-related suggestions, ensuring their voices contribute meaningfully to a safer work environment.
c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, the Company is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy working environment through a proactive and preventive 
approach to workplace safety. To uphold this commitment, daily inspections and periodic Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) 
walkthroughs are conducted by the designated Plant Safety Officer. These assessments help identify and document near misses, 
unsafe acts and hazardous conditions. Appropriate corrective and preventive actions are promptly implemented to mitigate risks 
and prevent recurrence.
	
	
All operational sites are equipped with essential emergency response infrastructure, including first-aid facilities and ambulances. 
In addition, employees/workers are regularly trained to handle emergency situations and are encouraged to participate actively in 
safety dialogues. These include workplace inspections, safety audits, and review of incident reports, fostering a culture of continuous 
improvement and shared responsibility for workplace safety.
d)	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No) 
	
	
Yes, both employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. We are committed to ensuring 
the health and well-being of our workforce beyond occupational safety requirements. On-site medical practitioners are available to 
provide primary healthcare support, routine medical consultation and emergency care during working hours.
	
	
To manage unforeseen medical situations promptly, we maintain a fully equipped ambulance stationed at our plant premises at all times.
	
	
In addition to these facilities, we provide comprehensive insurance coverage to all employees and eligible workers, which includes:
 
 
Mediclaim Insurance Policy: Covers hospitalization and other major medical expenses.
 
 
Group Term Life Insurance Policy: Offers financial security to the families of employees in the event of an untimely demise.
 
 
Workmen Compensation Coverage: Ensures legal and financial protection for all workers in case of work-related injuries 
or disabilities.
	
	
These initiatives reflect our holistic approach to employee welfare, emphasizing preventive care, timely medical intervention and 
financial protection.

evaluate safety performance to mitigate risks and uphold best-in-class safety standards.
	
To foster a proactive safety culture, the company organizes regular first aid training, fire safety training, emergency mock drills, safety audits 
and on-site inspections at all operational locations. These initiatives help raise awareness and ensure preparedness among all personnel.
	
We have established an Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Committee, providing a platform where employees can actively participate 
in identifying, discussing and resolving safety-related issues. To encourage inclusivity and anonymous reporting, a suggestion box is 
placed in a discreet location, away from surveillance cameras, allowing workers to freely share their observations and concerns regarding 
workplace hazards and safety practices.
	
Through these structured programs and participatory mechanisms, the company reinforces its commitment to fostering a culture of 
safety, responsibility and continuous improvement.

The Company follows a structured and systematic approach to managing workplace safety and continuously improving its Environment, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) performance. Every safety-related incident is thoroughly assessed to identify the root cause, enabling the 
development and implementation of effective Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA). The outcomes of these investigations, 
including the root cause analysis and the corrective action plan, are communicated to all relevant stakeholders to ensure transparency 
and organizational learning.
	
To reinforce a culture of safety, learnings from all incidents are periodically disseminated across all sites and functional teams through 
internal communications, toolbox talks and safety briefings. This ensures that every part of the organization benefits from shared 
experiences and actively contributes to the prevention of similar occurrences.
	
The company adopts stringent safety measures to maintain a secure and healthy working environment. This includes, regular safety 
training and awareness programs, access to first aid facilities and an on-site ambulance, mandatory use of Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE), adherence to standard hygiene and sanitation protocols.
	
In addressing significant health and safety risks identified during periodic assessments and audits, the company takes a proactive and 
technology-driven approach. This include, but are not limited to:
 
 
Integration of automation and mechanization to reduce manual handling and high-risk activities
 
 
Deployment of safety monitoring systems
 
 
Enhanced supervision and real-time safety observations
 
 
Skill-building initiatives to strengthen safety capabilities at all levels of the workforce
	
These ongoing efforts are integral to our goal of ensuring zero harm and fostering a resilient, safety-first culture across the organization.

consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
	
Stakeholder consultations are primarily led by business leaders and designated representatives of the Company, reflecting the belief that 
effective stakeholder engagement is integral to achieving the Company’s sustainability objective of inclusive and responsible growth.
	
Feedback received through these engagements, along with any significant issues or concerns raised, are systematically escalated 
to the Board of Directors or the relevant Board-level Committees. These committees are responsible for oversight across specific 
functional areas such as:
 
 
Direct and indirect business risks
 
 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiatives
 
 
Environmental and ecological stewardship
 
 
Marketing and brand strategy
 
 
Information technology governance
 
 
Strategic project planning and execution
	
This structured approach ensures that stakeholder insights are meaningfully integrated into the Company’s decision-making processes 
at the highest level.
	
Over time, the Company has taken a systematic approach to strengthen stakeholder engagement practices - regularly assessing, refining 
and improving its methods. This has led to tangible improvements in the quality of engagement, responsiveness to stakeholder concerns 
and the alignment of business objectives with stakeholder expectations.

responsiveness, awareness, compliance, organizational learning, continuous improvement, quality management, quality oversight, 
accountability and sustainability.
	
We have identified key stakeholder groups that demonstrate both a strong interest in our operations and a significant influence on 
our activities. By employing a range of engagement methods, we gain deeper insights into their primary environmental, social and

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.  
	
The Company has undertaken a range of initiatives to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and has transitioned towards cleaner, 
more sustainable energy sources. As part of our decarbonization strategy, we have successfully phased out coal and transitioned to 
biomass briquettes as a primary fuel source at Kamrup, Muzaffarpur, and Tumakuru plants. Biomass briquettes, being a renewable and 
low-emission alternative, significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with traditional fossil fuels. Furthermore, the company has 
also enhanced solar energy capacity at Karni plant location by enhancing the installation of solar photovoltaic panels, this investment not 
only contributes to the use of clean, renewable energy but also helps in offsetting grid-based electricity consumption. 
	
In addition, the Company has also incorporated the use of bio-gas as an alternative fuel in applicable operations, further diversifying its 
clean energy mix. These efforts reflect our ongoing commitment to energy efficiency, emissions reduction and alignment with national 
and global sustainability goals.
