26. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, and approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format
	
Identifying the universe of relevant ESG topics: The identification process involved engaging with internal stakeholders, 
conducting peer reviews and benchmarking, analyzing sector trends, and reviewing media reports and secondary sources to 
compile a comprehensive list of sustainability topics. These topics were then further assessed for their strategic relevance. 
Additionally, alignment with key issues outlined in established ESG standards and frameworks was ensured.
	
Detailing the stakeholder’s engagement methodology: A comprehensive stakeholder engagement process was 
undertaken to ensure that the views and priorities of key stakeholder groups were accurately captured and reflected. 
Detailed questionnaires were distributed to a range of identified stakeholders. External stakeholders included customers, 
shareholders, and vendors/suppliers, while internal stakeholders encompassed employees and the management team. For 
additional stakeholder groups not directly engaged through surveys—such as regulators, community representatives, and 
industry peers—desktop research was conducted to incorporate their perspectives and priorities into the analysis.
	
Data collection: We employed online surveys to gather data and insights from stakeholders in order to prioritize identified 
ESG topics. The survey was carefully designed to elicit key issues, risks, and opportunities from the stakeholders’ perspective, 
ensuring a broad and diverse range of responses. This approach enabled us to capture the full scope of potential ESG 
concerns. In addition to the surveys, we conducted in-depth discussions with a selected group of stakeholders to gain 
deeper insights into their primary concerns and to validate survey findings.

	
Discussion with the management team, CSR & ESG Committee and the Board: The outcomes of the exercise were shared 
with the leadership to identify key focus areas, considering their relevance to stakeholders and the business, as well as 
their impact on sustainable development.

Water Scarcity 
and Pollution
Risk
India faces significant 
water scarcity and pollu-
tion challenges, impact-
ing both environmental 
sustainability and op-
erational continuity for 
manufacturing 
indus-
tries like footwear.
Relaxo has significantly reduced 
its water consumption by adopting 
efficient practices, including rainwater 
harvesting. In regions with low 
rainfall, the company is constructing 
check 
dams 
to 
enhance 
water 
availability. Across its operations, 
Relaxo actively undertakes water 
conservation 
initiatives 
and 
is 
currently implementing Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) systems at all its 
plants, ensuring that all treated water 
is reused for non-potable purposes.
Initially, there may be capi-
tal investments required for 
upgrading equipment and 
implementing conservation 
measures. However, in the 
long term, reduced water 
consumption and potential 
regulatory compliance ben-
efits can lead to positive 
financial outcomes.
2
Carbon 
Emissions and 
Climate Change
Risk
Increasing 
awareness 
and regulations related 
to carbon emissions and 
climate change pose 
risks 
to 
operations, 
supply 
chains, 
and 
market acceptance.
The company has undertaken a 
range of proactive measures aimed 
at 
reducing 
its 
environmental 
impact and lowering greenhouse gas 
emissions:
Afforestation Drive: Planted over 
60,000 plants to enhance green cover 
and carbon sequestration.
Green 
Mobility: 
Initiated 
the 
replacement of conventional petrol/
diesel office vehicles with cleaner 
alternatives.
Energy Transition Projects (Ongoing):
Biomass to PNG Conversion: Shifting 
from 
biomass-based 
boilers 
to 
PNG Piped Natural Gas for leaner 
combustion.
Servo Motors Installation: Replacing 
traditional 
motors 
with 
energy-
efficient servo motors. 
VFDs on Motors: Installing Variable 
Frequency Drives (VFDs) to optimize 
energy consumption.
Pollution Control Measures:
Installed dust collectors to improve 
air quality and reduce particulate 
emissions.
Energy Efficiency Enhancements:
Upgraded lighting systems from CFC 
to LED for better energy efficiency.
Retrofitted diesel generators (DGs) to 
dual-fuel mode to reduce reliance on 
diesel and lower emissions.
These initiatives reflect the compa-
ny’s strong commitment to sustaina-
bility, cleaner energy, and responsible 
environmental stewardship.
Initial 
investments 
in 
technology upgrades and 
process changes may have 
upfront costs. However, re-
duced energy consumption, 
regulatory compliance, and 
enhanced brand value as a 
sustainable company can 
result in positive financial 
outcomes over time.

Product Safety 
and Quality 
Assurance
Opportunity
Ensuring 
product 
safety and quality is 
critical for customer 
satisfaction, regulatory 
compliance, and market 
competitiveness.
The 
company 
ensures 
product 
safety and quality assurance by 
implementing 
stringent 
quality 
control measures, conducting regular 
product testing and certification—
including 
BIS 
certification—and 
investing in research and development 
to create innovative and sustainable 
materials.
Costs 
associated 
with 
quality 
assurance 
and 
R&D investments may be 
incurred initially. However, 
enhanced customer trust, 
reduced recall risks, and 
market differentiation can 
lead to positive financial 
outcomes.
4
Community 
Engagement 
and Social 
Impact
Opportunity
Engaging 
with 
local 
communities, support-
ing social causes, and 
investing in community 
development 
initia-
tives can enhance brand 
reputation, foster posi 
tive relationships, and 
create shared value.
The company ensures product safety 
and quality by implementing stringent 
quality control measures, conducting 
regular testing and certifications—
including 
BIS 
certification—and 
investing in research and development 
to innovate sustainable materials.
Costs associated with com-
munity projects and partner-
ships may be incurred. How-
ever, improved brand image, 
increased customer loyalty, 
and access to new markets 
can lead to positive financial 
outcomes and long-term 
sustainability.
5
Energy 
Management 
and Renewable 
Sources
Opportunity
Opportunity
The company has taken significant 
steps toward sustainability by in-
vesting in energy-efficient technolo-
gies and adopting renewable energy 
sources across its manufacturing 
facilities. Key initiatives include the 
implementation of smart systems 
and controls to optimize energy con-
sumption and ongoing efforts to ob-
tain recognized energy certifications 
or accreditations.
As part of these efforts, a solar roof-
top project has been initiated at all 
plant locations. Additionally, practical 
measures such as turning off lights 
when not in use are being actively 
enforced to further reduce energy 
consumption.
Initial 
investments 
in 
renewable energy infra-
structure and technology 
upgrades may be required. 
However, reduced energy 
costs, potential incentives 
or subsidies for renewable 
energy adoption, and en-
hanced brand reputation as 
a sustainable company can 
result in positive financial 
outcomes over time.
6
Digital 
Transformation 
and Technology 
Adoption
Opportunity
Rapid 
advancements 
in digital technologies 
offer opportunities to 
enhance 
operational 
efficiency, product in-
novation, customer en-
gagement, and supply 
chain visibility.
Embracing Digital Transformation
Our organization is actively embracing 
digital transformation through the 
implementation of data analytics, 
leveraging e-commerce platforms for 
enhanced sales and marketing, and 
integrating smart technologies for 
real-time monitoring and data-driven 
decision-making.
Sustainability through Digital Initi-
atives
One such initiative is the adoption 
of DocuSign, which has significantly 
contributed to our sustainability goals 
over the past two financial years by 
achieving the following environmen-
tal savings:
8,042 lbs of carbon emissions reduced
10,087 gallons of water conserved
3,425 lbs of wood saved
556 lbs of waste eliminated
Initial investments in digi-
tal infrastructure, software 
solutions, and employee 
training may be required. 
However, improved pro-
ductivity, cost savings from 
streamlined 
processes, 
enhanced customer expe-
riences, and competitive 
advantages in the market 
can lead to positive finan-
cial outcomes and business 
growth.

Our company recognizes that the well-
being and safety of our employees 
are fundamental to achieving long-
term success. As part of our ongoing 
commitment, we are dedicated to:
Identifying 
and 
Understanding 
Workplace Hazards: We continuously 
assess potential risks and hazards 
within the workplace to ensure a 
comprehensive understanding of their 
impact on employee safety.
Implementing 
Risk 
Control 
Measures: We are actively developing 
and enforcing effective measures to 
control and eliminate risks associated 
with workplace hazards. This includes 
the creation of a detailed automation 
and mechanization plan that will 
phase out high-risk manual activities, 
thereby minimizing potential dangers.
Formulating a Robust Occupational 
Health & Safety Policy: Our company 
is committed to developing a strong 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
policy. This policy will outline specific 
procedures, 
protocols, 
and 
best 
practices aimed at ensuring the health 
and safety of all employees across 
every aspect of our operations.
By prioritizing these initiatives, we aim 
to create a safer, healthier, and more 
productive work environment where 
our employees can thrive.
