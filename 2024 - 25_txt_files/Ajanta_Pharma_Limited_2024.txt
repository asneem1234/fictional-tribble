trajectory of our India business 
and will further strengthen our 
pain portfolio. 
In other emerging markets, we 
continued to penetrate deeper 
and expanding chronic therapies. 
During the year we launched record 
70 new products across India and 
Emerging Markets. We also have 
a strong product portfolio under 
registration and development in 
R&D, which will enable sustainable 
growth in this business segment.
Our Generics Business in the USA 
contributed 23% to the revenue 
in FY 2025. In the year, it grew at 
a 9% as the new launches were 
done in the later half. We expect 
much better growth in FY 2026 
as we will see the full benefits 
of these launches and also new 
launches during the year. Our 
execution in this market has been 
excellent and flawless; and we 
continue to be a preferred partner 
for the distributors. But we also 
remain watchful in the market 
for any potential US government 
tariff policies. 
Our Anti-malarial Institutional 
business in Africa has been lumpy 
in nature due to its reliance on 
sponsors who fund purchases 
for further distribution to needy 
countries. In the year, it de-grew 
by a 41%. We have been prudent 
to bring down our dependence 
on this business to about 3% of 
our total revenue in FY 2025. In the 
future, we expect it to diminish 
further and become insignificant as 
we focus only on sustainable and 
scalable businesses. 
Financial Highlights
Revenue from operations grew by 
10% to H 4,648 cr. Our EBITDA grew 
by 7% to H 1,260 cr. with 27% margin. 
Our Profit After Tax grew by 13% to 
H 920 cr. with PAT margin of 20%. 
Our balance sheet position remains 
pristine with H 615 cr. as cash and 
liquid investments. We generated 
free cash flow of H 694 cr.  
in the year, which is 75% of PAT. 
We remain prudent in our capital 
allocation by returning excess 
cash generated in the business to 
shareholders. During the financial 
year, your Company distributed a 
total of H 700 cr. to shareholders in 
the form of dividend and buyback. 
Our Return on Capital Employed 
improved to 32% in FY 2025 from 
31% a year ago. It is amongst the 
best in the industry. 
Sustainability
Our successful efforts in 
Growing Sustainably and 
Scaling Responsibly  
gives us the confidence 
for better performance 
and lesser impact 
on environment in 
coming years.
At Ajanta, sustainability is our  
core value, and we continue to 
work towards it year after year.  
A 34% of our energy requirements 
is getting fulfilled from solar power 
and we continue to enhance 
this ratio in the coming years 
with further investments in solar 
power generation.

world-class infrastructure to 
foster collaborative work culture 
to promote innovative ideas and 
attract the best from the talent 
pool. We also added a world class 
liquid dosages manufacturing 
facility at our Pithampur location 
to fulfil rising opportunities in the 
exports market.
Our focus has always been on 
sustainable cost optimisation 
via technological interventions 
and process enhancements. 
We are also directing our efforts 
towards reducing working 
capital deployment across our 
businesses. Sustained efforts are 
being made to further improve our 
manufacturing efficiencies, optimise 
our manufacturing footprint and 
optimize overall fixed costs.
Segment Review
Our Branded Generics 
business contributed 74% 
to our FY 2025 revenue 
against 71% in the previous 
year. This is the highest-
ever in the history of Ajanta. 
During the year, we saw 
it growing at 15% on the 
back of expansion in field 
force, new therapies and 
new products across 
the markets. 
After a long gap, we expanded into 
two new therapies of Nephrology 
and Gynaecology in India which 
were supported by addition of 200+ 
Medical Representatives (MRs) on 
the ground. Also, we added another 
250+ to expand our existing 
therapy footprints in India. We also 
took a significant step forward with 
the first ever acquisition of three 
brands in the pain management 
segment. These additions align 
well with the accelerated growth 
Dear Stakeholders,
We take great pride that our 
efforts to create a long term 
sustainable and scalable business 
is bringing encouraging results. 
With our continued investments 
in Branded Generics business, we 
strengthened our chronic product 
portfolio across the markets.  
This continues to enable us to keep 
reaping its benefits for not just 
years, but decades to come.  
In fact, its benefits are perennial. 
Also, this year, we saw the full year 
benefit of doubling our sales force 
in emerging markets to 1,800 three 
years ago. This year we scaled up 
the sales force in India by 20% to 
3,450+. We should be able to see 
the accrual of its benefits in the 
next two years. This demonstrates 
our prudent and responsible 
approach towards scaling up our 
Branded Generics business.  
We are also conscious of creating 
enabling infrastructure to support 
this growth. We are pleased to 
share that our head office has 
moved into a brand-new office 
Ajanta Tower which is in the heart  
of the business district in Andheri 
Based on the actual output from 
renewable energy initiatives 
and energy-saving measures 
implemented during FY 2025, 
Ajanta achieved this significant 
environmental milestone. These 
efforts led to a reduction of 14,268 
tonnes in CO2 emissions. Apart 
from this, we are also working on 
water conservation, solid waste 
management and plastic neutrality 
to make our operations more 
sustainable in the long run. 
We take this opportunity to express 
our deepest appreciation to all our 
employees and their families for 
their consistent contribution in our 
journey. We continue to improve our 
people practices, benchmarking 
against the best in the world, which 
is confirmed by our recognition of 
‘Great Place to Work’, third year 
in a row. We also thank you for 
your continuing trust, support, and 
commitment to Ajanta.

Branded Generics
Ajanta has a well-diversified Branded Generics business spread across India and 
30+ other emerging market countries in Asia and Africa. The sales for our Branded 
Generics business stood at J 3,394 cr., registering a healthy growth of 15% during the 
year, outpacing the overall market growth. This led to a record 74% contribution in the 
overall revenue. This higher contribution helped to improve our gross margin by 200 
basis points to 77%.
We are strengthening this business 
by prioritising chronic therapies, 
ensuring consistent and long-term  
growth. That means, in every 
market, our chronic ratio is 
increasing continuously. So, we 
are focusing more on the chronic 
therapies now for the growth. That 
would be a sustainable business, 
which is going to boost long term 
growth. At the same time, we 
are scaling responsibly through 
planned expansion of our field force 
in India and emerging markets to 
have optimal coverage of medical 
health care professionals.
We have also strengthened this 
core business by penetrating 
deeper into select countries of our 
existing markets and expanding 
into new markets where we 
increased MRs, therapies and 
product offerings. Our focused 
execution of this strategy involved 
identifying treatment gaps to add 
new products and therapies. It also 
involved expanding our field force 
to widen our reach among medical 
health care professionals through 
segment-focused marketing.
Ajanta has a portfolio of over 550 
products in these markets with 
about 50% being first to market. 
This is a portfolio of smart products 
which can improve patient 
convenience and compliance. 
Basically, these are targeted 
towards specialists and super-
specialists. 
During the year, we launched 
record number of 70 new products 
across India and Emerging Markets. 
We also have a strong product 
portfolio under registration and 
development in R&D, which give us 
the confidence to grow faster than 
the markets in each of the countries 
we are present in.
This is supported by a strong 
field force of over 5,400 medical 
representatives spread across 
India, Asia and Africa, including 
450+ MRs added in India during 
FY 2025. This front-end presence 
across all our markets ensures 
that we hold leadership positions 
in various molecules and sub 
therapeutic segments. 
Smart product portfolio, right 
geographical mix, focused 
approach, tailored strategies for 
key markets and strong execution 
have led to consistent double-digit 
revenue growth. Ajanta has gained 
significant positioning in these 
markets with strong marketing 
and distribution capabilities. 
Brand is our biggest moat and our 
Branded Generics business exhibits 
assurance, sustainability and 
scalability for Ajanta in the long run.

FY 2025 was indeed an eventful year for the India business with many new initiatives. 
After seven years there was addition of two new therapies: Gynaecology and 
Nephrology. The total IPM size for both these therapies is approximately H 16,000 cr.,  
as per latest IQVIA MAT. We have added 200 plus MRs in these two new therapies.  
We have launched 12 new products in these two therapies in FY 2025. 
In the covered market, we are 5th largest in 
IPM and amongst top 10 in all our therapeutic 
segments.
Also, there was a significant 
expansion that we undertook in the 
existing therapies with the addition 
of 250 new MRs taking our total MR 
strength in India to over 3,450.  
We are also open for further 
expansion in FY 2026 as may 
be necessary. 
The year also saw first ever 
acquisition of three brands in 
the pain management segment. 
These additions are in line with our 
strategy of increased focus and 
expanding product basket. This is 
going to give us a good mileage on 
the business.
Focusing on our performance 
in FY 2025, the India business 
contributed 32% to the Company’s 
total revenue, supported by 
the launch of 32 new products, 
including eight first-time launches 
in the country. For FY 2025, sales 
reached H 1,452 cr., up from  
H 1,308 cr. in FY 2024, reflecting 
a growth of 11%. We continued 
to outperform the Indian

confident of sustaining this 
momentum in the coming years, 
backed by a robust pipeline of new 
product launches.

through increased investment in both products and people to drive accelerated

at H 1,191 cr. against H 1,057 cr., a 
healthy growth of 13%.

Digitisation
At Ajanta, we are at the forefront of digitisation. By connecting most of our 
functions through digital systems, we have built a solid network that helps us 
serve our customers better. Whether it is R&D, manufacturing, quality control, 
sales & marketing, HR or finance, we can collect and use data in a way that 
ensures our products and services meet customer needs smoothly.
Previously, batch manufacturing 
records (BMRs) were maintained 
manually, a process involving 
extensive paperwork. Today, 
these records are entirely digital 
and seamlessly linked with our 
production equipment.
This also helps us use predictive 
analytics to improve efficiency 
across our supply chain.
With better R&D timelines, less 
production downtime and faster 
online customer support, our 
digitisation efforts are helping us 
prepare for the future with more 
confidence. Thoughtful use of AI 
has become the way to enhance 
efficiencies across the organisation.

Economic Overview  
and Outlook
As per the International Monetary 
Fund report published in April 2025, 
the global trade tariff tensions 
and extremely high levels of policy 
uncertainty are expected to have 
a significant impact on economic 
activity. Based on information 
as of April 4, global growth is 
projected to drop to 2.8% in 2025 
and 3% in 2026—down from 3.3% 
for both years in the January 2025 
update. This is also much below the 
historical (2000–19) average  
of 3.7%.
Growth in advanced economies 
is projected to be 1.4% in 2025. 
Growth in the United States is 
expected to slow to 1.8%.  
Growth in the Euro area is expected 
to slow by 0.2% point to 0.8%.  
In emerging markets and 
developing economies, growth 
is expected to slow down to 
3.7% in 2025 and 3.9% in 2026, 
with significant downgrades for 
countries affected most by recent 
trade measures, such as China.
Intensifying downside risks 
dominate the outlook. Ratcheting 
up a trade war, along with even 
more elevated trade policy 
uncertainty, could further reduce 
near and long-term growth.
Pharmaceutical Sector 
Overview
Branded Generics: High‑Growth 
Opportunity in Emerging Markets
As per market research firm 
Research and Markets, the global 
branded generics market is 
forecast to grow from USD 261 
billion in 2024 to nearly USD 376 
billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 6.2%.
Emerging economies are 
experiencing rapid growth in non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) 
like diabetes and cardiovascular 
disorders, fuelling demand for 
reliable, affordable medicines. 
Demographic and Economic 
Trends indicates that large, ageing 
populations and rising incomes are 
increasing healthcare consumption 
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. On 
the other hand, though regulatory 
hurdles persist, improving standards 
and harmonisation are gradually 
making it easier for quality-focused 
companies to expand branded 
generics portfolios.
The Indian pharmaceutical market 
(IPM) specifically continues to deliver 
robust growth. As per PharmaTrac, IPM 
grew by 8.4% during FY 2025, led by 
price (5.6%) and new launches (2.4%) 
growth, while volume growth remained 
weak at 0.4% YoY. The IPM’s value now 
exceeds H 2.24 trillion, with projections 
indicating the market will expand 
near 2 times over the next six to seven 
years, fuelled by rising chronic disease 
prevalence, improved healthcare 
access, and government support for 
local manufacturing and R&D.
Branded Generics remain the 
backbone of the Indian market, 
accounting for nearly 87% of value. 
However, the market is becoming 
more competitive, with price-
led growth outpacing volume, 
and increased substitution by 
trade generics.
US Generics Market: 
Growth and Business 
Potential
The US Generics market 
remains a cornerstone of the 
pharmaceutical landscape, 
accounting for approximately 90% 
of all prescriptions dispensed in 
2024, as per IQVIA. Despite this 
dominance, the pace of generic 
uptake for newly off-patent drugs 
has moderated compared to the 
rapid adoption seen a decade ago, 
with recent years showing lower 
and slower generic penetration 
following exclusivity loss.
As per Precedence Research, the 
US Generics drugs market size was 
estimated at USD 139 billion in 
2024 and is predicted to increase 
from USD 146 billion in 2025 to 
approximately USD 232 billion by 
2034, expanding at a CAGR of 5.2% 
from 2025 to 2034. This growth is 
underpinned by factors like rising 
chronic disease burden, cost 
advantages generics offer, etc.

The Branded Generics business in 
Asia and Africa consists of more 
than eight major therapeutic 
segments and we hold the 
leading position in all our sub-
therapeutic segments.
Basket of More than 
220 Products  
Ajanta’s Asia business extends 
across the Middle East, Southeast 
Asia, and Central Asia, covering 
nearly 10 countries. We are 
strategically strengthening this 
business through increased 
investments in both product and 
people to drive accelerated 
growth. We have significantly 
expanded our product portfolio 
in the region with the launch of 25 
new products, primarily in chronic 
therapies. This business saw a 
growth of 13% in the year and 
contributed 26% to total sales. The 
growth was well-diversified in terms 
of new product launches, besides 
volume growth of existing products.
Our Africa business achieved 
an outstanding growth of 28%, 
driven by a continued strategic 
focus on expanding our chronic 
therapies portfolio in the region 
and successful launch of 13 
new products. These initiatives 
are steadily building a strong 
foundation for a more sustainable 
and scalable business in the years 
to come. This business contributed 
16% in total sales in the year.  
The growth in FY 2025 was higher 
on the low base of FY 2024.
The US Generics
The US Generics recorded 9% 
growth for the year and contributed 
23% to total sales. This growth 
was soft as all five new product 
launches occurring in the second 
half of the year, limiting their ability 
to contribute to the full-year 
performance. We have 47 products 
on the shelf and 22 ANDAs are 
awaiting approvals. During the 
year, we filed 6 ANDAs, received 
6 final approvals and launched 
5 products.
Africa Institutional
This business consists of  
anti-malarial products being 
distributed through multilateral 
aid agencies, which saw degrowth 
of 41% due to lower procurement 
by agencies and contributed 3% 
to total sales. This business has 
become a very small part in our 
overall business.

a growth of 10%.
Material Costs
Material cost moved to 23% in

in FY 2025 against 21% in previous 
year. Total cost stood at H 1,090 cr.  
in FY 2025 against H 900 cr. in 
FY 2024. Higher increase in the 
cost is due to one-time charge of 
about H 30 cr. for change in gratuity 
policy and additions of medical 
representatives in India.
Other Expenses
Other expenses stood at H 1,228 cr.  
in FY 2025 (26% of revenue from 
operations) against H 1,070 cr.

towards addition of new therapies 
and marketing divisions in India 
business. R&D cost was at H 224 cr.  
in FY 2025 against H 208 cr. in 
FY 2024, which accounted for 5%  
of revenue from operations.

new products, resulting in higher 
marketing expenses.

H 1,260 cr. against H 1,172 cr. in

combined benefits of contribution 
of business product mix and 
improvement in gross margins.

27%, which is among the best in 
the industry. We expect this to now 
remain at this level or see small 
improvement in coming years.

class corporate head office

training infrastructure and foster 
collaboration with designated 
break out spaces. Also, it boasts 
of the best-in-class employee 
facilities with canteen, gymnasium, 
recreational zones to attract high 
quality talent in the industry.
Your Company’s Human Resource 
Development efforts continue to 
shape Ajanta as a preferred place 
to work. These efforts were once 
again recognised with the ‘Great 
Place to Work’ certification for the 
third consecutive year. Our people 
practices are now benchmarked 
globally. These include structured 
skill development, personality 
enhancement, and employee 
engagement through internal 
communication. Together, they 
contribute to a work environment 
that is positive and enabling.
Ajantaites are empowered to take 
ownership and deliver impact.  
The Company’s culture is anchored 
in four core values: Excellence, 
Transparency, Integrity, and 
Discipline. These principles guide 
over 11,000 employees in fulfilling 
the mission of delivering life-saving 
medicines to those in need.
The Company is committed to 
maintaining a safe, secure, and 
healthy workplace. Workforce 
productivity and performance 
are consistently reviewed to stay 
ahead of internal and industry 
benchmarks. Professional goals 
for individuals and teams are 
closely aligned with organisational 
objectives. This alignment ensures 
a clear sense of direction and 
reinforces purpose at every level.
Human resource initiatives focus 
on building an inclusive culture

Creating a safe work environment is 
central to these efforts.

opportunities for contribution.  
A zero-tolerance policy towards 
discrimination is strictly followed. 
The Occupational Health and 
Safety (OHS) framework across 
manufacturing facilities ensures 
that employees operate in a safe 
and compliant setting.
Risk Management
The risk management philosophy 
at Ajanta stems from the set 
of principles and framework 
embedded in our values for 
sustainable growth which prompts 
us to scale our business very 
responsibly. This keeps us prudent 
in capital allocation, thoughtful 
in our choice for markets and 
products, and conscious of impact 
we have on mother earth. Also, it 
keeps us very mindful of our own 
business practices to mitigate any 
known or unknown risks.
The business environment has 
always been dynamic and 
continuously shifting. But in the 
current environment of tariff-
tensions, it is becoming more 
uncertain and complicated.  
We operate across more than 30 
highly regulated countries, each 
with its own intricate and unique 
operational challenges.
This gives rise to a wide array of 
risks, which we proactively track, 
evaluate, and address through 
our comprehensive Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) framework. 
Through effective risk identification, 
analysis, and mitigation, we aim  
to build resilience, support 
long-term growth, and optimise 
value creation.
Our ERM process involves 
collaboration with functional 
leaders to recognise both internal 
and external events that could 
negatively affect the Company’s 
goals. It also includes ongoing 
surveillance of changes in internal 
and external contexts that could 
lead to new risks or threats. The key 
risks identified include regulatory 
compliance, currency risks, market  
competition, supply chain 
vulnerabilities, cybersecurity and 
data protection, macroeconomic 
and geopolitical factors,  
third-party risks and Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) 
concerns. The Risk Management 
Committee conducts an annual 
review of our risk management 
policy. Our ERM framework is vital 
in protecting the interests of the 
Company, its shareholders, and 
all stakeholders.
Internal Controls and 
Adequacy
Company has established a 
strong and dependable internal 
control system, as we consider it 
fundamental to sound governance. 
The internal control framework is 
structured to consistently evaluate 
the sufficiency, efficiency, and 
effectiveness of these controls. 
Management remains dedicated 
to maintaining an internal control 
environment appropriate to 
the scale and complexity of 
our operations. This ensures 
adherence to internal protocols, 
applicable laws and regulations, 
accuracy in record-keeping, 
efficient operations, safeguarding 
of assets and resources, and 
overall risk mitigation. The 
controls are designed to offer 
reasonable assurance.
The present system of Internal 
Financial Controls (IFC) complies 
with the Companies Act, 2013 
and aligns with internationally 
recognised risk-based frameworks.  
Our Internal Audit (IA) function 
reports through CFO to the 
Chairperson of the Audit 
Committee, thereby preserving its 
independence and objectivity.  
A specialised internal audit team, 
supported by external audit firms, 
works to safeguard and enhance 
organisational value by offering 
risk-based, impartial assurance, 
guidance, and insight. 
The annual internal audit plan is 
developed from a well-defined 
Audit Universe, which includes all 
business areas, functions, risks, 
compliance needs, and control

About 99.87% of the outstanding equity shares have 
been dematerialised up to March 31, 2025. Trading 
in Shares of the Company is permitted only in 
dematerialised form. The Company’s equity shares are 
fairly liquid and are actively traded on BSE and NSE.

Company has not issued these types of securities.
Commodity price risk or foreign exchange risk and 
hedging activities
The Company does not have any significant exposure 
in commodities directly and does not carry out any 
commodity hedging activities.
Currency risks mainly arise out of exports and overseas 
operations. Since about 68% of the Company’s income 
is by way of exports with major currency exposure being 
in USD/EUR, the Company generally does currency 
hedging for 6 to 18 months and up to the extent of 
50% to 75% of its net foreign exchange earnings. It 
uses forward exchange contracts and/or options to 
hedge against its net foreign currency exposures as 
advised by the Risk Management Committee and forex 
consultants. All material foreign exchange transactions 
are fully covered.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
STATEMENT BY MANAGEMENT
Dear Valued Partners,
As we reflect on the year gone by, I am proud to present how Ajanta Pharma Limited (APL) has demonstrated the 
spirit of our theme: ‘Growing Sustainably. Scaling Responsibly.’ Our journey this year has been defined by strategic 
growth that balances ambition with accountability. Every step forward has been guided by our belief that long-term 
success is best built on sustainable foundations and responsible leadership.
In this dynamic ESG landscape, our commitment to innovation, continuous improvement, and transparent 
stakeholder engagement has remained resolute. I am pleased to share the significant progress we have made 
in advancing our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives and strengthening our alignment with 
sustainable development.
Substantial progress has been made in water management as well. Our Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) have been 
upgraded with cutting-edge technologies, including Ultra-Filtration (UF), Reverse Osmosis (RO), and mist evaporators. 
These upgrades facilitate water reuse in cooling towers, supporting our goal of a circular water economy. In addition, 
the implementation of condensate recovery systems has notably reduced boiler fuel consumption.
Employee health and safety remain a top priority. Our robust Occupational Health and Safety Management System 
has enabled us to achieve a commendable milestone of zero lost-time incidents during the reporting period. Four 
of our major sites have obtained ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certifications, with additional sites poised to receive 
certifications soon.
Our firm commitment to ethical business practices is supported by a comprehensive Code of Conduct for Directors 
and employees, complemented by sound corporate governance standards. We actively collaborate with our supply 
chain partners through in-depth Value Chain Assessments and targeted sustainability interactions, fostering ESG-
aligned practices across our extended ecosystem.
Our stakeholder engagement efforts continue to evolve, emphasising transparency, accountability, and meaningful 
dialogue. By proactively addressing concerns, we further strengthen our shared sustainability journey. Our Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, focusing on healthcare, education, rural development, and the promotion of 
sporting excellence, exemplify our broader vision for inclusive and sustainable growth.
Looking forward, we remain committed to expanding our sustainability goals, innovating across environmental 
dimensions, and driving impactful social initiatives. We thank you for your continued trust, support, and collaboration 
as we work together to build a resilient, sustainable future. 
Warm regards,
Yogesh Agrawal

This year, we have made considerable strides in minimising our environmental footprint. 
A key highlight is the installation of an additional 2.2 MW of solar power capacity, 
taking our total capacity to 12.6 MW, significantly boosting our renewable energy 
portfolio. This initiative enables us to reduce our carbon emissions by approximately 
14,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, demonstrating our resolve to combat climate change.
Our efforts in resource conservation have remained strong, with focused initiatives 
across waste management, energy optimisation, and water conservation. We have 
also adopted clean fuels for boiler operations, introducing agro-waste-based 
briquettes at plants, thereby promoting the use of bio-fuels and reducing scope 
1 emission.

Product Quality 
and Safety
Risk & 
Opportunity
Any deficiency in product 
quality and safety can 
have severe consequences, 
including a significant 
negative impact on patient 
well-being and business 
operations. 
This may result in 
decreased sales, 
reputational damage, and 
regulatory actions, all of 
which can lead to reduced 
revenue and heightened 
scrutiny from regulators.
•	
The Company has established stringent 
Pharmacovigilance processes and 
adheres to global quality standards to 
ensure the highest quality products.
•	
It has got ISO 9001:2015 certification 
which conforms that the products meet 
the required quality specifications.
•	
Active monitoring of product safety 
throughout its lifecycle is implemented, 
alongside rigorous quality control and 
assurance measures, ensuring cGMP 
compliance and full adherence to 
regulatory requirements.
•	
We leverage technological 
advancements, cGMP training, 
automation, and digitalisation to 
enhance operational efficiency and 
elevate product quality.
•	
Quality reviews are conducted at third-
party locations to ensure the safety and 
quality of products manufactured at 
these sites. 
•	
Risk assessment procedures like Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment 
(“HIRA”) are in place, all changes get 
assessed for probable risk.
Positive
Products meeting the 
quality and safety 
standards will lead 
to higher consumer 
confidence and 
enhanced revenue.
Negative
Quality and safety 
issues may lead to 
penalties and other 
actions from regulators 
and also may have 
an adverse impact on 
the Company’s brand 
image and consumer 
confidence
2
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk & 
Opportunity
Employees are the 
company’s most valuable 
assets, and ensuring their 
health and safety is our top 
priority. 
Poor Occupational Health 
and Safety (OHS) practices 
can lead to a range of 
negative outcomes, such 
as increased absenteeism, 
reduced productivity, and 
higher healthcare costs. 
Ineffective OHS measures 
often result in frequent 
safety incidents and lower 
employee morale.
•	
A robust Occupational Health and 
Safety management system (ISO 
45001:2018) is implemented at four 
major sites, with additional locations 
undergoing the certification process.
•	
Each site conducts Occupational Safety 
and Health (OSH) Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessments through 
various techniques, including Hazard 
Identification (HAZID), Hazard and 
Operability studies (HAZOP), and HIRA 
for routine and non-routine activities.
•	
Work zone sampling, provision of 
required PPEs, SOP and instruction for 
safe operation, induction trainings  are 
done regularly and effectively.  
•	
Annual health check-up of employees, 
and health awareness trainings are 
given on regular basis.  
Positive
Robust OHS standards 
minimise or prevent the 
occurrence of untoward 
incidents and bring 
higher productivity. 
It also contributes to 
elevate brand image of 
the Company amongst 
regulators and 
investors.

Opportunity
Our innovative, first-

extensive R&D, are key to

and novel drug delivery 
systems allows us to stay 
ahead of the competition 
while enhancing product

•	
By focusing on operational excellence 
and cost-effectiveness, we proactively 
manage risks associated with the 
affordability and accessibility of life-
saving medications.
•	
This not only mitigates financial 
challenges but also presents significant 
opportunities to develop and deliver 
high-quality, affordable healthcare 
solutions.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk & 
Opportunity
Compliance with laws and 
regulations is fundamental 
to maintaining a strong 
corporate governance 
framework, ensuring smooth 
operations, and creating 
long-term value for 
stakeholders. 
Ethical breaches or non-
compliance can erode 
stakeholder trust, damage 
employee morale, lead to 
regulatory actions, and 
negatively affect financial 
performance. 
•	
We maintain a strict zero-tolerance 
policy for any ethical lapses or breaches 
of business integrity, thereby reducing 
the risk of reputational damage and 
regulatory penalties.
•	
Code of Conduct for Directors and 
Senior Management sets clear 
expectations for ethical behaviour and 
avoiding conflicts of interest.
•

of untreated or poorly 
treated wastewater can 
contaminate nearby 
water sources, harming 
aquatic ecosystems, 
threatening biodiversity, 
and endangering human 
health in communities that 
depend on these water 
sources. 
Ajanta is committed to becoming water 
positive by 2026, focusing on minimising 
wastewater generation, implementing 
advanced treatment systems for wastewater 
recovery and reuse, and deploying Rainwater 
Harvesting systems.
•

already in place at our Guwahati, Dahej 
and Waluj facilities, significantly reducing 
the environmental impact associated 
with wastewater discharge.

The R&D team has made significant investments in enhancing the 
environmental sustainability of key product formulations. Notably, nearly 10 
products have been transitioned from non-aqueous to aqueous coating 
processes. This shift has effectively eliminated the need for solvents in 
the coating stage, resulting in reduced chemical usage and a lower 
environmental footprint.
Capex
10%
23%
The Company has undertaken a wide range of initiatives aimed at improving 
its environmental impact, with measurable progress across energy, water, 
waste, and material efficiency domains.  
• 	
Renewable Energy Transition and Emissions Reduction
	
To mitigate Scope 2 emissions, a 2.2 MW solar power plant was 
commissioned, increasing the company’s total renewable energy capacity 
to 12.6 MW. This strategic shift towards clean energy significantly reduces 
dependence on grid electricity. Simultaneously, conventional fossil fuel-
based boilers were replaced with biomass-based systems, substantially 
lowering Scope 1 emissions and promoting the use of renewable biofuels.
• 	
Water Conservation and Circular Usage
	
Water efficiency has been enhanced through the deployment of 
condensate recovery systems at critical facilities and the reuse of treated 
wastewater in cooling tower operations. These initiatives reduce freshwater 
withdrawal and support circular water use practices across operations.
• 	
Sustainable Waste Management
	
The company has achieved zero hazardous waste discharge from three 
key manufacturing units by diverting waste for co-processing in the 
cement industry. This environmentally sound disposal method supports the 
principles of a circular economy while ensuring safe waste treatment.
• 	
Material Efficiency and Sustainable Packaging
	
Improvements in material efficiency include optimising packaging sizes 
to minimise plastic usage, replacing HDPE drums with eco-friendly fibre 
containers. These changes contribute to greener practices.
•	
Enhanced Energy Efficiency
	
Significant gains in energy efficiency have been realised through the 
implementation of magnetic levitation chillers, electronically commutated 
(EC) fans, high-capacity dehumidifiers, and the construction of energy-
efficient buildings. Collectively, these measures contribute to reduced 
energy consumption, lower operational costs, and a diminished 
environmental footprint.

b. 	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
	
At Ajanta, we firmly believe that proactive risk assessments are essential to safeguarding the health, safety, 
and well-being of everyone in the workplace. We employ the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA) methodology, a structured three-step approach that includes:
	
	
1.	
Spot the Hazard – Identifying potential sources of harm (Hazard Identification).
	
	
2.	
Assess the Risk – Evaluating the likelihood and severity of risks (Risk Assessment).
	
	
3.	
Make the Changes – Implementing appropriate measures to eliminate or control risks (Risk Control).
	
	
Through the HIRA framework, we systematically identify hazards, evaluate associated risks, and enforce 
control measures to mitigate them. This process is further strengthened by periodic internal audits and 
leadership safety rounds, which help identify unsafe acts and conditions, thereby contributing to continual 
improvement and risk level optimisation.
	
	
We also implement Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) based on incident analysis and root cause 
identification. The effectiveness of CAPA is monitored through follow-up evaluations, ensuring that the 
corrective measures are sustained and that any necessary process reassessments are conducted.
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks
	
	
Yes
	
d. 	 Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services?
	
	
Yes

Key initiatives undertaken during the past year for strengthening Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) practices 
are enumerated below:
	
Enhancing Operational Safety:
	
Implemented static charge dissipation systems in the expanded production and solvent storage areas at Dahej 
plant. This reduced the risk of electrostatic ignition, a potential fire hazard.
	
Battery Safety Upgrades:
	
The battery storage area at Dahej plant has been isolated and equipped with a hydrogen detection and fire 
control system. This ensures compliance with safety standards and minimises the risk of fire or explosion.
	
Electrical Panel Protection:
	
Key electrical panels at our manufacturing sites are now protected by CO2 flooding systems. This advanced 
fire suppression technology effectively extinguishes electrical fires, safeguarding personnel and equipment.
	
Independent Safety Audits:
	
Regular inspections, audits, and testing at each of our sites are conducted by qualified third-party specialists. 
This independent evaluation ensures adherence to safety protocols and identifies areas for further improvement.
	
Automatic Solvent Transfer System:
	» SCADA-based automatic solvent transfer system at Waluj plant eliminates the need for manual handling of 
solvent drums, minimising the risk of slips, falls, and other physical injuries.
	» Minimises operator exposure to hazardous solvents during the transfer process, protecting respiratory health.
	» Solvent transfer occurs under a nitrogen blanketing system, significantly reducing fire risk.
	
Automatic Water Jet System for Tank Cleaning:
	
Implemented automatic water jet cleaning systems with sodium hypochlorite dosing in all our formulation units 
which eliminates the need for personnel to enter confined spaces for tank cleaning, a hazardous activity that 
requires continuous oxygen monitoring or artificial oxygen supply.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Our organisation has implemented a multi-pronged strategy for waste management, with a strong emphasis on 
reducing hazardous waste generation, promoting sustainable disposal, and minimising environmental impact.
	
1. 	
Waste Management Practices
	
	
Hazardous Waste Co-processing: 
	
	
All hazardous waste generated from our facilities at Aurangabad, Pithampur, Guwahati, and Dahej is now 
sent for pre-processing/co-processing in the cement industry. This ensures that waste is not sent to landfills 
but instead utilised as an alternative fuel or raw material in a high-temperature, controlled environment, 
aligning with circular economy principles.
	
	
Zero Discharge from Key Units:
	
	
Through this co-processing strategy and improved operational control, we have achieved zero discharge 
of hazardous waste from three of our major units, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and 
contributing to long-term sustainability goals.
	
	
Recycling of Treated Wastewater:
	
	
Guwahati facility, recycled treated wastewater for use in cooling towers, promoting resource efficiency 
and reducing fresh water demand.
	
	
Packing Material Optimisation:
	
	
Initiatives like reduction in packaging material size and replacement of HDPE drums with sustainable fibre 
containers have significantly reduced plastic waste generation across our operations.
	
2. 	
Strategy for Reducing Hazardous & Toxic Chemical Use
	
	
Solvent Reduction through FTNIR Technology:
	
	
In our quality control processes, we have implemented FTNIR (Fourier Transform Near Infrared) technology. 
This shift has substantially reduced the use of solvents in drug analysis, thereby cutting down on toxic 
chemical usage at the analytical level.
	
	
Alternative Coating Technologies:
	
	
For selected pharmaceutical products, we have transitioned use from non- aqueous to aqueous 
tablet coating. This change minimises the dependency on certain chemicals involved in traditional 
coating processes.
	
	
Eco-friendly Procurement and Project Design:
	
	
A key principle in all new projects and procurement decisions is the prioritisation of energy and material 
efficiency, including the reduction of harmful chemical inputs. This harmonisation of practices across sites 
ensures consistency in sustainability efforts.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REASONABLE ASSURANCE REPORT ON IDENTIFIED 
SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION IN AJANTA PHARMA LIMITED’S BUSINESS 
RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
To the Board of Directors of Ajanta Pharma Limited,
1.	
We have undertaken to perform reasonable assurance engagement, for Ajanta Pharma Limited (the “Company” 
or “APL”) vide our engagement letter dated 16/12/2024 in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed 
below (the “Identified Sustainability Information” or “BRSR Core indicators”) in accordance with the Criteria stated 
in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (“BRSR”) of the Company for the year ended March 31st, 2025. This engagement was conducted by our 
multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, environmental engineers and specialists.
2.	
Identified Sustainability Information
	
Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to our report. 
The reporting boundary of the BRSR is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosures of the BRSR 
with exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable.
	
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31st, 2025 information only 
and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods, and any elements thereto, and, 
therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.
3.	
Criteria
	
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
	
The criteria used is the “BRSR Core”, which is a subset of the BRSR, consisting of a set of Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”)/ metrics under nine Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) attributes, as per the 
format of BRSR Core specified in Annexure 17A, read with the format of BRSR and the Guidance Note given in 
Annexure 16 and 17, respectively, of the SEBI Master Circular for ‘compliance with the provisions of the SEBI LODR 
Regulations, 2025 by Listed Entities’ dated November 11, 2024, and the SEBI Circular on the ’Industry Standards 
on Reporting of BRSR Core’ dated December 20, 2024 (collectively referred to as the “SEBI Circulars”).
4.	
Management’s Responsibility
	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
Identified Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of the BRSR, disclosing environmental 
information basis operational control approach, taking into account applicable laws and regulations including 
the SEBI circulars, related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information 
in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal 
controls relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, 
which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
	
The Management and the Board of Directors of the Company are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
compliance with the requirements of LODR Regulations and the SEBI Circular in relation to the BRSR Core.
5.	
Inherent limitations
	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non- 
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can 
affect comparability between companies.
	
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint, waste. Obtaining 
sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts 
and metrics.
6.	
Our Independence and Quality Control
	
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/
CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the required 
competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
	
We apply Standard on Quality Control (the “SQC”) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly 
maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
7.

Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed 
in Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.

(SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(SAE) 3410 “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” (together the “Standards”), both issued 
by the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.
	
These Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the BRSR are prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
	
As part of reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with the Standards, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the engagement.
8.	
Reasonable Assurance
	
A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as 
necessary in the circumstances.
	
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
	» Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures.
	» Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or 
measurements of the Identified Sustainability Information.
	» Made inquiries of Company’s management, including engineering team, quality team, finance team, human 
resource team amongst others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the BRSR.
	» Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes 
and controls for recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the 
corporate office and at other locations/offices on a sample basis under the reporting boundary. This included 
evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the engagement and determining whether they have 
been implemented by performing procedures in addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the 
Identified Sustainability Information.
	» Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be 
materially misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures.
	» Where applicable, for the Identified Sustainability Information in the BRSR, we have relied on the information 
in the audited standalone/ consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 
31, 2025 and the underlying trial balance.
	» Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and judgements made by the 
management in the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information.
	» Tested the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling 
the Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis.
	» Tested the consolidation working of the corporate office and other locations/offices on a sample basis under

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of 
Ajanta Pharma Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements 
of Ajanta Pharma Limited (hereinafter referred to as 
the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries together referred to 
as “the Group”), which comprise the consolidated 
balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated statement 
of changes in equity and consolidated statement of 
cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the 
consolidated financial statements, including material 
accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial 
statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based 
on the consideration of reports of the other auditors 
on separate financial statements of such subsidiaries 
as were audited by the other auditors, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs 
of the Group as at 31 March 2025, of its consolidated 
profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated 
changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the 
year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Group 
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the 
relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence 
obtained by us along with the consideration of reports 
of the other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) of 
the “Other Matter” section below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Key audit matter
See Note 7.9, 37 and 53 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue from sale of products is recognised at a point in time 
when control of the products is transferred to the customer. 
The actual point in time when revenue is recognised varies 
depending on the specific terms and conditions of the sales 
contracts entered with customers.  The Group has numerous 
customers operating in multiple geographies and sales 
contracts with these customers have distinct terms and 
conditions relating to the recognition of revenue, the right 
of return and price adjustments. Contractual arrangements 
as well as regulatory requirements in various geographies 
result in adjustments to gross sales price. These adjustments 
arise from the Group’s obligations to customers towards 
chargebacks, rebates, product recalls, medicaid, allowances, 
supply penalties and right of return (“variable consideration”). 
As stated in Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements, 
revenue from the sale of goods is measured after adjusting the 
effects of variable consideration
Our audit procedures in respect of revenue recognition included 
the following: 
	
» Verifying the accounting policies adopted by the Company 
with respect to recognition of revenue by comparing with the 
applicable accounting standards.
	
» Testing the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Company’s manual and automated 
controls designed over recognition of revenue and accrual 
for variable consideration.
	
» Performing substantive testing of selected samples of revenue 
transactions recorded during the year as well as at year-
end. We used statistical sampling and verified contractual 
terms of sales invoices / contracts, shipping documents and 
acknowledged delivery receipts for those transactions.
	
» Performing substantive procedures to verify period end 
accruals for adjustment on account of variable consideration.
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
We identified the recognition of revenue from sale of products 
as a key audit matter considering:
Revenue is a key performance indicator for the Company. 
Accordingly, there could be pressure to meet the expectations 
of investors / other stakeholders and / or to meet revenue 
targets stipulated in performance incentive schemes for a 
reporting period. We have considered that there is a risk of 
fraud related to revenue being overstated by recognition in 
the wrong period or before control has passed during the year 
and at period end.  Adjustments made with respect to variable 
consideration are based on contractual arrangements, market 
conditions and accumulated experience which requires 
judgement and estimation by the Group and change in these 
estimates can have a significant financial impact.
	» Examining high risk journal entries and other adjustments 
that contain unusual combinations of credit to revenue 
with no associated debit to cash, debtors, or another 
revenue account. 
	» We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the 
financial statements as per the requirement of Ind AS 115 
Revenue from contracts with customers
Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of 
Directors are responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included 
in the Holding Company’s annual report, but does 
not include the financial statements and auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
Management’s and Board of Directors 
Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board 
of Directors are responsible for the preparation 
and presentation of these consolidated financial 
statements in term of the requirements of the Act 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
state of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other 
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the 
Group in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 
133 of the Act. The respective Management and 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each 
company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; the selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
by the Management and Board of Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group are responsible for 
assessing the ability of each company to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the respective Board of 
Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	» Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	» Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	» Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the 
Management and Board of Directors.
	» Conclude on the appropriateness of the 
Management and Board of Directors use of the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparation 
of consolidated financial statements and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness 
of this assumption. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
	» Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
	» Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial statements of such 
entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the 
financial statements of such entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we 
are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, 
which have been audited by other auditors, such 
other auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried 
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are 
further described in paragraph (a) of the section 
titled “Other Matter” in this audit report.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Holding Company and such other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements of 
which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter

on the consolidated financial statements of Ajanta Pharma Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report 
of even date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of Ajanta Pharma Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) as 
of and for the year ended 31 March 2025, we have 
audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements of the Holding Company , as 
of that date.
In our opinion, the Holding Company, has, in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such internal 
financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 
March 2025, based on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Holding Company considering the essential 
components of such internal controls stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by the Holding 
Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the Holding Company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements were 
established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements include those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and 
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

OVERVIEW
STATUTORY 
REPORTS
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
NOTICE
1. Corporate Information
Ajanta Pharma Limited (“the Company”) is a public 
limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. 
Its shares are listed on Bombay Stock Exchange and 
National Stock Exchange. The registered office of 
Holding Company is located at Ajanta House, Charkop, 
Kandivali (West), Mumbai. These Consolidated Financial 
statements (“CFS”) comprises the Company and its 
wholly owned subsidiaries (referred to collectively as 
the “Group”).
The Group is primarily involved in development, 
manufacturing and marketing of speciality 
pharmaceutical finished dosages.
2. Basis of Preparation
Statement of Compliance:
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind AS’) as per the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
from time to time, notified under section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) and other relevant 
provisions of the Act. These consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on an accrual 
basis and under the historical cost basis, except 
otherwise stated.
These Consolidated Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2025 have been reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and subsequently approved by the Board 
of Directors at its meeting held on 30 April 2025.
Use of estimates and judgements:
The preparation of consolidated financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires management to 
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on the date of the financial statements. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. Estimates and under 
lying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively in current and future periods.
Judgements:
Information about judgements made in applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant 
effects on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements is included in the following notes.
Classification of Lease as per Ind AS 116:
Ind AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the 
lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease 
adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the 
lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The 
Group makes an assessment on the expected lease 
term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses 
whether it is reasonably certain that any options to 
extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In 
evaluating the lease term, The Group considers factors 
such as any significant leasehold improvements 
undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to 
the termination of lease and the importance of the 
underlying lease to The Group’s operations taking into 
account the location of the underlying asset and the 
availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term 
in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease 
term reflects the current economic circumstances. The 
discount rate is generally based on the incremental 
borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated 
or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.
Estimates:
Information about assumptions and estimation 
uncertainties at the reporting date that have a 
significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year is included in the following notes
Recognition of current and deferred tax assets:
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the 
sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. 
The calculation of The Group’s total tax charge 
necessarily involves a degree of estimation in respect 
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally 
determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a 
formal legal process. The final resolution of some of 
these items may give rise to material profits/losses 
and/or cash flows.
The complexity of The Group’s structure makes the 
degree of estimation more challenging. The resolution 
of issues is not always within the control of The Group 
and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legal 
processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which 
The Group operates. Issues can, and often do, take 
many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting 
period result from payments on account and on the 
final resolution of open items. As a result there can be 
substantial differences between the tax charge in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and tax payments.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon 
whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and 
suitable taxable profits will be available in the future 
against which the reversal of temporary differences 
can be deducted. To determine the future taxable 
profits, reference is made to the latest available profit 
forecasts. Where the temporary differences are related 
to losses, relevant tax law is considered to determine 
the availability of the losses to offset against the future 
taxable profits.
Chargebacks, rebates and discount:
Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts, other 
deductions and Medicaid payments are estimated 
and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as 
reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim 
made by the wholesaler for the difference between 
the price at which the product is initially invoiced to 
the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed 
to be procured from the Group. Provisions for such 
chargebacks, rebates and discounts are accrued and 
estimated based on historical average rate actually 
claimed over a period of time, current contract prices 
with wholesalers/other customers and estimated 
inventory holding by the wholesaler.
Property, plant and equipment:
Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life 
prescribed in Schedule II of the Act. In cases, where 
the useful lives are different from that prescribed in 
Schedule II, they are based on technical advice, taking 
into account the nature of the asset, the estimated 
usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the 
asset, past history of replacement, anticipated 
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties and 
maintenance support.
Recognition and measurement of defined 
benefit obligations:
The obligation arising from the defined benefit plan 
is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends 
in salary escalation and vested future benefits and 
life expectancy. The discount rate is determined with 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on the government bonds. The period to maturity 
of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable 
maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations.
Intangible Assets:
Intangible assets majorly consist of trademark and 
software licences which are amortised over licence 
period which equates the economic useful life ranging 
between 2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the 
period of its economic useful life.
Allowance for uncollected accounts receivable 
and advances:
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are 
stated at their normal value as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Individual trade receivables are written off when 
management seems them not collectible. Impairment 
is made using expected credit loss model.
The impairment provisions for financial assets are based 
on assumption about risk of default and expected loss 
rates. Judgement in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation are 
based on past history, existing market condition as 
well as forward looking estimates at the end of each 
reporting period.
Allowances for inventories:
Management reviews the inventory age listing on a 
periodic basis. The review involves comparison of 
the carrying value of the aged inventory items. The 
purpose is to ascertain whether an allowance is 
required to be made in the financial statement for 
any obsolete and slow-moving items. Management is 
satisfied that adequate allowance for obsolete and 
slow-moving inventories has been made in the group’s 
financial statements.
Management also reviews net realizable value for all 
its inventory and is satisfied that adequate allowance 
has been made in the financial statements.
Contingencies:
Management judgement is required for estimating 
the possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Group as 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of pending 
matters with accuracy.
Impairment reviews:
An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset 
or cash generating unit (‘CGU’) exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of its fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use 
calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. 
In calculating the value in use, certain assumptions 
are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain 
matters, including management’s expectations of 
growth in EBITDA, long term growth rates; and the 
selection of discount rates to reflect the risks involved.
Determination of functional currency:
Each entity in the group determines its own functional 
currency (the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates) and items 
included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency. Ind AS 21, 
“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” 
prescribes the factors to be considered for the purpose 
of determination of functional currency. Management 
uses its judgement to determine the functional currency 
that most faithfully represents the economic effects of 
the underlying transactions, events and conditions.
Provision for anticipated sales return:
In determining the provision for anticipated sales 
returns, estimates for probable saleable and non-
saleable returns of goods from the customers are 
made on scientific basis after factoring in the historical 
data of such returns and its trend.

3.	 Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statement of the Company and its wholly 
owned subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity over which 
the Group has control. Control is achieved when the 
Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee 
if and only if the Group has:
	» Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give 
it the current ability to direct the relevant activities 
of the investee)
	» Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
	» The ability to use its power over the investee to 
affect its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting 
rights result in control. To support this presumption and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting 
or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether 
it has power over an investee, including:
	» The contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee.
	» Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
	» The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
	» The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights 
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of 
the other voting rights holders.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements 
of control.
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and 
other events in similar circumstances. If a member of 
the Group uses accounting policies other than those 
adopted in the consolidated financial statements for 
like transactions and events in similar circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that Group 
member’s financial statements in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity 
with the Group’s accounting policies.
Consolidation procedure:
(i)	
Subsidiaries
	
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. 
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, 
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date on 
which control commences until the date on which 
control ceases.
Items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and 
cashflows of the parents with those of its subsidiaries 
are combined like to like basis. For this purpose, income 
& expenses of the subsidiaries are based on the assets 
and liabilities recognised in consolidated financial 
statements at acquisition date.
(ii)	
Non-controlling interests (NCI)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of 
the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date 
of acquisition.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding 
goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified 
separately from the Group’s equity. NCI are measured 
at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of those 
interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling 
interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total 
comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest 
having a deficit balance.
(iii)	 Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, 
it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components 
of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary 
is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. 
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
(iv)	 Transaction’s eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any 
unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-
group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, 
but only to the extent that there is no evidence 
of impairment.
4. Functional and Presentation Currency
Group’s consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional 
currency of the Holding Company. For each entity the 
Group determines the functional currency and items 
included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency.
Initial recognition: 
Currency transactions are recorded by the Group’s 
entities at their respective functional currency, by 
applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange 
rate between the functional currency and foreign 
currency at the date of the transaction.
Conversion:
Foreign currency monetary items are reported at 
functional currency spot rate of exchange at reporting 
date. ‘Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rates at the dates of 
the initial transactions.
Group companies:
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations are translated into Indian rupees at the rate 
of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their 
statements of profit or loss are translated at average 
exchange rates.
For practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate 
to translate income and expense items, if the average 
rate approximates the exchange rates at the dates 
of the transactions. The exchange differences arising 
on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the component 
of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in profit or loss.
5. Rounding of Amounts
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and

6. Current / Non-Current Classification
An entity shall classify an asset as current when-
(a)	
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or 
consume it, in its normal operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
(d)	
the asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the 
asset is restricted from being exchanged or used 
to settle a liability for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period.
An entity shall classify all other assets as non-current.
An entity shall classify a liability as current when-
(a)	
it expects to settle the liability in its normal 
operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
the liability is due to be settled within twelve 
months after the reporting period; or
(d)	
it does not have an unconditional right to defer 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that 
could, at the option of the counterparty, result in 
its settlement by the issue of equity instruments 
do not affect its classification.
An entity shall classify all other liabilities as non-current.
Operating Cycle
An operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or 
cash equivalents.
Based on the nature of products / activities of the 
group and the normal time between acquisition of 
assets and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, 
the group has determined its operating cycle as twelve 
months for the purpose of classification of its assets 
and liabilities as current and non-current.
7. Material Accounting Policies
7.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
Recognition and measurement:
Items of PPE are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of 
an item of PPE comprises its purchase price, including 
import duties and other non-refundable taxes or levies 
and any directly to the attributable cost of bringing 
the assets to its working condition for its intended use 
and any trade discount and rebates are deducted 
in arriving at purchase price. Cost of the assets 
also includes interest on borrowings attributable to 
acquisition of qualifying fixed assets up to the date 
the asset is ready for its intended use incurred up to 
that date.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the 
plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-
term construction projects if the recognition criteria are 
met. When significant parts of plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group 
depreciates these components separately based 
on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major 
inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All 
other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss as incurred.
Cost of Items of Property, plant and equipment not 
ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date, is 
disclosed as capital work in progress. Advances given 
towards acquisition of property, plant and equipment 
outstanding at each balance sheet date are disclosed 
as Capital Advance under Other non-current assets.
All identifiable revenue expenses including interest 
incurred in respect of various projects/ expansion, net 
of income earned during the project development 
stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-

operative expenses and disclosed under Capital Work 
– in – Progress.
Capital expenditure on Property, plant and equipment 
for research and development is classified under 
property, plant and equipment and is depreciated on 
the same basis as other property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are derecognised 
either on disposal or when the asset retires from 
active use. Losses arising in the case of the retirement 
of property, plant and equipment and gains or losses 
arising from disposal of property, plant and equipment 
are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the 
year of occurrence.
Transition to Ind AS:
The cost property, plant and equipment at 1 April 
2016, the Companies date of transition to Ind AS, 
was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), 
as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
Subsequent expenditure:
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the company and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Depreciation:
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the 
depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is 
provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives 
as prescribed under Schedule II to the Act or as per 
technical assessment. The residual values, useful lives 
and method of depreciation of PPE is reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
Depreciation on additions / disposals is provided on 
a pro-rata basis i.e. from / up to the date on which is 
asset is ready to use / disposed off. Freehold land is 
not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of Tangible assets are 
as follows
PPE
Useful Life
Buildings*
5 Years to 60 Years
Plant and Equipment*
3 Years to 25 Years
Furniture and Fixtures*
10 Years
Vehicles
8 Years to 10 Years
Office Equipment’s*
3 Years to 5 Years
* For these class of assets, the useful life of assets is different than 
the prescribed life as per Part C of Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. The different useful life is based on internal technical 
evaluation by the Company and historical usage of assets.
Dies & Punches having useful life of 3 years as per 
technical evaluation and management estimate and 
Solar Plants having useful life of 25 years.
Property, plant and equipment which are added / 
disposed off during the year, depreciation is provided 
on pro-rata basis.
Building constructed on leasehold land are depreciated 
based on the useful life specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013, where the lease period of the 
land is beyond the life of the building. In other cases, 
building constructed on leasehold land are amortised 
over the primary lease period of the land.
Depreciation for Subsidiaries:
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment has 
been provided at the rates required / permissible by the 
GAAPs of the respective countries. The management 
believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic 
and reflect fair approximation of the period over which 
the assets are likely to be used.
Vehicles acquired on finance leases are depreciated 
over the period of lease agreement or the useful life, 
whichever is shorter.
7.2 Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
assets can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses, if any. Internally 
generated intangibles, excluding development costs 
as defined in Ind AS, are not capitalised and the related 
expenditure is reflected in Statement of profit and loss 
in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
Trademarks and software are amortised over their 
estimated useful life on straight line basis from the date 
they are available for intended use or the period of 
the license as applicable, subject to impairment test.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss when the assets 
are derecognised.
Research and Development:
Revenue expenditure on research is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which it 
is incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is carried forward when its future recoverability 
can reasonably be regarded as assured. Any 
expenditure carried forward is amortised over the 
period of expected future sales from the related 
project. The carrying value of development costs is 
reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is 
not yet in use, and otherwise when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
Impairment on non-financial assets:
The group’s non-financial assets other than inventories 
and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, 
then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows (i.e. corporate assets) are 
grouped together into cash-generating units (CGUs). 
Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its 
value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value 
in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, 
discounted to their present value using a discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment loss recognized in respect of a 
CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amounts 
of the assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro 
rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which 
impairment loss has been recognized in prior periods, 
the Company reviews at each reporting date whether 
there is any indication that the loss has decreased or 
no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only 
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no 
impairment loss had been recognized.
The following intangible assets are tested for 
impairment each financial year even if there is no 
indication that the asset is impaired:
i)	
An intangible asset that is not yet available for 
use; and
ii)	
An intangible asset that is amortised over a period 
exceeding ten years from the date when the asset 
is available for use.
7.3 Non-current assets classified as held for 
sale
Assets are classified as held for sale and stated at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell if the asset is available for immediate sale and its 
sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets 
are presented separately in the Balance Sheet as 
“Assets Classified as Held for Sale”. Once classified as 
held for sale, intangible assets, investment property 
and property, plant and equipment are no longer 
amortized or depreciated.
7.4  Financial Instruments
Trade receivables and debt securities issued are 
initially recognised when they originate. All other 
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
recognised when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without 
a significant financing component) or financial liability 
is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for 
an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade 
receivable without a significant financing component 
is initially measured at the transaction price.
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial Assets:
Classification:
The Group classifies financial assets as subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or 
loss, on the basis of its business model for managing 
the financial assets and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial asset.
Initial recognition and measurement:
All financial assets excluding trade receivable (not 
measured subsequently at fair value through profit or 
loss) are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction 
costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the 
financial asset.
Subsequent measurement:
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in two broad categories:
	
» Financial assets at fair value (FVTPL/FVTOCI)
	
» Financial assets at amortised cost

OVERVIEW
STATUTORY 
REPORTS
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
NOTICE
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and 
losses are either recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), 
or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)).
Financial Assets measured at amortised cost (net of 
write down for impairment, if any):
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost when 
asset is held within a business model, whose objective 
is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash 
flows and contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest. Such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method less impairment, if 
any. The losses arising from impairment are recognised 
in the Statement of profit and loss.
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value, when asset is held within a business model, 
whose objective is to hold assets for both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
Fair value movements are recognized in the other 
comprehensive income.
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value 
with all changes recognised in profit or loss.
Investment in Subsidiary:
Investment in equity instruments of Subsidiaries 
are measured at cost. In the financial statements, 
investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost. The carrying 
amount is reduced to recognise any impairment in the 
value of investment.
Investment in Equity Instruments:
Equity instruments which are held for trading are 
classified as at FVTPL. Fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in 
profit or loss.
Investment in Debt Instruments:
A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost or 
at FVTOCI. Any debt instrument, which does not meet 
the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. Debt instruments 
included within the FVTPL category are measured at 
fair value with all changes recognised in the Statement 
of profit and loss.
Derecognition of Financial Assets:
A financial asset is primarily derecognised when the 
rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired 
or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset.
Impairment of Financial Assets:
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the financial assets 
that are debt instruments and trade receivables.
Financial Liabilities:
Classification:
The Group classifies all financial liabilities as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
Initial recognition and measurement:
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, 
loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and 
derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement:
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when 
the liabilities are derecognised as well as through EIR 
amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated 
by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part 
of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities:
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Derivative Financial Instrument:
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such 
as forward currency contracts to mitigate its foreign 
currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments 
are initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives 
are carried as financial assets when the fair value 
is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair 
value is negative. Any changes therein are generally 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
7.5 Inventories
Raw materials and packing materials are valued at 
lower of cost (on moving weighted average basis) and 
the net realisable value, cost of which includes duties 
and taxes (net off CENVAT and Goods and Service Tax 
wherever applicable). Cost of imported raw materials 
and packing materials lying in bonded warehouse 
includes the amount of customs duty. Finished products 
including traded goods and work-in-progress are 
valued at lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress have 
been computed to include all cost of purchases, cost 
of conversion, appropriate share of fixed production 
overheads based on normal operating capacity and 
other related cost incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs 
of completion and selling expenses necessary to make 
the sale.
Slow and non-moving material, products nearing 
expiry, defective inventory are fully provided for and 
valued at net realisable value.
Goods and materials in transit are valued at actual cost 
incurred up to the date of balance sheet. Materials and 
other items held for use in production of inventories are 
not written down, if the finished products in which they 
will be used are expected to be sold at or above cost.
Consumables and other materials procured for R&D 
purpose are charged off when acquired.
The comparison of cost and Net realizable value is 
made on an item-by-item basis.
7.6 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash on 
hand and cash at bank including fixed deposit/highly 
liquid investments with original maturity period of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, as they are considered an 
integral part of the group’s cash management.
7.7 Cash Flow Statement
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flow 
from operating, investing and financing activities of the 
Group are segregated.
7.8 Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
the Company’s functional currency at the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured based on historical cost in 
a foreign currency are not translated. Foreign currency 
exchange differences are generally recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of 
monetary items or on translating monetary items 
at rates different from those at which they were 
translated on initial recognition during the period or 
in previous Financial Statements are recognised in the 
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss in the period 
in which they arise. When a gain or loss on a non-
monetary item is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income, any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. 
Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary 
item is recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss, any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
In case of foreign operations whose functional currency 
is different from the parent company’s functional 
currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign 
operations, The income and expenses of such foreign 
operations are translated to the reporting currency 
at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing 
during the year. Resulting foreign currency differences 
are recognized in other comprehensive income/ (loss) 
and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When

a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, 
the relevant amount in the FCTR is reclassified to the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as a part 
of gain or loss on disposal.
7.9 Revenue Recognition
Sale of Goods:
Revenue is measured based on the transaction 
price adjusted for discounts, rebates, chargebacks, 
medicaids, product recalls & supply penalties, which 
is specified in a contract with customer. Revenue 
are net of estimated returns and taxes collected 
from customers.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognized at point in 
time when control is transferred to the customer and 
it is probable that consideration will be collected. 
Control of goods is transferred upon the shipment of 
the goods to the customer or when goods is made 
available to the customer as per terms agreed.
The transaction price is documented on the sales 
invoice and payment is generally due as per agreed 
credit terms with customer.
The consideration can be fixed or variable. Variable 
consideration is only recognised when it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
Sales return is variable consideration that is recognised 
and recorded based on historical experience, market 
conditions and provided for in the year of sale as 
reduction from revenue. The methodology and 
assumptions used to estimate returns are monitored 
and adjusted regularly in line with trade practices, 
historical trends, past experience and projected 
market conditions.
Interest income:
Interest income is recognised with reference to the 
Effective Interest Rate method.
Dividend income:
Dividend from investment is recognised as revenue 
when right to receive is established.
Income from Export Benefits and Other Incentives:
Export benefits available under prevalent schemes are 
accrued as revenue in the year in which the goods are 
exported and / or services are rendered only when their 
reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to 
them will be complied with, and the amounts will be 
received. Export benefit receivables are carried at net 
realisable value.
7.10	Employee Benefits
In case of Holding Company:
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of rendering service are classified as short-term 
employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, 
short-term compensated absences, performance 
incentives etc., and the expected cost of bonus, ex-
gratia are recognised during the period in which the 
employee renders related service.
(i)	
Defined benefit plans
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit 
retirement plan (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering eligible 
employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum 
payment to vested employees at retirement, death, 
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an 
amount based on the respective employee’s salary 
and the tenure of employment with the Company.
Liabilities with regard to Gratuity Plan are determined 
by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent 
actuary, at each balance sheet date using the 
Projected Unit Credit Method.
The Company fully contributes all ascertained liabilities 
to the Ajanta Pharma Limited Group Gratuity Trust (the 
Trust). Trustees administer contributions made to the 
Trust and contributions are invested in a scheme with 
Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by 
laws of India.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of 
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation 
is limited to the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The 
Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined 
benefit plan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the 
other comprehensive income for the period in which 
they occur. The effect of any plan amendments are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(ii)	
Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised as expense when employees have 
rendered services entitling them to such benefits.
The Company pays provident fund contributions 
to publicly administered provident funds as per 
local regulations. The Company has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are accounted for as 
defined contribution plans and the contributions are 
recognized as employee benefit expense when they 
are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an 
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction 
in the future payments is available.
(iii)	 Compensated absences
The Company has a policy on compensated absences 
which are both accumulating and non-accumulating 
in nature. The expected cost of accumulating 
compensated absences is determined by actuarial 
valuation performed by an independent actuary at 
each balance sheet date using projected unit credit 
method on the additional amount expected to be 
paid/availed within twelve months as a result of the 
unused entitlement that has accumulated at the 
balance sheet date.
Compensated absences which are not expected to 
occur within twelve months after the end of the period 
in which the employee renders the related services are 
recognised as a liability at the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognized in the period in which the 
absences occur.
(iv)	 Share-based compensation
Employees Stock Options Plans (“ESOPs”): The grant 
date fair value of options granted to employees 
is recognized as an employee expense, over the 
period that the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. The expense is recorded for 
each separately vesting portion of the award as if 
the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The 
increase in equity recognized in connection with 
share based payment transaction is presented as 
a separate component in equity under “Employee 
Stock Options Outstanding Reserve”. The amount 
recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of stock options that vest. The options 
granted to employees of subsidiary is recognised as 
an equity investment.
The company recognizes compensation expense 
relating to share-based payments in net profit using 
fair-value in accordance with Ind AS 102, Share-
Based Payment.
In case of Subsidiary at Mauritius:
For employees who are not covered by a pension 
plan, the net present value of severance allowances 
payable under the Employment Rights Act 2008 is 
provided for. The obligations arising under this item 
are not funded.
In case of Subsidiary at Philippines:
Short-term benefits:
The Company recognizes a liability net of amounts 
already paid and an expense for services rendered by 
employees during the accounting period. Short term 
benefits given by the Company to its employees include 
salaries and wages, social security contributions, short 
term compensated absences, bonuses and other non-
monetary benefits.
Post-employment benefits:
The Company does not have a formal retirement 
benefit plan. However, the Company is subject to the 
provisions of Republic Act No. 7641, retirement law.
Compensated Absences:
Compensated absences are recognized for the 
number of paid leave days remaining at the end of 
the reporting period. Those are included in the salaries 
and wages account and are recognized when availed 
of by the employees.
In case of Subsidiary at USA:
Short-term benefits:
The Company recognizes a liability net of amounts 
already paid and an expense for services rendered by 
employees during the accounting period. Short-term 
benefits given by the Company to its employees include 
salaries and wages, social security contributions, 
Medicare contributions, and other non-monetary 
benefits. A liability is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid, if the Company has a present 
legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as 
a result of past service provided by the employee, and 
the amount of obligation can be estimated reliably.
Post-employment benefits:
The Company provides a 401(k) retirement program 
for full-time employees who are 21 years of age or 
older. Eligible employees are entitled to participate 
in the company offered plan with an option to 
contribute up to maximum 3% of annual base salary. 
For employees with an annual base salary above the 
annual compensation limits, as determined by the 
Federal Internal Revenue Service (Federal), the annual 
APUI contribution will be capped at 3% of the Federal 
allowed annual compensation limits. All contributions 
are 100% vested immediately to the employee.
7.11 Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed 
in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs 
consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing 
cost also includes exchange differences to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
7.12 Leases
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land and buildings. The Group assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of 
a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an

identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves 
the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from use of 
the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the 
Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term 
of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low 
value leases. For these short-term and low value 
leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as 
an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease.
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
prior to the commencement date of the lease plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) 
is determined on an individual asset basis unless the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
generally accepted interest rate. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Company changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing cash flows.
Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a 
finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified 
as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
In respect of assets given on operating lease, lease 
rentals are accounted in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss, on accrual basis in accordance with the 
respective lease agreements.
7.13 Government Grants
Government grants are initially recognised as deferred 
income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and the Company will comply 
with the conditions associated with the grant;
	» In case of capital grants, they are then recognised 
in Statement of Profit and Loss as other income on 
a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
	» In case of grants that compensate the Company for 
expenses incurred are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss on a systematic basis in the periods 
in which the expenses are recognised.
7.14 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders 
of the company by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted 
earnings per equity share is computed by dividing 
the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the 
company by the weighted average number of equity 
shares considered for deriving basic earnings per 
equity share and also the weighted average number 
of equity shares that could have been issued upon 
conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The 
dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the 
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been 
actually issued at fair value. Dilutive potential equity 
shares are deemed converted as of the beginning 
of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive 
potential equity shares are determined independently 
for each period presented.
7.15 Income Taxes
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred 
income tax.
Current tax is recognised in statement of profit or loss, 
except when they relate to items that are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
in which case, the current tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively. Current income tax for current and prior 
periods is recognized at the amount expected to be 
paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted by the 
balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply to taxable income in the years 
in which those temporary differences are expected to 
be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax 
rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is 
recognized as income or expense in the period that 
includes the enactment or the substantive enactment 
date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and tax losses can be utilized. The Group 
offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, 
where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognized amounts and where it intends either to 
settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the 
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where it is 
expected that the earnings of the subsidiary will not 
be distributed in the foreseeable future.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
7.16 Dividends to Shareholders
Annual dividend distribution to the shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the shareholders. Any 
interim dividend paid is recognised on approval by 
Board of Directors. Dividend payable is recognised 
directly in equity.
7.17 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, 
Contingent Assets and Commitments
General:
Provisions (legal and constructive) are recognised 
when the Group has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made.
Provisions (excluding retirement benefits and 
compensated absences) are not discounted to its 
present value and are determined based on best 
estimate required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current 
best estimates.
If there is any expectation that some or all of the 
provision will be reimbursed, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating 
to a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any virtually certain reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risk specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 
a finance cost.
Contingent liability is disclosed in the case of:
	
» a present obligation arising from past events, when 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation;
	
» a present obligation arising from past events, when 
no reliable estimates is possible;
	
» a possible obligation arising from past events, unless 
the probability of outflow of resources is remote.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent 
assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the 
Financial Statements.
Commitments include the amount of purchase order 
(net of advances) issued to parties for completion of 
assets and Non-cancellable operating lease.
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets 
and commitments are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date.
7.18 Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date 
in accordance with Ind AS 113.
Financials Statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for the following material 
items in the statement of financial position:
	
» Derivative financial instruments (mainly forward 
currency contracts) are measured at fair value 
received from Bank.
	
» Mutual Funds are measured at fair values as per Net 
Asset Value (NAV).
	
» Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) at fair values as 
per Black Scholes option pricing model.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or settle a liability in an ordinary transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:
	» Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	» Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
	» Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy 
as explained above.
7.19 Recent accounting pronouncements
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the year ended 31 
March, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance 
Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, 
relating to the sale and leaseback transactions, 
w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Group has reviewed the new 
pronouncements and based on its evaluation has 
determined that it does not have any significant 
impact in its financial statements.

46.	Capital Management
Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. Management monitors the return (EBIT) on capital, as well as the level of 
dividends to equity shareholders. The Group’s objective for capital management is to maximise shareholder value, 
safeguard business continuity and support the growth of the Group. The Group determines the capital requirement 
based on annual operating plans and long-term and other strategic investment plans. 
Group monitors capital using a ratio of ‘adjusted net debt’ to ‘adjusted equity’. For this purpose, adjusted net debt is 
defined as debt less cash and cash equivalents and current investments. Adjusted equity comprises all components 
of equity. 
Group’s policy is to keep the Net Debt Equity ratio below 1.00 and its adjusted net debt to equity ratio at 31 March 
2025 was as follows.

Sensitivity Analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other 
assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation as shown below.

Although the analysis does not take into account full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does 
provide an approximation of sensitivity of assumptions. The estimate of future increase in compensation levels, 
considered in the actuarial valuation, have been taken on account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other 
relevant factors such as supply and demand in the employment market.
49.3 Leave Encashment:
The Holding Company’s employees are entitled for compensated absences which are allowed to be accumulated 
and encashed as per the Company’s policies. The liability of compensated absences, which is non-funded, has 
been provided based on report of independent actuary using “Projected Unit Credit Method”.
Accordingly, H 41.39 Crore (31 March 2024 H 33.07 Crore) being liability as at the year-end for compensated absences 
as per actuarial valuation has been provided in the accounts.
Employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at Mauritius:
For employees who are not covered by a pension plan, the net present value of severance allowances payable is 
provided for aggregating H 0.66 Crore (31 March 2024 H Nil).
Employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at Philippines:
Short term benefits include salaries and wages and other government contributions which are due within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which employee renders the related service. The Company’s short-term employee 
benefits amounted to H Nil (31 March 2024 H Nil). The Company did not yet set up a retirement plan since it does not 
have more than ten employees who had served at least five years.
Employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at USA:
Short term benefits include salaries and wages and other government contributions which are due within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which employee renders the related service. The Company’s short-term employee 
benefits amounted to H 3.32 Crore (31 March 2024 H 2.96 Crore).
50.	Share Based Payments
The Holding Company has established “Employee Stock Options Scheme 2011” (‘ESOP-2011’) and “Share based 
Incentive Plan 2019” as approved in earlier year by the shareholders of the Company and Compensation committee 
of Board of Directors for the key employees of the Company. The options issued under the above scheme vest in 
a phased manner.
During the year ending on 31 March 2024, the company made the decision to withdraw the Employee Stock Options 
Scheme 2011 in the Nomination & Remuneration committee meeting held on 31 January 2024, with immediate effect.
During the year ending on 31 March 2025 15,700 option cancelled by the Company under the Share based Incentive 
Plan 2019 to the employees of the Group (includes 13,000 options granted to employee of a subsidiary).

Valuation of stock options
The fair value of stock options granted during the period has been measured using the Black–Scholes option pricing 
model at the date of the grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend 
yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk-free interest rates. They key inputs and assumptions used are 
as follows:
Share price: The closing price on NSE as on the date of grant has been considered for valuing the options granted.
Exercise Price: Exercise Price is the market price or face value or such other price as determined by the Remuneration 
and Compensation Committee.
Expected Volatility: The historical volatility of the stock till the date of grant has been considered to calculate the 
fair value of the options.
Expected Option Life: Expected Life of option is the period for which the Company expects the options to be live. 
The minimum life of a stock option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised and the 
maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised.
Expected dividends: Expected dividend yield has been calculated as an average of dividend yields for four years 
preceding the date of the grant.
Risk free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate on the date of grant considered for the calculation is the interest 
rate applicable for a maturity equal to the expected life of the options based on the zero-coupon yield curve for 
Government Securities.
These assumptions reflect management’s best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties 
based on market conditions generally outside of the Company’s control. As a result, if other assumptions had been 
used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if 
management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially 
impacted in future years. The Company has granted stock options to employees of a subsidiary, the estimated fair 
value of stock options issued are included in the carrying value of the investment in the said subsidiary on a straight-
line basis over the requisite service period of each separately vesting portion of the award.
Share appreciation rights (SARs)
On 30 January 2025, the Group granted 13,000 share appreciation rights (SARs), respectively, to employees of the 
Ajanta Pharma USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, that entitle them to a cash payment. The amount of the cash 
payment will be difference between share price of the Company on the date of vesting and issue price.
Total carrying amount of liabilities for SARs is H 0.52 Crore as at 31 March 2025.
The fair value of the SARs has been measured using the Black-Scholes Merton formula. Service and non-market 
performance conditions attached to the arrangements were not taken into account in measuring fair value.
The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date and measurement date of the SARs were 
as follows.

Fair value hierarchy	
	
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments 
that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are 
disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining 
fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting 
standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.

Level 1 – Level 1 Hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes mutual funds 
that have declared buyback NAV. The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.
Level 2 – The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (like Mark to Market Derivatives, 
and Non-convertible market link Debentures) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of 
observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required 
to fair value as instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3 – If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included 
in level 3. 
Measurement of fair values
Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs:
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 & Level 3 fair values, for financial 
instruments measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, as well as the significant unobservable

a)	
Trade receivables 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and 
control relating to customer credit risk management. Trade receivables, which are non-interest bearing, are mainly 
from stockists, distributors and customers and are generally on 14 days to 270 days credit term. Outstanding 
customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company has no concentration of credit risk as the customer 
base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.
As at 31 March 2025, Group had 82 customers (31 March 2024: 76 customers) that owed the company more than H 
0.50 Crore each and accounted for approximately  93% and 91% of the total outstanding as at 31 March 2025 and 
31 March 2024.
Expected credit loss assessment
As per simplified approach, the Group makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivable using a 
provision matrix to mitigate the risk of default payment and make appropriate provision at each reporting date 
wherever required. The trend of the bad debts is negligible.

b. 	
Financial instruments 
Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in liquid securities issued by mutual funds having a credit ranking 
of at least 3 and above from CRISIL or equivalent rating agency. Group monitors changes in credit risk by tracking 
published external credit ranking. Based on its on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Group adjusts its 
exposure to various counterparties.
ii.	
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations 
without incurring unacceptable losses. The Group’s objective is to, at all times maintain optimum levels of liquidity 
to meet its cash and collateral requirements. The Group closely monitors its liquidity position and deploys a robust 
cash management system. It maintains adequate sources of financing including bilateral loans, debt and overdraft 
from banks at an optimised cost. Working capital requirements are adequately addressed by internally generated 
funds. Trade receivables are kept within manageable levels. 
Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments 
at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities over the next six months. The ratio of cash 
and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments to outflows is 0.65 at 31 March 2025 (0.55 at 
31 March 2024).

iii. 	 Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity 
prices – will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments, and 
derivative financial instruments. 
Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates and interest rates. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts to 
manage its exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations.  All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines 
set by the risk management committee.
Sensitivity Analysis on Interest rate
The Company’s fixed rate bank deposits and securities are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject 
to interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flow will fluctuate 
because of a change in market interest rates.
Sensitivity Analysis on Equity prices
The Group has invested its surplus funds primarily in debt based mutual funds. The value of investment in these 
mutual fund schemes is reflected though Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset Management Company 
on daily basis. The Company has not performed a sensitivity analysis on these mutual funds based on estimated 
fluctuations in their NAV as in management’s opinion, such analysis would not display a correct picture.
iv.	
Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, 
purchases and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of the Group. The currencies 
in which these transactions are primarily denominated are US Dollars, Euro, Mauritian Rupee, Philippine Peso and 
Nigerian Naira.
At any point in time, the Group covers foreign currency risk by taking appropriate percentage of its foreign currency 
exposure, as approved by risk management committee in line with the laid down policy approved by the Board. 
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year 
from the reporting date. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the 
Group’s policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies 
at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.

a)	
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily 
to the Group’s debt interest obligations. Further, the Group engages in financing activities at market linked rates, 
any changes in the interest rates environment may impact future rates of borrowing.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to management is as follows.

53.	Disaggregation of Revenue
The operations of the Group are limited to only one segment viz. pharmaceuticals and related products. Revenue 
from contract with customers is from sale of manufactured goods and traded goods. Sale of goods are made 
at a point in time and revenue is recognised upon satisfaction of the performance obligations which is typically 
upon dispatch / delivery. The Group has a credit evaluation policy based on which the credit limits for the trade 
receivables are established. There is no significant financing component as the credit period provided by the Group 
is not significant.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of 
Ajanta Pharma Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements 
of Ajanta Pharma Limited (the “Company”) which 
comprise the standalone balance sheet as at 31 
March 2025, and the standalone statement of profit 
and loss (including other comprehensive income), 
standalone statement of changes in equity and 
standalone statement of cash flows for the year 
then ended, and notes to the standalone financial 
statements, including material accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid standalone financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of 
the Company as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and 
other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its 
cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India together with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Key audit matter
See Note 6.9, 35 and 50 to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue from sale of products is recognised at a point in time 
when control of the products is transferred to the customer. 
The actual point in time when revenue is recognised varies 
depending on the specific terms and conditions of the sales 
contracts entered with customers. Revenue from the sale of 
goods is measured based on the transaction price adjusted 
for discounts and rebates, which is specified in contract with 
customers. The Company has many customers operating in 
various geographies and sales contracts with these customers 
have distinct terms and conditions relating to the recognition 
of revenue and right of return.
We identified the recognition of revenue from sale of products 
as a key audit matter considering:
Revenue is a key performance indicator for the Company. 
Accordingly, there could be pressure to meet the expectations 
of investors / other stakeholders and / or to meet revenue 
targets stipulated in performance incentive schemes for a 
reporting period. We have considered that there is a risk of 
fraud related to revenue being overstated by recognition in the 
wrong period or before control has passed during the year and 
at period end.
Our procedures in respect of recognition of revenue included the 
following:
	» Verifying the accounting policies adopted by the Company 
with respect to recognition of revenue by comparing with the 
applicable accounting standards.
	» Testing the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Company’s manual and automated 
controls over revenue recognition.
	» Performing substantive testing of selected samples of revenue 
transactions recorded during the year as well as at year-
end. We used statistical sampling and verified contractual 
terms of sales invoices / contracts, shipping documents and 
acknowledged delivery receipts for those transactions.
	» Analysing and testing high risk journal entries that contain 
unusual combinations of credit to revenue with no associated 
debit to cash, debtors or another revenue account.
	» We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the 
financial statements as per the requirement of Ind AS 115 
Revenue from contracts with customers.
Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the 
Company’s annual report, but does not include the 
financial statements and auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the matters stated in Section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of 
these standalone financial statements that give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss 
and other comprehensive income, changes in equity 
and cash flows of the Company in accordance with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the 
Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing 
the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	» Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	» Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	» Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the 
Management and Board of Directors.
	» Conclude on the appropriateness of the 
Management and Board of Directors use of the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparation 
of standalone financial statements and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on

the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Company to cease to continue as 
a going concern.
	» Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

property, plant and equipment are verified 
in a phased manner over a period of 3 years. 
In accordance with this programme, certain

been linked with inventory records. In our

records that were more than 10% in the

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report
on the standalone financial statements of Ajanta Pharma Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report 
of even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of Ajanta Pharma 
Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in 
conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended on 
that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements and such internal financial 
controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 
2025, based on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements were 
established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the standalone 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements include those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and 
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CORPORATE 
OVERVIEW
STATUTORY 
REPORTS
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
NOTICE
1. Corporate Information
Ajanta Pharma Limited (“the Company”) is a public 
limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. 
Its shares are listed on Bombay Stock Exchanges and 
National Stock Exchange. The Registered office of 
the Company is located at Ajanta House, Charkop, 
Kandivali (West), Mumbai.
The Company is primarily involved in development, 
manufacturing and marketing of speciality 
pharmaceutical finished dosages.
2. Basis of Preparation
Statement of Compliance:
These standalone financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind AS’) as per the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
from time to time, notified under Section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) and other relevant 
provisions of the Act. These standalone financial 
statements have been prepared on an accrual 
basis and under the historical cost basis, except 
otherwise stated.
The standalone financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2025 have been reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and subsequently approved by the Board 
of Directors at its meeting held on 30 April 2025.
Use of estimates and judgements:
The preparation of standalone financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on the date of the financial statements. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. Estimates and under 
lying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively in current and future periods.
Judgements:
Information about judgements made in applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant 
effects on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements is included in the following notes.
Classification of Lease as per Ind AS 116:
Ind AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the 
lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease 
adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the 
lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. 
The Company makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby 
assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any 
options to extend or terminate the contract will be 
exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company 
considers factors such as any significant leasehold 
improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs 
relating to the termination of lease and the importance 
of the underlying lease to the Company’s operations 
taking into account the location of the underlying 
asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. 
The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure 
that the lease term reflects the current economic 
circumstances. The discount rate is generally based 
on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the 
lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with 
similar characteristics.
Estimates:
Information about assumptions and estimation 
uncertainties at the reporting date that have a 
significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year is included in the following notes.
Recognition of current and deferred tax assets:
The Company’s tax charge on ordinary activities is 
the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. 
The calculation of the Company’s total tax charge 
necessarily involves a degree of estimation in respect 
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally 
determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a 
formal legal process. The final resolution of some of 
these items may give rise to material profits/losses 
and/or cash flows.
The complexity of the Company’s structure makes the 
degree of estimation more challenging. The resolution 
of issues is not always within the control of the Company 
and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legal 
processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which 
the Company operates. Issues can, and often do, take 
many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting 
period result from payments on account and on the 
final resolution of open items. As a result there can be 
substantial differences between the tax charge in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and tax payments.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon 
whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and 
suitable taxable profits will be available in the future 
against which the reversal of temporary differences 
can be deducted. To determine the future taxable 
profits, reference is made to the latest available profit 
forecasts. Where the temporary differences are related 
to losses, relevant tax law is considered to determine 
the availability of the losses to offset against the future 
taxable profits.
Property, plant and equipment:
Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life 
prescribed in Schedule II of the Act. In cases, where 
the useful lives are different from that prescribed in 
Schedule II, they are based on technical advice, taking 
into account the nature of the asset, the estimated 
usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the 
asset, past history of replacement, anticipated 
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties and 
maintenance support.
Intangible Assets:
Intangible assets majorly consist of trademarks and 
software licences which are amortised over licence 
period which equates the economic useful life ranging 
between 2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the 
period of its economic useful life.
Recognition and measurement of defined 
benefit obligations:
The obligation arising from the defined benefit plan 
is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends 
in salary escalation and vested future benefits and 
life expectancy. The discount rate is determined with 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on the government bonds. The period to maturity 
of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable 
maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations.
Allowance for uncollected accounts receivable 
and advances:
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are 
stated at their normal value as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Individual trade receivables are written off when 
management seems them not collectible. Impairment 
is made using expected credit loss model.
The impairment provisions for financial assets are 
based on assumption about risk of default and 
expected loss rates. Judgement in making these 
assumption and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation are based on past history, existing market 
condition as well as forward-looking estimates at the 
end of each reporting period.
Allowances for inventories:
Management reviews the inventory age listing on a 
periodic basis. The review involves comparison of the 
carrying value of the aged inventory items. The purpose 
is to ascertain whether an allowance is required to 
be made in the standalone financial statement for 
any obsolete and slow-moving items. Management 
is satisfied that adequate allowance for obsolete 
and slow-moving inventories has been made in the 
financial statements.
Management also reviews net realisable value for all 
its inventory and is satisfied that adequate allowance 
has been made in the financial statements.
Contingencies:
Management judgement is required for estimating 
the possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Company 
as it is not possible to predict the outcome of pending 
matters with accuracy.
Impairment reviews:
An impairment exists when the carrying value of an 
asset or cash generating unit (‘CGU’) exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher 
of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
The value in use calculation is based on a discounted 
cash flow model. In calculating the value in use, certain 
assumptions are required to be made in respect of 
highly uncertain matters, including management’s 
expectations of growth in EBITDA, long-term growth 
rates; and the selection of discount rates to reflect the 
risks involved.
Provision for anticipated sales return:
In determining the provision for anticipated sales 
returns, estimates for probable saleable and non-
saleable returns of goods from the customers are 
made on scientific basis after factoring in the historical 
data of such returns and its trend.
3. Functional and Presentation Currency
The financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupees (‘INR’ or ‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘H’) which is the 
functional currency for the Company.
4. Rounding of Amounts
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and 
notes have been rounded off to the nearest Crore.
5. Current/non-current classification
An entity shall classify an asset as current when-
(a)	
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or 
consume it, in its normal operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
(d)	
the asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the 
asset is restricted from being exchanged or used 
to settle a liability for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period.
An entity shall classify all other assets as non-current.

An entity shall classify a liability as current when -
(a)	
it expects to settle the liability in its normal 
operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
the liability is due to be settled within twelve

do not affect its classification.
An entity shall classify all other liabilities as 
non-current.
Operating Cycle:

of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or 
cash equivalents.
Based on the nature of products/activities of the 
Company and the normal time between acquisition of 
assets and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, 
the Company has determined its operating cycle as 
twelve months for the purpose of classification of its 
assets and liabilities as current and non-current.
6.	 Material Accounting Policies
6.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
Recognition and measurement:
Items of PPE are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The 
cost of an item of PPE comprises its purchase 
price, 
including 
import 
duties 
and 
other 
non-refundable taxes or levies and any directly to the 
attributable cost of bringing the assets to its working 
condition for its intended use and any trade discount 
and rebates are deducted in arriving at purchase price. 
Cost of the assets also includes interest on borrowings 
attributable to acquisition of qualifying fixed assets 
up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use 
incurred up to that date.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the 
plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-
term construction projects if the recognition criteria are 
met. When significant parts of plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company 
depreciates these components separately based 
on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major 
inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All 
other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss as incurred.
Cost of Items of Property, plant and equipment not 
ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date, is 
disclosed as capital work-in-progress. Advances given 
towards acquisition of property, plant and equipment 
outstanding at each balance sheet date are disclosed 
as Capital Advance under Other non-current assets.
All identifiable revenue expenses including interest 
incurred in respect of various projects/expansion, net 
of income earned during the project development 
stage prior to its intended use, are considered as 
pre-operative expenses and disclosed under Capital 
Work-in-Progress.
Capital expenditure on Property, plant and equipment 
for research and development is classified under 
property, plant and equipment and is depreciated on 
the same basis as other property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are derecognised 
either on disposal or when the asset retires from 
active use. Losses arising in the case of the retirement 
of property, plant and equipment and gains or losses 
arising from disposal of property, plant and equipment 
are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the 
year of occurrence.
Transition to Ind AS:
The cost of property, plant and equipment as at 1 
April 2016, the Companies date of transition to Ind AS, 
was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), 
as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
Subsequent expenditure:
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Depreciation:
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the 
depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is 
provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives 
as prescribed under Schedule II to the Act or as per 
technical assessment. The residual values, useful lives 
and method of depreciation of PPE is reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
Depreciation on additions/disposals is provided on 
a pro-rata basis i.e. from/up to the date on which is 
asset is ready to use/disposed off. Freehold land is 
not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of Tangible assets are 
as follows
PPE
Useful Life
Buildings*
5 years to 60 years
Plant and Equipment*
3 years to 25 years
Furniture and Fixtures*
10 years
Vehicles
8 years to 10 years
Office Equipments*
3 years to 5 years
* For these class of assets, the useful life of assets is different than 
the prescribed life as per Part C of Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. The different useful life is based on internal technical 
evaluation by the Company and historical usage of assets.
Dies & Punches having useful life of 3 years as per 
technical evaluation and management estimate and 
Solar Plants having useful life of 25 years.
Property, plant and equipment which are added/ 
disposed off during the year, depreciation is provided 
on pro-rata basis.
Building constructed on leasehold land are depreciated 
based on the useful life specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013, where the lease period of the 
land is beyond the life of the building. In other cases, 
building constructed on leasehold land are amortised 
over the primary lease period of the land.
6.2 Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the assets will flow to the Company and the cost of 
the assets can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses, if any. Internally 
generated intangibles, excluding development costs 
as defined in Ind AS, are not capitalised and the related 
expenditure is reflected in Statement of profit and loss 
in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
Trademarks and Software are amortised over their 
estimated useful life on straight-line basis from the 
date they are available for intended use or the period 
of the license as applicable, subject to impairment test.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible assets with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss when the assets 
are derecognised.
Research and Development:
Revenue expenditure on research is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which it 
is incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is carried forward when its future recoverability 
can reasonably be regarded as assured. Any 
expenditure carried forward is amortised over the 
period of expected future sales from the related 
project. The carrying value of development costs is 
reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is 
not yet in use, and otherwise when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
Impairment on non-financial assets:
The Company’s non-financial assets other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, 
then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows (i.e. corporate assets) are 
grouped together into cash-generating units (CGUs). 
Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its 
value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value 
in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, 
discounted to their present value using a discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment loss recognised in respect of a 
CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amounts 
of the assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro 
rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which 
impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, 
the Company reviews at each reporting date whether 
there is any indication that the loss has decreased or 
no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only 
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
The following intangible assets are tested for 
impairment each financial year even if there is no 
indication that the asset is impaired:

ii)	
An intangible asset that is amortised over a period 
exceeding ten years from the date when the asset 
is available for use.
6.3 Non-current Assets Classified as Held For 
Sale
Assets are classified as held for sale and stated at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell if the asset is available for immediate sale and its 
sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets 
are presented separately in the Balance Sheet as 
“Assets Classified as Held for Sale”. Once classified as 
held for sale, intangible assets, investment property 
and property, plant and equipment are no longer 
amortised or depreciated.
6.4 Financial Instruments
Trade receivables and debt securities issued are 
initially recognised when they originate. All other 
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
recognised when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without 
a significant financing component) or financial liability 
is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for 
an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade 
receivable without a significant financing component 
is initially measured at the transaction price.
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial Assets:
Classification:
The Company classifies financial assets as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income or fair value 
through profit or loss, on the basis of its business model 
for managing the financial assets and the contractual 
cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Initial recognition and measurement:
All financial assets excluding trade receivable(not 
measured subsequently at fair value through profit or 
loss) are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction 
costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the 
financial asset.
Subsequent measurement:
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in two broad categories:
	» Financial assets at fair value ( FVTPL / FVTOCI)
	» Financial assets at amortised cost
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and 
losses are either recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), 
or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)).
Financial Assets measured at amortised cost (net of 
write down for impairment, if any):
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost when 
asset is held within a business model, whose objective 
is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash 
flows and contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest. Such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method less impairment, if 
any. The losses arising from impairment are recognised 
in the Statement of profit and loss.
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value, when asset is held within a business model, 
whose objective is to hold assets for both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
Fair value movements are recognised in the other 
comprehensive income.
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value 
with all changes recognised in profit or loss.
Investment in Subsidiary:
Investment in equity instruments of Subsidiaries 
are measured at cost. In the financial statements, 
investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost. The carrying 
amount is reduced to recognise any impairment in the 
value of investment.
Investment in Equity Instruments:
Equity instruments which are held for trading are 
classified as at FVTPL. Fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in 
profit or loss.
Investment in Debt Instruments:
A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost or 
at FVTOCI. Any debt instrument, which does not meet 
the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or 
as FVOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. Debt instruments 
included within the FVTPL category are measured at 
fair value with all changes recognised in the Statement 
of profit and loss.
Derecognition of Financial Assets:
A financial asset is primarily derecognised when the 
rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired 
or the Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset.
Impairment of Financial Assets:
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the financial assets 
that are debt instruments and trade receivables.
Financial Liabilities:
Classification:
The Company classifies all financial liabilities as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
Initial recognition and measurement:
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, 
loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and 
derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement:
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when 
the liabilities are derecognised as well as through EIR 
amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated 
by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part 
of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities:
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Derivative Financial Instrument:
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward currency contracts to mitigate 
its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair 
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair 
value is negative. Any changes therein are generally 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
6.5 Inventories
Raw materials and packing materials are valued at 
lower of cost (on moving weighted average basis) and 
the net realisable value, cost of which includes duties 
and taxes (net off CENVAT and Goods and Service Tax 
wherever applicable). Cost of imported raw materials 
and packing materials lying in bonded warehouse 
includes the amount of customs duty. Finished products 
including traded goods and work-in-progress are 
valued at lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress have 
been computed to include all cost of purchases, cost 
of conversion, appropriate share of fixed production 
overheads based on normal operating capacity and 
other related cost incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs 
of completion and selling expenses necessary to make 
the sale.
Slow and non-moving material, products nearing 
expiry, defective inventory are fully provided for and 
valued at net realisable value.
Goods and materials in transit are valued at actual cost 
incurred up to the date of balance sheet. Materials and 
other items held for use in production of inventories are 
not written down, if the finished products in which they 
will be used are expected to be sold at or above cost.
Consumables and other materials procured for R&D 
purpose are charged off when acquired.
The comparison of cost and Net realisable value is 
made on an item-by-item basis.
6.6 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash on 
hand and cash at bank including fixed deposit/highly 
liquid investments with original maturity period of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, as they are considered 
an integral part of the Company’s cash management.

6.7 Cash Flow Statement
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flow 
from operating, investing and financing activities of the 
Company are segregated.
6.8 Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
the Company’s functional currency at the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured based on historical cost in 
a foreign currency are not translated. Foreign currency 
exchange differences are generally recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of 
monetary items or on translating monetary items 
at rates different from those at which they were 
translated on initial recognition during the period or 
in previous Financial Statements are recognised in the 
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss in the period 
in which they arise. When a gain or loss on a non-
monetary item is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income, any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. 
Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary 
item is recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss, any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is recognised in Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
6.9 Revenue Recognition
Sale of Goods:
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price 
adjusted for discounts and rebates, which is specified 
in a contract with customer. Revenue are net of 
estimated returns and taxes collected from customers.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at point in 
time when control is transferred to the customer and 
it is probable that consideration will be collected. 
Control of goods is transferred upon the shipment of 
the goods to the customer or when goods is made 
available to the customer as per terms agreed.
The transaction price is documented on the sales 
invoice and payment is generally due as per agreed 
credit terms with customer.
The consideration can be fixed or variable. Variable 
consideration is only recognised when it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
Sales return is variable consideration that is recognised 
and recorded based on historical experience, market 
conditions and provided for in the year of sale as 
reduction from revenue. The methodology and 
assumptions used to estimate returns are monitored 
and adjusted regularly in line with trade practices, 
historical trends, past experience and projected 
market conditions.
Interest income: Interest income is recognised with 
reference to the Effective Interest Rate method.
Dividend income: Dividend from investment is 
recognised as revenue when right to receive 
is established.
Income from Export Benefits and Other Incentives:
Export benefits available under prevalent schemes are 
accrued as revenue in the year in which the goods are 
exported and/or services are rendered only when their 
reasonable assurance that the conditions attached 
to them will be complied with, and the amounts will be 
received. Export benefit receivables are carried at net 
realisable value.
6.10 Employee Benefits
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of rendering service are classified as short-term 
employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, 
short-term compensated absences, performance 
incentives etc., and the expected cost of bonus, ex-
gratia are recognised during the period in which the 
employee renders related service.
(i)	
Defined benefit plans
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit 
retirement plan (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering eligible 
employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum 
payment to vested employees at retirement, death, 
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an 
amount based on the respective employee’s salary 
and the tenure of employment with the Company.
Liabilities with regard to Gratuity Plan are determined 
by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent 
actuary, at each balance sheet date using the 
Projected Unit Credit Method.
The Company fully contributes all ascertained liabilities 
to the Ajanta Pharma Limited Group Gratuity Trust (the 
Trust). Trustees administer contributions made to the 
Trust and contributions are invested in a scheme with 
Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by 
laws of India.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of 
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation 
is limited to the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The 
Company recognises the net obligation of a defined 
benefit plan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the 
other comprehensive income for the period in which 
they occur. The effect of any plan amendments are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(ii)	
Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised as expense when employees have 
rendered services entitling them to such benefits.
The Company pays provident fund contributions 
to publicly administered provident funds as per 
local regulations. The Company has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are accounted for as 
defined contribution plans and the contributions are 
recognised as employee benefit expense when they 
are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an 
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction 
in the future payments is available.
(iii)	 Compensated absences
The Company has a policy on compensated absences 
which are both accumulating and non-accumulating 
in nature. The expected cost of accumulating 
compensated absences is determined by actuarial 
valuation performed by an independent actuary at 
each balance sheet date using projected unit credit 
method on the additional amount expected to be 
paid/availed within twelve months as a result of the 
unused entitlement that has accumulated at the 
balance sheet date.
Compensated absences which are not expected to 
occur within twelve months after the end of the period 
in which the employee renders the related services are 
recognised as a liability at the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognised in the period in which the 
absences occur.
(iv)	 Share-based compensation
Employees Stock Options Plans (“ESOPs”): The grant 
date fair value of options granted to employees 
is recognised as an employee expense, over the 
period that the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. The expense is recorded for 
each separately vesting portion of the award as if 
the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The 
increase in equity recognised in connection with 
Share-based payment transaction is presented as 
a separate component in equity under “Employee 
Stock Options Outstanding Reserve”. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of stock options that vest. The options 
granted to employees of subsidiary is recognised as 
an equity investment.
The Company recognises compensation expense 
relating to share-based payments in net profit using 
fair-value in accordance with Ind AS 102, Share-
Based Payment.
6.11 Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed 
in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs 
consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing 
cost also includes exchange differences to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
6.12 Leases
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land and buildings. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of 
a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves 
the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from use of 
the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the 
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) 
and low value leases. For these short-term and low 
value leases, the Company recognises the lease 
payments as an operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
prior to the commencement date of the lease plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.

OVERVIEW
STATUTORY 
REPORTS
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
NOTICE
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) 
is determined on an individual asset basis unless the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortised 
cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
generally accepted interest rate. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Company changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing cash flows.
Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified 
as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of 
the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified 
as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
In respect of assets given on operating lease, lease 
rentals are accounted in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss, on accrual basis in accordance with the 
respective lease agreements.
6.13  Government Grants
Government grants are initially recognised as deferred 
income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and the Company will comply 
with the conditions associated with the grant;
	» In case of capital grants, they are then recognised 
in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss as other 
income on a systematic basis over the useful life of 
the asset.
	» In case of grants that compensate the Company 
for expenses incurred are recognised in Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis 
in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.
6.14 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders 
of the Company by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted 
earnings per equity share is computed by dividing 
the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of equity 
shares considered for deriving basic earnings per 
equity share and also the weighted average number 
of equity shares that could have been issued upon 
conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The 
dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the 
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been 
actually issued at fair value. Dilutive potential equity 
shares are deemed converted as of the beginning 
of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive 
potential equity shares are determined independently 
for each period presented.
6.15 Income Taxes
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred 
income tax.
Current tax is recognised in statement of profit or loss, 
except when they relate to items that are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
in which case, the current tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively. Current income tax for current and prior 
periods is recognised at the amount expected to be 
paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted by the 
balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply to taxable income in the years 
in which those temporary differences are expected to 
be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax 
rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is 
recognised as income or expense in the period that 
includes the enactment or the substantive enactment 
date. A deferred income tax asset is recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. 
The Company offsets current tax assets and current 
tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right 
to set off the recognised amounts and where it intends 
either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
6.16 Dividends to Shareholders
Annual dividend distribution to the shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the shareholders. Any 
interim dividend paid is recognised on approval by 
Board of Directors. Dividend payable is recognised 
directly in equity.
6.17 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, 
Contingent Assets and Commitments
General:
Provisions (legal and constructive) are recognised 
when the Company has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made.
Provisions (excluding retirement benefits and 
compensated absences) are not discounted to its 
present value and are determined based on best 
estimate required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current 
best estimates.
If there is any expectation that some or all of the 
provision will be reimbursed, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating 
to a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any virtually certain reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risk specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 
a finance cost.
Contingent liability is disclosed in the case of:
	» A present obligation arising from past events, when 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation;
	» A present obligation arising from past events, when 
no reliable estimates is possible;
	» A possible obligation arising from past events, unless 
the probability of outflow of resources is remote.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed 
in the standalone financial statements. Contingent 
assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the 
financial statements.
Commitments include the amount of purchase order 
(net of advances) issued to parties for completion of 
assets and Non-cancellable operating lease.
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets 
and commitments are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date.
6.18 Fair value measurement
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date in 
accordance with Ind AS 113.
Financials Statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for the following material 
items in the statement of financial position:
	» Derivative financial instruments (mainly forward 
currency contracts) are measured at fair value 
received from Bank.
	» Mutual Funds are measured at fair values as per Net 
Asset Value (NAV).
	» Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) at fair values as 
per Black Scholes option pricing model.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or settle a liability in an ordinary transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:

active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	» Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
	» Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy 
as explained above.

Sensitivity Analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other 
assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation as shown below:

Although the analysis does not take into account full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does 
provide an approximation of sensitivity of assumptions. The estimate of future increase in compensation levels, 
considered in the actuarial valuation, have been taken on account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other 
relevant factors such as supply and demand in the employment market.
46.3 Leave Encashment
The Company’s employees are entitled for compensated absences which are allowed to be accumulated and 
encashed as per the Company’s policies. The liability of compensated absences, which is non-funded, has been 
provided based on report of independent actuary using “Projected Unit Credit Method”.
Accordingly, H 41.39 Crore (Previous Year H 33.07 Crore) being liability as at the year-end for compensated absences 
as per actuarial valuation has been provided in the accounts.
47.	 Share-Based Payments

2019” as approved in earlier year by the shareholders of the Company and Compensation committee of Board of 
Directors for key Employees of the Group. The options issued under the above scheme vest in a phased manner.

Valuation of stock options
The fair value of stock options granted during the period has been measured using the Black–Scholes option pricing 
model at the date of the grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend 
yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. They key inputs and assumptions used are 
as follows:
Share price: The closing price on NSE as on the date of grant has been considered for valuing the options granted.
Exercise Price: Exercise Price is the market price or face value or such other price as determined by the Remuneration 
and Compensation Committee.
Expected Volatility: The historical volatility of the stock till the date of grant has been considered to calculate the 
fair value of the options.
Expected Option Life: Expected Life of option is the period for which the Company expects the options to be live. 
The minimum life of a stock option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised and the 
maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised.
Expected dividends: Expected dividend yield has been calculated as an average of dividend yields for four years 
preceding the date of the grant.
Risk free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate on the date of grant considered for the calculation is the interest 
rate applicable for a maturity equal to the expected life of the options based on the zero-coupon yield curve for 
Government Securities.
These assumptions reflect management’s best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties 
based on market conditions generally outside of the Company’s control. As a result, if other assumptions had been 
used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if 
management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially 
impacted in future years. The Company has granted stock options to employees of a subsidiary, the estimated fair 
value of stock options issued are included in the carrying value of the investment in the said subsidiary on a straight-

Fair value hierarchy	
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments 
that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are 
disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining 
fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting 
standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.

Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes mutual funds 
that have declared buyback NAV. The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (like mutual funds, Mark to 
market derivatives and Non-convertible market link debenture) is determined using valuation techniques which 
maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant 
inputs required to fair value as instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included 
in level 3. 
Measurement of fair values
Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs:
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 & Level 3 fair values, for financial 
instruments measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, as well as the significant unobservable

a)	
Trade receivables 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and 
control relating to customer credit risk management. Trade receivables, which are non-interest bearing, are mainly 
from stockists, distributors and customers and are generally on 14 days to 270 days credit term excluding wholly-
owned subsidiaries. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company has no concentration 
of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.
As at 31 March 2025, Company had 34 customers (31 March 2024, 32 customers), excluding wholly-owned subsidiaries 
that owed the Company more than H 0.50 Crore each and accounted for approximately 27% and 27% respectively 
of the total outstanding as at 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024.
Expected credit loss assessment
As per simplified approach, the Company makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivable using a 
provision matrix to mitigate the risk of default payment and make appropriate provision at each reporting date 
wherever required. The trend of the bad debts is negligible.

There are no unbilled receivables, hence the same is not disclosed in the ageing schedule.
There are no other trade receivables which have significant increase in credit risk.
The loss allowance on trade receivable has been computed on the basis of Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments which 
require such allowance to be made even for trade receivable considered good on the basis that credit risk exists 
even though it may be very low.
(b)	 Financial instruments
Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in liquid securities issued by mutual funds having a credit 
ranking of at least 3 and above from CRISIL or equivalent rating agency. Company monitors changes in credit risk 
by tracking published external credit ranking. Based on its on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Company 
adjusts its exposure to various counterparties.
ii.	
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral 
obligations without incurring unacceptable losses. The Company’s objective is to, at all times maintain optimum 
levels of liquidity to meet its cash and collateral requirements. The Company closely monitors its liquidity position and 
deploys a robust cash management system. It maintains adequate sources of financing including bilateral loans, 
debt, and overdraft from banks at an optimised cost. Working capital requirements are adequately addressed by 
internally generated funds. Trade receivables are kept within manageable levels.
Company aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments 
at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities over the next six months. The ratio of cash 
and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments to outflows is 0.69 at 31 March 2025 (0.62 at 
31 March 2024).

iii. 	 Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity 
prices – will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments, and 
derivative financial instruments.
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange 
contracts to manage its exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations. All such transactions are carried out within the 
guidelines set by the risk management committee.
Sensitivity Analysis on Interest rate
The Company’s fixed rate bank deposits and securities are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject 
to interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flow will fluctuate 
because of a change in market interest rates.
Sensitivity Analysis on Equity prices
The Company has invested its surplus funds primarily in debt based mutual funds. The value of investment in these 
mutual fund schemes is reflected though Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset Management Company 
on daily basis. The Company has not performed a sensitivity analysis on these mutual funds based on estimated 
fluctuations in their NAV as in management’s opinion, such analysis would not display a correct picture.
iv.	
Currency risk
Company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, 
purchases and borrowings are denominated and the functional currency of Company. The currencies in which these 
transactions are primarily denominated are US dollars, Australian dollars, Great Britain Pound and Euro.
At any point in time, Company covers foreign currency risk by taking appropriate percentage of its foreign currency 
exposure, as approved by risk management committee in line with the laid down policy approved by the Board. 
Company uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one 
year from the reporting date. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, 
the Company’s policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign 
currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.

50.	Disaggregation of Revenue
The operations of the Company are limited to only one segment viz. pharmaceuticals and related products. Revenue 
from contract with customers is from sale of manufactured goods and traded goods. Sale of goods are made
