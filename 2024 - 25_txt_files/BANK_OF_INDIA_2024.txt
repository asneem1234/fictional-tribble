Regulator
y & Legal 
Complianc
es 
Risk 
Non-compliance with 
applicable laws and 
regulatory 
requirements 
poses 
significant risks to the 
Bank, 
including 
potential 
legal 
penalties, 
financial 
losses, 
and 
reputational damage. 
Conversely, a strong 
compliance 
culture 
enhances operational 
performance 
and 
process 
efficiency, 
while also fostering 
transparency 
and 
accountability. 
By 
prioritizing regulatory 
adherence, the Bank 
provides assurance to 
stakeholders 
and 
gains 
greater 
confidence 
among 
investors 
regarding 
the 
integrity 
and 
robustness 
of 
its 
operations. 
The Bank has established an 
independent 
Compliance 
Department, headed by a 
senior officer of the rank of 
Chief General Manager, who 
also serves as the Chief 
Compliance Officer (CCO) for 
regulatory 
purposes. 
The 
primary responsibility of the 
department is to ensure 
adherence to all statutory, 
regulatory, 
and 
internal 
guidelines 
across 
both 
domestic and international 
operations. It acts as the 
single point of contact for the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
and facilitates the smooth 
execution 
of 
Risk-Based 
Supervision (RBS) under the 
SPARC framework. The Bank 
operates under a Board-
approved 
Compliance 
Function Policy, formulated 
in 
accordance 
with 
RBI 
guidelines. This policy is 
reviewed 
and 
updated 
annually to ensure continued 
regulatory 
alignment 
and 
operational integrity. 
Negative Implication: 
Non-compliance 
with 
regulatory requirements 
can result in significant 
reputational 
damage, 
adversely 
impacting 
business operations and 
stakeholder confidence. 
In contrast, adherence 
to applicable laws and 
regulations enables the 
Bank to manage risks 
more effectively while 
fostering a culture of 
fairness, transparency, 
and employee loyalty.

(ICAAP). In response to evolving regulatory expectations and the broader sustainability 
agenda, the Bank’s Board has adopted a comprehensive ESG. This policy establishes a

disclosures and practices.

evaluated for strategic competencies. Integrated digital tools across key HR 
functions ensure robust governance and EASE compliance, empowering a resilient, 
growth-ready workforce.

Details of improvements in 
environmental and social impacts 
R & 
D 
As a financial services institution, the Bank’s R&D outlay and capital expenditure have been primarily 
focused on investments in Information Technology systems. These efforts aim at process enhancement, 
with a strong emphasis on product digitization. Over the year, the Bank undertook several digital 
initiatives aimed at improving customer experience by increasing transparency and accessibility across 
its offerings. This shift towards digitization has also supported the Bank’s sustainability goals by reducing 
reliance on paper-based processes and lowering its carbon footprint. 
 
Capital investments have been directed towards strengthening the Bank’s digital infrastructure, 
including the expansion of Internet and Mobile banking platforms, enhancement of ATM channels, 
procurement of software licenses, development of IT applications, and the upgrade of security systems 
and network infrastructure, including data centres.  
Cape

a.  
Does the entity have 
procedures in place 
for 
sustainable 
sourcing? (Yes/No) 
As a service-oriented institution, the Bank’s operations are associated with 
relatively low resource consumption. Nevertheless, it remains committed to 
promoting sustainable procurement practices while supporting local economies. 
The Bank actively strives to source sustainable products from local suppliers at 
fair prices. Key initiatives in this regard include prioritizing the use of energy-
efficient equipment—such as star-rated air-conditioners, laptops, computers, 
and lighting devices—across all branches and offices. Additionally, branches and 
offices are encouraged to procure items like stationery from local suppliers based 
on operational requirements, promoting local sourcing and minimizing 
environmental impact. 
b. 
If 
yes, 
what 
percentage 
of 
inputs were sourced 
sustainably? 
As a financial services institution, the Bank's operations are not heavily 
dependent on material resources. However, in line with its commitment to 
responsible corporate citizenship, the Bank places strong emphasis on optimizing 
resource efficiency, minimizing waste generation, and improving overall process 
productivity. While increased digitization of products and services has led to a 
reduction in paper usage, paper continues to remain a key resource in day-to-day 
operations. To address this, the Bank has strengthened its efforts to reduce paper 
consumption through expanded recycling initiatives, procurement of paper from 
sustainable sources, and the rationalization of internal printing practices.

Recovery Unit. The disposal of the Bank's surplus or obsolete IT assets and 
resources, such as desktop computers, servers, and storage devices, is strictly 
governed by legal and environmental compliance. These assets are disposed of
