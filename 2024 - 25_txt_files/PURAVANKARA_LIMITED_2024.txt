1
Climate 
Protection, 
Energy and 
Emissions
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk:
Regulatory Risk: Increasing 
environmental regulations (e.g., EC, IGBC 
norms, energy codes) may lead to penalties 
or project delays if not complied with.
Operational Risk: Rising energy costs 
and supply chain disruptions (e.g., access 
to sustainable materials) can affect 
profitability.
Physical Risk: Climate-related events 
such as extreme heat, floods, or storms 
can impact project timelines, asset 
durability, and site viability.
Reputational Risk: Inadequate climate 
action may result in negative stakeholder 
perception, particularly from investors, 
customers, and regulators.
Opportunity:
Cost Savings: Improved energy efficiency 
and renewable energy adoption can reduce 
operational expenses in the long term.
Market Advantage: Green-certified and 
energy-efficient buildings are increasingly 
preferred by both buyers and tenants.
Investor Interest: Strong ESG 
performance attracts environmentally 
conscious investors and aligns with 
sustainable finance frameworks.
Future-readiness: Proactive climate 
strategies ensure long-term resilience and 
alignment with global sustainability goals 
(e.g., SDGs, India’s net-zero targets).
Our approach to 
mitigating climate-
related risks includes:
Transitioning to 
renewable energy 
sources across 
operations wherever 
feasible.
Pursuing green building 
certifications such as 
IGBC/LEED for new 
developments.
Improving energy 
efficiency through design 
innovations, smart 
systems, and sustainable 
construction materials.
Monitoring and reporting 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
and progressively 
engaging with Scope 3 
categories.
Incorporating climate risk 
into project planning and 
site selection, especially 
for flood-prone or high-
heat zones.
Engaging in awareness 
and training programs for 
teams and contractors on 
sustainable construction 
practices.
These measures not only 
reduce our environmental 
footprint but also ensure 
regulatory preparedness, 
cost efficiency, and 
reputational benefits.

Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk:
Reputational Risk: Inadequate customer 
experience or communication gaps can 
lead to negative reviews, loss of brand 
trust, and reduced referrals.
Regulatory Risk: Non-compliance 
with regulations like RERA can result in 
penalties and legal challenges.
Operational Risk: Delays in handovers or 
poor after-sales support may increase 
complaints and lead to financial liabilities 
or compensation claims.
Opportunity:
Brand Differentiation: High customer 
satisfaction can be a strategic 
differentiator in a competitive real estate 
market.
Customer Retention & Referrals: 
Satisfied customers are more likely to 
invest in future projects and recommend 
the brand.
Data-Driven Improvement: Customer 
feedback helps improve product design, 
service delivery, and operational 
processes.
Robust feedback 
mechanisms to capture 
and act on customer 
insights.
Transparent 
communication through 
digital and in-person 
channels.
Dedicated CRM teams to 
handle service quality, 
grievance redressal, and 
post-handover care.
Use of technology to 
automate updates, 
document sharing, and 
service requests.
Continuous training for 
frontline staff to align 
with customer-centric 
values.

Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk:
Operational Risk: Construction activities 
carry a high risk of workplace injuries or 
fatalities if safety protocols are not strictly 
implemented.
Regulatory Risk: Non-compliance 
with health and safety laws can lead to 
penalties, legal action, or work stoppages.
Reputational Risk: Accidents or unsafe 
work conditions can damage stakeholder 
trust, particularly among buyers, investors, 
and local communities.
Productivity Risk: Unsafe working 
environments can lead to lower morale, 
higher absenteeism, and reduced 
workforce efficiency.
Opportunity:
Brand Trust: Demonstrating a strong 
commitment to worker and occupant 
safety enhances the company’s brand and 
credibility.
Operational Efficiency: Safe sites operate 
more smoothly with fewer disruptions, 
leading to timely project delivery.
Employee Loyalty: A culture of safety 
improves employee satisfaction, retention, 
and overall workplace morale.
Attracting Responsible Capital: A strong 
health and safety track record aligns with 
ESG mandates of institutional investors 
and lenders.

Safety, and Environment 
(HSE) policy across all 
project sites.
Regular safety audits, 
risk assessments, and 
compliance checks at 
construction sites.

metrics like near-misses, 
lost-time injury frequency 
rate (LTIFR), and

Data Privacy 
and Safety
Risk
Risk:
Cybersecurity Risk: With increased 
digital transactions and online customer 
interactions, any breach of sensitive 
data can lead to financial losses, legal 
consequences, and reputational damage.
Regulatory Risk: Non-compliance with 
data protection laws (such as the Digital 
Personal Data Protection Act, 2023) may 
result in fines and sanctions.
Trust Deficit: Any mishandling or leakage 
of customer, employee, or partner data 
can erode stakeholder trust and affect 
long-term business relationships.
Operational Disruption: Cyberattacks 
or system failures can halt operations, 
compromise systems, and result in 
significant downtime.
Opportunity:
Brand Credibility: Strong data protection 
practices build customer trust and 
enhance brand reputation in a digitally 
driven market.
Operational Confidence: A secure IT 
infrastructure reduces risk and improves 
business continuity and resilience.
Investor Confidence: Demonstrating 
responsible digital governance aligns 
with ESG expectations of investors and

well for future legal and technological

Ethical & Governance Risk: Unchecked or 
opaque use of AI could lead to unintended 
bias, discrimination, or decisions lacking 
transparency, affecting stakeholder trust.
Data Dependency Risk: AI systems rely 
heavily on data quality — poor or biased 
data can lead to flawed outcomes and 
reputational damage.
Cybersecurity Risk: AI systems, if not 
secured, may increase the surface area for 
cyberattacks or manipulation.
Job Displacement Concerns: Increased 
automation could raise concerns among 
employees and unions regarding workforce 
displacement, impacting morale and 
organisational culture.
Regulatory Risk: Emerging AI regulations 
may impose new compliance burdens or 
liabilities.
Opportunity:
Operational Efficiency: AI-driven 
automation can improve decision-making, 
reduce human error, and streamline 
internal processes (e.g., construction 
timelines, cost management, customer 
engagement).
Customer Experience: AI can enhance 
personalization in marketing, CRM, and 
post-sales service.
Predictive Insights: Machine learning 
models can help forecast project risks, 
energy usage, and market trends.

or peri-urban areas, can lead to 
deforestation, loss of native vegetation, 
and disruption of local ecosystems.
Regulatory Risk: Non-compliance with 
environmental clearances (e.g., EC, tree 
compensation norms, CRZ guidelines) can 
cause delays, fines, or legal action.
Community Backlash: Projects that 
negatively impact local biodiversity may 
face resistance from communities and 
environmental groups, affecting social 
license to operate.
Climate Vulnerability: Poor land use 
planning can increase the risk of heat 
islands, flooding, and soil erosion, which 
may affect the long-term viability and

P2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
As a responsible real estate developer, the company is committed to delivering projects that are both environmentally sustainable 
and safe for occupants and communities. This commitment is reflected across the lifecycle of our developments—from responsible 
sourcing of construction materials and incorporation of green building practices to efficient waste management and adoption of 
eco-friendly design principles.
The company ensures that all residential and commercial spaces are developed in accordance with applicable safety standards, 
structural norms, and quality benchmarks to protect the health and well-being of end-users. By prioritizing sustainability and 
safety in project planning, construction, and post-occupancy phases, the company not only meets its regulatory and ethical 
obligations but also contributes to resilient urban development and the preservation of natural resources for future generations.

FY 2023-24 (Previous Financial

Details of improvements in 
environmental and social impacts
R&D
In the real estate sector, most of the R&D and capital expenditure is embedded within ongoing project 
development activities, such as planning, design, construction, and infrastructure upgrades. These costs 
are typically integrated into broader project budgets, making it operationally challenging to isolate specific 
investments made purely for environmental or social impact improvements.
However, the company is increasingly embedding sustainability considerations—such as energy-efficient 
designs, use of eco-friendly materials, water conservation systems, and community-centric planning—within its 
project lifecycle. While these initiatives do contribute to environmental and social improvements, the associated 
expenditures are not currently tracked as standalone R&D or capex line items.
The company is working towards building internal mechanisms to track and report such investments more 
accurately in the forthcoming years, as part of our broader ESG and sustainability reporting framework.
Capex
Question E2
Sustainable Sourcing 
a.	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? Yes / No 
	
Yes. The entity has established procedures for sustainable sourcing aimed at minimizing its environmental footprint and 
supporting the local economy. Priority is given to locally available materials to reduce embodied energy, with a focus on 
resource-efficient manpower based on productivity metrics. The company uses a range of sustainable materials in its projects, 
including Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC) with Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), cPVC pipes, factory-engineered doors, 
and tiles from ISO 14001-certified manufacturers. Cement and steel are primarily sourced within a 400 km radius to further 
promote local procurement. In FY 2023–24, 75% of supplier spending was directed towards local suppliers. The increase in 
supplier expenditure is attributed to the direct purchase of high-value assets such as generators and transformers. These

efforts not only ensure a reliable supply chain but also foster stronger ties with the community and contribute to regional 
economic growth.
b.	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 	
In FY 2024–25, approximately 75% of inputs were sourced locally, aligning with the company's sustainable sourcing practices. 
While a specific percentage for sustainably sourced inputs (as per defined sustainability certifications or standards) is not 
separately disclosed, a significant portion of materials—such as RMC with GGBS, ISO 14001-certified tiles, and engineered 
products—adhere to sustainable sourcing principles. 
Question E3
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for
a.	 Plastics (including packaging)
 	
As a company specializing in the construction and development of residential homes with an expected lifecycle exceeding 
50 years, traditional practices such as reusing and recycling construction materials are limited in applicability. However, we 
actively focus on minimizing plastic waste by reducing rework and material wastage during the construction process. All 
plastic and other waste generated are responsibly managed and disposed of through authorized vendors, ensuring compliance 
with environmental regulations and promoting sustainable waste management practices. 
b.	 E-waste
 	
We have introduced an extended-life warranty for IT assets and accessories, extending coverage by an additional year. This 
initiative helps reduce e-waste generation by enabling a three-year delay in asset replacement, subject to annual renewal. 
It also contributes to lowering operating costs. Warranty extension details are transparently available on our website. We 
securely store e-waste in a controlled inventory accessible only to authorized personnel. Disposal of e-waste is conducted 
through recyclers authorized by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), with certificates of disposal collected 
for verification. These measures ensure compliance with E-Waste Management Rules while safeguarding health and the 
environment. 
c.	 Hazardous waste
	
We actively work to reduce the generation of hazardous waste by implementing preventive measures such as the use of 
collection trays to contain potential spills and avoid contamination. These measures help minimize environmental risks and 
enhance workplace safety. Furthermore, all hazardous waste is managed through timely and responsible disposal processes, 
carried out exclusively by authorized vendors who comply with regulatory standards. This approach ensures safe handling, 
transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials, aligning with environmental protection guidelines and legal requirements.
d.    Other waste
 	
All waste generated across our operations is systematically collected and carefully segregated at the source to ensure proper 
handling and facilitate efficient recycling or disposal. The segregated waste is securely stored in designated areas following 
strict safety and environmental protocols. Disposal is conducted in full compliance with regulatory requirements, with waste 
being sent only to landfill sites that have been officially approved by the relevant state authorities. This controlled process 
helps minimize environmental impact, ensures adherence to legal standards, and supports our commitment to responsible 
waste management practices. 
	
Our waste management process entails careful collection, segregation, and storage of waste in designated areas until it 
is appropriately disposed of. Disposal is carried out exclusively through authorized vendors, ensuring full compliance with 
regulatory requirements and environmental responsibility. To further reduce our overall waste footprint, we have introduced 
several initiatives at our Headquarters, including the implementation of a paperless policy, which has significantly decreased 
paper consumption. These measures reflect our dedication to sustainable practices, environmental stewardship, and the 
ongoing pursuit of waste reduction across our organizational operations.

P3: Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their value chains
Upholding and advancing the welfare of all employees, including those within their value chains, is a fundamental obligation for 
businesses. Placing emphasis on equitable and secure working environments, offering competitive salaries, and guaranteeing 
equal chances for professional advancement enhance employee contentment and efficiency. Furthermore, attending to the 
requirements of workers across the value chain, such as suppliers and subcontractors, nurtures ethical and sustainable business 
conduct. By prioritizing employee well-being, businesses cultivate a favorable workplace atmosphere, bolster their reputation, 
and foster social and economic progress.

Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the 
coverage such system? 
Yes. Puravankara has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management system aligned with

includes risk mapping, emergency preparedness, regular audits, training, and integration of OHS criteria in procurement contracts 
to ensure a safe and secure work environment across operations.

e.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity?
	
To identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and non-routine bases, Puravankara follows a structured 
and proactive approach. Hazards are initially identified through Method Statements on an activity-wise basis, followed by 
detailed risk analyses. For non-routine assessments, regular site inspections and walkthroughs are conducted, with findings 
documented in Observation Reports and recorded in a Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) register, which is 
regularly updated.
	
Risk management is integrated from the planning stage itself, and risk levels are categorized as High, Medium, or Low, with 
immediate controls applied where needed to bring risks to ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable). The company employs 
the Hierarchy of Controls—Elimination, Substitution, Engineering Controls, Administrative Controls, and PPE—to mitigate 
risks. Qualified safety professionals oversee implementation, and behavioral-based safety training and grievance protection 
mechanisms are in place to ensure a safe and responsive work environment.
f.	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
(Y/N)
	
Yes, Puravankara has robust processes in place for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
potentially unsafe situations without fear of reprisal. Workers are encouraged to promptly report any safety concerns through 
established reporting mechanisms such as site safety officers, observation reports, and safety review meetings.
	
We maintain an open-door policy and provide anonymous reporting channels where necessary, ensuring all concerns are taken 
seriously and addressed swiftly. In situations where workers perceive immediate danger, they are empowered to stop work and 
remove themselves from the risk zone until appropriate controls are implemented. This approach reflects our commitment to 
creating a safe, transparent, and responsive work environment.
g.	 Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No) 
	
Yes, the organization ensures that all employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services. Each worker is provided with an individual ID card that includes insurance details and EPFO enrollment information, 
enabling seamless access to healthcare facilities.
	
Puravankara has tie-ups with hospitals near work sites where workers can undergo quarterly health check-ups. These check-
ups are designed to proactively identify and address a range of health concerns, including TB, HIV/AIDS, mental health issues, 
and substance abuse. In cases where health issues are detected, follow-up action is taken through on-site medical camps and 
proper documentation.
	
Workers can avail healthcare services at partner hospitals by presenting their ID card along with a recommendation letter 
from HR. This system ensures timely, affordable, and convenient medical support beyond occupational needs. Additionally, key 
OHS-related statistics and health outcomes are reviewed during Board meetings to refine and enhance the company’s overall 
health and safety strategy.

Question E12
Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
To ensure a safe and healthy workplace, the organization has implemented comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
measures that are rigorously enforced across all project sites and offices. These measures include:
1. Mandatory Use of PPE:
	
All employees and workers are required to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets, gloves, safety boots, 
reflective vests, and goggles—especially while performing high-risk tasks like welding and working at height.
2. Safety Signages and Hazard Isolation:
	
Clear and visible safety signage—including prohibition signs, warning indicators, and fire safety instructions—are installed 
throughout construction sites. Hazardous areas, such as high-voltage zones, are cordoned off with barriers and fences to 
prevent unauthorized access.
3. Housekeeping and Site Cleanliness:
	
Daily site maintenance is carried out to eliminate hazards like loose nails, dust, and stagnant water in excavation and backfilling 
areas. This significantly reduces the risk of slips, trips, and other site-related injuries.
4. Regular OHS Training Programs:
	
Comprehensive safety training is conducted for all employees and workers. Topics include general safety awareness, material 
handling, housekeeping, scaffolding safety, height work protocols (including edge protection), electrical and fire safety, 
proper use of power tools, and health and hygiene in labour camps. These sessions ensure that workers are equipped with the 
knowledge and skills necessary to maintain a safe working environment.
	
These proactive safety measures form a core part of the company’s sustainability framework, demonstrating a deep 
commitment to protecting the physical and mental well-being of every individual on site.

Question E15
Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks 
/ concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
Safety-related incidents are treated with utmost seriousness and are systematically evaluated, investigated, and addressed 
through a structured incident management framework. Upon the occurrence of any safety event—whether an accident, near miss, 
or unsafe condition—the following steps are taken to ensure resolution and prevention of recurrence:
1.	 Thorough Incident Investigation and Root Cause Analysis:
	
Each safety incident is carefully investigated to identify its root causes and contributing factors. This includes collecting 
witness statements, examining the scene, reviewing relevant procedures, and assessing equipment involved. Findings are 
documented and reviewed by the safety team and senior management.
2. 	 Implementation of Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA):
	
Based on the investigation outcomes, targeted corrective and preventive actions are established to address the identified 
gaps. These actions are tracked for effectiveness and reviewed periodically.
	
Key measures implemented include:
	 Refresher Training on Safety Competency and Behavior-Based Safety (BBS):
	
Employees and workers undergo refresher training sessions that reinforce safety protocols and behavior-based safety 
approaches. These programs focus on enhancing situational awareness, promoting a culture of safety ownership, and 
encouraging proactive reporting of hazards.
	 Strict Enforcement of Height Safety Protocols:
	
Full body harnesses with 100% tie-off at secure anchorage points are mandated for all personnel working at height. 
Supervisors ensure compliance through regular monitoring, and violators are subject to disciplinary action.
	 Engineering Controls to Prevent Unauthorized Equipment Use:
	
Physical controls have been implemented—such as lock-out/tag-out mechanisms, control panel locks, and tool tracking 
systems—to restrict access to hazardous equipment and tools only to trained and authorized personnel.
Together, these measures aim not just to resolve the immediate incident but to institutionalize learning, prevent recurrence, and 
cultivate a resilient safety culture that protects every worker on site.

Question E5
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
Yes / No / NA
Yes. The company integrates sustainable water management practices into its project designs to ensure resource efficiency and 
environmental responsibility. A key focus is the implementation of advanced recycling systems within all developments. Each 
project is equipped with a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) that enables the treatment and recycling of wastewater generated from 
washrooms, toilets, and kitchens.
The treated water, once brought to acceptable quality standards, is reused for non-potable applications such as flushing toilets 
and irrigating landscaped areas. This not only minimizes the dependency on fresh water but also reduces the environmental 
impact of wastewater discharge. In many of our projects, up to 90% of the water used is recycled, significantly reducing water 
consumption and promoting circular water use.
Further, water-efficient low-flow fixtures are installed throughout the properties to reduce overall water usage. In line with our 
commitment to groundwater conservation, we design our projects with reduced basement footprints and maximize landscaped 
areas on natural ground. These green zones support groundwater recharge and enhance natural percolation, thereby improving 
the site's hydrological sustainability.
These measures are a part of the company’s broader strategy to develop environmentally responsible buildings that align with 
sustainable development goals, preserve natural resources, and create long-term ecological value.

Question E8
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. Yes / No / NA
Yes. The company is actively engaged in implementing project-level initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
through a combination of hard and soft measures that are integrated into project planning and execution.
On the energy front, we promote the use of renewable energy by installing solar photovoltaic (PV) rooftop systems for powering 
common area lighting across our developments. Additionally, we prioritize energy efficiency by using BIS-certified star-rated 
equipment for HVAC systems, clubhouse amenities, and lighting in shared spaces. These interventions collectively contribute to 
reducing electricity consumption from non-renewable sources and help lower overall emissions.
At both our corporate headquarters and project sites, diesel generator (DG) sets are used for backup power. Recognizing their 
potential impact on air quality, we mitigate emissions by ensuring:
	 DG sets are installed in enclosed, designated zones with appropriate chimney stacks, as per guidelines prescribed by the 
Pollution Control Board.
	 The fuel used is ultra-low sulfur diesel, which significantly reduces particulate emissions and sulphur dioxide levels.
Through these initiatives, the company demonstrates a clear commitment to minimizing its carbon footprint while ensuring 
regulatory compliance and advancing its sustainability objectives.

Question E10
Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
At Puravankara, we recognize that the construction sector, by its very nature, is resource-intensive and generates considerable 
volumes of waste with potential environmental, health, and economic impacts. As part of our sustainability commitment, we have 
adopted a proactive and structured waste management strategy aimed at achieving "zero waste to landfill."
Waste Management Practices
Our approach is guided by the principles of reduction, segregation, recycling, and responsible disposal, with the following key 
measures in place:
	 Segregation at Source: Waste at project sites and the corporate headquarters is meticulously segregated into hazardous and 
non-hazardous categories.
	 Non-Hazardous Waste: Includes materials such as plastic, paper, wood, scrap steel, food waste, and construction and 
demolition (C&D) waste.
	
In FY 2023-24, non-hazardous waste generation totaled 1,336.68 tonnes. While there was a decrease in plastic, paper, 
and wood waste compared to FY 2022-23, we observed an increase in scrap steel, food waste, and C&D waste, attributed 
to the growing number of active projects.
	 Hazardous Waste: Includes used oil, filters, paint waste, and contaminated cotton waste.
	
Hazardous waste rose from 0.05 tonne in FY 2022-23 to 0.51 tonne in FY 2023-24, with a notable 28% reduction in used 
oil filters, reflecting improved handling and disposal practices.

norms, reducing the risk of spills and exposure.

P9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
The company is committed to engaging with consumers in a transparent, ethical, and value-driven manner. In the real estate 
sector, where long-term trust and satisfaction are critical, the company prioritizes clear communication, timely project delivery, 
and adherence to quality and regulatory standards.
By proactively understanding customer needs, preferences, and feedback, the company strives to design and deliver projects 
that enhance quality of life—through thoughtful planning, sustainability features, and customer-centric amenities. Responsible 
marketing, fair pricing, and strong after-sales support further strengthen consumer trust and loyalty.
Through this approach, the company builds lasting relationships, enhances brand credibility, and contributes to inclusive urban 
growth and customer well-being.
Question E1
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
The company has implemented an integrated, technology-driven mechanism for managing consumer complaints and feedback 
through Salesforce (SFDC), ensuring transparency, traceability, and timely resolution.
All customer communications sent to crm@puravankara.com are automatically captured in SFDC, where a case is created and 
assigned to a designated Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The SPOC is responsible for reviewing the concern, coordinating with 
relevant teams, and responding to the customer.
In cases where interdepartmental coordination is required, the case is seamlessly reassigned within SFDC to the appropriate 
internal team. The system tracks all updates, communications, and actions in real time to ensure closure within defined Turnaround 
Times (TATs). Accountability is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the complaint.
In addition to reactive complaint management, the company also proactively gathers customer feedback through multiple 
channels, including:
	 Email communications
	 IVR calls
	 Customer interactions during possession

Note:
During FY 2024–25, a total of 19,682 customer complaints were recorded, of which 61 remained unresolved as on the reporting 
date. In FY 2023–24, the total number of recorded complaints was 15,962, with 3 unresolved.
It is important to note that the complaint data disclosed in the previous year’s BRSR (FY 2023–24) reflected only a subset of 
complaints, based on a narrower classification framework that captured escalated or formal complaints (reported as 13, with 10 
unresolved). Following the implementation of a comprehensive CRM system (Salesforce) and an internal review of definitions and 
tracking protocols, the complaint classification methodology was updated to include a broader and more accurate spectrum of 
customer grievances.
This change enhances data accuracy and reflects the company’s commitment to transparent and responsive customer 
engagement. The numbers reported for FY 2023–24 have been retrospectively aligned for comparability.
