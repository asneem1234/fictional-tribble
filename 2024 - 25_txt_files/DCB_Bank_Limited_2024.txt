13. Climate 
Change 
R & O 
Banks are exposed to risks 
associated with climate change 
through their lending portfolios, 
particularly in sectors vulnerable to 
climate impacts like agriculture, real 
estate, and energy. Extreme weather 
events, such as floods and droughts, 
can lead to loan defaults and asset 
devaluation. Moreover, regulatory 
changes aimed at mitigating climate 
change can affect the 
creditworthiness of industries reliant 
on fossil fuels, thereby impacting 
banks' investments.  
We comply with applicable legal 
requirements which relate to our 
climate change aspect. 
Bank is analyzing international 
and national best practices and  
regulatory requirements, and will 
soon introduce policies to better 
manage Climate Change Risk.

GHG 
Management 
R & O 
By proactively managing energy 
consumption and reducing GHG

supplied is made from re-cycled materials, modular ceiling tiles are used wherever possible which are directly 
made from recycled waste. 
• Use of air-conditioners using green refrigerants thereby avoiding ozone depletion. 
• Initiated installation of solar panels for generation of renewable power wherever possible in branches and offices 
(possible with right of ownership to rooftop terrace is available) 
• Installed waterless urinals in large offices where water savings happen in large numbers. These systems do not 
use flushing water thereby saving water. 
• Use of products with highest energy efficiency such as inverter/VRF bases air conditioners, LED glow sign boards, 
LED down lighting, energy complaint UPS all these are aimed towards reduction of power consumption. 
• Use of smart practices such as master switch to cut off unwanted power consumption during non-working hours 
due to human mistakes. Use of occupancy-based sensors for switching off of light during times of non-use. 
• Use of green certified products which are aimed at reduction of resources e.g. certified plumbing and sanitary 
products which help achieve lower consumption of water. 
• The Bank has undertaken digitalization of various processes/ activities during the year which has saved tonnes of 
paper.

causes no harm when the water is released to the ground (Sewer Systems). The Bank practice responsible 
procedure to dispose UPS batteries through E-waste recyclers. In doing this, the battery does not fall in the hands 
of informal scrap dealers/ vendors where disposal methods of battery contents is suspect. Disposal done 
irresponsibly will generate toxic environment in the soil.
