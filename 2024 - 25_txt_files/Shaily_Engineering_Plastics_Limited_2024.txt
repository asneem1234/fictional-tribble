10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
At Shaily, we are committed towards responsible and sustainable waste management within our manufacturing operations. The 
Company has entered contract with various environmental agencies to pick the plant-generated plastic waste and disposed the 
same, ensuring proper disposal methods and end-use mapping. These agencies are certified by Gujarat Pollution Control Board 
(GPCB).
In addition to plastic waste, the Company prioritizes the proper disposal of other types of waste such as e-waste, battery waste, 
spent oil, and scraps. These materials often contain hazardous components that require specialized handling and treatment to 
prevent harm to the environment and human health. By engaging authorized vendors, we ensure that these waste materials are 
managed in compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.
The water discharged from production is recycled through Effluent Treatment Plant and thereafter ETP sludge is sent to GPCB 
authorised agency through manifest. Sewage water is treated by available Sewage Treatment Plant and after the treatment the 
same water is used for gardening. RO rejected water is used for flushing purposes.
Through these waste management practices, we strive to minimize our environmental impact, promote sustainability, and 
contribute to a circular economy by repurposing waste materials for beneficial reuse.
