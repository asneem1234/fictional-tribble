Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
	
GBL primarily operates as a service‑oriented company and, therefore, does not manufacture products that require 
direct end‑of‑life reclamation. The chemical products supplied by GBL are used by other industries as inputs in the 
production of finished goods for end users. While GBL’s own operations do not generate significant post‑consumer 
waste, the company ensures that all waste streams generated on-site are managed in strict compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations and industry best practices. Disposal and recycling activities are carried out only through 
agencies authorized by the respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), and records of waste generation and 
disposal are maintained for regulatory review.
a.	
Plastics (including packaging) – All plastic waste generated is segregated at source and sent to authorized 
recyclers for reclaiming and reuse, in line with plastic waste management rules. 
b.	
E-waste - All in‑house electronic waste is handed over to certified e‑waste handlers/recyclers for environmentally 
safe disposal, in compliance with the E‑Waste Management Rules. 
c.	
Hazardous waste - Hazardous waste, including ETP sludge, used foam pigs, used oil, and oil‑soaked cotton 
waste, is carefully segregated, stored in designated areas, labelled, and transported in accordance with legal 
requirements and safety protocols. Disposal is carried out through authorized vendors for recycling or treatment, 
as mandated by the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules. 
d.	
Other waste - Garden waste (e.g., fallen leaves, clippings) is composted in‑house to produce manure. Paper, 
wood, steel, electrical, and aluminium scrap is sold to authorized recyclers. Used batteries are returned to 
authorised suppliers under a buy‑back system for recycling or reuse.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
No, owing to the nature of the Company’s product/service offerings, GBL doesn’t fall under Extended Producers 
Responsibility (EPR) regime.

b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
Ganesh Benzoplast Limited (GBL) has established comprehensive and systematic procedures to identify 
workplace hazards and assess associated risks across all project sites, manufacturing units, and office locations. 
These processes are designed to proactively eliminate or minimize risks to ensure a safe working environment. 
Key elements of these procedures include:
-	
Detailed method statements are developed for all activities, outlining each step in the work sequence and 
identifying potential hazards at every stage.
-	
A structured approach is employed to identify hazards - covering physical, chemical, ergonomic, and human 
factors and evaluate the likelihood and potential consequences of incidents. This helps prioritize risks and 
determine appropriate control measures.
-	
Real-time risk evaluations are conducted immediately before starting any work activity, allowing the 
identification of unforeseen hazards and ensuring conditions remain safe.
-	
Identified hazards and corresponding control measures are effectively communicated to all relevant 
personnel, contractors, and stakeholders to ensure awareness and compliance.
-	
A comprehensive Fatality Prevention Plan is applied across all operations, incorporating rigorous safety 
monitoring, deployment of safety systems in high-risk areas, and continuous improvement initiatives aimed 
at achieving zero accidents.
-	
Engaging employees and supervisors through consultation, safety meetings, and feedback mechanisms, as 
they are critical in identifying practical hazards and suggesting improvements.
-	
Maintaining detailed records of hazard identification, risk assessments, control implementations, and safety 
performance metrics, ensuring transparency and continual compliance with occupational health and safety 
standards.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes. GBL has in place a comprehensive Incident Management and Investigation System that enables the prompt 
and transparent reporting of all work-related hazards - including unsafe acts, unsafe conditions, near misses, 
injuries, illnesses, and serious incidents. Once a hazard or incident is reported, a detailed root cause investigation 
is carried out, applying the Hierarchy of Controls to determine effective corrective and preventive measures. All 
corrective actions are systematically recorded, monitored for progress, and closed upon completion. 
	
To encourage participation at every level, each site is equipped with suggestion and feedback boxes where 
employees, contract workers, and business partners can share safety-related concerns or recommendations. 
In addition, a formal whistleblower mechanism is available for reporting serious safety lapses or inaction on 
identified risks. Information on how to access this portal is prominently displayed across all sites to ensure easy 
and confidential use.
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/No)
	
Yes. GBL ensures that all employees and workers have access to a range of non‑occupational medical and 
healthcare services. The company places strong emphasis on the overall well‑being of its workforce and business 
partners by maintaining well‑equipped healthcare facilities at multiple locations.
	
In addition to providing regular medical check‑ups and health awareness programmes to encourage preventive 
care, GBL conducts dedicated wellness initiatives that address both physical and mental health. Special focus is 
placed on stress management and fostering a healthy work‑life balance through targeted activities, counselling 
sessions, and awareness drives organised across different sites

Ganesh Benzoplast Limited (GBL) maintains a proactive and evolving safety management approach, in which all 
guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are periodically updated using insights from internal case 
studies, industry incidents, and lessons learned. This knowledge is integrated into predictive analysis models and risk 
assessment processes to identify unsafe behaviours, emerging hazards, and high risk activities before they lead to 
incidents. By anticipating risks early, GBL is able to allocate resources strategically to prevent workplace accidents, 
operational disruptions, and potential environmental harm.
	
Major initiatives embedded in this approach include
	
Key initiatives include:
•	
Near Miss Awareness and Reporting Programme: A company wide campaign engaging employees at all 
levels to recognise and promptly report near miss events. These insights are analysed to implement preventive 
measures and eliminate recurrence.
•	
No Blame, Transparent Safety Culture: An open reporting environment where employees and contractors can 
report hazards, unsafe conditions, or incidents without fear of repercussion, ensuring that safety concerns are 
addressed quickly and constructively.
•	
Inclusive Contractor Participation: Ensuring that contractors and third party staff have representation in site 
safety committee meetings, enabling joint decision making on safety improvements and hazard control measures.
•	
Safety Metrics Awareness & Performance Review: Regular training sessions and briefings to familiarise all 
personnel with key safety performance indicators such as Lost Time Injury (LTI), Restricted Work Case (RWC), and 
Medical Treatment Case (MTC). For every LTI case, a structured Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) plan is 
developed, reviewed for effectiveness, and rolled out across all Strategic Business Units (SBUs).
•	
Cross Functional Safety Audits: Periodic audits involving multidisciplinary teams to identify systemic risks and 
share best practices across different operations.
•	
Safety Communication and Visual Management: Use of signages, dashboards, newsletters, and safety alerts 
to keep safety top of mind for all site personnel.
	
Through this integrated, learning driven safety framework, GBL not only meets regulatory compliance requirements 
but also cultivates a mature safety culture aimed at achieving zero harm to people, environment, and assets.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
At GBL, stakeholder engagement is an ongoing, structured process led by senior leadership and aligned with 
the Company’s governance framework. Interactions occur through multiple channels - including formal meetings, 
consultations, investor calls, employee forums, community discussions, and regulatory/industry association 
engagements - ensuring responsiveness to market, regulatory, and sustainability trends.
Process flow:
•	
Regular Engagement with investors, employees, communities, customers, vendors, regulators, and NGOs to 
identify economic, environmental, and social issues.
•	
Feedback Capture & Analysis, categorising inputs by topic and materiality.
•	
Operational Review at the business unit level to assess implications.
•	
Board Reporting, with consolidated updates from leadership or delegated committees (CSR, Sustainability, 
Audit).
•	
Board Deliberation, integrating inputs into sustainability strategy, risk management, and long‑term planning.
Implementation examples:
•	
Project Consultations: Public/stakeholder feedback is integrated into new project and expansion planning.
•	
Community & CSR Planning: Needs assessments and baseline surveys inform CSR priorities, with annual plans 
and impact results presented to the Board.
	
At GBL, stakeholder consultation on economic, environmental, and social (EES) topics is embedded within the 
Company’s governance framework and overseen by the Board through the Sustainability & Risk Management (SRM) 
Committee along with other delegated committees such as CSR, Audit, and NRC. Consultation takes place through 
regular interactions with investors, employees, communities, customers, vendors, regulators, and NGOs via structured 
channels including AGMs, investor calls, employee forums, community meetings, surveys, and industry associations. 
Feedback from these consultations is systematically captured and analysed by theme and materiality, reviewed at 
the business unit level, and consolidated for presentation to the Board on a quarterly and annual basis. The Board 
deliberates on these insights to integrate stakeholder perspectives into strategic planning, sustainability initiatives, 
and risk management processes. Outcomes and Board responses are communicated back through the Company’s 
website, statutory disclosures, employee forums, and direct community follow-ups, ensuring a closed-loop system
