Water & 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Potential risks of inadequate 
water and waste management 
may 
lead 
to 
deterioration 
in 
water 
and 
soil 
quality 
affecting 
ecosystem 
and 
health. Water is a critical input 
into 
the 
manufacturing 
of 
pharmaceutical 
formulations, 
used in the manufacturing of 
pharmaceutical 
formulations, 
in the preparation of reagents, 
and for cleaning (e.g. washing 
and 
rinsing), 
domestic 
and 
gardening uses.
Water and waste related risks are assessed 
as part of established risk management 
framework periodically. We conduct water 
risk evaluation studies to identify alternative 
water resources. Our water management 
strategy involves key focus areas including 
water 
efficiency 
and 
optimization, 
identifying alternate water sources for water 
security, and creating freshwater potential 
beyond the fence. We have implemented 
waste management systems at all our 
facilities, which covers waste minimization, 
segregation for maximizing waste reuse/
recycle/recovery.

Research & 
Development
Opportunity
R&D investment has a positive 
impact on green innovation 
and 
Sustainability 
& 
ESG 
performance of our organization. 
Strategic investment in R&D 
and disclosing the same allows 
our 
internal 
and 
external 
stakeholders 
understand 
the 
approach and scale taken by our 
organization.
A key area of focus is ‘Green Chemistry’ and 
we have implemented several initiatives 
for the same. These include transitioning 
from solvent-based reactions to water 
based reactions, using less harmful, greener 
solvents instead of highly hazardous solvents, 
enhancing our solvent recovery capabilities 
and overall, improving our processes to 
maximize the incorporation of all materials 
used.
We have initiated Life Cycle Assessments 
(LCA) study to identify and further reduce 
the adverse environmental footprint of our 
products.

Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
It is crucial to engage with 
the communities we operate 
in to increase trust and foster 
harmony.
Shilpa Foundation is the principal channel 
for the corporate philanthropy undertaken 
by our organization. The aim is to build 
resilient solutions that enable underserved 
communities to improve their livelihood 
continually. The core areas of intervention 
are 
Primary 
Healthcare, 
Environmental 
Sustainability, 
Rural 
Development 
and

Any action by our directors, 
employees 
or 
value 
chain 
partners which are unethical 
or 
pertains

Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct 
and defined roles and responsibilities of 
concerned personnel related to ethics and 
integrity (e.g. anti-bribery, anti-corruption, 
anti-money laundering, whistle blowing, 
etc.).
Our 
commitment 
to 
good 
corporate 
governance is integral to our business and 
it helps us create long-term value for all our 
stakeholders.
Our Business Code of Conduct applies to 
Directors, and employees of our organization, 
its subsidiaries, and affiliates. It lays down 
the principles that guide our conduct 
and 
strengthens 
our 
decision-making, 
promotes stakeholder trust and works as 
a moat around our business. We conduct 
our business as per our Anti-Corruption 
policies, and all applicable laws. While 
contracts with our suppliers, contractors, 
and business partners include adherence to 
our principles concerning ethics, there is a 
separate Supplier Code of Conduct required 
to be followed by our suppliers and service 
providers.
The principles of integrity, transparency, 
accountability,

ethics
