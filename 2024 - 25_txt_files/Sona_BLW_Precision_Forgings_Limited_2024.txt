Ethics, 
Accountability, 
and 
Transparency
Risk and 
Opportunity
Adherence to the highest 
standards of transparency 
and business ethics results 
in corporate governance 
excellence. Our governance 
mechanism is designed 
to promote transparency 
in the system, adherence 
to compliances, and 
ensuring accountability. 
The mechanism strives to 
create a value system to 
achieve business excellence 
and increase stakeholder 
confidence.
To strengthen the value system, 
the Company has implemented 
ethical policies and framework to 
inculcate a culture of compliance 
and governance. With regular 
communication, training and 
awareness sessions of the 
employees, extended workforce, 
and suppliers, the Company 
drives ethical behavior. Most of 
these policies are available on 
Company’s website for the benefit 
of all the stakeholders.
Unethical behavior, 
non-compliance, and 
violation of any form 
may bring punitive 
and reputational 
repercussions, 
besides loss 
of investors’ 
confidence and 
brand erosion.
2
Safe and 
Healthy 
Working 
Conditions
Risk and 
Opportunity
By identifying health and safe 
working condition as a risk 
and opportunity, the Company 
prioritises the well-being 
of its employees, complies 
with legal norms, maintains 
operational efficiency & 
continuity, and manages costs 
effectively. These factors, 
contribute to the overall 
sustainability and long-term 
success of the company. 
Our priority is to ensure a 
safe working environment 
for all our employees and 
workers with primary focus on 
safety management system, 
mitigation of associated 
hazards, regular training 
and mock drills, periodic risk 
assessment, and continual 
improvement in OHS 
management system.
A strong security system is in 
place to fulfill the Zero Harm 
vision. These processes are 
well designed, rely on real-time 
data, and are centered on the 
shared responsibility principle. 
At Sona Comstar, we have set 
high standards of occupational 
safety at all our premises. Regular 
assessment of health and safety 
practices and working conditions 
for all our plants and offices to 
identify gaps, if any and develop 
corrective action plans. Respective 
Plant management teams, along 
with key facility workers, are 
responsible for implementing 
adequate safety policies, 
procedures, and measures from a 
corporate governance standpoint.
Health and Safety 
related incidents 
may cause 
disruption, impact 
employee morale, 
and business 
reputation leading 
to negative financial 
implications.
3
Product Safety 
and Quality
Risk and 
Opportunity
Our aim is to strive for 
quality excellence and 
our core values – ‘Vitality, 
Frugality, and Agility’ reflect 
our approach in developing 
products that create positive 
customer experience. On one 
hand, Opportunities outweigh 
the Risks such as competitive 
advantage, foster customer 
satisfaction and customer 
loyalty, strong brand equity 
& image and drive business 
success. While, on the other 
hand, product quality and 
safety pose threats in the 
form of potential harm to 
consumers, non-compliance 
with regulatory & statutory 
norms and negative impacts 
on brand reputation and 
revenue.
Our product responsibility extends 
beyond manufacturing and sales, 
contributing to cleaner and safer 
mobility. The key guiding principle 
of our approach is to minimise 
the impact on environment while 
maximising safety, economic and 
social impact. Our manufacturing 
facilities are IATF 16949 certified 
which stands for continual 
improvement, emphasising defect 
prevention, and reduction of 
variation and waste in the supply 
chain and assembly process.
Defective products 
may account for 
product recalls. 
Product recalls 
can also impact 
consumers’ quality 
perception, which 
can result in 
reputational harm 
damage. Product 
recall may increase 
cost due to product 
replacements and 
the creation of 
product fixes, apart 
from the litigation 
cost.

Material 
Sourcing
Opportunity
In an auto-component 
business, identifying material 
sourcing as a risk and/or 
opportunity, proactively allows 
in addressing supply chain 
vulnerabilities, strengthening 
value chain resilience, 
improving competitiveness, 
effectively managing costs, 
fostering innovation, and 
driving quality and long-term 
sustainability in business 
operations. Sona Comstar 
selects the best materials 
suitable for respective end 
application thereby optimising 
the amount of material utilised 
in operations. Furthermore, 
we have adopted circular 
economy by using recycled 
input material and returnable 
packaging wherever possible.
--
Responsible material 
sourcing could 
result in higher 
levels of consumer 
satisfaction, 
sustainability, and an 
increase in market 
competitiveness.
5
Solutions for 
low carbon 
mobility
Opportunity
Sona Comstar believes 
that electrified mobility is 
necessary to reduce the 
GHG emissions arising from 
automobiles and for a greener 
planet. It has therefore 
embarked on a journey to 
increase its revenue from 
battery electric vehicles 
(BEV) and focused its R&D 
efforts towards developing 
drive motors, controllers, 
and transmission solutions 
for different types of electric 
vehicles.
--
As of 31st March 
2025, we derived 
36% of our sales 
from BEV. We have 
won 58 EV programs 
across 32 unique 
customers. We will 
increasingly derive 
higher percentage 
of our revenue from 
EVs and target to 
achieve 45% of our 
revenue from EV 
targeted products by 
2026.
6
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Our energy policy is primarily 
focused on improving energy 
efficiency in our operations, 
execution of innovative 
projects to optimise energy 
demand, and the proactive 
use of renewable energy.
--
Energy saving 
initiatives and 
enhanced use of 
renewable energy 
would result in 
sustainability 
and reduce the 
company’s specific 
energy consumption 
thereby leading to 
financial savings.
7
Emissions 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
One of the most important 
solutions to climate change 
is reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, which is why it 
is so important in executing 
our commitments for carbon 
management & greenhouse 
gas mitigation.
We intend to increase the 
proportion of renewable electricity 
in our total energy consumption 
for the reduction of GHG 
emissions and saving energy by 
using electricity generated from 
the solar plant. We have also taken 
targets for reduction in specific 
energy consumption to improve 
energy intensity in our operations.
There may 
potentially be 
negative financial 
implications and 
reputational 
damage in case of 
failure to meet the 
commitment towards 
GHG reduction.

Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Safe management of both 
hazardous and non-hazardous 
wastes is an important 
business conduct issue for 
every manufacturing industry. 
Our Management Policy 
on Environment directs us 
to implement effective and 
efficient waste management 
practices with an aim to 
recycle and reduce the waste 
generated while transforming 
resources into valuable 
products
We have implemented initiatives 
throughout the year, such as 
recycling of waste die lube 
recovered from manufacturing 
operations.
Improper 
management of 
waste may lead 
to environmental 
pollution/ 
contamination, 
regulatory fines 
and notices, 
adverse impacts 
on health, and 
community protest 
that will negatively 
impact the brand’s 
reputation.
9
Respect for 
Individuals
Risk and 
Opportunity
Sona Comstar is ensuring 
100% employees are trained 
on aspects of “respect 
towards Individuals”. We are 
committed to providing our 
workers and officers with 
equal opportunities in terms 
of recognition, advancement, 
and career path, regardless 
of their origin or views, and 
do not tolerate any form of 
discrimination or harassment. 
Any violation in human rights 
may lead to regulatory, legal, 
and legislative challenges 
besides making the company 
not a preferred employer of 
choice.
Our induction programmes are 
structured in a manner which 
highlights awareness of human 
rights for new employees and 
refresher training. Sona Comstar 
complies with all the required 
labor laws and is OHSAS 18001 
certified. We also provide training 
to our employees at the time 
of induction about the code of 
conduct which covers human 
rights issues such as child labor, 
gender diversity, workplace 
discrimination. We also get 
background verification conducted 
through a third party for all the 
new employees. The Company 
strives to uphold the basic 
principles of human rights in all 
its operations. This is in alignment 
with its codes and policies. We 
also provide a vigil mechanism for 
our employees to report genuine 
concerns for any unfair and unjust 
incident under the ambit of law. 
We have also been certified as a 
Great Place to Work.
Potential to 
negatively impact 
the brand image, 
inability to retain 
good talent etc.

b.	
What are the processes used to identify 
work-related hazards and assess risks 
on a routine and non-routine basis by

The Company identifies potential work-related incident risks through a structured 
hazard identification process, followed by a likelihood assessment to estimate the 
frequency or probability of occurrence. Based on this assessment, risk reduction 
measures are implemented to either prevent incidents (by reducing their likelihood) 
or control them (by limiting their extent and duration), as well as to mitigate any 
adverse effects. To further enhance workplace safety, Sona Comstar has developed 
an Emergency Preparedness Plan, a Mock Drill Record Evaluation Checklist, and an 
Aspect Register–Standard Operating Procedure Manual aimed at minimising work-
related hazards. For non-routine activities, a rapid risk assessment is conducted before 
the activity begins. Appropriate control measures are then implemented through a work 
permit system, in accordance with the identified risk level, to eliminate or minimise 
potential hazards.

to report the work related hazards and

c) near-miss reporting. To address and reduce such hazards, the company conducts 
emergency mock drills and safety exercises, while also organising capacity-building 
and awareness sessions to ensure employees and workers are well-versed in safety 
procedures and risk management practices.

maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified
Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
