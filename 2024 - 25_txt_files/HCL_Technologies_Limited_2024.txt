1
Climate 
change
Risk and 
opporunity
Climate change poses both 
a physical and a transition 
risk to HCLTech’s business 
operations. Physical risks 
include extreme weather 
events like droughts, floods, 
cyclones, wildfires and 
heat stress. Transition risks 
include changes in policy 
and regulatory context 
leading to increased carbon 
prices, taxes and cost of 
doing business. It also 
includes business continuity 
risks. The opporunity to 
be climate resilient and 
climate positive includes 
developing climate resilient 
processes, operations, value 
chain, products, services 
and solutions that not only 
suppor our journey but 
also that of our clients and 
parners.
As a par of our net- zero 
strategy, HCLTech is 
commited to limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions 
aligned to the 1.5ºC pathway 
by 2030 and to achieving 
net zero by 2040. A clear 
roadmap is planned towards 
this commitment. We are 
making steady progress on 
this roadmap. HCLTech is 
also developing products, 
services and solutions that 
help clients and parners 
meet their commitments 
on climate change. 
HCLTech has continued 
its journey to identify and 
execute projects to work 
with communities to move 
towards a climate resilient 
future.
The financial 
implications of climate 
change risk are 
disruption to business 
operations and 
increased cost of doing 
business.
The financial 
opporunity of being 
climate resilient and 
climate positive is 
enhanced business 
continuity, robust 
operations, cost saving 
and increased business 
revenues.
Details are covered in 
the TCFD disclosures.

2
Eco ¯efficiency Risk and 
opporunity
Eco¯efficiency is an 
opporunity for HCLTech 
to improve its operational 
efficiency on its ecological 
perormance related to 
energy, waste, water and 
other resources.
HCLTech has implemented 
various energy efficiency 
initiatives to reduce energy 
consumption, water 
consumption and waste 
minimization. HCLTech 
has defined monitoring 
and governance systems 
covering all eco¯efficiency 
parameters. These are 
reviewed at regular 
intervals and budgets are 
allocated for perormance 
improvement.
Lower perormance on 
eco¯efficiency carries 
the risk of increased 
costs of doing business. 
Improvement in 
eco¯efficiency directly 
leads to cost savings 
and resilient business 
operations.
3
Human 
Capital
Risk and 
opporunity
HCLTech defines human 
capital as skills, knowledge 
and experience possessed 
by an employee or a team, 
that can be valuable to the 
organization. We require 
constant upskilling and 
reskilling of our employees 
to ensure we deliver top 
services to our clients in 
a rapidly evolving digital 
technology space. Human 
capital is an imporant risk as 
well as opporunity for us.
HCLTech has a clear 
institutional mechanism 
to map future skillset 
requirements and has 
programs for upskilling and 
reskilling employees. There 
are measurements used 
to gauge the perormance 
of the initiative, which are 
reviewed periodically.
The financial 
implication of the risk 
is potential loss of 
business opporunity 
if adequate and 
appropriate human 
capital is not available. 
Readiness on human 
capital creates 
opporunities to cater 
to client and business 
needs leading to 
revenue growth.
4
Local hiring
Opporunity
Hiring local talent in places 
where we do business 
is an imporant risk and 
opporunity for us.
Hiring locally is not just 
the right thing to do, but 
an effective strategy to 
improve talent retention. 
It also conveys our 
commitment to the 
community that we are 
invested in that location. 
Across the globe, in 
the countries where we 
operate, we are investing in 
local talent. As a strategy 
HCLTech has expanded its 
offices to smaller cities (New 
Vistas) and provided a hybrid 
workspace to furher enable 
people prospects.
Improved talent 
retention and beter 
relations with the 
community and clients 
lead to steady long 
term revenue growth 
and ability to deliver on 
that growth.

5
Diversity and 
inclusion 
(D&I)
Risk and 
Opporunity
To maintain our innovative 
culture, we recognize the 
imporance of diversity 
in thought, ideas and 
perspectives. There is ample 
evidence to highlight that 
having diverse perspectives 
in a team creates beter 
work outcomes in addition 
to beter team coherence 
and has a positive impact on 
creativity, problem¯solving 
and overall organizational 
success.
HCLTech has clear policies, 
processes and governance 
structures to monitor the 
perormance of our D&I 
strategy. We have an ESG 
and DEI Commitee set 
up in our Board to ensure 
a strategic focus. Goals 
and targets are identified 
and integrated into the 
perormance evaluation of 
leaders. A separate team 
works on various initiatives 
to furher our commitment.
Absence of D&I 
robustness may lead 
to narrow perspectives 
that may impact quality 
and output of work.
Robust presence of 
D&I may potentially 
lead to comprehensive 
solutions driving beter 
business outcomes in 
addition to inclusive 
workplace. Inclusive 
workplace may drive 
beter productivity, 
innovation and 
retention of talent.
6
Talent 
atraction 
and retention
Risk and 
Opporunity
Meeting the increasing 
demand for new talent 
poses a significant risk and a 
unique opporunity.
The increasing shifts globally 
towards the adoption 
of digital solutions and 
increasing range and 
diversity of technology 
solutions have put the 
focus on striving the right 
balance between demand 
and supply of appropriate 
skillsets. We view it as an 
opporunity to align our work 
culture with global trends, 
thereby enhancing employee 
retention while also 
increasing their efficiency.
HCLTech’s strategy is 
to focus on building the 
workplace of tomorrow—one 
which promotes equality of 
opporunity, a collaborative 
and transparent culture and 
deploys a robust training 
strategy designed to meet 
the development needs 
of employees at all levels. 
The company provides 
employees with progressive 
career paths through 
internal opporunities.
Failing to effectively 
atract and retain 
talented individuals 
can result in missed 
opporunities for 
growth and innovation, 
leading to decreased 
productivity and 
competitiveness. 
Additionally, the 
costs associated with 
recruiting, onboarding 
and training new 
employees are 
significant.
On the other hand, 
successfully atracting 
and retaining the right 
talent leads to direct 
perormance gains and 
ability to cater to new 
growth opporunities 
leading to beter 
revenues.

Work 
environment
Risk and 
opporunity
HCLTech identifies work 
environment as a material 
topic considering both the 
emotional and physical 
aspects of our employees.
Good workspaces, wellness 
spaces, creches, gyms, etc., 
are integral pars of our 
offices. It is also imporant to 
create an environment that 
is safe where employees 
have the confidence and 
trust to repor on any 
kind of discrimination or 
harassment.
We ensure that our offices 
are designed and planned 
to ensure the comfor of our 
employees.
We have clear policies 
and processes to prevent 
any discrimination 
and harassment in our 
workplaces. These are 
communicated regularly and 
employees are encouraged 
to repor on any incidents.
We have tracking 
mechanisms to ensure 
we take preventive steps. 
Independent investigation 
of incidents is also ensured.
The comfor and trust 
of the employees in a 
good work environment 
results in dedicated 
employees. Hence 
the financial impact 
is a result of healthy 
and safe employees 
perorming to their full 
potential. A workplace 
incident can result in a 
loss of reputation to the 
organization and this 
can result in potential 
loss of opporunities.
8
Citizenship
Opporunity
Corporate citizenship is 
not just an opporunity 
for HCLTech but rather 
it is the backbone of 
the organization. It is 
our responsibility to the 
community in which we 
operate.
HCLFoundation in India and 
the various employee councils 
around the world highlight our 
focus. Apar from the positive 
impact on the community 
members/program 
paricipants, our initiatives 
demonstrate our commitment 
to the communities in which 
we operate.
Outcomes resulting 
from improved trust 
and credibility in the 
community can bring 
potential financial 
opporunities for 
HCLTech.

Sustainable 
impact on 
clients
Opporunity
As technology solutions are 
deployed at greater scale 
and complexity to solve 
major problems around the 
world, their sustainable and 
responsible use becomes 
critical to limit their footprint 
and to avoid unintended 
consequences.
As a leader in IT services, 
HCLTech is uniquely 
positioned to assist its 
clients to innovate through 
advanced technology and 
digitalization while being 
responsible in its usage.
HCLTech already works 
with clients on several 
sustainable solutions. 
Therefore, we created a 
dedicated team which works 
with various sector heads 
to identify opporunities 
related to sustainability 
and create appropriate 
sustainability¯related 
solutions for our clients.
The direct financial 
impact will emerge 
from the creation of 
new opporunities with 
clients. Indirect benefits 
include the creation 
of environmental and 
social capital.

Cyber 
security, data 
protection 
and system 
availability
Risk and 
opporunity
Greater adoption of 
technology globally has led 
to increased incidents of 
cyberatacks and frauds. This 
has led to a greater focus 
on the need to build robust, 
secure and sophisticated 
solutions that are secure, 
safe and robust. Data privacy 
and security are critical 
features.
HCLTech ensures a globally 
interconnected oversight 
framework involving 
governance, policies, 
procedures, training and 
awareness programs, global 
privacy impact assessments, 
privacy by design, data 
mapping, third¯pary 
contractual oversight, 
incident management and a 
mechanism for monitoring 
regulatory compliance for 
every geography.
Our Crisis & Resilience 
program highlights our 
focus on integrating 
resilience as an intrinsic par 
of our business operating 
model and seeks to embed 
“resilience by design” 
across the dimensions of 
work, personnel, workplace, 
business operations, 
technology, supply chain 
and leadership.
Our Information and 
cybersecurity program 
ensures a strong security 
posture for HCLTech and 
our clients. Our security 
posture has been validated 
by independent, industry 
recognized cerifications 
and atestation standards, 
including quarerly oversight 
by the Board. We also have 
cyber insurance that covers 
different types of breaches 
and cyber events.
Any incident has a 
direct impact on that 
specific project with the 
client or on HCLTech 
as an organization. 
It may lead to 
regulatory implications, 
reputational challenges 
and financial 
implications.

Sustainable 
Procurement
Risk and 
Opporunity
For sustainability to be 
effective at derisking the 
organization, it needs to 
be deployed beyond our 
internal operations to cover 
our supply chain. A supply 
chain that is at odds with 
our sustainability goals and 
priorities is a risk to our 
achievement of our goals.
Through responsible 
sourcing, collaboration with 
upstream and downstream 
parners and improving 
supply chain governance, 
HCLTech has integrated 
sustainability into its 
procurement process. 
Both the Supplier Code of 
Conduct and Procurement 
Policy has integrated 
sustainability requirements. 
ESG has been incorporated 
as a risk domain in the 
Vendor onboarding process 
for new vendors. 
HCLTech has also 
conducted risk evaluation 
of the supply chain based 
on ESG guidelines and 
identified categories and 
vendors who will be audited. 
The audit requirements are 
integrated into the Vendor 
Risk Management program 
(R&C).
Non¯adherence to 
ESG guidelines in 
the supply chain can 
lead to associated 
reputation damage and 
thwar progress on our 
sustainability goals.
Integration of 
our sustainability 
goals in our supply 
chain increases our 
effectiveness in 
meeting these goals 
and leads to greater 
positive impact.

Governance 
and ethics
Risk and 
opporunity
The regulations around 
governance are significant 
and increasingly 
becoming more stringent 
around requirements on 
accountability, transparency 
and fairness.
HCLTech has stipulated 
policies, processes and 
systems to ensure ethical 
conduct and strong 
governance. Governance 
and Ethics are the 
foundations of the HCLTech 
culture. We structure our 
governance to permeate 
ethical conduct throughout 
the organization. Our strong 
governance and ethical 
culture ensure our viability 
over the long term.
The Code of Business Ethics 
and Conduct (COBEC) is 
our principal document that 
outlines the way HCLTech 
employees should conduct 
business.
The whistle¯blower policy 
and various other reporing 
channels help to identify 
any challenges that need 
to be corrected. The Board 
reviews this periodically 
through the Audit 
Commitee.
We are focused on 
both current and future 
regulations to ensure we 
are fully prepared for any 
change.
Non¯compliance 
with corporate 
governance regulations 
can have several 
financial implications 
and reputational 
consequences. 
Regulatory actions 
taken against the 
company can lead 
to penalties, fines 
and legal expenses, 
negatively impacting its 
financial perormance. 
Moreover, there is a 
risk associated with 
incidents that may 
not be regulatory in 
nature but still raise 
questions about the 
ethical conduct of the 
business.

208
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Repor
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
HCLTech has established, implemented, and maintained a formal process for hazard identification, risk 
assessment and control to effectively manage workplace and safety hazards across our facilities. HCLTech uses 
the failure mode effect analysis (“FMEA”) to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis.
After risks are identified, the following steps are taken:
●
Risk Evaluation: The identified risks are assessed using the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which considers the 
Severity, Occurrence, and Detection of each failure mode.
●
Action Plan Development: High-priority risks are addressed by creating mitigation strategies, such as design 
changes, process improvements, or additional controls.
●
Implementation of Actions: The corrective measures are applied to reduce the likelihood of failure, minimize 
impact, or improve detection methods.
●
Re-evaluation: The updated process or design is reviewed, and a new RPN is calculated to confirm the 
effectiveness of the actions taken.
The above steps ensure a continuous cycle of improvement to minimize risks and enhance system reliability.
c.
Whether you have processes for workers to repor the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
Yes, we have established processes for workers to repor work-related hazards and remove themselves from risky 
situations. Key steps involved are as follows:
●
Hazard Identification: Workers are encouraged to identify and recognize potential hazards in the workplace. 
This is done through regular inspections, observations, and feedback.
●
Reporing Channels: Workers can repor hazards through various channels such as direct communication with 
supervisors, dedicated safety commitees, or anonymous reporing systems.
●
Documentation: Proper documentation of the hazard is crucial. This includes detailing the nature of the 
hazard, its location, and any immediate risks it poses.
●
Immediate Action: Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous situations if they believe 
there is an imminent risk to their health or safety. 
●
Follow-Up: After a hazard is repored, there is a follow-up process to ensure that the issue is resolved and 
that the workplace is safe.
●
Training and Education: Regular training sessions are conducted to educate workers on how to identify, 
repor, and handle workplace hazards effectively.

Essential Indicators
1.
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
HCLTech follows a structured and inclusive process for identifying key stakeholder groups. The company has 
underaken a comprehensive mapping exercise to identify all relevant stakeholders:
●
Internal stakeholders such as employees
●
External stakeholders including clients, suppliers, investors, regulators, NGOs, and local communities
●
Indirect stakeholders such as future generations and natural ecosystems
The stakeholder identification and engagement approach are built on three core dimensions:
●
Influence – their ability to shape or be influenced by the company’s business decisions
●
Impact – the extent to which they are affected by, or can affect, the company’s operations
●
Experise – their technical knowledge or representative capacity relevant to ESG issues
Engagements are designed and underaken based on the materiality and need for consultation. These include both 
targeted methods (such as interviews and workshops) and broader periodic consultations, as appropriate and the 
frequency of engagement is predicated or scheduled as per the mutual needs of the stakeholders. Insights and 
outcomes from these engagements are disseminated across relevant teams within the organization to ensure timely 
feedback and resolution for stakeholders.
This robust engagement mechanism has enabled HCLTech to align its ESG focus with its strategic framework – Act, 
Pact, and Impact. For the company, stakeholder engagement is not a one-time activity, but a continuous process that 
suppors the understanding and fulfilment of stakeholder expectations.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
To strengthen its ESG governance, HCLTech has established a robust framework that actively involves both the Board 
and stakeholders in identifying and addressing ESG-related risks and opporunities. This collaborative approach 
ensures that the company’s sustainability strategy remains closely aligned with stakeholder expectations and keeps 
pace with evolving global standards.
At HCLTech, ESG governance is built on several key pillars:
●
Developing clear sustainability strategies that suppor the company’s overall objectives
●
Seting measurable ESG targets to monitor progress and drive continuous improvement
●
Maintaining open and transparent communication with stakeholders to foster accountability and growth
Executive Directors and Senior Management play a hands-on role in engaging with stakeholders—including investors, 
employees, clients, and suppliers—to beter understand their needs, expectations, and concerns. Insights and feedback 
from these interactions are systematically relayed to the Board through well-defined processes.
When stakeholders raise imporant issues, these are escalated to the appropriate forums for careful consideration 
and action. HCLTech also has a clear internal mechanism for addressing concerns, suggestions, and grievances, with 
maters referred to relevant Board commitees based on their significance.
To ensure oversight, HCLTech has set up a dedicated ESG and DEI Commitee that meets quarerly. This commitee:
●
Reviews and assesses ESG risks and opporunities that could impact business perormance
●
Approves both shor-term and long-term ESG strategies
●
Ensures these strategies are seamlessly integrated into the company’s overall business plans
The Corporate Sustainability team closely tracks key ESG metrics and provides regular updates to both the ESG 
Commitee and the CEO. This process ensures transparency and keeps leadership accountable for delivering on the 
company’s ESG commitments.

topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics 
were incorporated into the policies and activities of the entity.
Yes. HCLTech has consulted stakeholders for arriving at the 12 material topics and will continue to monitor the 
progress of the topics. Engaging with stakeholders is central to how the Company identifies environmental, social and 
governance topics. Through these interactions, we gather valuable feedback, insights, and data that help us focus on 
what maters most. This process plays a key role in shaping and refining our ESG strategy.
At HCLTech, we stay closely connected with our internal and external stakeholders to understand what truly maters 
to them and to our business. Through open conversations and interviews, we carry out a double materiality analysis—
looking at the risks, opporunities, and impacts from both sides. This helps us focus on the issues that are most relevant 
and meaningful.

Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
Employees must repor any incidents of alleged harassment that they are aware of through channels provided by the 
Global Ethics Helpline (GEH) which allows employees to make complaints about sexual harassment in the workplace 
online. Employees can also share their concerns and queries using secure@hcltech.com.
All official mechanisms for reporing issues/complaints are focused on preventing and addressing sexual harassment 
grievances in the workplace in accordance with HCL’s Prevention and Redressal of Sexual Harassment at Workplace 
Policy. The policies and practices are in accordance with the applicable laws, especially the “The Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013” for employees based in India, as well as other 
relevant rules in the countries where the company operates.
If an employee is subjected to sexual harassment, they should repor it to secure@hcltech.com immediately. The 
Internal Complaints Commitee (“ICC”) investigates and addresses complaints received through this method with the 
utmost objectivity and confidentiality. HCL Tech also guarantees that the standard SLAs required by law are satisfied.
False Accusation: If the ICC determines that the complaint against the respondent is malicious, that the aggrieved 
woman or anyone else filing it knew it was false, or that the aggrieved woman or anyone else filing it has produced 
any forged or misleading document, it may advise the employer to take appropriate action, such as issuing a writen 
apology, issuing a warning, reprimanding or censured the employee, withholding a promotion, withholding a pay 
increase, terminating their employment, having them undergo counseling, or having them perorm community service. 
However, this excludes claims that are hard to suppor or that were made in good faith.
Right to Appeal: Any individual who is dissatisfied with the recommendations made may file an appeal with the cour or 
tribunal within the time frame specified, in the manner required, without prejudice to any provisions contained in any 
other legislation now in effect.
