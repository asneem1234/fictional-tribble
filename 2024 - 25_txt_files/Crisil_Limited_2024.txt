areas such as adherence to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations, enforcement of minimum wage 
standards, prevention of child labour and implementation of anti-bribery measures, all of which are assessed through 
the self-assessments.
	
The assessments are performed on a regular basis, and if any unfavourable responses regarding the aforementioned 
minimum social regulations are received from our suppliers, these responses are reviewed by our dedicated business 
and corporate teams, leading to the initiation of necessary corrective actions that ensure no significant gaps remain 
unaddressed. Minimum adherence to the social norms outlined above is now an essential component of the criteria 
utilised for the onboarding of new vendors starting from 2023.

Interacting with stakeholders is essential to the organisation's success 
because it allows for the integration of their requirements into its 
objectives. Crisil believes it is critical to interact with people and 
comprehend their requirements, wants and concerns. These kinds of 
interactions also guarantee efficient and long-lasting cooperation. For 
each of our stakeholders, we institutionalised structured feedback 
mechanisms which provide us with good insights on their expectations 
from their relationship with Crisil.
Every quarter, the Board's Stakeholder Relations Committee examines 
grievances from all stakeholders including clients, employees, 
shareholders, suppliers and business partners. Over the course of the 
year, the Committee reviewed the results of stakeholder surveys and 
the entire engagement process, going beyond the purview of grievance 
handling. This is reflective of the importance attributed to stakeholder 
needs at the topmost level at Crisil.
Thought leadership
As part of our thought leadership and outreach initiative, we authored 
several opinion pieces and articles on important industry and regulatory 
developments, in premier dailies and online platforms. We also

Literacy (CFL) project – which is being implemented in India with support from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 11 
public sector banks and the NABARD. This project scales-up Crisil Foundation’s financial awareness and inclusion 
efforts through 675 CFL projects across 100,000+ villages in 14 states and four union territories. By building timely, 
relevant and trusted centres of knowledge, such as the CFL, Crisil has taken a firm step towards enabling the last-
mile financial inclusion, critical to the country’s long-term development.

Ethical  
conduct 
Opportunity
Materiality assessment 
helps in prioritising the 
topics and analysing the 
relevant sustainabiliy 
risks and opportunities 
that can be integrated 
in our operations and 
business activity. Crisil 
conducted a materiality 
re-assessment by revisiting 
material topics. The list 
of top E, S and G topics 
has been derived through 
a consultative exercise, 
wherein the priorities were 
evaluated in order of their 
importance to our business 
and our stakeholders. The 
survey was responded by 
315 internal and external 
stakeholders.
The results will help us 
make decisions based on 
relevant data and meet 
increasing demands from 
regulators and reporting 
standards. This exercise 
also helps us identify 
risks and opportunities 
pertaining to those 
identified areas. The survey 
was conducted across 
diverse stakeholders 
including clients, vendors, 
community, shareholders, 
employees and top 
management.

consumption from renewable sources, from 58% in 2023 to 67% in 2024.
•	
In 2024, 33% of our office area was certified under IGBC’s LEED certification programme
• 
Crisil transitions to a New Green Office in Mumbai
	
In the conceptualisation and execution of our new office at Lightbridge, Saki Vihar, careful 
attention has been devoted to environmental considerations, demonstrating our dedication to 
creating workspaces that harmonise commercial needs and the natural ecosystem.  
Few highlights of the office:
•	
The central atrium features natural greenery, with live plants in the atrium and on every 
floor, which help maintain optimal oxygen levels within the premises
•	
The design maximises natural light, reducing the need for artificial lighting
•	
Entire premises operate on sustainable green energy

Modern Slavery Act, 2015
Statement
This statement is published by Crisil Limited about and to 
enable its subsidiaries that are subject to the Act, including 
in particular Crisil Irevna UK Ltd and Coalition Development 
UK Ltd (subsidiaries). Crisil and its subsidiaries are together 
referred to as Crisil entities. Forced, bonded or compulsory 
labour, human trafficking and other kinds of slavery signify 
some of the severest forms of human rights abuse. We are 
committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and 
human trafficking.
Organisational structure
Crisil Limited provides ratings, research, and risk and policy 
advisory services in the knowledge process and business 
process outsourcing sector. S&P Global Inc is the parent 
Company. Crisil has its registered office in Mumbai, India. 
We operate in India, China, Singapore, England, Poland, 
Argentina, Australia, and the United States of America, and 
have about 4,000 employees worldwide. Our global annual 
turnover is in excess of £36 million.
Our supply chains
Our supply chains include consultants, advisors, IT (hardware 
and software), and other office equipment suppliers, 
professional services from our lawyers, accountants and 
other advisers, security, catering, office cleaning and other 
office facilities services, staffing companies, etc. We require 
all of our suppliers to conduct business in a lawful and 
ethical manner as part of our supplier on-boarding process, 
and accept our trading terms and conditions.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern 
slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in 
any part of our business. Our Modern Slavery Act, 2015, 
policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with 
integrity in all our business relationships, and implementing 
and enforcing effective systems and controls, to ensure no 
slavery and human trafficking takes place in our supply 
chains.
Due-diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking 
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we have 
in place systems to: 
	•
Identify and assess potential risk areas in our 
supply chains 
	•
Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our 
supply chains 
	•
Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains 
	•
Protect whistleblowers 
	•
Where possible, build long-standing relationships with 
local suppliers and make clear our expectations of 
business behaviour
Supplier adherence to our values
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We 
ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply 
with our values and ethics.
Training
We provide training to our staff to ensure a high level of 
understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human 
trafficking in our supply chains and our business.
Our effectiveness in combating slavery and 
human trafficking
The Act is relatively new and very few companies, including 
Crisil entities, have experience of seeking out, let alone 
detecting, slavery or trafficking among their own staff or 
among their suppliers. To date, Crisil entities are yet to 
detect or suspect that any Crisil entities or suppliers employ 
persons who may be enslaved or trafficked. Therefore, 
key performance indicators can be set only in respect of 
reasonable due diligence efforts once experience of the 
initial outputs of such exercises are collated and analysed. 
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54(1) of the 
Modern Slavery Act, 2015, and constitutes our slavery and 
human trafficking statement.

Basis of our conclusion 
As part of the assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of assurance specialists performed assurance work for selected sites 
of Crisil. We carried out the following activities: 
BRSR Core Indicators – Reasonable level of Assurance 
Rest non-financial disclosures in BRSR Report – Limited Level of 
Assurance 
Reviewed the disclosures under BRSR Core, encompassing the 
framework for assurance consisting of a set of Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) under 9 ESG attributes. The Industry Standard on 
Reporting of BRSR Core used a basis of reasonable level of 
assurance. 
Reviewed the disclosures under BRSR reporting guidelines. Our 
focus included general disclosures, management processes, 
principle wise performance (essential indicators, and leadership 
indicators) and any other key metrics specified under the reporting 
framework. The BRSR reporting format used a basis of limited level 
of assurance. 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of key systems, 
processes and controls for collecting, managing and reporting the 
BRSR Core indicators. Assessment of operational control and 
reporting boundaries 
Understanding the key systems, processes and controls for 
collecting, managing and reporting the non-financial disclosures in 
BRSR report. Understand and test, on a sample basis to evaluate 
adherence to the reporting principles. 
Seek extensive evidence across all relevant areas, ensuring a 
detailed examination of BRSR Core indicators. Engaged directly with 
stakeholders to gather insights and corroborative evidence for each 
disclosed indicator. 
Collect and evaluate documentary evidence and management 
representations supporting adherence to the reporting principles. 
We adopted a risk-based approach, that is, we concentrated our 
assurance efforts on the issues of high material relevance to the 
Company’s business and its key stakeholders. 
DNV audit team conducted on-site audits for data testing and also, 
to assess the uniformity in reporting processes and also, quality 
checks at different locations of the Company. Sites for data testing 
and reporting system checks were selected based on the 
percentage contribution each site makes to the reported indicator, 
complexity of operations at each location (high/low/medium) and 
reporting system within the organization. Sites selected for audits 
are listed in Annexure II. 
 
DNV audit team conducted on-site audits for corporate offices and 
sites. Sample based assessment of site-specific data disclosures was 
carried out. We were free to choose sites for conducting our 
assessment. 
In both the cases, DNV teams conducted the: 
• 
Interviews with selected senior managers responsible for management of disclosures and review of selected evidence to 
support environmental KPIs and metrics disclosed the Report. We were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those 
with overall responsibility of monitoring, data collation and reporting the selected indicators.
