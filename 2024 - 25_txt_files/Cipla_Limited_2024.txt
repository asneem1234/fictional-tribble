Essential Indicators
Leadership Indicators

investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes 
to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity,

b. 	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced

Cipla has implemented procedures to ensure sustainable 
sourcing by embedding sustainability criteria into our 
comprehensive supply chain framework. This integration 
is facilitated through our Supply Chain Management 
Sustainability Policy, Responsible Sourcing Policy and 
Supplier Code of Conduct. We conduct thorough 
assessments of our suppliers based on ESG parameters 
and organise capacity-building workshops for our key 
suppliers. These suppliers are selected based on criteria 
such as their value, volume and dependency on our 
operations. For more detailed information regarding 
the assessments undertaken during the year to identify 
sustainably sourced products, please refer to page no. 
104 of the Relationship Capital section.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your 
products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) 
Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.  
	
As a pharmaceutical company, we do not participate in the 
reclamation or recycling of products at the end of their lifecycle. 
Nonetheless, we have established comprehensive waste 
management protocols throughout all our manufacturing 
facilities and warehouses. Products that remain unsold 
in the market and reach the end of their lifecycle for any 
reason are collected by our warehouses for secure disposal 
through incineration
4.	
Whether 
Extended 
Producer 
Responsibility 
(EPR) 
is 
applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted 
to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to 
address the same. 
	
Refer to page no. 125 of Natural Capital
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / 
Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing

Refer to page no. 125 of Natural Capital
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total 
material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry).  
	
Since we are in the pharmaceutical business, we do not 
recycle or reuse input material.18
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at the end of life 
of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused, recycled, and 
safely disposed, as per the following format:  
	
As a pharmaceutical company, Cipla does not reclaim 
products at the end of their life for reuse or recycling due to 
the nature of the industry. Instead, expired or unused products 
are retrieved from market and safely disposed of through 
incineration. We actively use recycled tertiary packaging 
materials sourced from our suppliers and ensure responsible 
management of plastic waste. This includes collecting and 
channelising rigid, flexible and multi-layered plastics in 
quantities equivalent to those used in our own packaging.
	
In FY 2024-25, we collected 1,992 metric tonnes of expired 
products for safe incineration and sent 274 metric tonnes of 
packaging material for recycling.
5.	
Reclaimed products and their packaging materials (as 
percentage of products sold) for each product category. 
	
As a pharmaceutical company, Cipla does not reclaim 
products at the end of their life for reuse or recycling, given 
regulatory and safety considerations. However, any reclaimed 
products are safely disposed of through incineration.
	
In FY 2024–25, 15% of our formulation products were reclaimed 
and safely disposed through incineration. Additionally, 100% 
of the equivalent quantity of pre and post consumer plastic 
waste generated from our packaging is collected through 
authorised waste management agencies and is either co-
processed, recycled, or converted into energy.19

A detailed framework and guidelines have been provided 
in Cipla's Business Continuity Plan guidance document to 
support Cipla’s business units and operations to respond, 
restore and check critical business processes when normal 
operations are disrupted. This document provides an overview 
of ongoing functions, describes an approach to supporting 
critical business functions and defines personal roles and 
responsibilities. It also outlines notification procedures and 
communication methods, protocols for activation deactivation 
plans, provisions for alternative workplaces/manufacturing/ 
product development and a plan for the maintenance and 
recovery of important records.
	
This document contains BCP guidelines to respond to outages 
caused by natural, technical and man-made events, as well as 
events that cause loss of access to parts or the entire facility 
or loss of service due to failure of equipment or systems. The 
effect of the above disruptive events can lead to the realisation 
of risks in main risk categories i.e. Environmental, health and 
safety (‘EHS’) and business/financial risks. The BCP guidelines 
provide a framework for addressing these EHS and business/
financial risks. BCP guidelines\apply to Cipla, its subsidiaries 
and affiliates. Additionally, every Cipla location has an on-site 
emergency response plan.
	
Furthermore, due to the variability of disruptions, from time 
to time, business functions may define specific business 
continuity/ risk mitigation plans which are taken with due 
consideration toward risks involved and are subject to cross-
functional deliberations and approvals.
