Identify potential sources of Hazard – Identify potential sources of harm (Hazard Identification).

standards, which uncover unsafe behaviours and conditions, driving continual improvement and optimizing risk levels.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices

Ans: Hospitals generate biomedical waste, as a by-product of healthcare services that can potentially pose serious health and 
environmental impacts if not handled correctly. At Shalby, we take this topic very seriously by putting in place an effective 
management system of healthcare waste which addresses the basic elements of waste minimization, segregation and 
identification by sorting into categories including medical, general, recycled and food waste. The company has achieved the 
reduction in generation of waste, raw material and other resources through various initiatives like environment awareness 
campaigns, training and monthly monitoring of hazardous & non- hazardous waste. We are not producing carbon but and at 
the same time, we have policy in place to dispose of bio medical waste in accordance with the guideline of the government 
and to ensure minimum generation of radiation within the hospital.
