Energy 
Management
Opportunity Metal 
product 
manufacturing, 
especially 
processes such as melting, moulding, heat 
treatment, and machining, requires significant 
energy input, making it inherently energy-intensive. 
At AIA Engineering, we recognise the critical 
importance of managing energy consumption 
efficiently, both from an environmental and 
operational standpoint.
Additionally, we view energy efficiency not just as 
a sustainability imperative but also as a key lever 
for enhancing cost-effectiveness. By optimising 
energy use across our value chain, we are able 
to reduce our overall energy footprint while 
simultaneously improving production economics. 
We have implemented structured energy management practices that 
focus on improving equipment efficiency, reducing process-level 
energy wastage, and transitioning towards cleaner energy sources. 
These ongoing efforts are central to our strategy for reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our operations. 
- Our major initiatives include the installation of 11 Wind Energy 
Turbines + 3 Hybrid (Wind + Solar energy) at the Kutch and 
Jamjodhpur sites, which have an installed capacity of 37.38 MW 
(31.80 MW Windmill + 5.58 MW Solar) of renewable energy. 
- We are proud to share that we have already exceeded the 2027 
electricity target, and currently approximately 29% of our overall 
electricty requirements are supported by Renewable sources. 
In addition to lowering our environmental footprint, these measures 
also contribute to improved cost efficiency.

Through regular energy audits, equipment upgrades, and process 
optimisation, we have been able to achieve measurable improvements 
in our specific energy consumption. This directly supports our broader 
climate strategy by curbing greenhouse gas emissions associated 
with energy use.
Our approach integrates both technological interventions and 
behavioral improvements on the shop floor, aligning with our long-
term goal of building a more energy-resilient and environmentally 
responsible manufacturing ecosystem.
4
Training And 
Development
Opportunity Every employee, whether new or experienced, 
undergoes structured training modules covering 
equipment operation, safety protocols, site 
orientation, and emergency response procedures. 
These programmes are continuously updated to 
reflect the latest industry standards, regulatory 
requirements, and technological advancements.
- Beyond safety and operational training, we are 
committed to building a future-ready workforce. 
We 
regularly 
conduct 
skill 
enhancement 
workshops, 
technical 
upskilling 
sessions, 
leadership 
development 
programmes, 
and 
knowledge-sharing forums. We ensure that all 
our employees remain aligned with evolving 
industry best practices.
- Our comprehensive approach not only ensures 
smooth plant operations but also supports 
long-term business growth, fosters individual 
development, and enhances career progression 
opportunities. Training and development are the 
embedded practices that define our commitment 
to excellence.

Materials 
Sourcing
Risk
As a manufacturer of engineered metal products, 
we are highly dependent on the uninterrupted 
supply of quality raw materials such as metal 
scrap and alloys. Any fluctuation in raw material 
availability, 
pricing 
volatility, 
supply 
chain 
disruption, or inconsistency in material quality can 
have a direct impact on our production efficiency, 
cost structure, and delivery commitments.
Given its criticality to our operations, we have established a structured 
vendor classification system based on the nature of products and 
services provided. Each vendor is evaluated against a defined set 
of performance parameters to ensure supply chain stability and 
reliability.
- To strengthen our procurement risk management framework, we 
conduct periodic assessments of critical vendors. This allows us 
to proactively identify vulnerabilities and take corrective actions to 
avoid potential disruptions.
- Beginning this year, we have further enhanced our vendor evaluation 
process by integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) 
parameters into our assessments. These include factors such as 
regulatory compliance, ethical practices, environmental performance, 
and social responsibility. Insights from these assessments are now 
being incorporated into procurement decision-making to promote 
responsible sourcing and build a more resilient and sustainable 
supply chain.
Negative

Local 
Communities
Opportunity Our manufacturing units are primarily situated in 
rural and industrial areas, and we acknowledge 
our responsibility towards the communities 
around us. We are dedicated to making a positive 
impact through targeted community engagement 
initiatives under CSR, which encompass education, 
healthcare, and livelihood development. We aim 
to build lasting, meaningful relationships with 
local communities near our manufacturing areas, 
ensuring that our growth is inclusive and aligned 
with broader social development objectives.

Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions
Risk
AIA Engineering operates in an energy-intensive 
manufacturing sector, with large-scale operations 
that primarily depend on non-renewable fuel 
sources. This reliance significantly contributes 
to our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making 
emissions management a critical environmental 
and operational concern.
We have implemented structured energy management practices that 
focus on improving equipment efficiency, reducing process-level 
energy wastage, and transitioning towards cleaner energy sources. 
These ongoing efforts are central to our strategy for reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our operations. 
- Our major initiatives include the installation of 11 Wind Energy

Air Quality
Risk
As a manufacturing company operating in an 
emission-intensive sector, we recognise that our 
operations, if not properly controlled, have the 
potential to contribute to air pollution through 
fugitive 
emissions, 
process 
exhaust, 
and 
combustion-related discharges.
We are conscious of the ecosystem and communities in which we 
operate. AIA Engineering proactively invested in air filtration and 
emission monitoring infrastructure to ensure that our manufacturing 
activities do not adversely impact ambient air quality.
Air emissions from our operations are routinely monitored by 
accredited third-party agencies, and all parameters consistently 
remain well within the regulatory limits prescribed by environmental 
authorities. To further strengthen our monitoring capabilities, we have 
implemented online continuous stack monitoring systems (OCEMS) 
for stacks classified as critical, enabling real-time tracking and control 
of key air pollutants.
Negative
9
Waste 
Management
Risk
As part of our manufacturing operations, a 
considerable volume of waste, both hazardous 
and 
non-hazardous, 
is 
generated 
across 
various stages of production. Recognising the 
environmental implications of industrial waste, 
we have identified this topic as material. 
Our goal is to reduce the amount of waste we produce and make 
sure that it is reused or recycled for the same or a different purpose. 
A ‘waste hierarchical approach’ is applied, to reduce, reuse, recycle 
and recover waste products in preference to disposal of waste in 
alignment with the circular economy. Where possible, we explore 
opportunities for use of recycled material and reuse of waste by us or 
other companies through co-processing of foundry waste and other 
waste as alternative raw material or fuel. It presents opportunities 
for environmental stewardship and helps us manage raw material 
well. The Company takes waste management seriously and works 
towards reducing, reusing, and recycling its waste wherever possible. 
We optimise the use of key resources, including minerals and ensure 
waste minimisation at sources and facilitate recovery, and recycling. 
We follow waste management standards that meet or exceed 
applicable legal requirements and we incorporate industry best 
practices into our operations and services. We recognise the negative 
impact of improper waste disposal on the environment and as a result, 
put in place strong mechanisms to treat and dispose of the generated 
waste. We ensure that all waste from our activities is either remelted 
in the furnace or recycled through authorised recyclers and vendors, 
in line with the principles of a circular economy.

Water and 
Effluent 
Management 
Opportunity Water is a critical input for our manufacturing 
operations, and we recognise its importance 
both as an operational necessity and a 
shared 
environmental 
resource. 
Given 
our 
high dependency on water, AIA Engineering is 
committed to responsible water management 
across all our facilities.
All our operational units are equipped with fully 
functional Sewage Treatment Systems (STPs), 
enabling us to treat domestic waste water and 
recycle 100% of it. We operate under a 100% Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) framework, ensuring that 
no treated or untreated wastewater is released 
into the environment. This closed-loop system 
supports our commitment to water circularity and 
reduces the burden on freshwater resources.
In addition to operational efficiency, we actively 
invest in water conservation and replenishment 
projects. These include the implementation of 
rainwater harvesting systems within our plants, 
and the construction of groundwater recharge 
wells not only within our premises but also 
in surrounding communities. These recharge 
structures contribute to replenishing aquifers, 
enhancing local water tables, and improving long-
term water availability for both the Company and 
nearby communities.

Anti-Corruption
Risk
At AIA Engineering, we take a firm stand

this by promoting a culture of integrity and 
accountability. Clear policies, regular internal 
checks, and awareness among employees help us 
stay aligned with legal and ethical expectations. 
Everyone associated with us is expected to follow 
our Code of Conduct and act transparently in all 
business dealings.
We have instituted well-defined policies applicable to all internal 
and external stakeholders, outlining expectations around ethical 
conduct, transparency, and professional integrity. These policies 
are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors as part of our 
governance oversight. Non-compliance with these provisions may 
lead to disciplinary action, depending on the severity and nature of 
the violation.

Employment 
Factors
Opportunity At AIA Engineering, employment is not merely 
about staffing roles, it is about fostering long-
term associations. We value our people and 
operate with a clear purpose: to grow together. 
In turn, we invest in their development and well-
being. Our consistently low attrition rate, along 
with the fact that a majority of our team members 
have been with us for over a decade, reflects the 
trust, stability, and inclusive culture we have built 
over the years.
Given its direct impact on organisational 
continuity, workforce morale, and social well-
being, employment is considered a material topic 
for us under the social pillar of sustainability.

Statement by director 
responsible for the 
business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement 
of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders, 
As a member of the Board of Directors responsible for our Business Responsibility 
& Sustainability Report, I am pleased to share our progress and outlook for the 
coming year. Our commitment to providing optimised solutions through the 
technical evaluation of our customers’ requirements remains steadfast. By offering 
specifically designed solutions in ideal metallurgy and process optimisation services 
globally, we continue to lead in Quality, Services, and Innovation within our field. Our 
reputation for providing global solutions to local requirements is unmatched.
ESG: A Business Necessity
The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our 
operations is now embedded as a core business imperative. 
Over the past year, we have taken decisive steps to strengthen our sustainability 
performance, guided by a robust ESG governance framework. Our most significant 
progress has been in environmental impact reduction. We are proud to have 
surpassed our renewable energy target ahead of schedule; achieving 29.3% of 
our total electricity consumption through clean energy sources. This milestone 
reaffirms our commitment to energy transition and emissions reduction. In parallel, 
we have made strong headway in reducing plastic waste, having eliminated single-
use plastics from packaging and initiated similar transitions across our facilities 
and corporate houses. Circularity is another area where we are actively innovating. 
Through our sustainable materials initiative, we have produced bricks and paver 
blocks using discarded sand, dust, and plastic, converting waste into value. The 
Company has integrated mechanical and thermal reclaimers to recycle its moulding 
sand, reducing the requirement for silica sand by 80%. We also collaborated 
with our value chain partners to co-process our waste silica sand from foundry 
operations in cement kilns. We are constantly working towards making our products 
more sustainable. These efforts will continue to scale in the years ahead. We are 
also working closely with critical vendors to drive responsible practices through 
structured assessments and ongoing engagement. While the journey is gradual, we 
are deeply committed to building a more inclusive and sustainable value chain. 
We continue to place strong emphasis on the social and governance dimensions 
of our ESG strategy. Our workforce is supported through comprehensive benefits, 
ongoing dialogue, and a robust health and safety framework that ensures a secure 
and enabling work environment. Customer satisfaction remains central to our 
ethos, currently at a strong ~98% with focussed efforts underway to enhance this 
further. From a governance perspective, the Board is actively driving transformative 
decisions aimed at operational excellence and long-term value creation. This 
includes strategic investments in advanced machinery, automated systems, energy-
efficient technologies, capital infrastructure, and the transition to cleaner fuels and 
greener transportation. We are also expanding our commitment to afforestation and 
ecological restoration as part of our broader environmental agenda. This fiscal year, 
we also collaborated with universities to foster innovation and R&D through joint 
projects. Furthermore, we also established the Skill Development Centre at GPERI, 
Mehsana, (Gujarat Technological University - AIA Foundry) to enhance industry-
readiness among youth. Across all these fronts, specific actions are being taken to 
embed sustainability more deeply and systematically into the fabric of our business. 
Thank you.

Remarks: Currently, there is no process in place for reclaiming products for reuse, recycling, or disposal. However, our products 
and their packaging materials can be reused and recycled as follows:
-	
Our alloy steel castings (Grinding Media and Castings) are fully recyclable by melting at the end of their life cycle.
-	
The packaging materials for our products, such as HDPE bags and MS drums, are recyclable after use.
-

EI-9.	Indicate if any independent assessment/evaluation/assurance for Waste has been conducted by an external agency. If 
Yes, provide the name of the agency: 
Yes. Shailesh Haribhakti & Associates.
EI-10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
At our establishment, we prioritise waste reduction, reuse, and recycling in accordance with a waste hierarchy approach, aligning 
closely with the principles of the circular economy. Our strategies include:
1.	
Reducing Waste Generation: We optimise the use of resources, including minerals, to minimise waste at its origin.
2.	
Reuse and Recycling: We actively seek opportunities to reuse waste both internally and externally, such as by utilising 
foundry waste and other materials as alternative raw materials or fuel through co-processing.
3.	
Regulatory Compliance and Best Practices: We go beyond legal waste management requirements by adopting industry-
leading best practices.
4.	
Environmental Stewardship: Recognising the environmental consequences of improper waste disposal, we employ robust 
mechanisms for waste treatment and disposal.
Annual Report 2024-25

Specific Practices:
Eco-friendly Brick Production:
Foundry waste materials, such 
as sand and plastics are used to 
manufacture eco-friendly bricks and 
paver blocks. This year, ~170 MT of 
waste was utilised to produce over 
55,000 bricks and blocks.
Waste Sand Recycling:
The 
Company 
has 
integrated 
mechanical and thermal reclaimers 
to recycle its moulding sand, 
reducing the requirement for silica 
sand by 80%. The waste sand 
generated is used in co-processing 
in cement kilns and for making 
bricks and paver blocks.
Non-Hazardous Waste 
Management:
Our practices for managing non-
hazardous waste include:
1.	
Internal and external recycling 
of materials such as silica 
sand, 
slag, 
and 
refractory 
waste 
for 
applications 
like 
co-processing, 
brick 
manufacturing, 
and 
metal 
recovery.
2	
Sale of commercial waste 
materials like paper, wood, and 
rubber to designated vendors 
for further processing or reuse. 
Our waste management policies 
and practices are detailed in our 
Waste 
Management 
Circular 
Economy Policy, underscoring our 
commitment to sustainability and 
environmental responsibility.
Hazardous Waste Management:
We promote a circular economy by prioritising the reuse and recycling of 
hazardous waste to minimise environmental impact. Our practices include:
1.	
Partnerships with authorised facilities for decontamination, recycling, and 
disposal of hazardous waste components like containers, oils, e-waste, 
batteries, and biomedical waste.
2.	
Ensuring that all hazardous waste is transported in registered vehicles 
and disposed of in full compliance with regulatory norms.
3.	
Giving preference to co-processing and recycling over TSDF (Treatment, 
Storage, and Disposal Facility) or incineration, wherever possible.
4.	
Maintaining an MoU with an SPCB-approved decontamination unit for 
container reuse and recycling of liners and plastic bags.
5.	
Selling used/waste oil, e-waste, and batteries exclusively to registered 
authorised recyclers.
6.	
Disposing biomedical waste from the Occupational Health Centre (OHC) 
through authorised biomedical waste incineration facilities.
7.	
Managing oily sludge and other oil-containing residues through SPCB-
approved CHWIF (Common Hazardous Waste Incineration Facility).
Co-processing of Waste Silica 
Sand:
We collaborated with our value chain 
partners to co-process waste silica 
sand from foundry operations in 
cement kilns. In 2024–25, 1,085.21 
MT of silica sand was repurposed 
through this method, ensuring both 
environmental 
compliance 
and 
sustainable waste disposal.
Slag Reprocessing:
Slag is reprocessed at our in-
house slag processing facility to 
recover metal for reuse in foundry 
operations.
- In 2024–25: 10,620.5 tonnes of 
slag 
processed, 
yielding 
885.3 
tonnes of recovered metal.
Organic Waste Utilisation: 
We convert kitchen and canteen 
waste 
into 
organic 
manure 
through a combination of in-house 
composting systems and external 
waste management partners. In 
2024–25, around 61 MT of organic 
waste was successfully processed 
into manure. Thus, supporting our 
commitment to sustainable waste 
management and circular resource 
use.

The current global environment poses severe cybersecurity 
threats of various kinds, such as ransomware, hacking, 
malware, and spoofing, among others. The Company has 
implemented several mitigation programmes; however, the 
continuous development of new cyber threats remains a 
concern.
It is not possible to fully secure the system due to limitations 
in knowledge about emerging viruses and cyber-attack 
techniques. The Company mitigates these risks to the 
extent possible. A disaster recovery mechanism has been 
established, enabling traffic to be redirected to the disaster 
recovery server (secondary server) to ensure uninterrupted 
operations.
Each quarter, the IT team conducts a Disaster Recovery (DR) 
drill, and the results have been satisfactory.

applicable environmental and social regulations within their 
respective jurisdictions. Additionally, we reviewed whether 
partners had implemented ISO-certified management 
systems, such as ISO 14001 for Environmental Management 
and ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety. While 
direct environmental impact assessments were not

Essential Indicators
Customer Feedback Management:
We continuously gather and utilise feedback from 
customers to align with their requirements. Our 
process efficiently manages customer complaints 
regarding products and services. Typically, complaints 
are first received by the respective field engineer and 
then escalated to the Quality Assurance Controller 
for thorough investigation. When feasible, samples 
are collected and analysed to determine the causes 
of issues. Root cause analyses are conducted for 
all complaints, and corrective actions are promptly 
implemented. Resolutions are communicated back 
to customers through our field engineers, ensuring 
customer satisfaction.
Measuring Customer Satisfaction:
We have implemented a robust system to monitor 
customer perceptions of our products. Feedback is 
systematically collected to cover various aspects 
of our operations. Key attributes evaluated include 
delivery timelines, product performance, and aftersales 
service. Customer satisfaction levels are graded on a 
scale from 1 to 4. Using a weighted average method, 
we compute the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) 
annually. For the latest reporting period, our CSI score 
stood at 97.6%.

While our products are inherently safe, we take additional steps to promote responsible usage. We provide handling guidelines 
as needed and share Safety Data Sheets (SDS) upon request along with the consignment, ensuring customers have access to 
essential safety information.
LI-3. Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services

relating to the major products / services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? 
(Yes/No)
Our product packaging includes essential customer information like dimension and weight, among others. As our products, like 
grinding media in ball form and other alloy mill castings, are mechanical components made of metallic materials, they inherently 
pose no hazards in their original form. Therefore, they do not necessitate special handling or storage requirements. However, 
we provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) with consignments upon customer request. We actively conduct customer satisfaction 
surveys to ensure continuous improvement.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires 
the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make 
determinations about the relevancy of information to 
be included, and make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported information. Measurement of certain 
amounts and BRSR metrics, some of which are estimates, 
is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, 
for example Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions, water 
footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce 
the uncertainty in the amount and metrics.
SUMMARY OF THE WORK WE PERFORMED AS THE 
BASIS FOR OUR OPINION/CONCLUSION

professional scepticism throughout the engagement. We 
designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
