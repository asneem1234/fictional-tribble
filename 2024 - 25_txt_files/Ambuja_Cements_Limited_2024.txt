1.
Water 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Water being a shared resource, 
it is essential for business to use it in a 
responsible way. These risks comprise 
conflicts with local communities and 
stakeholders over water rights and 
usage, potential water scarcity or 
quality issues due to over-extraction or 
pollution, and regulatory constraints on 
water abstraction permits or discharge 
standards.
Opportunity – By demonstrating 
commitment to conserving water 
resources, we can build stronger 
relationships with local communities 
and government. This will help us in 
securing and maintaining social license 
to operate, especially in water-stressed 
regions. In future, the company may 
qualify for government incentives aimed 
at promoting water conservation and 
sustainability initiatives.
We have been 
investing in rainwater 
harvesting initiatives, 
restoring village 
ponds, construction 
of check dams, water 
conservation at closed 
mines and groundwater 
recharge for a long 
time to mitigate the 
risk of lack of water. As 
a result, the company 
is now water positive. 
The company uses more 
than 50 % of its water 
requirements in cement 
manufacturing from 
harvested rain water.
Negative/
Positive
2.
Air quality
Risk
Exposure to dust, Sox, Nox and other 
pollutants from cement plants can lead 
to respiratory issues among employees 
and nearby communities. This may lead 
to increased costs associated with 
healthcare for affected employees, and 
insurance premiums. The company may 
also face opposition, protests and even 
legal restrictions on its operations.
We focus on 
improving air quality 
in the surrounding 
environment. We 
monitor the plants’ stack 
emissions through the 
Continuous Emission 
Monitoring System. We 
work on upgradation 
of electrostatic 
precipitators and 
replacement of damaged 
bags to control dust 
emissions.  We take 
primary and secondary 
measures to control 
NOx emissions.

3.
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity Circular economy offers great opportunity 
to lower the use of natural resources and 
fossil fuels in cement production and 
reduces carbon emissions.
_
Positive
4.
Climate and 
Energy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Climate change poses multiple 
physical risks like flooding, temperature 
rise, water stress etc. Emerging and 
potential regulations may introduce or 
escalate regulatory risks. These extreme 
weather events can cause infrastructure 
damage, may hinder the supply chain 
network affecting timely delivery of raw 
materials and finished products. It may 
also cause power outages and affect the 
manufacturing processes.
Opportunity – Energy cost is a major 
cost in cement manufacturing. We 
continuously strive to reduce our specific 
thermal energy consumption and 
specific electrical energy consumption 
to optimise our energy costs. In addition, 
it is directly related to carbon emissions 
and by optimising energy consumption, 
we can lower our carbon emissions.
The Company has 
approximately 78% of 
products in its portfolio 
which are blended 
products with lower 
carbon footprint.
Further, we are investing 
more and more in 
renewal energy and 
green energy from 
WHRS. In addition, we 
have set ambitious 
targets for Thermal 
Substitution Rates (TSR) 
by using alternate fuels.
Negative/
Positive
5.
Biodiversity
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Land disturbance and habitat 
fragmentation from operational activities 
can lead to biodiversity degradation. 
Opportunity – Restored ecosystems 
can provide long-term environmental 
benefits, including enhanced ecosystem 
services such as water filtration, carbon 
sequestration, and soil preservation. 
These benefits not only contribute to 
global environmental goals but also can 
have positive economic implications for 
the company and local communities in 
the long run.
We adhere to Indian 
national regulations 
and are a signatory 
to the India Business 
and Biodiversity 
Initiative (IBBI) of the 
Confederation of Indian 
Industry (CII), and 
Deutsche Gesellschaft 
für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). 
We assess the impacts 
on biodiversity and 
ecosystem services 
through set KPIs. This 
helps in conservation 
of ecosystem.

Sustainable 
Construction
Opportunity Intervention of sustainable practices 
and technologies such as substitute 
cementitious materials, CO2 capture 
in the built environment, and efficient 
concrete use help drive down carbon 
emissions from cement production 
and hence help to reduce the carbon 
footprint.
_
Positive
7.
Human 
Capital 
Development
Opportunity Through continuous learning and 
development and strengthened 
employee relations, we can mitigate 
succession planning risks, address skills 
gaps and ensure continuity of leadership 
and expertise. It will also help in being 
competitive in the marketplace and 
stay ahead of trends. Human Capital 
development will also contribute 
to an overall learning culture in the 
organisation.
_
Positive
8.
Diversity 
and 
Inclusion
Opportunity Employee diversity leads to increased 
creativity and innovation, improved 
communication and teamwork, and a 
greater understanding and appreciation 
of different cultures. Additionally, a 
diverse workforce can help to attract 
and retain top talent and can provide a 
competitive advantage for organisations. 
_
Positive
9.
Human 
Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Concerns related to child/forced 
labour, discrimination or any other 
human rights-related aspects within 
the workforce and value chain may 
lead to statutory violations which may 
negatively impact the brand image.
Opportunity – Alignment with the 
human rights principles and procedures 
safeguard the employees and value 
chain partners and ensure zero incidents 
of non-compliance  with regards to 
International and National Human Rights 
Standards and Regulations.
We are committed 
to respecting and 
promoting human rights 
across the value chain 
by inculcating a human 
rights policy. The policy 
is in line with The 
Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, Social 
Accountability 8000 
(SA8000) Standard and 
International Treaties & 
Conventions related to 
Human Rights.

10.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Failure to protect workers from 
occupational hazards can result in 
legal action, fines, and compensation 
claims against the company. These 
risks can lead to significant financial 
liabilities and damage the company's 
reputation. Also, potential employees 
may hesitate from joining the company, 
and current employees may leave if they 
perceive their health and safety are 
not adequately protected, leading to 
challenges in attracting and retaining a 
skilled workforce.
Opportunity – By prioritising the well-
being of all employees and workers, 
the company can enhance its employer 
brand, making it a more attractive 
place to work. Employees are more 
likely to join and stay with a company 
that prioritises their well-being, leading 
to lower turnover rates and higher 
employee satisfaction.
We have developed 
safety initiatives 
including competency 
development, training, 
audits, inspections, 
surveys, We Care 
initiatives, Critical 
Control Management 
to prevent unwanted 
events, and especial 
cross-functional teams 
to drive process safety. 
Also, we  conduct 
safety audits across our 
manufacturing sites to 
ensure that the actions 
are timely closed and 
implemented.
Negative/
Positive
11.
Community 
Relations
Opportunity Uplifting livelihood opportunities 
improves community relations which is 
essential for the social license to operate. 
Also, a healthy community will ensure 
availability of strong local labour force, if 
required at any given point of time.
_
Positive
12.
Customer 
Relationship 
Management
Opportunity CRM empowers to build a positive 
customer experience based on relevant, 
real-time information and customer needs 
that matters to the business. It would 
enable data driven decision making, 
improved customer experience and hence 
drive growth in business by increasing 
loyalty and enhancing relations.

Governance

stakeholders and creates long-term 
value for them.

Risk 
Management
Opportunity Enhanced Risk awareness and in-place 
emergency preparedness plans help to

to climate change, regulations, sustained 
supply of raw material, funds, etc. and 
geopolitical developments. This helps to 
stay one step ahead and ensure business 
continuity and regulatory resilience.
_
Positive
15.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk – Improper usage of resources, 
human rights violations, non-compliance 
with Supplier Code of Conduct, zero 
adoption of sustainable practices by 
suppliers can adversely impact the 
environment, social wellbeing, value 
chain and brand image. Additionally, it 
might also lead to cases of regulatory 
non-compliances and fines.
Opportunity – The company can 
leverage suppliers near operations 
to reduce costs, for greater control, 
quicker response and helps in cutting 
down significant emissions related to 
transportation.
Supply chain and 
sourcing process has 
a direct impact on 
the environment and 
communities such as 
emissions, circular 
economy, water usage, 
biodiversity, material 
usage and human rights. 
We have taken measures 
to ensure an optimum 
supply chain with 
competent suppliers. 
Negative/
Positive
16.
Information 
technology 
and data 
privacy
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk – Instances of information security 
breaches could lead to loss of sensitive 
data of customers including personal 
information. It could also lead to 
increased media scrutiny resulting in 
a loss of stakeholder trust, company 
reputation and regulatory fines or 
penalties.
Opportunity – In the ever-evolving 
landscape of digitalisation and innovation, 
monitoring and analysis of data in real 
time would lead to quicker identification 
and resolution of issues. As a result, this 
will ensure management of systems and 
processes more effectively. 
With increased 
digitisation, and 
heavy dependence on 
technology systems, 
it has become critical 
for us to ensure 
implementation of SOPs 
and policies, conduction 
periodic internal and 
external (third-party) 
audits and tests to check 
the resilience of the 
IT infrastructure from 
hackers, cyber-attacks, 
malware etc.

environmental sustainability and responsible resource 
management. Further, with an aim to arrest the 
pressing issue of deforestation, we planted 108256 
trees during the year under review, as part of our 
commitment to grow 2.4 million trees by 2030.
Beyond our core business, we have made a significant

Many corrective actions are being taken to implement learning from safety related incidents. Traffic flow has 
been improved, and pedestrian walkways have been designated to minimise the risk of man-machine interaction. 
Load securing procedures have been strengthened through driver training, regular inspections, and the enforcement 
of mandatory pre-trip checks. Robust fall protection systems, including guardrails, safety nets, and the provision of 
appropriate personal protective equipment, have been installed and regularly inspected. Electrical safety has been 
significantly improved through the implementation of a comprehensive program encompassing LOTOTO (lockout 
/ tagout / tryout) procedures, arc flash hazard assessments, and regular equipment inspections, coupled with 
mandatory training for all electrical workers. Furthermore, structural integrity has been enhanced by strengthening 
roofs with cyclonic plates and securing loose sheets. Floor openings have been secured to prevent accidental falls. 
Toppling abatement systems have been implemented for tipper trucks and dumpers to minimise the risk of vehicle 
rollovers. These proactive measures, combined with ongoing monitoring, regular safety audits, and continuous 
employee training, aim to create a safer and more secure working environment for all employees.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The successful involvement of our stakeholders is essential to the achievement of our strategic goals because 
it provides us with the opportunity to understand their expectations, respond to their concerns, and assist us 
in prioritising the areas in which we should be concentrating our efforts. Our mechanism for engaging with 
stakeholders is governed by our Stakeholder Engagement Policy (https://www.ambujacement.com/Upload/PDF/
Ambuja-Stakeholder-Engagement-policy-18-oct.pdf), which is further aligned with global best practises.
	
Ambuja identifies its stakeholders as groups and individuals, who can influence or / are impacted by our 
operations / activities, change in technology, regulations, market and societal trends either directly or indirectly. 
Stakeholders comprise of communities, employees, supply chain partners, customers, investors, regulators, industrial 
organisations etc.
	
Against each group, the potential ways in which stakeholders will be affected as well as the magnitude of both the 
actual and perceived impacts have been determined. This assists the company in developing a bespoke plan for 
engaging with stakeholders, which can then be kept up to date as and when is necessary.
	
Throughout the course of the year, we maintain ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders by utilising a variety of 
channels of contact. The insights that we gain from these projects are tremendously helpful, because they allow us 
to continually enhance both our strategy and our operations. The process of engaging stakeholders also includes 
regular feedback and grievance redressal methods, both of which are vital components of the process.

with respect to disclosures. TUVI has verified the disclosures and assessed the robustness of the underlying 
data management system, information flows, and controls. In doing so:  
a) TUVI examined and reviewed the documents, data, and other information made available by ACL for 
non-financial Section A and B,  09 BRSR principles covering Essential and Leadership Indicators and 09 attributes 
as per Annexure I - Format of BRSR Core (non-financial disclosures) 
b) TUVI conducted interviews with key representatives, including data owners and decision-makers from 
different functions of ACL 
c) TUVI performed sample-based reviews of the mechanisms for implementing the sustainability-related 
policies and data management (qualitative and qualitative) 
d) TUVI reviewed the adherence to reporting requirements of "BRSR”
