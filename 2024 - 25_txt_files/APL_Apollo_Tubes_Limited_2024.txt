which are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
We are independent from the entity in accordance with the 
requirements of independence and quality assurance set out 
in BRSR provisions and professional pronouncements and have 
fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance 
with these requirements.
Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption that 
the data and information provided by the company to us as 
part of our review have been provided in good faith and free 
from material misstatements. We were not involved in the 
preparation of any statements or data included in the Report 
except for Assurance Statement. Our firm applies International 
Standard on Quality Management and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. We apply SQC 1 for quality control in 
assurance and related services.
REASONABLE ASSURANCE
A reasonable assurance engagement includes identifying and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information, whether due to fraud or error, 
and responding to the assessed risks as required by the 
circumstances.
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of 
sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed the disclosures 
presented within the Report and referenced information, 
and sampled the disclosures and were reviewed through the 
company’s customised sustainability information management 
system.
The procedures conducted were based on professional 
judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluation of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical 
procedures, and reconciliation with underlying records. 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in executing the

information and related disclosures;
	
Acquired knowledge of the assessment criteria and 
assessed their adequacy for evaluating and/or measuring 
the identified sustainability information;
	
Conducted inquiries with Company’s management, 
including the environment team, compliance team, 
human resources team, and other relevant personnel 
responsible for preparing the Report;
	
Developed an understanding and performed an 
evaluation of the design of key systems, processes, and 
controls for recording, processing, and reporting the 
identified sustainability information at the corporate 
office and other locations.

material misstatement in the identified sustainability 
information, we determined the nature, timing, and 
extent of further procedures.
	
We tested the Company’s process for compiling 
sustainability information by comparing or reconciling it 
with the underlying records.
	
We verified the consolidation of data from various plants 
and offices on a sample basis within the reporting boundary 
to ensure the completeness of the reported data.
We believe that the evidence we have gathered is both sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance 
opinion.
OUR RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
conclusion on the identified sustainability indicators, based 
on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we 
have obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance 
with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements 
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 
(‘ISAE 3000’), and the terms of reference for this engagement 
as agreed with the Company. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject 
Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to 
issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures 
selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of 
the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
REASONABLE ASSURANCE OPINION
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the company’s identified sustainability 
criteria as per BRSR core framework for the financial year ended 
31st March 2025 are not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
By optimizing energy usage and 
investing in renewable energy 
sources, APL Apollo can reduce 
operational costs and improve 
efficiency. Implementing energy 
efficient technologies and 
processes not only reduces carbon 
footprint but also aligns with 
evolving consumer preferences for 
sustainable products. Additionally, 
it can enhance APL Apollo’s brand 
image and attract environmentally 
conscious investors and customers. 
By the year 2025, APL Apollo aims 
to ensure that all its plants have 
access to renewable energy.
Currently, 73% of the plants already 
have this access. In FY25, there was 
an overall increase in the renewable 
electricity from 28% (in FY24) to 
31% (in FY25), despite the addition 
of two new plants (New Raipur and 
Dubai), which rely solely on the 
respective national grids. Excluding 
the new plants, the overall 
renewable electricity is 52%.

Positive
Water & 
Effluent 
Management
Risk
Inadequate water management 
practices could result in increased 
operational costs, regulatory fines 
for non-compliance with water 
quality standards, and reputational 
damage due to environmental 
impacts such as pollution or water 
resource depletion. Additionally, 
improper effluent management 
poses risks of contaminating local 
water sources, leading to legal 
liabilities and community backlash.
Optimize water use, treat 
effluents, and implement water 
recycling/reuse systems.
APL Apollo plans to equip all 
its plants with Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) facilities. 
So far, 63% of the plants are 
equipped with ZLD.
Negative
Emissions 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk
Failure to control emissions 
can lead to regulatory fines and 
penalties, causing financial losses 
and reputational damage.
Additionally increased stakeholder 
scrutiny, from customers, 
investors, and regulatory bodies, 
heightens the risk, potentially 
resulting in legal action against 
non-compliant companies.
Monitor emissions and comply 
with emission standards. 
Additionally, APL Apollo has 
adopted a net-zero emissions 
target for 2050, aligning with 
the Science Based Targets 
Initiative.

(Indicate positive

Opportunity
By implementing emission 
reduction measures and adopting 
cleaner technologies, APL Apollo 
can enhance its environmental 
performance and reputation as a 
sustainable industry leader, this 
will in turn increase its access to 
both domestic and international 
markets.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Improper disposal of waste 
materials can lead to soil and 
water contamination, causing 
harm to ecosystems and local 
communities. Moreover, inefficient 
waste management may result in 
increased operational costs due to 
disposal fees and potential legal 
liabilities.
Reduce, reuse, and recycle 
waste; implement proper 
disposal methods. At APL 
Apollo, majority of the waste 
is disposed of as scrap and the 
remainder is repurposed within 
the business operations.
Additionally, any hazardous 
waste produced within the 
plant’s vicinity is disposed via 
authorized vendors.
Negative
Environmental 
Compliance
Risk
Non-compliance with 
environmental regulations can 
result in substantial financial 
penalties, legal liabilities, and 
reputational damage.
Stay updated with regulations, 
conduct regular compliance 
audits, and invest in training 
and awareness programs.
Negative
Health & 
Safety
Risk
1.  Workplace Accidents and 
Injuries: Inadequate health and 
safety measures can result in 
workplace accidents, injuries, and 
fatalities, leading to increased 
insurance costs, compensation 
claims, and loss of productivity.
2.  Reputational Damage: Poor 
health and safety practices can 
damage the company’s reputation, 
leading to loss of customer trust, 
stakeholder confidence, and 
increasing the company’s inability 
to attract and retain talent.
1. Risk Assessment: Identify 
hazards, assess risks, and 
implement controls to mitigate 
them.
2. Training and Awareness: 
Provide health and safety 
training to employees and raise 
awareness of potential risks.

human rights, diversity, and equal 
opportunity principles can result in 
legal action, fines, and reputational 
damage.
2. Reputation Damage: Violations 
of human rights or lack of diversity

3. Employee Relations: 
Discrimination or lack of diversity 
and equal opportunity can lead 
to employee dissatisfaction, low 
morale, and higher turnover rates.

2. Raise awareness about 
the importance of human

Relation
Risk
1. Work Stoppage: Labour 
disputes, strikes, or other forms 
of industrial action can disrupt 
operations, leading to financial 
losses and damage to reputation.
2. Legal and Regulatory 
Compliance: Failure to comply 
with labour laws and regulations 
can result in fines, penalties, 
and legal action. Adverse labour 
relations can result in legal costs 
associated with resolving disputes.
3. Employee Turnover: Poor 
labour relations can contribute to 
higher turnover rates, leading to 
recruitment and training costs and 
loss of institutional knowledge. 
Poor relations with employees 
can lead to decreased motivation, 
absenteeism, and reduced 
productivity.

communication channels 
between management 
and employees to address 
grievances promptly.
2. Implement fair and 
transparent policies for 
performance evaluation, 
promotion, and compensation.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and

Permanent workers
At APL Apollo, we prioritize the creation of a safe and inclusive workplace for 
our employees. To ensure transparency and address any concerns, we have 
implemented a robust vigil mechanism. Our Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy 
is actively enforced to handle and resolve any grievances in this regard. 
Additionally, we have a Whistleblower Policy in place, outlining the procedure 
for employees and workers to raise complaints, including the contact details 
of the Vigilance Officer. We are committed to fostering a culture of respect and 
providing a confidential platform for employees to voice their concerns, thereby 
maintaining a harassment-free workplace.
The company’s sexual harassment redressal procedure begins with the 
complainant submitting a written complaint, which is reviewed by the 
Complaints Committee. The complaint is then shared with the accused, who 
is given an opportunity to respond. The committee either resolves the matter 
directly or appoints an enquiry officer to conduct a formal investigation. After 
the enquiry report is submitted, both parties are heard before the committee 
makes its final decision. The findings are forwarded to management, which takes 
appropriate disciplinary action to ensure a fair and effective resolution.

APL Apollo is strongly committed to ensuring a safe, healthy, and secure work environment across all its facilities. Our approach 
to occupational health and safety is based on continuous improvement, proactive risk management, and effective preventive 
measures. We implement consistent safety practices across all our plants through well-defined protocols and infrastructure.
�	
Incident Investigation and Knowledge Sharing:
	
Every safety-related incident, regardless of its severity, is thoroughly investigated. A designated team — comprising safety 
officers and relevant department heads — conducts root cause analysis immediately following any incident. Key learnings 
from these investigations are documented and communicated company-wide through daily safety briefings, monthly 
review meetings, internal safety bulletins, and mandatory refresher training modules.
	
We also incorporate safety education through regular toolbox talks and audio-visual presentations to reinforce these 
learnings. All corrective actions are recorded and tracked in our integrated Safety Management System (SMS), and their 
effectiveness is verified through follow-up audits, inspections, CCTV monitoring, and periodic management reviews.
�	
Addressing Unsafe Observations:
	
APL Apollo maintains a proactive approach to identifying and addressing unsafe acts and conditions. Observations made 
during routine safety walks, scheduled audits, or reported through our digital safety platform are logged in the SMS, 
assigned to responsible departments, and addressed within defined timelines.
	
Each division maintains targeted action plans to mitigate near-miss events. Additional safety practices include the use of 
prominent safety display boards, division-specific HIRA (Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment) sheets, and clearly 
defined protocols. We ensure proper barricading around heavy machinery, strictly enforce the use of personal protective 
equipment (PPE), and promote a strong safety culture through structured recognition and reward programs.
�	
Proactive Risk Management and Preventive Measures:
	
We conduct regular HIRA studies across all operational areas to identify potential hazards and assess associated risks. 
Our risk register is reviewed quarterly, and division-specific protocols are updated accordingly.
	
Preventive measures include:
	
{
Visible marking of assembly points and fire extinguishers
	
{
Mandatory safety inductions for new employees
	
{
Ongoing safety training programs
	
{
Strategic use of CCTV and security personnel for continuous monitoring
	
{
Installation of sensors on movable machinery to automatically shut down operations in the presence of human 
proximity
	
{
Infrastructure improvements such as speed breakers to reduce accident risk
Furthermore, all third-party contractors operating within APL Apollo premises must meet strict compliance requirements, including 
valid insurance and ESIC coverage.

Use of Renewable Electricity
	
In FY25, there was an overall increase in the renewable electricity from 28% (in FY24) to 31% (in FY25), despite the addition 
of two new plants (New Raipur and Dubai), which rely solely on the respective national grids.
	
In most of the plants, there was a growth in the share of renewable electricity used in operations. The new plants currently rely 
on grid electricity and are in the process of adopting renewable electricity. Excluding the new plants, the overall renewable 
electricity is 52%.
	
73% of APL Apollo’s plants have access to renewable energy. Additionally, APL Apollo has signed a Power Purchase Agreement 
with BluPine Energy for a 61.65-megawatt solar plant in Chattisgarh. This project is estimated to generate about 94.5 million 
units of electricity annually, which will offset more than 87,000 tonne of CO2 emissions each year.

Adoption of Electric Trucks for Logistics
	
APL Apollo has started integrating electric trucks into its logistics operations as part of its broader sustainability initiative. 
The company has partnered with SG Green logistics which operates 55 ton capacity electric trucks to provide logistical 
services. These trucks have been introduced to gradually replace emissions from diesel-powered vehicles, aiming to 
reduce the environmental impact of transportation activities while also improving operational efficiency and aligning with 
APL Apollo’s long-term carbon reduction goals. As a result of this transition, APL Apollo has achieved a 54%* reduction in 
emissions compared to the use of diesel trucks. Currently the trucks are operating in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu 
and Karnataka.
	
*This reduction is calculated based on the assumption that the trucks are charged entirely at APL Apollo’s plants. The average 
renewable energy share across APL Apollo plants in the respective regions is 61% (Unit I Sikandarabad, Unit II Hosur, Unit VI 
Bangalore, Unit VII Kurandahalli village, AMPL 22 Sikandarabad, and AMPL 25 Sikandarabad).
