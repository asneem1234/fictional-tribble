Energy 
efficiency & 
Reduction 
of Carbon 
Emissions 
/ GHG 
Emissions 
as response 
to Climate 
Change
O
Improving energy efficiency 
and implementing effective 
energy management are 
essential strategies for 
reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) 
and other greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, which are 
key contributors to climate 
change. By using less energy to 
achieve the same outcomes, 
organizations can significantly 
cut fossil fuel use—the primary 
source of emissions. Strategic 
energy management, including 
monitoring usage, optimizing 
processes, upgrading to 
efficient technologies, and 
adopting renewable energy 
sources like solar and wind, not 
only reduces environmental 
impact but also lowers 
operational costs. These 
actions are vital for climate 
change mitigation, fostering 
sustainable development, and 
accelerating the transition to a 
low-carbon future.

Water and 
Waste 
Management 
(Hazardous 
and Non-
Hazardous)
R
Ineffective waste and water 
management can pose 
significant environmental, 
health, legal, and operational 
risks. Improper waste disposal 
may lead to contamination, 
public health hazards, 
and non-compliance with 
hazardous and biomedical 
waste regulations, which may 
result into legal penalties 
and potential loss of licenses 
etc. Likewise, poor water 
management can disrupt 
operations, elevate costs, 
and compromise hygiene 
standards, increasing the risk 
of waterborne infections and 
endangering patient safety.
Domestic wastewater 
undergoes treatment 
and is reused for non-
contact applications, 
including toilet flushing, 
gardening, and washing 
hospital vehicles. 
Rainwater harvesting 
practices are also in 
place at major facilities to 
support sustainable water 
management.
Our waste management 
approach is guided by the 
3R principle—Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle—which 
helps lower environmental 
pollution, conservevaluable 
resources, and improve 
cost-efficiency. We ensure 
that all biomedical waste

Occupational 
Health and

R
Healthcare professionals 
faces heightened exposure 
risks to infectious diseases 
and occupational hazards. 
We recognize that fostering 
a strong safety culture is 
essential to minimize errors 
and prevent adverse events in 
our child & mother -focused 
healthcare environment.
We have put in place 
strong safety measures 
to protect both our staff 
and patients. These 
include a dedicated 
Infection Prevention and 
Control Program tailored 
for child and mother 
healthcare, regular safety 
training sessions, and 
an Automated Incident 
Reporting System (AIRS) 
that allows staff to report 
concerns anonymously. 
We assess all incidents 
to ensure timely and 
appropriate responses, and 
we conduct Root Cause 
Analyses to prevent future 
issues. Extra precautions 
are also taken in neonatal 
and pediatric intensive 
care units to ensure the 
highest level of protection.

Privacy and 
Cybersecurity 
/ Data 
Security
R
Disclosure of sensitive 
patient information can 
incur substantial fines, 
legal liabilities, and erode 
stakeholder trust. Such 
breaches often disrupt 
operations—causing 
downtime and expensive 
recovery efforts—and inflict 
reputational damage that may 
deter prospective patients 
and partners, ultimately 
undermining revenue and 
growth.
We are dedicated to 
safeguarding sensitive 
information through a 
comprehensive privacy 
and security architecture. 
Our robust Information and 
Cyber Security programme 
is supported by detailed 
policies and standards, all 
aligned with industry best 
practices.

By delivering exceptional, 
high-quality services, we

unwavering commitment 
to patient safety not only 
minimizes risk but also builds 
lasting trust and confidence. 
By placing patient satisfaction

we create meaningful, positive 
experiences that drive loyalty, 
enhance our reputation, and 
position us as a trusted leader 
in healthcare excellence.

Investments 
in technology 
and digital 
marketing
O
By leveraging digital marketing 
and technology, the Company 
is strategically positioned 
to enhance patient services 
and expand its market reach. 
This digital-first approach 
strengthens brand presence 
and improves accessibility for 
a broader audience. Through a 
commitment to technological 
advancement, the Company 
drives innovation, consistently 
delivering products and 
services that exceed customer 
expectations.
Positive
7
Risk 
Management
R
A lack of robust controls 
within a risk management 
system can expose businesses 
to adverse effects across 
various operational areas. 
However, when integrated 
into the overall strategy, 
risk management presents 
significant opportunities. It not 
only protects against potential 
disruptions but also enhances 
adaptability in a dynamic 
business environment. This 
strategic approach fosters 
resilience and supports long-
term success, even in the face 
of challenges.
The Company actively 
collaborates with key 
stakeholders throughout 
the risk management 
process, ensuring 
their awareness and 
engagement in mitigating 
potential risks. This 
inclusive approach fosters 
a culture of risk awareness 
and accountability, 
leading to more effective 
and sustainable risk 
management outcomes.

Rainbow ensures the safe collection, treatment, and disposal of all waste and end-of-life materials in full compliance 
with local and state regulatory norms.
	
(a) 	 Plastics (including packaging): The Company follows responsible waste management practices by regularly selling 
its plastic waste to authorised plastic recyclers. Given the nature of its operations in the healthcare services 
sector, plastic waste generation remains minimal. To further minimise plastic use, all units are equipped with water 
dispensers and disposable paper cups, thereby eliminating the need for plastic PET bottles. Additionally, the 
Company has discontinued the use of plastic bags for general hospital operations, including carry bags, medicine 
packaging, and food distribution, promoting eco-friendly alternatives across all units.
	
(b) 	 E-waste: E-waste is collected and stored in designated bins at each unit and is disposed of in accordance with 
the Company’s ESG guidelines and E-Waste Management Policy. Rainbow has partnered with third party for the 
collection and responsible disposal of segregated e-waste. Disposal is carried out periodically, once sufficient 
volume has accumulated.
	
(c) 	 Hazardous waste: As a healthcare service provider, the Company ensures the safe and compliant disposal of 
biomedical waste (BMW) through authorised hazardous waste handlers, strictly adhering to the Biomedical Waste 
Management Rules, 2016.
	
(d) 	 Other waste: The Company ensures responsible disposal of various waste streams in line with regulatory 
requirements. General waste is managed through authorised municipal partners, while waste oil is disposed 
of exclusively via certified vendors to prevent unauthorised handling. General scrap is sold on demand to local 
authorised recyclers, with detailed records maintained for traceability. Wastewater and other contaminated 
liquids are treated through in-house Sewage and Effluent Treatment Plants (STP and ETP) before being safely 
discharged into municipal sewage systems, as per hospital policy.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
We prioritize comprehensive disaster management and business continuity to safeguard lives, protect assets, and 
ensure uninterrupted delivery of critical healthcare services during both natural and man-made emergencies. Through a 
National Network of Emergency Services and 24-hour trauma care capabilities, our hospitals are equipped to respond 
effectively to diverse threats such as earthquakes, floods, fires, chemical spills, cyberattacks, and pandemics. 
Annual site-specific risk assessments inform regularly updated disaster response plans, which include standardized 
evacuation protocols, communication strategies, and medical triage procedures. Each facility develops unit-specific 
evacuation plans based on a centralized SOP and conducts quarterly mock drills alongside safety training programs 
covering various emergency scenarios. Strategic partnerships with nearby hospitals further strengthen our capacity to 
manage patient transfers during crises.
	
Our robust Enterprise Risk Management framework, operating at Corporate, Regional, and Unit levels, systematically 
identifies and mitigates risks that could impact sustainable growth and operational stability. Critical risks are reviewed 
by the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee and the Executive Leadership Team, ensuring policies remain aligned 
with an evolving risk landscape. The organization-wide Business Continuity and Disaster Management Plan aims to 
minimize downtime, financial losses, and service disruptions while enabling rapid recovery and coordinated responses. 
Policies are accessible to all employees to foster preparedness and reinforce a culture of safety, resilience, and trust 
positioning us to maintain excellence in patient care and organizational performance under any circumstances.
