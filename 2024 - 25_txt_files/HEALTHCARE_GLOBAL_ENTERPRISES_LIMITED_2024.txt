Satisfaction 
and Wellbeing
Opportunity
Opportunity: As a company 
in the health sector, our 
foremost 
priority 
is 
to 
deliver 
high-quality 
care 
that enhances our patients' 
quality of life. Creating a 
positive patient experience 
is 
fundamental 
to 
our 
values. We are dedicated to 
cultivating a culture of care 
that prioritizes our patients' 
wellbeing 
and 
ensures 
they have easy access to 
comprehensive healthcare 
services.
-
Positive: Improving patient 
experience and achieving 
high levels of satisfaction 
positively 
influence 
our 
brand value. This, in turn, 
strengthens our reputation 
and fosters trust among 
stakeholders 
and 
the 
community regarding our 
company.
2.
Medical Quality 
and Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Medical quality is a vital 
factor that greatly affects 
the company's reputation 
and performance. Failing 
to uphold high standards of 
quality and safety may result 
in 
compromised 
patient 
safety, regulatory violations, 
and potential legal and 
financial consequences.
Opportunity: 
The 
core 
values of the Company 
revolve around nurturing 
a culture of care for all 
patients. This culture is 
heavily influenced by the 
quality and safety of the 
services we offer. As a 
healthcare organization, it 
is essential that we deliver 
services that are both safe 
and contribute to enhancing 
our patients' quality of life.
The Company recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
delivering 
high-quality 
services while prioritizing 
patient safety. To this end, 
we 
have 
implemented 
rigorous quality protocols 
that guarantee all services 
are rendered safely and 
efficiently. Our facilities 
are equipped with cutting-
edge 
technology 
to 
enhance the overall patient 
experience. 
Additionally, 
all staff members possess 
the required skills and 
undergo training to ensure 
they 
provide 
proper 
treatment and care.
Negative: Failure to comply 
with quality and safety 
standards could negatively 
affect 
the 
Company’s 
reputation. 
Additionally, 
it may lead to financial or 
legal repercussions, as well 
as the potential loss of 
accreditation status.
Positive: 
Delivering 
safe 
and high-quality healthcare 
services to all patients will 
not only drive business 
growth but also strengthen 
brand value. Moreover, it 
ensures that the Company 
complies with regulatory

3.
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Poor management of 
energy and the Company’s 
environmental impact could 
expose 
the 
organization 
to climate-related physical 
and transition risks. This 
may result in operational 
disruptions and jeopardize 
business continuity.
Opportunity: 
Embracing 
new 
low-carbon 
technologies 
can 
create 
opportunities 
for 
more 
efficient 
processes 
and 
enhance business resilience.
The Company is dedicated 
to 
transitioning 
to 
renewable 
energy 
and 
has implemented several 
initiatives to achieve this 
goal. This includes the 
installation of solar panels, 
which have the potential 
to offset 3,300 tons of 
carbon emissions each 
year. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Company has upgraded to 
LED lighting throughout 
its facilities to enhance 
energy efficiency.
Negative: 
Inefficient 
management 
of 
the 
Company's 
energy 
consumption 
could 
negatively affect business 
resilience. 
Additionally, 
it may result in a loss of 
stakeholder 
trust 
and 
damage to the Company's 
reputation.
Positive: Pursuing efficient 
energy management can 
provide 
businesses 
with 
opportunities to leverage 
emerging 
technologies 
and adopt more effective 
production methods.
4.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Risk: 
Effective 
waste 
management is essential 
for the Company to foster 
a positive environmental 
footprint. 
Dedicated 
efforts to minimize waste 
generation 
and 
ensure 
proper 
disposal 
are 
crucial to showcasing the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to a sustainable future and 
a healthier planet. This 
is 
especially 
important 
for 
the 
biomedical 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
produced in our hospitals, 
as proper treatment and 
safe disposal are vital for 
safeguarding both human 
and environmental health.
The 
Company 
has 
created 
comprehensive 
Waste 
Management 
Manuals 
that 
provide 
thorough 
guidance 
on 
waste disposal methods 
and procedures. These 
Manuals 
ensure 
strict 
adherence to regulatory 
requirements for proper 
waste 
disposal. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Company 
is continuously seeking 
opportunities to enhance 
waste recycling, which 
will help reduce waste 
generation and positively 
impact the environment.
Negative: 
Poor 
management and disposal 
of 
waste 
can 
have 
detrimental 
effects 
on 
both human health and the 
environment. It may also 
result in financial losses 
and 
legal 
repercussions 
due 
to 
non-compliance 
with laws and regulations. 
Additionally, the Company's 
brand 
value 
could 
be 
significantly compromised.

5.
Data Security
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Data security risks 
and threats can negatively 
impact the security and 
integrity of the Company's 
IT systems.
Opportunity: 
A 
strong 
governance framework for 
data integrity, technology, 
and 
digitization 
can 
significantly enhance the 
Company’s 
productivity 
and growth by ensuring a 
secure IT network.
To 
prevent 
data 
breaches 
and 
protect 
confidential 
information, 
the Company conducts 
regular assessments of 
vulnerabilities and breach 
threats to our IT systems. 
Employees receive training 
and awareness programs 
on 
cybersecurity, 
and 
periodic 
informational 
mailers are distributed to 
promote safe IT practices 
and behaviors.
Negative: Lack of a robust 
data integrity and security 
mechanism could increase 
the rate of data breaches 
and result in the loss of 
valuable data that may 
have an adverse impact 
on the business. Breach of 
patient/stakeholder 
data 
may 
potentially 
expose 
us to litigations, fines and 
penalties.
Positive: The integration 
of front-line data privacy 
principles 
and 
practices 
throughout the Company 
ensures compliance with 
data 
privacy 
laws 
and 
regulations. 
Moreover, 
it 
creates 
a 
protective 
environment 
against 
breaches 
and 
enhances 
productivity, 
ultimately 
contributing to sustainable 
growth.
6.
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk: Occupational health 
and safety is a crucial 
aspect of the Company’s 
commitment to delivering 
a safe and secure working 
environment. 
If 
the 
existing health and safety 
management programs are 
ineffective, it may result 
in a significant increase in 
health and safety incidents.
The 
Company 
has 
established 
a 
comprehensive Employee 
Health and Safety Policy 
that applies to all staff in 
order to promote a safe 
working 
environment. 
This 
policy 
outlines 
the 
processes 
and 
procedures necessary for 
ensuring safety, as well 
as preventive measures 
aimed 
at 
mitigating 
potential risks. Employees 
receive targeted training 
on 
health 
and 
safety 
to 
encourage 
safe 
workplace behaviors. All 
services offered by the 
Company 
are 
subject 
to Hazard Identification 
and 
Risk 
Assessment 
(HIRA). 
Compliance 
with 
standards 
and 
regulatory 
requirements 
is consistently monitored 
through rigorous Quality 
Audits.
Negative: Frequent health 
and 
safety 
incidents 
can adversely affect the 
Company’s 
performance 
regarding 
safety 
and 
employee well-being. This, 
in turn, can impact the 
brand image and reputation, 
hindering the Company’s 
ability to attract and retain 
talent.

Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Not complying with 
the highest standards of 
corporate governance and 
business ethics can lead to 
regulatory 
consequences, 
as well as financial and/or 
reputational damage.
Opportunity: 
Upholding 
and 
showcasing 
strong 
governance 
practices 
and ethical behavior will 
facilitate long-term value 
creation for all stakeholders.
The Company engages 
in proactive and regular 
communications 
with 
regulatory 
organizations 
across 
its 
facilities 
to 
minimize 
the 
risk 
of 
noncompliance. 
Additionally, 
strict 
adherence 
to 
internal 
policies 
and 
regulatory 
requirements is enforced 
through training for all 
employees on business 
ethics and the code of 
conduct.
Negative: 
Noncompliance 
with regulatory standards 
could negatively affect the 
Company's reputation and 
business continuity.
Positive: The Company's 
dedication 
to 
ethical 
business practices will be 
positively received by all 
stakeholders, 
enhancing 
brand value and building 
trust among them.
8.
Water 
Management
Risk
Risk: 
Efficient 
water 
management is essential 
for 
creating 
a 
positive 
environmental 
impact. 
Due to the nature of our 
operations, 
water 
usage 
is extensive across our 
hospitals. 
Therefore, 
targeted initiatives aimed at 
improving water efficiency 
and reducing consumption 
are crucial to mitigate risks 
to business growth and 
minimize adverse effects on 
the environment.
The Company conducts 
regular 
and 
focused 
monitoring 
of 
water 
usage across all locations. 
Water meters have been 
installed at all discharge 
sites to proactively track 
consumption 
levels. 
Additionally, the Company 
has embraced advanced 
technologies to optimize 
water 
usage 
through 
improved recycling and 
reuse practices.
Negative: 
Poor 
management 
of 
water 
usage can result in water 
scarcity, 
significantly 
affecting 
business 
continuity and growth. This 
mismanagement can also 
lead to a decline in brand 
value and reputation.
9.
Human Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: The lack of a protective 
environment 
for 
Human 
Rights can result in higher 
instances of discrimination 
and the development of a 
hostile work environment. 
Furthermore, this may harm 
the Company’s reputation 
and diminish its societal 
value.
Opportunity: 
As 
a 
responsible 
corporate 
citizen, the Company is 
committed 
to 
protecting 
and 
promoting 
human 
rights. This approach will 
enhance its positive image, 
build stakeholder trust, and 
clearly 
demonstrate 
the 
Company’s dedication to 
social responsibility.
Outlined in the Code of 
Conduct, the Company is 
dedicated to protecting 
and 
promoting 
human 
rights, 
establishing 
a 
supportive 
and 
robust 
governance 
framework. 
All 
employees 
receive 
training 
on 
these 
principles and are required 
to adhere strictly to them. 
As an equal opportunity 
employer, the Company 
maintains 
a 
zero-
tolerance policy toward 
any form of discrimination 
or violation of human 
rights. 
Additionally, 
the 
Company 
actively 
encourages its value chain 
partners to uphold human 
rights 
throughout 
their 
operations.
Negative: The lack of a 
robust governance system 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
human rights may result in 
employee 
dissatisfaction 
and decreased productivity, 
ultimately 
affecting 
the 
Company’s 
long-term 
business 
performance. 
Moreover, 
an 
ineffective 
grievance redressal system 
heightens 
the 
risk 
of 
noncompliance, potentially 
leading 
to 
financial, 
legal, 
and 
reputational 
repercussions.
Positive: 
A 
strong 
alignment 
with 
human 
rights principles enhances 
the 
Company’s 
social 
value 
and 
demonstrates 
their integration within the 
business model, fostering 
a comprehensive approach.

Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Disruptions to the 
Company’s supply chain can 
lead to substantial delays 
in 
delivering 
essential 
health services to patients. 
Additionally, 
reliance 
on 
non-substitutable suppliers 
creates a risk regarding 
the ongoing availability of 
critical supplies.
Opportunity: 
The 
supply 
chain 
is 
crucial 
to 
an 
organization's 
sustainability. 
Engaging 
suppliers in the ESG journey 
enables the Company to 
build 
a 
resilient 
supply 
chain and foster a virtuous 
cycle 
of 
environmentally 
and 
socially 
responsible 
practices throughout the 
value chain.
The 
Company 
has 
established 
long-term 
business 
relationships 
with reliable and reputable 
suppliers 
to 
create 
a 
strong 
supply 
chain. 
Considerable importance 
is placed on suppliers' 
knowledge, 
reputation, 
and ethical values during 
the 
selection 
process. 
Moreover, all suppliers are 
required to submit a self-
declaration regarding their 
social and environmental 
performance 
during 
onboarding. The Company 
also conducts targeted 
monitoring to ensure that 
all suppliers comply with 
the ESG principles it has 
adopted.
Negative: 
Long-term 
commercial 
partnerships 
with 
suppliers 
may 
be 
jeopardized 
if 
they 
fail 
to adhere to standards 
concerning 
social, 
environmental, and safety 
aspects, resulting in a loss 
of business value.
Positive 
The 
effective 
resolution 
of 
supply 
chain disruptions due to 
unforeseen 
circumstances 
is 
achieved 
through 
responsible supply chain 
practices. 
Additionally, 
commitment to responsible 
sourcing strongly reflects 
the Company’s dedication 
to its ESG performance.

Statement by director responsible for the

ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements. 
At HCG, sustainability remains a core pillar of our strategy — guiding both 
our operational decisions and long-term value creation. We are committed 
to fostering positive outcomes for all our stakeholders through a responsible, 
transparent, and accountable approach to business.
Our fourth Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) builds on 
our journey so far offering an integrated view of how we embed environmental, 
social, and governance principles into our day-to-day operations and strategic 
outlook. Ethical conduct forms the foundation of our business, supported by a 
strong governance framework that drives accountability and stakeholder trust.
Through this, we remain focused on expanding access to quality, affordable 
healthcare while continuously working to improve the lives of our patients. Our 
people are integral to our success. We are committed to creating a workplace 
where talent is nurtured, growth is encouraged, and wellbeing is prioritized. Our 
efforts are designed to promote inclusivity, empower employees at every level, 
and ensure they have meaningful opportunities for personal and professional 
development.
In alignment with our broader purpose, we continue to engage with local 
communities through targeted social impact and CSR initiatives. These efforts 
reflect our culture of care and our responsibility to support the broader ecosystem 
in which we operate.
We have undertaken focused initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, 
renewable energy adoption, water conservation, and responsible waste 
management. Notable actions include the use of solar energy, rainwater 
harvesting systems, e-billing to reduce paper use, and biodegradable materials 
to replace single-use plastics.
As we present our fourth BRSR, we reaffirm our commitment to continuous 
improvement and resilience. The road ahead demands greater climate 
responsibility, enhanced stakeholder collaboration, and deeper integration 
of sustainability across our business. We are determined to meet these 
expectations by listening to our stakeholders, collaborating across the industry, 
and innovating for a more sustainable future.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.  
	
The company is dedicated to minimizing its energy usage and reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. We meticulously 
track and monitor energy consumption throughout the company to ensure effective energy management, with internal limits 
set to control usage within acceptable bounds. We are actively working to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to 
low-carbon energy sources. As part of this effort, we have installed solar panels on our facilities to promote sustainable energy 
adoption. For instance, a 2.25-megawatt solar plant has been set up in Jagaluru Village, Karnataka's Davangere district. This 
plant is projected to produce 45 lakh units of clean energy annually, offsetting around 3,300 tons of carbon emissions each 
year. Additionally, it is expected to reduce our energy costs by approximately 70%. Furthermore, we have replaced conventional 
lights with LED lights to enhance energy conservation and promote a greener energy footprint.

The company prioritizes waste reduction at the source as a key part of its waste management strategy. All waste disposal 
is conducted in compliance with relevant regulations. We have developed comprehensive Waste Management Manuals to 
guide proper waste treatment throughout the organization. Our internal manuals provide detailed guidelines for the disposal 
of hazardous waste generated by the company. This includes obtaining authorization and approval from the State Pollution 
Control Board (SPCB) under the Hazardous and Other Waste (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. 
Furthermore, we ensure safe disposal of all biomedical waste through proper segregation in accordance with the Bio-Medical 
Waste Management Rules 2016. Additionally, used radiopharmaceutical products and vials are safely managed in compliance 
with relevant regulations through their respective manufacturers.
