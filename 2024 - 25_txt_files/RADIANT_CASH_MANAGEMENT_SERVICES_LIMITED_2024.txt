a material topic, RCMS ensures 
compliance with the existing 
and proposed environmental 
regulations. This helps the 
company avoid legal issues 
and penalties and improves 
its reputation as a responsible 
organization.
In India, the nature of 
vehicles to be used for the 
cash 
logistics 
operations 
are regulated by the RBI/
MHA 
guidelines. 
As 
per 
current regional regulatory 
compliance, 
the 
vehicles 
in 
Delhi 
and 
NCR

switched to CNG instead of 
conventional fuels like Petrol/
Diesel. Additionally, steps to 
reduce emissions from the 
cash vehicles are being taken

checks and regular servicing.

RCMS remains committed to upholding and promoting human rights across all aspects of its operations. The Company enforces 
a zero-tolerance policy towards child labour, forced labour, and any form of harassment, while actively supporting the right to 
freedom of association and collective bargaining. It fosters a culture of open communication and encourages stakeholders to raise 
concerns related to human rights without fear of retaliation. Any aggrieved employee or stakeholder may approach the designated

Company’s policies and day-to-day practices reflect its ongoing commitment to safeguarding human rights and ensuring ethical
