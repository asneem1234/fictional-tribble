Our People
Opportunity
The Company offers investigation 
and security services with 27,357 
employees and 1,65,448 workers. 
A solid base of talented workforce 
allows the Company to foster 
innovation, improve service 
delivery, and increase customer 
happiness.
-
Positive: A skilled and 
engaged workforce 
contributes to 
improved service 
quality, higher 
customer retention, 
and better financial 
stability.
Risk
The Company operates a 
human-centric model and faces 
high attrition rates. Loss of key 
personnel or difficulty in hiring 
skilled workers could disrupt 
operations.
•	
Employee Engagement Initiatives: 
Regular health check-ups, ongoing 
training for both frontline and support 
staff, and social events aimed at 
building a cohesive and motivated 
workforce.
•	
Structured Succession Planning: A 
formal "Policy on Succession Planning" 
has been implemented to identify and 
prepare high-potential employees for 
leadership roles, ensuring business 
continuity during transitions.
•	
Talent Acquisition Strategy: Focused 
recruitment campaigns, employee 
referral programs, and engagement 
with staffing partners to attract qualified 
candidates efficiently.
Negative: High 
attrition increases 
onboarding and 
training costs and may 
impact revenue due 
to leadership gaps or 
service disruption.
2
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Operating in a manpower-
intensive industry, employee 
health and safety is critical to 
operational continuity and 
employee wellbeing.
•	
Comprehensive OHS Policy: The 
Company has implemented a detailed 
Occupational Health & Safety Policy 
compliant with government regulations 
and industry standards.
•	
Hazard Identification & Risk 
Classification: Regular audits and 
safety inspections are conducted. 
Hazards are categorised (A, B, C) based 
on severity, with appropriate control 
measures and follow-ups.
•	
Safety Infrastructure & Training: 
Emergency response drills, counseling 
for mental wellness, and continuous 
safety education programs for all 
employees.
•	
Incident Reporting Mechanism: 
Easy-to-use channels for employees 
to report risks and near-misses, with 
a robust response and resolution 
framework.
Negative: Workplace 
incidents can lower 
morale, reduce 
productivity, increase 
absenteeism, and 
negatively impact 
growth.

3
Customer 
Engagement
Opportunity
•	
The continuous growth of any 
organisation is dependent 
on offering an exceptional 
client experience. A pleasant 
customer experience 
promotes loyalty, customer 
retention, and brand 
advocacy.
-
Positive: A positive 
customer experience 
can lead to increased 
satisfaction among 
customers and 
can also boost 
the Company's 
reputation.
Risk
•	
The Company offers 
investigation and security 
services to its consumers; any 
negative customer experience 
or non-fulfilment of Service 
Line Agreements (SLAs) may 
result in loss of clients or 
even damage the Company's 
reputation.
•	
Growing ESG awareness may 
result in its integration into 
contractual obligations. 
•	
Customer Feedback Mechanisms: 
Structured initiatives like the Customer 
Satisfaction (CSAT) Program, "Own 
Your Customer (OYC)" framework, and 
bi-annual satisfaction surveys help 
gather direct input and drive service 
improvements.
•	
Leadership-Level Engagement: Senior 
management conducts periodic review 
meetings with clients to understand 
evolving expectations and proactively 
address concerns.
•	
ESG Integration: Ongoing assessment 
of relevant Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) elements, with a 
roadmap for incorporating these into 
contract fulfilment and core operations.
Negative: Inadequate 
engagement may 
raise acquisition costs 
and reduce market 
share.  
Failure to meet ESG 
criteria may restrict 
growth.
4
Community 
Development
Opportunity
As a responsible corporate citizen, 
we recognise our role in giving 
back to our community and 
remain committed to fulfilling 
our social responsibilities. The 
Company organises several 
community engagement 
programs in areas such as 
healthcare, skill development, 
children’s education, promoting 
of local handicrafts, providing safe 
drinking water, promoting hygiene 
and sanitation in rural and urban 
areas and so on.
Positive: Strong 
community relations 
enhance social license 
to operate and can 
lead to new business 
opportunities, talent 
access, and resource 
availability.
5
Employee 
Training 
and Career 
Development
Opportunity
The Company regards its 
employees as an asset and 
therefore conducts several skill 
development programs through 
its 32 advanced training centres 
across 14 states. Additionally, 
the Company organises several 
leadership programs such as 
Mr. SIS, LEAP, LEAP Plus etc. 
Through the training champs 
network, the Company provides a 
learning experience by leveraging 
technology such as its mobile app 
and the SIS Academy. 
Positive: Career 
development of our 
employees results 
in enhanced skills 
and knowledge and 
can lead to higher 
workforce productivity 
thus contributing to 
increase in customer 
satisfaction which 
can increase the 
Company’s output 
and potentially its 
revenue.
Risk
•	
Deployment of staff on the 
job with limited training will 
impact service delivery as per 
the Company’s standards. 
•	
The Company has implemented several 
employee onboarding trainings to 
acquaint new employees with the 
Company’s values and standards.
Negative: Poor 
training can lead 
to customer 
dissatisfaction and 
revenue loss due to 
underperformance.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
At SIS, we recognise that effective stakeholder engagement is essential for building trust, fostering meaningful 
partnerships, and creating long-term value. To ensure a structured and strategic approach, the Company has implemented 
a Stakeholder Relationship Policy that outlines the framework for identifying, engaging with, and managing relationships 
with stakeholders.
	
This policy governs our stakeholder engagement process, which includes four key components: stakeholder identification, 
consultation, communication, and reporting. The frequency and method of engagement vary depending on the 
stakeholder group and the nature of the relationship.
	
For optimal resource allocation and meaningful engagement, SIS evaluates and prioritises stakeholders 
based on the following criteria:
•	
Their specific interests in the Company’s activities
•	
Their level of influence over business outcomes
•	
Their willingness to engage with the Company
•	
Their expectations from the engagement
•	
The potential value derived from the relationship, both for the stakeholder and the Company
 
Key stakeholder groups identified by SIS include:
•	
Shareholders and investors
•	
Employees
•	
Suppliers and vendors
•	
Central and state governments
•	
Regulatory authorities
•	
Customers and clients
•

Understanding and addressing the expectations of these stakeholders is a critical component of our ESG and 
sustainability strategy. As SIS continues to expand its impact, proactive and inclusive stakeholder engagement will 
remain central to our decision-making and long-term growth.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board.
	
SIS recognises that meaningful engagement with stakeholders is a vital part of its business operations. It is committed 
to maintaining regular and effective communication with its key stakeholders to strengthen transparency around its 
performance and strategic direction. This engagement helps the Company better understand stakeholder expectations, 
manage risks proactively, and resolve potential conflicts early. 
	
The stakeholder engagement process includes identifying key stakeholders, conducting consultations, reporting 
outcomes, and maintaining open lines of communication. The method and frequency of engagement are tailored to 
each stakeholder group, with relevant departments responsible for engaging with their respective stakeholders as 
needed on an ongoing basis. SIS has also drafted a Stakeholder Relationship Policy: https://sisindia.com/wp-content/
uploads/2023/02/Stakeholder-Relationship-Policy.pdf
	
The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee plays a crucial role in managing concerns related to security holders and 
investors. Its responsibilities include addressing grievances such as non-receipt of share certificates, delays or refusals in 
share and debenture transfers or transmissions, and issues with dividend payments and annual reports. The Committee 
also oversees the processes of dematerialisation and rematerialisation of shares, issuance of duplicate or consolidated 
certificates, and ensures compliance with applicable regulations concerning securities.
	
Additionally, the Committee monitors the performance of the Company’s registrars and transfer agents, recommending 
improvements to enhance investor services. It is also tasked with developing and overseeing a structured framework 
for investor communication and engagement, ensuring that stakeholders’ concerns are identified, prioritised, and 
addressed in a transparent and timely manner. Periodic reviews are conducted to assess and improve the effectiveness 
of this framework.
2. 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
At SIS, we believe that ongoing engagement with stakeholders is key to aligning expectations and enhancing our ability 
to serve them effectively. Regular interactions enable the Company to stay informed about evolving Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) priorities, assess their potential impact, and align them with SIS’s long-term aspirations.
	
To support our internal stakeholders, particularly employees, SIS has established several initiatives aimed at promoting 
well-being and development. Through the SEWA Trust, the Company offers financial assistance to employees during 
times of personal or family crisis, reinforcing our commitment to employee welfare.
	
In addition, SIS has partnered with the Indian Public School, a premier residential school in Dehradun, to offer scholarships 
to meritorious children of SIS employees, providing them with access to quality education and supporting the aspirations 
of their families.
	
Employee feedback plays a critical role in our continuous improvement process. Insights gathered from employee 
engagement surveys are used to design targeted training and development programs that facilitate skill enhancement 
and career growth across the organisation.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalised stakeholder groups.
	
SIS remains deeply committed to supporting its vulnerable frontline and non-billable workforce, recognising the critical 
role they play in the organisation’s success. We are conscious of the widespread impact we have on millions of families 
who depend on the livelihoods we create and sustain each year.
	
In alignment with this responsibility, SIS has partnered with Entitled, a Fintech company, to provide short-term financial 
assistance in the form of accessible loans to employees in need. Additionally, through the SEWA Trust, SIS extends Death 
Support SEWA benefits to the nominees of deceased employees. The support is offered in three tiers—H 1.5 lakhs, 
H 2.5 lakhs, and H 3.5 lakhs—based on the employee’s tenure with the Company.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and  
harassment cases.
	
SIS is committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace for all employees. The Company maintains a 
strict policy of zero tolerance for any form of retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith, whether 
related to misconduct, harassment, or violations of company policy. To ensure a workplace free from discrimination 
and sexual harassment, SIS has established an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in accordance with the provisions 
of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. The Committee 
is responsible for investigating complaints of sexual harassment and recommending appropriate actions based on 
its findings.
	
In addition, SIS has put in place a grievance redressal mechanism at the branch level to facilitate the registration and 
resolution of employee concerns. The Company is committed to maintaining strict confidentiality of all complaints and 
protecting the identity and dignity of those who come forward.
	
If an employee feels uncomfortable reporting an issue through the standard process, or if a previously raised concern is 
not adequately addressed, they are encouraged to escalate the matter directly to senior management. This multi-tiered 
approach ensures that all employees have a safe and accessible path to report issues without fear of retaliation.

^Water withdrawal recorded under the third party is estimated using the latest SEBI circular and Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) 
guidance which specifies estimated consumptions to be 45 Litres per head per working day for offices and based on the number of 
employees as on March 31, 2025. Based on the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) 2016 document, “Estimation of water requirement 
for drinking and domestic use” - water consumption of offices for domestic usage is 25 and flushing usage is 20 liters per head per day. 
Hence the total water consumption has been calculated by multiplying the number of employees by the stipulated 25 litres per head per 
working day.

have implemented the Own Your Customer (OYC) programme, which assigns each significant client to a member 
of the senior leadership team. This includes Regional Heads, Executive Directors, Zonal Heads, the CEO, and

with their assigned clients, gathering valuable feedback, and providing updates on actions taken in response to 
previous feedback. The OYC programme fosters personalised engagement, ensuring a proactive approach to 
customer satisfaction.
•	
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Programme: Each month, Branch Heads are tasked with engaging 10–15 of their 
most important clients through face-to-face meetings. The goal is to collect feedback on services provided, discuss 
client concerns, and provide updates on actions taken based on the previous month’s input. This continuous feedback 
loop ensures that customer concerns are addressed promptly, helping build stronger, more trusting relationships.
•	
Customer Half-Yearly Survey: To further enhance our understanding of client needs and satisfaction, SIS conducts 
a Customer Half-Yearly Survey, where all major clients are sent an email with a link to a comprehensive survey. This 
survey seeks ratings and comments on various performance metrics. The responses are immediately reviewed 
by the Centralised Quality Control team, who analyze the data and share the findings with relevant stakeholders. 
This feedback informs decision-making and corrective actions. As of the most recent survey, SIS has received an 
impressive average rating of 8/10 from our clients.
