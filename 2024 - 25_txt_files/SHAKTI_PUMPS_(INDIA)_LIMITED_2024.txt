Energy 
Management
Risk 
Electricity is a major cost 
driver in manufacturing 
water pumps. Rising 
tariffs, unreliable grid 
supply, and dependence 
on non-renewable sources 
can increase operational 
costs and cause 
production delays.
The Company monitors 
and analyses energy 
usage, invests in energy-
efficient equipment, 
explores renewable energy 
adoption, and implements 
peak-load management 
strategies to reduce 
reliance on the grid.
Negative. 
*There has been 
no negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of FY 2024-
25.
2
Workforce Health & 
Safety
Risk
Employees face hazards 
from heavy machinery, 
high-voltage systems, and 
handling of bulky materials. 
Safety lapses can result 
in injuries, production 
stoppages, legal liabilities, 
and reputational damage.
The Company enforces 
strict safety protocols, 
conducts regular training, 
ensures the use of PPE, 
performs preventive 
equipment maintenance, 
and encourages proactive 
incident reporting.

subject to price volatility 
or geopolitical risks.

agreements, explores 
alternative materials,

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements.
	
At Shakti Pumps (India) Limited, we have always believed that sustainable growth is the only form of growth worth pursuing. 
Over the past year, we have worked towards integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles into every 
aspect of our operations, not as a compliance requirement but as a responsibility towards the communities we serve and the 
environment we share.
	
We operate in an industry that is both energy-intensive and deeply linked to rural livelihoods. This comes with unique 
challenges, from ensuring that our manufacturing processes become progressively energy efficient, to reducing our carbon 
footprint, to aligning our product portfolio with the country’s renewable energy and water conservation goals. Transitioning 
to cleaner technologies while maintaining cost competitiveness has been one of our key focus areas.
	
In the year under review, we made measurable progress. Our solar-powered pumping solutions continued to replace 
conventional diesel and electric pumps in rural and agricultural sectors, directly contributing to emission reduction. We 
have invested in upgrading our manufacturing lines to improve resource efficiency and reduce wastage. On the social front, 
through the Shakti Foundation, we have supported education initiatives and undertaken infrastructure development to 
benefit underprivileged communities.
	
Looking ahead, our targets are clear. We aim to achieve further reductions in specific energy consumption across our 
operations, expand our range of renewable energy-driven products, and deepen our engagement with suppliers to ensure 
sustainable practices across the value chain. These are ambitious goals, but they are necessary if we are to play our part in 
building a sustainable future.
	
ESG is not a parallel agenda for us; it is embedded in our business model. I am confident that with the collective commitment 
of our employees, partners and stakeholders, Shakti Pumps will continue to deliver value while upholding our responsibility 
to people and the planet.

           Yes. The Company has established procedures to ensure that sustainability is embedded within its procurement 
practices. All prospective vendors are subject to a due diligence process that evaluates compliance with environmental 
regulations, ethical labor standards, energy efficiency, waste management, and responsible resource utilization. 
Preference is accorded to suppliers demonstrating eco-friendly manufacturing processes, use of recyclable materials, 
and alignment with the Company’s ESG commitments.
	
            Further, regular supplier assessments and audits are undertaken to monitor performance against defined sustainability 
parameters, including carbon footprint, water usage, waste disposal practices, and adherence to human rights 
requirements. The Company also ensures that office infrastructure and consumables, such as air conditioners, comply 
with eco-friendly and ozone-friendly standards.
b.

The Company endeavors to source products and services that are environmentally responsible, energy-efficient, 
recycled, and locally procured, to the extent practicable. Vendors and suppliers are encouraged to comply with applicable 
regulations, including those relating to environmental protection and human rights. The Company also engages with 
suppliers to identify, mitigate, and manage sustainability risks across environmental, social (including modern slavery 
and human rights), and governance dimensions.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for

The Company is primarily engaged in the manufacture of steel pumps. Given the nature of such products, the direct utilization 
of recycled inputs or reuse of components during the manufacturing stage is inherently limited. The useful life of the 
Company’s products varies depending upon factors such as customer usage patterns, operating conditions, and associated 
allied activities.
	
Upon reaching the end of their operational life, certain products are capable of refurbishment or repair through authorized 
service centres, thereby extending their utility and minimizing premature disposal. To the extent feasible, end-of-life 
materials are directed towards safe recycling or disposal in accordance with applicable environmental regulations and 
industry standards.

5.	
Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.  
	
Yes, the entity has established a comprehensive Business Continuity and Disaster Management Plan. As part of this framework, 
detailed On-Site Emergency Plans (OSEPs) have been developed for all manufacturing facilities and office locations. These 
plans are designed to address a broad spectrum of potential emergency scenarios, including but not limited to fire incidents, 
chemical spills, equipment malfunctions, natural calamities, and other critical disruptions.
	
The primary objective of these plans is to ensure a state of readiness, enable prompt and effective response actions, and 
minimize operational disruptions. They are also focused on safeguarding employee health and safety, protecting physical and 
environmental assets, and ensuring continuity of critical business functions under adverse conditions.
6. 
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation 
or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard? 
	
The Company acknowledges that its value chain operations involve the extensive use of steel coils in the course of its 
manufacturing activities, which may potentially result in an adverse impact on the environment due to resource extraction 
and material consumption.
	
In order to mitigate such impact, the Company has instituted a closed-loop mechanism whereby all scrap and residual steel 
generated during the manufacturing process is mandatorily returned to the suppliers for reuse. This system ensures that raw 
material wastage is minimized and that recycling is effectively integrated within the supply chain.
	
By implementing the aforesaid measures, the Company not only advances the principles of a circular economy but also 
promotes efficient utilization of resources. This initiative substantially reduces the overall environmental footprint of the 
Company’s value chain and contributes to long-term sustainability in its manufacturing operations.
