lending are critical. Negative 
media coverage, data breaches,

can erode brand equity, reduce 
customer retention, and impact 
market share. Comprehensive 
customer grievance mechanism 
helps 
to 
identify 
potential 
threats to the company’s brand 
reputation.
A multi-layered risk mitigation 
strategy is in place, including 
robust cybersecurity frameworks, 
proactive communication policies 
including Most Important Terms 
and Conditions, compliance with 
customer 
grievance 
redressal 
norms and stringent adherence 
to RBI and SEBI guidelines.

Statement by director responsible for the BRSR report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievement:
At SBI Card, we embrace Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles not as peripheral commitments, but as central to 
building a resilient, responsible, and future-ready organization. In the past year, we took deliberate steps to strengthen our ESG foundation, 
including a refreshed materiality assessment that sharpened our strategic priorities and guided our actions across all dimensions of 
sustainability.
Across all dimensions of ESG, we made purposeful progress. We intensified our efforts to cut emissions, become more energy efficient, 
and align our operations with a low-carbon future. We also made a conscious shift toward more sustainable practices — from reducing 
physical materials to strengthening initiatives that empower and support our people and communities.
On the social side, we remain committed to developing a workplace that is more diverse, more inclusive, and more adaptable. We 
invested in strengthening skills, capabilities, and awareness across all levels of the organization, and we deepened our engagement with 
the communities we serve — extending education, health care, and other initiatives to help drive meaningful change.
Governance remained a key priority in our sustainability journey. We maintained robust controls, enhanced oversight mechanisms, 
and integrated consideration of ESG risks into our enterprise risk framework — reflecting our ongoing resolve to operate with fairness, 
integrity, and accountability.
As we move forward, we will continue to pursue a path of responsible growth — strengthening our ability to innovate, adapt, and 
contribute positively to society. Our material priorities will guide us, and our progress will be driven by collaboration, discipline, and a 
deep sense of responsibility toward all our stakeholders.
Thank You!

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
SBI Card being a NBFC is engaged in delivering financial services to its customers. Since it is not a product-based 
company, it does not require raw material purchase for operations. However, SBI Card believes in a sustainable growth 
and considers sustainable sourcing practices for its day-to-day operations consumption. The Company procures paper 
and plastic from local and authorised vendors after considering the environmental footprint of the materials being used.

a. 	
Plastics (including packaging)
	
	
SBI Card is a non-manufacturing, service-based financial institution. The primary source of plastic usage in SBI Card’s 
operations is plastic credit cards issued to customers. At the end of the card’s lifecycle (expired or blocked cards), 
customers are encouraged to cut and dispose of cards securely.
	
	
SBI Card has already initiated the adoption of rPVC (recycled PVC) cards, with a gradual rollout strategy to increase 
its share across the portfolio in the coming years.
	
b. 	
E-waste
	
	
SBI Card is a non-manufacturing, service-based financial institution. E-waste generated from IT assets (laptops, desktops, 
printers, networking devices, etc.) is handled through government-authorized e-waste recyclers, in full compliance with 
the E-Waste (Management) Rules.
	
c. 	
Hazardous waste
	
	
SBI Card’s operations do not generate hazardous waste in the traditional industrial sense. However, if any small-scale 
hazardous waste is generated (e.g., used batteries), these are disposed of through specialized vendors authorized to 
handle such waste safely.
	
d. 	
Other waste
	
	
SBI Card is a non-manufacturing, service-based financial institution. The company undertakes initiatives to reduce paper 
waste, including promotion of e-statements, digital onboarding, and online servicing. General office waste is segregated 
at offices and is handed over to local municipal or authorized recycling partners.

As SBI Card does not engage in the manufacture, sale, transition, storage, or processing of e-waste or electrical and electronic

primary card offerings. As a result, we are gradually transitioning to using recycled PVC (rPVC) to significantly reduce the 
environmental impact associated with the card production.

Principle 4
Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	To enhance stakeholder engagement, we implemented a robust mechanism guided by the principles of inclusion, materiality,
and responsiveness for identifying and prioritizing stakeholders. We classified stakeholder groups based on their significance
to our business and their roles in both upstream and downstream processes, as well as their relationships within internal
and external environments. The following steps were taken to identify relevant stakeholder groups:
1.
Internal Brainstorming: We engaged management at all levels to establish criteria for stakeholders by addressing key
questions, such as:
•
Who are the individuals, groups, or institutions interested in our core operations?
•
	Who stands to benefit from our core operations and activities?
•
Who may be adversely affected by our core operations?
•
	Who possesses the power to influence our organizational activities, particularly our core operations?
2.
Identification of Stakeholders: Using the established criteria, we identified individuals and entities (both internal and
external) that influence or are impacted by our core operations and activities.
3.
Determining Engagement Modes: For each identified group, we defined the mode of engagement—such as
discussions, written communication, stakeholder meetings, or sustainability reports—and established the frequency of
these interactions.
4.
Segregation of Stakeholders: We categorized stakeholders based on their level of impact, frequency of interactions,
communication methods, interest in core operations, and influence on our activities.
5.
Mapping and Consensus: We mapped the stakeholder groups along with their modes and frequencies of engagement,
obtaining consensus from senior management on the identified groups.
6.
Development of a Stakeholder Engagement Plan: We aim to refine this process into a comprehensive 'stakeholder
engagement plan' that will serve as a blueprint for future communications and engagement strategies.
	This structured approach ensures that we effectively engage with our stakeholders, fostering meaningful relationships and 
enhancing our organizational responsiveness.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
As part of its commitment to sustainability, SBI Card has implemented a series of energy-efficient initiatives aimed at reducing 
its carbon footprint and enhancing operational efficiency. A major milestone was achieved at the Chennai office, where a 
transition to renewable energy took place in November 2024. In collaboration with the building owner and a green energy 
provider, solar power is now being sourced. This shift has enabled approximately 60–80% of the Chennai office’s electricity 
consumption to be met through renewable sources. As a result, the company recorded a reduction of around 1,05,000 
kilograms of CO₂ emissions compared to the previous year. This initiative underscores SBI Card’s focus on adopting clean 
energy solutions as a key pillar of its ESG strategy.

In addition to the Chennai renewable energy project, SBI Card has introduced several energy optimization measures across 
its offices. At the Gurgaon headquarters, energy-efficient microwave units were installed in the cafeteria to lower electricity 
usage. Further, in critical operational areas such as the hub rooms, the number of Precision Air Conditioning (PAC) units in 
use was reduced from two to one without compromising performance. PAC runtime cycles were also extended from 4 to 8 
hours to reduce short cycling, thereby minimizing energy spikes and enhancing system longevity.
	
Another significant measure involved optimizing the operational hours of Air Handling Units (AHUs) based on actual 
occupancy. Their daily runtime was reduced from 11–12 hours to 8–9 hours, ensuring energy is not wasted during non-peak 
periods. Moreover, the Facilities and CSR–ESG teams jointly initiated the “Lights Out for a Greener Tomorrow” campaign to 
promote awareness and behavioral change toward energy conservation across all offices.
	
Collectively, these initiatives led to energy savings of approximately 1,30,000 kWh and a further reduction of around 
1,06,600 kilograms in Scope 2 CO₂ emissions. These actions reflect SBI Card’s broader commitment to sustainability through 
continuous improvement in energy performance, reinforcing its role as an environmentally responsible organization.

Usage of 
Renewable Energy
In November 2024, SBI Card’s Chennai office marked a significant step forward in its 
sustainability journey by transitioning to renewable energy. Partnering with the building 
owner and a solar energy provider, the office began sourcing power from a photovoltaic 
(PV) plant. This initiative has allowed renewable energy to meet nearly 60–80% of the 
site’s electricity needs. As a direct outcome, the Chennai location achieved an estimated 
reduction of 1,05,000 kilograms of CO₂ emissions compared to the previous year—
demonstrating the tangible environmental benefits of clean energy adoption.
