26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Various material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that 
present a risk or an opportunity to the Company’s business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the 
risk along-with its financial implications, are indicated below:

In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
In corporate governance, key 
issues for the AMC sector include 
those related to ethical and 
responsible business conduct, 
anti-bribery measures, and 
compliance with evolving 
regulatory requirements and 
disclosures. The dynamic nature 
of the regulatory landscape, 
markets, and product offerings 
poses a risk of insufficient 
understanding and prompt 
response to these changes. 
Moreover, the growing emphasis 
on governance, compliance, and 
ESG disclosures necessitates the 
Company’s attention to emerging 
ESG-related risks.
The Company has established a comprehensive 
framework on corporate governance, featuring 
well-documented policies, including Board level 
Committees and control mechanisms to ensure 
effective oversight.
Negative:
In the event of challenges 
arising in the Management of 
the Company’s governance 
practices and adherence to 
compliance-based or regulatory 
requirements, there is a 
potential for a negative impact 
on the Company, affecting 
reputation and performance of 
the Company amongst others.
Risk 
Management
Opportunity The Company views effective risk 
management as a crucial element 
of business management, 
essential for achieving business 
goals and objectives. In the 
course of business, the Company 
encounters various risks, 
including strategic, investment, 
operational, and ESG-related risks 
and opportunities. Over time, 
the Company has continuously 
enhanced its Risk Management 
Framework to monitor and 
mitigate these risks. There is 
an ongoing opportunity for the 
Company to continue to update 
its risk management framework 
and associated practices and 
policies, to adapt and align them 
with regulatory requirements 
and the evolving landscape of 
the AMC industry.
Supported by well-established protocols and 
processes, the Company has established a 
resilient enterprise risk management framework. 
This framework incorporates strategies and 
protocols for risk identification, risk assessment, 
risk response, and an overarching risk 
management strategy.
Through the implementation of this robust risk 
management framework, the Company has 
showcased its dedication to ethical conduct 
and good governance across its business and 
operations. In addition to adhering to regulatory 
requirements, the Company has proactively 
incorporated industry best practices in risk 
management.
Positive:
The Company’s risk management 
systems and procedures 
highlight its dedication to ethical 
operations and profitable 
functioning while adhering 
to best practices, applicable 
laws, rules, and regulations. 
These systems aim to provide 
reasonable, though not 
absolute, assurance against 
material misstatements or 
loss. They also ensure the 
safeguarding of assets, the 
maintenance of accurate 
accounting records, the reliability 
of financial information, 
and the identification and 
management of business risks.

Human 
Capital
Opportunity/
Risk
Opportunity:
Consistently investing in the 
growth and development of 
people aligns them with business 
strategies and creates a strong 
competitive advantage. Human 
resources are of key importance 
not only in driving performance 
but also in retaining talent, 
ensuring continuity, reducing 
onboarding costs, and building 
deep institutional knowledge. 
This results in faster execution, 
better client outcomes, and 
a resilient, high-performing 
workforce.
Risk:
Talent retention, health and 
well-being challenges, regulatory 
and compliance risk such as 
workplace safety, diversity 
requirements.
The Company has implemented robust 
mechanisms to prevent non-compliances and 
conduct trainings to ensure workplace safety. 
Learning and Development Programmes are 
conducted to ensure upskilling of employees, 
including regular sessions on skill development, 
mental health and well-being, and Prevention 
of Sexual Harassment (POSH). These initiatives 
aim to foster a safe, supportive, and inclusive 
work environment while ensuring continuous 
employee growth.
Positive:
Retention of talented human 
resources increases productivity 
and reduces cost of re-hiring. 
A talented workforce enhances 
the Company’s reputation.
Customer 
Satisfaction 
and 
Relationship 
Management
Risk
As the Company offers financial 
products and services across 
diverse customer segments 
nationwide, any adverse effect 
on customer satisfaction or 
experience has the potential to 
directly influence the Company’s 
brand, reputation, and efforts 
to retain or expand its customer 
base. In this context, a negative 
impact may arise from a lack 
of transparency or adherence 
to responsible and ethical 
practices in selling, marketing, 
and disclosing information 
about its products.
To address customer escalations or grievances, 
the Company has implemented robust system 
and processes. This includes a dedicated 
grievance redressal system with an escalation 
matrix defined for the automatic and swift 
progression of grievances to the next level. 
These grievances may cover topics including 
the marketing and sale of specific products, 
and information disclosures related to 
these products.
The Company places a strong emphasis on ethical 
and responsible behavior by its representatives 
in operations, marketing, and selling practices. 
The Company ensures that key employee groups 
responsible for managing marketing and sales 
adhere to ethical marketing and selling practices 
throughout all stages of the product sales cycle.
In alignment with these principles, the Company 
consistently prioritizes delivering a seamless 
customer experience and ensuring customer 
satisfaction. Placing effective customer service 
and care at the core of its ethos remains a key 
priority for the Company.
Negative:
Issues in managing or ensuring 
customer satisfaction and 
a positive overall customer 
experience can potentially result 
in a decline in the Company’s 
active customer base and 
adversely impact its reputation 
in the industry.
