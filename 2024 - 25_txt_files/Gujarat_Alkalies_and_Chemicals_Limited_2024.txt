1
Climate 
Change
R
The Company 
may encounter 
Significant 
environmental risks 
due to climate 
change, including 
water scarcity and 
extreme weather 
events. 
The Company has chosen to adopt climate-
resilient infrastructure and has developed 
effective strategies to ensure continuous 
business operations. Additionally, The 
Company has participated in initiatives 
such as the Vadodara Jal Sanchay and 
has implemented desalination for water 
usage at Dahej.
N
2
Energy 
Consumption
R
Higher energy 
consumption poses 
significant risks to 
a company like 
The Company 
from environmental 
and financial 
perspectives. It 
increases the 
greenhouse gas 
emissions, resulting 
in a negative 
image of the 
company. This 
can also impact 
the company's 
efficient energy 
management.
The Company has implemented controls 
and procedures to effectively monitor and 
manage energy consumption across its 
operations, regularly tracking energy usage 
to ensure efficiency. In FY 2024-25, we 
entered into Power Purchase Agreements 
(PPA) with Tata Power for renewable 
power supply from a 70 MW solar plant 
and with NVVNL for supply from a 50 MW 
solar plant. The Company achieved 40% 
of its total power from renewable sources 
in FY 2024-25, with a target to reach 45% 
renewable input by FY 2025-26 and 80% 
beyond FY 2027-28.
N
3
GHG & Air 
Emission
R
Higher carbon 
emissions 
substantially 
contribute to 
air pollution 
and adverse 
environmental 
impact.
The Company has begun transitioning to 
renewable energy sources to reduce its 
carbon footprint and emissions.
N
52nd Annual Report 2024-25
54
This has 
significant risks 
to the Company 
from regulatory 
and reputational 
perspective. 
During this period, 40 of The Company’s 
power came from renewable sources, with 
plans to increase to 45 by FY 2025-26 
and 80 by FY 2027-28.
4
Renewable 
Energy
O
The Company is 
gradually shifting 
towards renewable 
energy, which 
will help reduce 
operating costs, 
increase profitability, 
and meet regulatory 
compliances 
through reduced 
emissions. 
The Company has installed 171.45 MW 
capacity wind farms, 35 MW solar power 
plants, 732 kW floating solar power plant 
and a1 MW DC rooftop solar power plant for 
Vadodara and Dahej complex. The Company 
has also installed 6.5 MW capacity and 
275 kW capacity back pressure turbines at 
Dahej and Vadodara complex respectively. 
Further, hybrid power installations of 62.7 
MW capacity are also under construction. 
In the year 2024-25, we have done PPA 
with NVVNL and Tata Power for purchase 
of Solar power from their 50 MW & 70 
MW solar power installations respectively. 
P
5
Water 
consumption 
and waste 
generation
R
Water consumption 
in an excessive 
quantity is a 
potential risk 
for a chemical 
company. This 
will impact water 
availability leading 
to water scarcity, 
and dependency 
on local water 
supplies. Further, 
this will be resulting 
in environmental 
concerns, 
reputational damage 
and cost escalation 
in the company’s 
reputation.
vWaste generation 
poses risk 
to regulatory 
compliances and 
increases operating 
costs.”
The Company has recycled 5,10,093 .l of 
water by treating wastewater for the year 
2024-25.
The Company has committed to responsible 
water usage by closely monitoring water 
withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. A 
portion of the water is recycled and reused. 
The Company plans to purify the sewage 
water from Vadodara Municipal Corporation 
for reuse in its plant. To minimize evaporation 
losses, a floating solar power plant has 
been installed on one of its water reservoirs. 
Additionally, The Company is participating 
in a desalination project initiated by GIDC 
at Dahej, with a capacity of 100 MLD of 
water, of which The Company’s share is 
10 MLD. This meets approximately 75-80 
of the water requirements at the Dahej 
complex with desalinated water, thereby 
reducing reliance on surface water and 
groundwater.
The Company has installed RO plants at 
Vadodara and Dahej to recycle effluents 
for the water usage with capacity of 800 
.LD & 3300 .LD respectively.
N
6
Compliance 
Management
R
Any non-compliance 
to the statutory 
requirements by 
the Company 
may result into 
disruptions in 
operations, 
penalties, and loss 
of reputation.
In this FY 2024-25, The Company has 
been 100 compliant with all the statutory 
compliances.
The Company has established a system to 
track and manage all statutory compliances 
through a Compliance Management System.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
 
Established in 1973, in its 52nd year since inception, Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Limited (GACL) has 
witnessed another productive and eventful year in the chemical manufacturing sector, striving towards a 
sustainable future. The Company has consistently placed a strong emphasis on the well-being of both people 
and the planet in its business pursuits, resulting in sustained operations in a highly competitive market. The 
Company has a track record of giving importance to its core values, which enabled it to be an undisputed 
leader in chemical manufacturing segments where it operates. The Company has grown into one of the 
leaders with an aggregate capacity of 8,52,750 MTA of caustic soda from the modest beginning made in 
1976 at 37,425 MTA. 
 
The Company is deeply committed to integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles 
into its core operations. The Company prioritizes ethical conduct, upholds rigorous standards for its products 
and processes, and consistently seeks avenues for improvements directed towards conservation of natural 
resources. The Company diligently adheres to pertinent regulations and steadfastly works towards nurturing 
a sustainable and promising future.

Transparency and Governance:
 
The Company is committed towards robust corporate governance through high ethical standards, integrity, 
excellence, and responsibility. The Company ensures stringent ethical standards across all its interactions, 
prioritizing transparency, honesty, and fairness in its every endeavour. 
 
True to our commitment, in FY 2024-25, there have been no instances of corruption or conflicts of interest.
 
Learning, & Development and Innovation:
 
The Company embraces continuous learning and development as a catalyst for driving innovation within 
its operations. This commitment to ongoing learning has facilitated the integration of new technologies and 
enhanced process efficiencies, resulting into reduced wastages and a more environmentally responsible 
approach. Consequently, these endeavours have led to optimized operational costs for the company.
 
As part of its long-term strategy to increase in-house chlorine consumption, the Company commissioned a 
30 .TPA Chlorotoluenes Project at Dahej, producing benzyl chloride, benzaldehyde, and benzyl alcohol. The 
plant was successfully commissioned on March 29, 2025, in the august presence of Hon’ble Chief Minister 
of Gujarat and the first dispatch occurred on April 21, 2025.  The first consignments of Benzyl Alcohol and 
Benzaldehyde from Dahej were done on 05.07.2025. 
 
The Company’s water conservation efforts include equity participation in Vadodara -al Sanchay Private Limited 
for funding the Tertiary Treatment of Waste Water (TTWW) project.
 
As a part of its R&D efforts, the Company has developed improved processes for manufacturing high-
purity guaiacol, cold-water-soluble methyl cellulose, High Purity Vanillin, Cold Water-Soluble Hydroxy Propyl 
Methyl Cellulose. In addition to this, it has also developed an improved process for the crystallization for 
manufacturing sodium percarbonate powder treating sodium cyanide-containing liquid effluent on Industrial scale. 
Also, the Company has developed an improved process to produce hydrazine hydrate, for which commercial 
production has already commenced. Contributing towards vAatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyanw, GACL has up a 
plant to manufacture Hydrazine Hydrate (N2-H4.H2O) for which our country is mostly dependent on imports 
from other countries. The indigenous environment-friendly technology developed by us is our contribution 
towards the dream of our nation i.e., vMake in Indiaw. For this, we had collaborated with the Indian Institute 
of Chemical Technology (Hyderabad), one of the leading CSIR laboratories, and have received joint patents 
in India and 8SA for this process. The plant, based on indigenously developed and patented technology, is 
currently under stabilization for optimized operations.
 
The Company implemented a water recycling plan and water conservation strategies overseen by the Research 
and Development (R&D) Department. It has developed In-house Scale Corrosion Inhibitors (i.e Scalewins) and 
Biocides (i.e. Biowins) formulations, serving as scale corrosion inhibitors and biocides, respectively, to manage 
scale, corrosion, fouling and biological growth in the cooling water system. Tailored formulations are applied 
for the treatment of the cooling water systems, with technical support provided by the R&D team. These 
formulations play a critical role in mitigating scale and corrosion in the cooling water system, contributing to 
significant water conservation efforts by increasing the cycle of concentration (COC) of cooling towers. This 
treatment has successfully enabled the achievement of a high COC.
 
The Company has invested in a joint desalination water plant to meet most of its water requirement at its 
Dahej Complex, thereby conserving surface and ground water for agriculture purpose.
 
GACL hosted a sectoral workshop on vBest Practices in Energy Efficiency in the Chlor-Alkali Sector: A Path 
for Decarbonization,w under the 8.-India Technical Assistance Programme, ASPIRE, initiated by the Foreign 
Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), 8. Government, in collaboration with the Bureau of Energy 
Efficiency, Ministry of Power, Government of India, at its Dahej complex.
 
Efficient Supply chain
 
The Company procures a substantial volume of raw materials from a large number of Micro, Small and 
Medium-sized Enterprises (MSME) within India. One of the primary raw materials i.e. salt, is sourced from 
nearby MSMEs. The Company capacitated these salt producers for efficient salt farming and the production 
of high-quality salt. These arrangements not only ensure the best quality requiring minimum consumption of 
chemicals for further purifications, but also a dependable supply chain. Further, the Company benefits from 
its close proximity to rail, road, and sea transportation infrastructure, allowing cost-effective transportation 
of products to distant locations. Additionally, the Company has established a robust nationwide network of 
dealers, serving as extended arms of the Company to reach all end-users. Moreover, the company caters 
to nearby customers through dedicated pipelines.

Diversified Energy Sourcing:
 
Environmental stewardship is central to Company’s operations, guiding our efforts to reduce our ecological 
footprint and promote sustainability. Through innovative practices and responsible resource management, we 
strive to safeguard the environment for future generations.
 
Our commitment is evident as Company is actively advancing by development and commencement of a 75 
MW Group Captive Solar Power Plant in collaboration with GIPCL and GSFC, which includes the phased 
commissioning of 25 MW on 24.04.2025 and an additional 50 MW on 26.06.2025. To enhance renewable 
power sourcing in the short and medium term, strategic arrangements are made with NTPC Vidut Vyapar 
Nigam Limited, Tata Power, and Kreate Energy. Additionally, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is formed 
with Aditya Birla Renewable Energy to secure 62.7 MW of hybrid power for captive use, anticipated to 
be operational by January, 2026. In pursuit of further expansion, the Company has invited expressions of 
interest from reputable renewable energy developers for a 75 MW hybrid power plant in SPV mode, which is 
currently under evaluation and agreements expected to be concluded in the second quarter of FY 2025-26. 
Furthermore, an MOU with GMDC has been signed to explore additional 60 MW renewable Plant in SPV 
mode, emphasizing GACL’s commitment to sustainable energy solutions.
 
GACL has attained a 40% share of renewable energy in its power mix, with a target to increase this to 
45% by FY 2025-26 and 80% beyond FY 2027-28.
 
Promoting Well-Being: 
 
The health and safety of our employees and the surrounding community are top priorities at GACL, particularly 
due to the inherent risks associated with handling chemicals. We rigorously adhere to safety protocols and 
regulations to prevent accidents and protect the environment. By investing in comprehensive training and 
state-of-the-art safety equipment, we ensure a secure workplace that minimizes hazards. Our commitment to 
health and safety not only safeguards our people and operations but also reinforces trust among stakeholders 
and regulatory bodies. As of March 31, 2025, our Vadodara complex impressively achieved 976 days without 
accidents, while Dahej Complex-1 and Dahej Complex-2 reached 654 and 958 accident-free days, respectively.
 
Responsible Corporate Citizenship:
 
GACL believes in the importance of community development. To create a positive and enduring impact on 
society, the Company has undertaken various CSR projects through its CSR arm viz. GACL Foundation 
Trust. Those projects include the promotion of education, HMDC/Special children, Health, Nutrition Hygiene & 
sanitation, Sustainable livelihood & Skill development, promotion of Art Culture & Heritage, Water conservation 
and Environmental projects.
 
Additionally, we focus on projects that improve human development indices. In our educational projects, we 
address rural infrastructure gaps by constructing and refurbishing Anganwadis and enhancing the quality of 
education and mid-day meals.
 
To become a model organization in social work, we are dedicated to the holistic growth and sustainable 
development of communities, emphasizing social upliftment. We prioritize growth that encompasses development 
in environmental, social, and governance areas. Our environmental initiatives include developing green belts, 
preventing soil erosion, implementing rainwater harvesting, and installing renewable energy sources. Our 
sustained growth over the past half-century is a testament to our holistic approach. We intend to continue 
advancing our business while contributing to the growth and upliftment of all our stakeholders, remaining 
committed to sustainability through these efforts.
 
As GACL moves forward, the Company remains dedicated to growth across environmental, social, and 
governance fronts. GACL aims to continue delivering on its commitment to sustainability, enhancing lives, 
and nurturing the environment, ensuring that progress benefits all stakeholders.
