Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your

manage such wastes.
Since we operate as a non-manufacturing entity, our waste production is kept to a minimum. Our waste stream is free from 
any hazardous or toxic chemicals. Furthermore, any electronic waste (e-waste) we generate is meticulously managed by 
certified and reputable e-waste vendors and organizations, guaranteeing the implementation of appropriate disposal and 
recycling methods.
To further reduce our environmental impact, we prioritize digital processes, thereby minimizing paper usage in our day-to-
day activities. Additionally, all e-waste generated is responsibly handled through registered and reputable e-waste vendors 
and agencies, ensuring proper disposal and recycling practices.
Our Company does not produce any hazardous or toxic chemicals, further exemplifying our commitment to environmental 
responsibility.
