*Coal India Limited (CIL) allocates coal linkages directly to end-users in both the power and non-power sectors to meet their long-term coal requirements. 
Consequently, there is no involvement of intermediaries or dealers in this process. However, under the e-auction mechanism, any Indian buyer—including 
traders—is eligible to participate and procure coal. Therefore, CIL does not operate through a dealer or distribution network for the sale of coal.

Coal India Limited operates primarily in the extraction and supply of coal, which is 
a bulk commodity sold without conventional consumer packaging. The company's 
core business model involves direct supply of coal to power plants, steel plants, 
and other industrial consumers through railways and conveyor systems, eliminating 
the need for product packaging that would require end-of-life reclamation. As coal 
is consumed entirely in the production process at customer facilities, there are no 
residual product materials or packaging components that return to the company 
for reuse, recycling, or disposal. Therefore, this disclosure requirement pertaining 
to product and packaging reclamation is not applicable to the company's 
operational framework and business model.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the 
environment, arising from the value chain of the 
entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures 
have been taken by the entity in this regard? 
	
The Company primarily utilizes coal sourced from CIL 
as the main fuel for its Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) 
to generate electricity. However, recognizing the 
environmental impacts associated with this process—
such as air pollutants and fly ash—the Company has 
implemented measures to mitigate these effects.
	
To significantly reduce air pollution, the Company has 
equipped its TPPs with Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) 
and Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) units, ensuring 
cleaner emissions. Additionally, the fly ash generated 
during power production is repurposed rather than 
wasted. It is extensively utilized in industries such as 
cement manufacturing and brick production, as well 
as for filling voids and road construction, supporting 
sustainable waste management efforts.
	
These initiatives reflect the Company’s dedication to 
minimizing environmental impact while maintaining 
efficient energy production.

utilizing mechanisms such as the Samadhan Cell and CPGRAMS to handle grievances effectively.
	
At the district level, Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) Cells operate under the guidance of the District Collector, while 
Grievance Redressal Committees are established at project sites. Each grievance undergoes thorough examination by 
relevant departmental officers. In Odisha, the Company adheres to the Odisha Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Policy 
of 2006, ensuring structured resolution through Rehabilitation and Peripheral Development Advisory Committees (RPDACs) 
and sub-committees led by District Collectors.
	
This comprehensive grievance redressal framework reinforces the Company’s commitment to transparency, accountability, 
and stakeholder satisfaction.

Independent Assurance Practitioners' Statement 
To,  
Coal India Limited Limited 
Premise No-04 MAR, Plot No-AF-III, Action Area-1A, Newtown, Rajarhat, 
Kolkata-700156. 
JointValues ESG Services Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “JointValues”) 
was appointed and engaged by the management of Coal India Limited

performance disclosed by the Coal India Limited in the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the ‘reporting period’ 
April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025  considering related regulation3, 4, 5, 6 for listed 
entities issued by the SEBI.  
JointValues performed the engagement through a multidisciplinary team of 
experienced professionals and subject-matter specialists, on attributes 
pertaining to environmental, social, and governance performance of the 
Company reported through BRSR Core, to obtain sufﬁcient evidences to 
support the professional judgement,  and provide the basis for conducting 
reasonable assurance within the deﬁned scope and boundary of the 
engagement.  
The Assurance team applied professional judgement, skills, and techniques 
with professional scepticism in a systematic engagement process to arrive at 
an independent opinion about the subject matters within the scope and 
boundary of the engagement.

JointValues conducted this reasonable assurance of the company in 
accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). 
JointValues conducted the engagement process with adherence to ethical 
requirements, professional standards, and compliance with applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements, in line with the International Standards on 
Quality Management (ISQM), Quality Management for Firms that Perform 
Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements or Other Assurance or Related 
Services Engagement issued by IAASB.  
During 
the 
engagement, 
the 
assurance 
team 
complied 
with the 
JointValues’s Code of Conduct, that deﬁnes independence and other ethical 
requirements and aligns with the best practices and the International Code 
of Ethics (ICE) for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board 
for Accountants (IESBA). 
The scope of this engagement, as agreed upon by JointValues and the 
company, was to provide Reasonable assurance on the non-ﬁnancial 
sustainability disclosure covered under nine core attributes of the BRSR Core 
format, as provided by the company to JointValues in the BRSR format. The 
values related to the nine core attributes of BRSR Core as provided by the 
company are mentioned in Annexure-I to the assurance statement. 
The reporting boundary of the company’s BRSR is “consolidated basis” as 
disclosed in Question 13 of Section A of the SEBI’s BRSR format for the 
reporting period from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. 
Limitations and Exclusions 
- 
Reducing engagement risk to zero is rarely attainable; therefore, 
“reasonable assurance” is less than absolute assurance. 
- 
Preparing the company's BRSR information requires management to 
set the criteria, decide what information is relevant to include, and

make 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
that 
impact 
the 
reported 
information.  
- 
Calculating and measuring certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, 
such as GHG emissions, water, waste and energy footprint, involves 
assumptions/estimations and inherent measurement uncertainty. 
Even though we obtain sufﬁcient appropriate evidence to support our 
opinion, it does not eliminate the uncertainty in these amounts and 
metrics. 
- 
Evaluation, veriﬁcation and assessment of any company's ﬁnancial 
performance and data have been out of the scope of this engagement, 
except relying on the company's third-party audited ﬁnancial reports 
as provided to us during the course of engagement, wherever 
materially required concerning the nine core attributes of the BRSR 
core. The assurance does not cover the Company's statements that 
express opinions, claims, beliefs, aspirations, expectations, aims, or 
future intentions. Additionally, assertions related to Intellectual 
Property Rights and other competitive issues are beyond the scope of 
this assurance. 
- 
Aspects of the BRSR and the data and information (qualitative or 
quantitative) other than the Identiﬁed Sustainability Information. 
- 
The assessment does not include a review of the Company's strategy 
or other related linkages expressed in the Report. These aspects are 
not within the scope of the assurance engagement. 
- 
The assurance does not extend to mapping the BRSR with reporting 
frameworks other than those speciﬁcally mentioned. This engagement 
does not consider assessments or comparisons with frameworks 
beyond the speciﬁed ones. 
- 
The absence of a signiﬁcant body of established practice on which to 
draw to evaluate and measure non-ﬁnancial information allows for 
different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and 
can affect comparability between entities. 
Procedures Followed:

Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures 
listed above, we have:

relevant 
personnel

subject matter as per SEBI Circular for BRSR Core.

materiality thresholds used by the Company for data analysis. 
● Performed analytical procedures to analyse trends in the historical 
data and accordingly ascertain the reasonableness of the data 
reported in the current year.

sustainability indicators, to verify that the data had been appropriately 
measured with the underlying documents recorded, collated and 
reported, including returns and internal monitoring reports ﬁled to 
various authorities by the company and relied upon by us. This 
includes 
assessing 
records 
and 
performing 
testing, 
including 
recalculation of sample data. 
The selection of the assurance approach was based on our professional 
judgment, considering the nature, timing, data availability, evidence 
produced and the extent required to assess the risks of the information for 
material misstatement or deliberate misrepresentation by the company. Our 
opinion on the continuing effectiveness of the company's internal controls is 
out of the scope of this assurance statement. Our responsibilities under
