Governance, leadership and oversight
7. .Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
At Bajaj Healthcare Limited, we recognize that long-term business resilience depends on 
how effectively we integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into 
our operations and decision-making. The pharmaceutical sector is faced with challenges 
ranging from climate change impacts, resource efficiency, and regulatory compliance to 
ensuring product quality, occupational safety, and transparent governance. These issues 
present both risks and opportunities that shape the way we operate
During FY 2024–25, we strengthened our response to climate and environmental risks 
through structured disaster management plans, investments in solar energy, effluent 
treatment and Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) initiatives, and measures to optimize resource 
efficiency. We continued to improve energy efficiency, waste management, and water 
recycling across our facilities. On the social front, we reinforced occupational health and 
safety through comprehensive management systems, detailed SOPs, safety committees, 
and regular trainings, ensuring zero fatalities and a strong culture of safety across all units. 
We also enhanced inclusivity by ensuring accessibility of workplaces, embedding equal 
opportunity principles in our Code of Conduct, and investing in skill-building initiatives for 
our workforce.
From a governance perspective, we maintained our focus on ethical business practices, 
transparent reporting, and compliance with national and international standards such as 
ISO, WHO–GMP, FSSC 22000, and HACCP. We also strengthened stakeholder engagement 
through structured dialogue with employees, communities, customers, regulators, and 
suppliers, ensuring their feedback informs our sustainability roadmap.
Looking ahead, our targets are centered on further reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
expanding renewable energy adoption, achieving Zero Liquid Discharge across all units, 
and strengthening digital security and ESG compliance frameworks. We will continue to 
align our efforts with the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) 
and global best practices, while driving innovation in sustainable Active Pharmaceutical 
Ingredient (API) manufacturing and community-focused initiatives.
As we progress on this journey, we remain committed to creating long-term value for all 
stakeholders while upholding the highest standards of responsibility, transparency, and 
sustainability

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for:
	
(a)	
Plastics (including packaging)-
	
	
The Company encourages the reuse and safe disposal of plastic packaging waste generated during operations. Discarded containers, 
bags, and liners are segregated, collected, and sent for reuse or are sold to authorized recyclers as per applicable norms. The waste 
is managed under approved vendor agreements and follows Rule 9 compliance for plastic waste management.
	
(b)

The Company’s operations generate minimal electronic waste, any obsolete or discarded electronic components are collected 
and disposed of through authorised e-waste recyclers in line with the E-Waste (Management) Rules. The Company ensures secure 
handling and maintains traceability records for such disposals.
	
(c)	
Hazardous waste-
	
	
A detailed and unit-wise SOP is in place across all major sites (Formulation, Panoli, Savli, and Tarapur) for the collection, segregation, 
packaging, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. Key measures include:
	
•	
Segregation of hazardous waste into defined categories such as ETP sludge, spent carbon, used oil, solvents, process residues, etc.
	
•	
Use of properly labelled containers and polybags for safe internal transfer.
	
•	
Temporary storage in designated hazardous waste storage areas within the premises.
	
•	
Final disposal through authorized waste management service providers either via incineration, recycling, co-processing in cement 
kilns, or re-use within premises where feasible.
	
(d)	
Other waste-
	
	
Non-hazardous waste such as general scrap, filters, and cotton waste is collected and disposed of responsibly. Cotton waste is 
typically incinerated on-site, while reusable materials are channelled to authorized recyclers. The Company ensures that all disposal 
practices comply with local environmental regulations and internal EHS protocols.

plastic waste equivalent to the volume generated by its packaging and products.
	
The EPR action plan has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and is 
aligned with the annual waste return requirements. The Company has partnered with authorised plastic waste processors to ensure 
collection, transportation, and end-of-life processing of the identified categories of plastic waste. This ensures both legal compliance and 
environmental accountability.
	
The Company continues to monitor its EPR obligations closely and updates its implementation strategy in line with regulatory changes to 
maintain full alignment with state and central pollution control authorities.

Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the 
coverage such system?
	
Yes, the Company has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) across all 
operational units. The system ensures compliance with statutory EHS requirements, proactive identification and mitigation of 
workplace risks, and continuous improvement through structured audits and training. A cross-functional Safety Committee comprising 
representatives from Production, Maintenance, Engineering, Purchase, and Stores along with elected worker representatives monitors 
safety implementation at each unit. The Company conducts periodic internal safety audits, quarterly safety committee meetings, and 
regular trainings focused on high-risk tasks to foster a culture of safety.
	
The OHSMS encompasses all routine and non-routine activities, including production, processing, maintenance, chemical handling, 
equipment installation, waste disposal, and emergency preparedness. Each site has implemented tailored safety protocols supported 
by detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
	
This integrated approach ensures full OHSMS coverage across all employees and workers, regardless of location.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
c.	
The Company employs a robust, multi-tiered approach to hazard identification and risk assessment as part of its Occupational Health 
and Safety Management System (OHSMS). For routine operations, hazards are identified through Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), internal safety inspections, and incident investigations. Dedicated Safety Officers use 
standardized checklists and site-specific tools to monitor compliance and identify unsafe practices. Feedback mechanisms such as 
worker observations and safety suggestion channels supplement these formal processes.
	
For non-routine activities including equipment installation, maintenance shutdowns, or process changes, the Company uses a 
structured Work Permit System backed by detailed pre-job safety assessments. These controls are reinforced through periodic HAZOP 
studies and mock drills to test emergency preparedness.
	
This comprehensive and location-specific framework ensures early risk detection and mitigation across both routine and exceptional 
scenarios.
d.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes, the Company has a clearly defined and well-communicated process for workers to report work-related hazards and to disengage 
from imminent risk situations without fear of retaliation. This is embedded within the Company’s Occupational Health & Safety 
Management System (OHSMS), ensuring that employees and contract workers can report unsafe conditions through verbal reporting 
to supervisors, designated safety officers, or formal written records.

These mechanisms are reinforced through regular safety training and awareness sessions. Workers are encouraged and empowered to 
remove themselves from hazardous conditions until corrective actions are taken, thereby upholding a strong safety culture.
e.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
Yes, the Company provides access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services across all its units as part of its broader 
employee welfare initiatives. Employees and workers are covered under health and wellness programs that include periodic general 
medical check-ups, access to onsite first-aid facilities, emergency medical support, and consultations at designated hospitals with 
whom formal agreements are in place.
	
These services extend beyond occupational requirements and are designed to promote holistic health and well-being for all categories 
of the workforce.

11.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
The Company has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) across all its 
operational units to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all employees and workers. This system is designed not 
only to meet statutory requirements but also to foster a proactive culture of safety and well-being throughout the organization. The 
OHSMS is guided by a dedicated Safety Committee at each site, comprising representatives from departments such as Production, 
Maintenance, R&D, and Stores, along with elected worker representatives. These committees conduct periodic reviews to monitor 
safety performance, evaluate incident trends, and identify opportunities for continuous improvement.
	
The Company undertakes structured hazard identification and risk assessment exercises across routine and non-routine activities. 
Tools such as Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), and site-specific HAZOP studies are regularly 
used, supported by well-defined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) unique to each facility. To ensure control over high-risk or 
non-routine tasks, a robust Work Permit System is followed, and all procedures are aligned with documented SOPs that govern risk 
mitigation at the operational level.
	
Reporting mechanisms are established to enable employees and workers to promptly report any unsafe condition or work-related 
hazard without fear of retaliation. This process is documented through SOPs for accident and incident reporting, which are actively 
followed across all units. In line with the Company’s commitment to welfare beyond occupational safety, employees and workers are 
provided access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. These include routine medical check-ups, consultations, and 
emergency medical care through tie-ups with designated hospitals, in accordance with internal HR and health-related SOPs.
	
The Company emphasizes continuous education and awareness on health and safety. Regular training sessions are conducted to cover 
operational risks such as machine safety, chemical handling, and emergency response. These are further reinforced through periodic 
emergency mock drills and internal audits, which ensure preparedness and adherence to protocols.
	
By integrating safety into every aspect of operations and maintaining strong governance over incident response, risk control, training, 
and health support systems, the Company ensures that the workplace remains safe, compliant, and conducive to employee well-being. 
This structured and participatory approach reflects the Company’s ongoing commitment to safeguarding its people and sustaining a 
culture of health and safety across all levels of the organization.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused or 
contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, the Company has designated Mr. Anil Jain, Managing Director, as the focal point responsible for overseeing human rights-
related matters across its operations. His responsibilities include ensuring alignment with human rights standards, addressing any 
adverse impacts, and integrating human rights considerations into policies and practices. The Company also upholds a strong ethical 
framework through its Whistle-Blower Policy, which enables employees and stakeholders to confidentially report concerns related 
to unethical practices, including human rights violations. This mechanism, along with cross-functional collaboration, ensures timely 
redressal and reinforces the Company’s commitment to maintaining a safe, fair, and respectful work environment.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
The Company has established a comprehensive internal framework to address grievances related to human rights, ensuring that 
all employees and workers have access to fair and confidential redressal mechanisms. At the operational level, an open-door policy 
encourages individuals to voice concerns directly to their respective Heads of Department or the Human Resources team. This informal 
channel fosters early resolution and open dialogue on matters affecting employee dignity, equality, or workplace behavior.
	
For more serious or sensitive issues, the Company has adopted a formal Whistle-Blower Policy that offers a secure and anonymous 
platform to report concerns related to unethical conduct, human rights violations, discrimination, or any breach of the Code of Conduct. 
All complaints received through this channel are reviewed independently and handled with strict confidentiality to protect the 
identity and interests of the complainant. The mechanism is accessible to employees, workers, and external stakeholders, reinforcing 
transparency and accountability.
	
Further, the Company has constituted a duly compliant Internal Committee under the Prohibition of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Act to 
specifically address complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace. The committee functions independently, adheres to procedural 
fairness, and ensures timely resolution with a focus on maintaining a safe and respectful working environment.
	
The Company’s Code of Conduct, applicable to all directors, senior management, and employees, serves as the guiding framework 
for upholding human rights principles. It emphasizes non-discrimination, equal opportunity, workplace safety, anti-harassment, 
and responsible corporate citizenship. Additionally, the Company promotes a culture of diversity and inclusion, mandating that all 
employment-related decisions are made solely based on merit and job-related qualifications.
	
Through these layered mechanisms ranging from informal escalation to formal redressal channels, the Company ensures that any 
grievances related to human rights are addressed with utmost seriousness, in line with legal requirements and ethical expectations.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
The Company has established robust mechanisms to ensure that no adverse consequences befall any individual who raises concerns 
related to discrimination or harassment. Through its Whistle Blower Policy and Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) framework, 
it provides a safe and confidential platform for employees and stakeholders to report unethical behaviour, including any form of 
harassment or discrimination. The policy explicitly prohibits retaliation against complainants, including intimidation, demotion, 
suspension, denial of promotion, or any form of harassment, whether direct or indirect.
	
Any violation of this non-retaliation principle is treated as a serious disciplinary offence, with appropriate action taken against those 
found responsible. Additionally, the identity of the complainant is protected and is disclosed only on a strict need-to-know basis during 
the investigation process. The Company also safeguards those who support or participate in the investigation process. By creating this 
protective environment and ensuring clear accountability through its internal committees, the Company fosters a workplace culture 
grounded in trust, fairness, and respect.
9.

Key initiatives that remained in effect during the year include the continued operation of solar power installations within select plant 
locations, which help reduce dependence on conventional grid electricity. The Company also maintained and monitored thermal 
insulation upgrades previously applied to critical equipment such as reactors and storage units, thereby ensuring improved energy 
efficiency in heat-intensive processes.
	
Energy conservation at the operational level remains a core priority, with the ongoing use of LED lighting systems replacing legacy 
high-energy fixtures across units. These systems contribute not only to reduced electricity usage but also support broader workplace 
efficiency goals. Furthermore, equipment-level optimization, including the replacement of older, less efficient machinery with newer 
high-efficiency models, is helping lower energy consumption and operational emissions across functional areas.
	
The Company also sustains its efforts in green campus initiatives, such as indoor and outdoor plantation, which contribute indirectly 
to GHG absorption and promote a healthier work environment. These environmental enhancements are complemented by internal 
programs that encourage employee awareness and behavioral changes in support of sustainability, such as promoting energy-saving 
practices and reducing unnecessary power usage.
	
Collectively, these actions reflect the Company’s commitment to a pragmatic and integrated approach to GHG mitigation, where 
emphasis is placed not just on initiating new projects, but also on strengthening the long-term efficiency and environmental impact 
of existing initiatives. The continuity of these measures underlines the Company’s recognition that sustained performance and 
maintenance are equally critical in achieving tangible climate benefits.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
The Company has adopted a structured and site-specific approach to waste management, driven by regulatory compliance, 
environmental stewardship, and internal SOPs established across its manufacturing units. At each facility, hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste is carefully segregated, packed, stored in designated areas, and tracked through formal documentation formats such as waste 
disposal slips and category registers.
	
Hazardous waste such as ETP sludge, spent carbon, solvents, scrubbing solutions, and distillation residues is managed in accordance 
with legal norms and internal safety standards. These wastes are either reused within the premises, incinerated in on-site units, or 
transferred to authorised treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) or co-processing units such as cement kilns. Notably, the 
Company has eliminated the landfilling of hazardous waste from its operations, ensuring that all such waste is treated or disposed of 
using more sustainable alternatives.
	
To reduce the use of hazardous and toxic substances, the Company continuously evaluates opportunities for process improvements 
and material substitution. In several cases, spent solvents and scrubbed chemicals are recovered, treated, and reused in internal 
operations, reducing both raw material consumption and waste generation. Additionally, the Company relies on in-house treatment 
technologies like multi-effect evaporators and effluent treatment plants to recycle water and reduce chemical discharge.
	
Non-hazardous waste, including plastic packaging, discarded containers, and e-waste, is collected and routed through authorised 
recyclers. The Company ensures traceability of such materials and maintains proper disposal records. Internal audits and supplier 
assessments also form part of the extended waste governance framework, ensuring responsible waste handling across the value chain.
	
Overall, the Company’s waste management strategy integrates regulatory compliance, internal SOPs, vendor accountability, and 
process optimisation to reduce environmental impact and promote operational sustainability.
