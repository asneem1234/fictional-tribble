26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
 
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:
S. No. Material issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk/ opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1.
Human Capital 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
As a Risk: Consistent 
availability of skilled 
labour, retention of such 
employees and ensuring 
optimum productivity all 
year round
As an Opportunity: The 
right mix of employees 
– gender, demographics 
and skillset can result in a 
vibrant and self-sustaining 
culture that can drive 
productivity and help the 
employees generate job 
satisfaction and wealth for 
themselves.
At Apex, we begin with 
ensuring that we have the 
right person for the right job. 
They are then put through 
our strong training programs 
to ensure that they are 
equipped with the right skills to 
discharge their job and excel in 
their roles.
Negative
Inadequate hiring and 
retention practices can lead 
to decreased productivity 
and increased costs and also 
result in a loss of business.
Positive
Creating a viable work 
environment will contribute to 
long-term business success 
and will also help position 
Apex as an employer of 
repute and create a virtuous 
cycle of attracting good 
talent.
2.
Environmental 
Risk 
Management
Risk
Effective management 
of climate risk is crucial 
for the progress of the 
community that we operate 
in and ultimately the 
ability of the Company to 
continue its operations at 
an optimum level. 
While the business is subject 
to vagaries of nature, several 
steps are taken to ensure 
that the ecological balance 
of the areas we work in 
are maintained, including 
safeguards and best practices 
to create a sustainable 
business model.
Failing to effectively 
maintain ecological balance 
could result in long-term 
sustainability problems for 
both our business and the 
communities in which we 
operate, potentially leading 
to revenue loss or operational 
disruptions
3.
Community 
Development
Opportunity
Community presents a 
significant opportunity for 
our business, especially 
given our labor-intensive 
processes. By hiring from 
the areas close to our 
operations, we not only 
create job opportunities 
but also foster sustainable 
community development. 
Community Development
Opportunity
4.
Product Quality Opportunity
We have invested in 
creating strong processes 
around Quality Checks, 
some of which are driven 
by regulatory requirements. 
This creates an entry 
barrier since some of 
the pre-qualifications 
for selling in specific 
geographies are extremely 
stringent
NA
Superior product quality 
leads to consumer stickiness 
and strengthens relationships 
with clients. Also, it gives 
them a vote of confidence 
to buy more products, 
which leads to healthy and 
sustainable revenues 
5.
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Dependence on external 
suppliers for raw material, 
procurement of containers 
for export, has a likelihood 
to disrupt the supply of the 
products of the Company, 
resulting in lower sales.
While we are able to work 
on our supply chain for raw 
materials through constant 
interactions with farmers, we 
are exposed to supply chain 
risks on the delivery side. 
Given the delicate geopolitical 
balance on several of our 
key routes, disruptions could 
lead to increased costs and 
unavailability of timely supply 
to customers and inventory 
buildups.
If we are unable to secure 
raw materials in the sizes 
we require, or are unable 
to make timely shipments 
of our finished products, 
it could have a material 
adverse impact on our 
results of operations and 
could increase our costs 
and thereby impact our 
profitability.
