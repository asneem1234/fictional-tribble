STATEMENT ON CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY 
ABSORPTION & FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS AND OUTGO
A.	 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY:
	
(i)	 The steps taken or impact on conservation 
of energy:
	
	
a.	
Modification in Water Pump System of 
Cooling Tower:
	
	
	
The replacement of the 7.5 kW submersible 
water pump with a 5.5 kW mono block water 
pump resulted in significant energy savings 
and operational efficiency. By reducing the 
energy consumption from 180 kWh to 132 
kWh per day, the project achieved notable 
reductions in energy use, contributing to our 
energy conservation efforts. Additionally, 
the new pump requires less manpower 
for maintenance, further enhancing the 
efficiency of the cooling tower system.
	
	
b.	
Modification made to CNC machine to 
address energy consumption:
	
	
	
The original design featured a continuously 
running vacuum blower, even during idle 
periods which resulted in excessive energy 
consumption. To address this inefficiency, 
an initiative project was undertaken to 
implement an on/off switch for the blower, 
allowing operators to shut it down when 
not in use. This modification in the CNC 
system leads to substantial energy savings.
	
	
c.	
Electric Material Handling Equipment:
	
	
	
The Company has adopted electric-powered, 
energy-efficient reach trucks and stackers 
for 
material 
handling, 
contributing 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
overall 
emissions 
and energy usage.
	
(ii)	 The steps taken by the Company for 
utilizing alternate sources of energy:
	
	
a.	
The Company has taken a commendable 
step towards sustainability and energy 
independence by installing a 1 MW solar 
rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system at Safari 
Manufacturing Limited (SML), wholly owned 
subsidiary’s Halol Factory to support its 
renewable energy transition. This initiative 
showcases a strategic move to leverage 
underutilized rooftop space for generating 
renewable energy, which aligns with the 
Company’s sustainability strategy to use 
renewable energy and reduce operational 
GHG 
emissions. 
In 
its 
commissioning 
year (FY 2023–24), the system generated 
3,80,351 kWh of on-site renewable energy, 
contributing to 7.8% renewable energy 
share of the total energy consumption at 
the SML’s Halol Factory. With the facility 
operating at full capacity in FY 2024–25, 
solar generation increased significantly 
to 15,99,681 kWh, raising the share of 
renewable energy in the total energy mix 
to 21%, a notable improvement from the 
previous year. In addition to reducing 
dependence on grid electricity, the solar PV 
system enabled SML’s Halol Factory to avoid 
approximately 1,163 tCO2e of greenhouse 
gas emissions in FY 2024–25, reinforcing 
Company’s commitment to sustainable 
manufacturing and climate responsibility.
	
	
b.	
Additionally, 
the 
Company 
has 
also 
installed a 3 MW rooftop solar photovoltaic 
(PV) system at SML’s newly operational 
Jaipur Factory. This initiative is part of 
the 
Company’s 
broader 
commitment 
to reducing its carbon footprint and 
promoting renewable energy use across its 
operations. The rooftop solar installation 
is expected to generate approximately 
44,44,488 kWh of clean electricity annually. 
This would help in reducing 3,231 tCO2e of 
scope 2 GHG emissions.
	
	
c.	
The manufacturing facilities do not use 
diesel generators (DG sets) due to a 
strategic decision to rely solely on grid 
power. This approach reduces the reliance 
of fossil fuels for operational purposes, 
thereby avoiding greenhouse gas emissions 
and promoting a more sustainable and 
environmentally friendly operation.
	
(iii)	 Capital Investment on energy conservation 
equipment: ` 0.46 Crore
Annual Report 2024-25
48
B.	
TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION:
	
(i)	 Efforts 
made 
towards 
technology 
absorption:
	
	
a.	
Transitioned 
from 
three-stage 
thermoforming 
machines 
to 
more 
advanced 
two-stage 
thermoforming 
machines. This technological shift was 
taken to enhance production efficiency and 
sustainability. In a three-stage machine, 
the process typically involves heating the 
plastic sheet, forming it to the desired 
shape and then trimming the formed 
product. The two-stage machines, however, 
combines the forming and trimming stages 
into one, thereby reducing the overall cycle 
time and energy consumption. By adopting 
this technology, we achieved a reduction in 
the size of the plastic sheets required for 
the hard luggage production and reducing 
the offcut generation. Furthermore, the 
reduction in sheet size and offcut generation 
has resulted in a decrease in the electricity 
consumption per unit of luggage produced 
and increased extruder capacity.
	
	
b.	
SML produces in-house components for 
luggage. Due to delays in part supplies 
from local vendors and volatile pricing 
of imported components, the Company 
through SML decided to develop an ancillary 
manufacturing unit that produces in-house 
components such as wheels. The facility is 
designed with a production capacity of 
20,00,000 wheels monthly.
	
	
c.	
Identifying 
operational 
risks 
and 
inefficiencies 
in 
manually 
transferring 
of product shells, SML has implemented 
robotic manipulator arm onto our injection 
moulding system at its Halol and Jaipur 
Factory. 
Additionally, 
SML 
deployed 
an automated conveyor system for the 
seamless transport of shells, incorporated 
with other necessary auxiliary components 
such as de-gating stations and repositioned 
the CNC machinery closer to the injection 
moulding unit to streamline the workflow.
	
(ii)	 The 
benefits 
derived 
like 
product 
improvement, 
cost 
reduction, 
product 
development or import substitution:
	
	
a.	
SML’s strategic move to produce in-house 
wheels enabled more flexible production 
planning, 
minimized 
supply-chain 
disruptions, reduced import costs and 
decreased associated value chain emissions. 
This transition to in-house production has 
proved to be a valuable strategy for SML 
and the Company, streamlining the supply 
chain and reducing production delays while 
contributing to sustainability goals.
	
	
b.	
SML’s robotic manipulator arm initiatives 
have increased the operational efficiency 
and 
strengthened 
the 
operational 
safety while decreasing the need for 
additional personnel.
	
	
c.	
Following value engineering projects also 
resulted into major cost benefits:
	
	
	
(i)	
Alternate material for cost saving: 
Logos in PVC material are replaced with 
ABS material to reduce the cost without 
compromising the aesthetic value.
	
	
	
(ii)	 Set-up 
local 
suppliers 
for 
lining 
used 
in 
interior, 
earlier 
it 
was 
imported from China.
	
	
	
(iii)	 In 
case 
of 
imported 
technology 
(imported during the last three years 
reckoned from the beginning of the 
financial year): Nil

Management Discussion and 
Analysis Report
A.	 Industry Structure and Developments:
	
The past few years have seen a sustained period 
of strong growth for the organised sector. At a 
significantly higher base of consumers, the industry 
growth has tempered down last year in line with the 
overall economy. Several structural factors continue 
to have a positive long-term impact on the industry. 
The trend towards travel becoming one of the top 
areas of discretionary, spend continues to strengthen. 
This has also been helped by increasing air-travel 
penetration into Tier 2 & 3 cities in India. Large capital 
investments by Airlines in fleet expansion have 
picked momentum during the last year, as overall 
infrastructure improvement for Roads and Railways 
continues. Marriages remain a large driver of luggage 
sales and with a young demographic profile in the 
country, this factor will continue to fuel growth.
	
Over the last few years, consumer preference has been 
shifting definitely from soft luggage to hard luggage. 
In the last year, this transition has culminated into 
hard luggage becoming the dominant category in 
the Upright Luggage segment. This has resulted in a 
transition of the category from being import-based to 
becoming local manufacturing driven. Over the next 
couple of years, the new-age branded players are 
also expected to follow this trend towards localised 
manufacturing. Several unorganised sector players 
have already started local manufacturing focussed on 
offline channels.
	
Exclusive Retail channel has seen significant expansion 
for the industry with several new age brands as 
well as legacy players increasing investments to 
drive brand visibility and improved mid-premium 
mix. In E-commerce channel, while the addition 
of incremental channel users has slowed down, it 
continued drive good overall growth by focussing 
on higher order conversion rates. Quick-commerce 
channel entered the category during the year with 
good success and is expected to be a key growth 
driver in the coming years. The demand in offline 
channels remained muted during the year.
	
The overall long-term outlook for the organised 
sector remains very robust with continued growth in 
travel, increasing preference for branded luggage, 
growth in school and office going population.
	
Company Development:
	
The Company continued to grow ahead of the 
market led by a well-defined portfolio catering 
well to diverse consumer needs and strong go-to-
market strategy. Safari brand has been adjudged as 
the ‘No. 1 Luggage Brand in India’ in revenue terms 
for the second successive year (Source: Euromonitor 
International Limited; Personal Accessories 2025ed; 
Luggage category; gbn; all retail channel, value rsp 
terms; 2024 data).
	
Anticipating continued growth on the hard luggage 
category, the Company has commissioned a new 
greenfield integrated manufacturing plant for 
polypropylene and polycarbonate zippered hard 
luggage in Jaipur, Rajasthan under its wholly 
owned subsidiary i.e. Safari Manufacturing Limited. 
It has further scaled up manufacturing capacity in 
manufacturing plants based in Halol, Gujarat.
	
The Company has been expanding its presence in 
the mid-premium segment with rapid scale up of 
Urban Jungle, a casual premium brand focussing on 
the youth. The brand has expanded from its initial 
offering of zippered hard luggage to backpacks, as 
well as travel accessories. To cater to the increasing 
discernment in consumer tastes at the premium end, 
the Company has also launched a new sub-brand 
Safari Select in the mid-premium segment with a 
semi-formal design approach.
	
The Company has continued to expand its offline 
presence in prestigious high footfall locations in 
selected markets through exclusive retail stores. 
This channel has been instrumental in increasing 
consumer traction for its premium offerings of 
Urban Jungle and Safari Select. This will help drive 
long-term consumer equity and advocacy through 
an integrated approach that focussed on superior 
brand experience.
	
During the year, the Company invested in enhancing 
its back-end capabilities to develop a more efficient 
and future-ready supply chain. Large integrated 
tech-enable 
warehousing 
facilities 
have 
been 
established in both its manufacturing locations, while 
consolidating several smaller warehouse locations.
B.	
Opportunities and Threats:
	
The industry has seen a sharp structural shift towards 
hard luggage at competitive pricing. The Company’s 
investments in expanding its hard luggage capacity 
have positioned it to drive significant overall growth 
via this category. It will be imperative for the 
Company to continue to assess and plan for such 
shifts in consumer tastes and trends in the future.
ANNEXURE I
Annual Report 2024-25

A significant portion of the Company’s Backpack 
category supplies are still dependent on imports. 
To de-risk against potential geo-political and 
macro-economic uncertainties, the Company is 
rapidly building a larger supplier base within India 
with all necessary capabilities.
	
The entry of several new players focussed on the mid 
and premium end of the market has created more 
consumer interest in the category with expansion of 
style, colour and brand choices. This is expected to 
help drive category expansion at the premium end 
and presents an opportunity for the industry to tap 
into increasing affluence and discernment of the 
Indian consumer. Capitalising on this opportunity 
will need aesthetic and functional innovation as well 
as building strong consumer brands. The Company 
is investing on Urban Jungle and Safari Select 
in this segment.
	
The Company has built a strong position in 
E-commerce channel with consistent focus and 
investments. The E-commerce landscape is changing 
fast with the advent of Quick-Commerce. This can 
have potential impact on the Company’s position 
with changes in consumer behaviour and preferences. 
It is critical for the Company to be agile and to build 
expertise in this area for continued growth.
	
With tempering down of industry growth, the 
price competition in the category has been 
increasing. The Company is managing the challenge 
by continuing its focus on frugality in costs and 
improved product-mix.
	
Company’s linear structure facilitates faster and 
better decision making which allows the Company to 
grab opportunities in time.
C.	
Segment/ Product-wise Performance:
	
With a sharp growth in hard luggage category and 
limited supplies in the industry, the Company has 
been able to capitalise well on the demand growth 
with consistent investment on capacity enhancement. 
The category is now getting sub-segmented with 
innovations in aesthetics, colour, shapes, opening 
mechanism, etc. The Company is consistently 
enhancing its portfolio with innovative product 
offerings to drive consumer preference.
	
Backpack 
category 
is 
highly 
fragmented 
and 
competitive with large number of players. The brand 
portfolio of Safari, Safari Select, Genie, Genius 
and Urban Jungle has given the Company a strong 
offering to cut-through into the Formal, Casual and 
the School Backpack markets catering to the diverse 
needs of a school going teenager to that of an office 
going professional. The Company has grown very 
well in the category through strong focus on product 
and go-to-market strategies that have helped it 
gain market share in key growth channels such as 
E-commerce and exclusive Retail. The Company will 
continue to invest aggressively behind this category 
as a strong growth driver.
D.	 Outlook:
	
The Company maintained its growth trajectory well 
ahead of the market, but the demand side has several 
short-term uncertainties led primarily by larger 
marco-economic factors. Hence, it will be important 
for the Company to stay focussed on specific channels, 
categories and consumer segments that are expected 
to drive market growth.
	
The Company has further optimised its supply 
chain for better responsiveness and cost, by 
investments in modern technology in the areas 
of ERP, warehousing and planning capability. 
Given the focus on  E-commerce and Quick-commerce 
channels, the Company will continue to undertake 
focussed investments to make its supply chain 
more robust and future-ready in dealing with their 
unique requirements.
	
Both the premium segment and the backpack 
category continue to be large opportunity areas for 
the Company that are critical for long-term growth. 
It is important for the Company to invest aggressively 
in building its share in these categories to drive future 
growth and improve its price realisation through 
product mix improvement.
	
While there continue to be some uncertainties, 
the overall growth drivers are well in place for the 
Company to continue on a high growth trajectory 
with improving profitability.
E.	
Risks and Concerns:
	
The Company is exposed to various risks and 
uncertainties which may adversely impact its 
performance. The Company’s future growth prospects 
and cash flow generation could be materially 
impacted by any of these risks or opportunities. 
The major risks as identified by the Company are 
demand-risks due to recessionary trends in the global 
economy, currency risk associated with imports, 
unfair competition, etc.
	
The 
Company 
follows 
the 
Enterprise 
Risk 
Management (ERM) framework to manage and 
mitigate such risks which is primarily based on 
the integrated framework for enterprise risk 
management and internal controls developed 
by the Company.
F.	
Internal Control Systems and their adequacy:
	
M/s. Moore Singhi Advisors LLP were appointed 
as the Internal Auditors of the Company to review 
internal controls periodically with specific reference

Leadership Message
This year marked a defining chapter in our journey, as we continued to build a business that balances performance 
with responsibility. In FY 2024–25, Safari expanded its operational footprint with the launch of the Jaipur plant, further 
strengthening our commitment to sustainable and resilient growth. As we scale, our focus remains firmly on minimising 
environmental impact, enhancing workplace practices and supporting the well-being of communities we serve.
We have deepened our environmental stewardship across operations. The share of renewable energy in our facilities 
increased from 2.4% to 8%, reflecting a meaningful transition toward cleaner sources. Reused water now accounts for 
32% of total water consumption, significantly reducing dependence on freshwater. Additionally, we achieved 100% 
waste recycling across our manufacturing units, an outcome of disciplined and structured waste management practices.
To drive further progress, we are pursuing IGBC Green Building certification, integrating sustainability into how we 
design and manage our infrastructure. As our product portfolio grows, we are increasing the use of sustainable materials 
and adopting circular design principles that minimise waste and extend product life - aligning our growth with long-term 
environmental goals.
Equally, we remain deeply invested in our people. Our workforce grew by 11% during the year, with a 26% increase in the 
number of women, an encouraging step towards greater diversity and inclusion. We continue to maintain a workplace 
where individuals feel respected, supported and empowered. Structured development programs, open communication 
and a strong focus on well-being create an environment where people can thrive and grow with the organisation. 
Our teams also actively engage in volunteering and community partnerships to support local needs.
Our governance framework anchors these efforts. With clearly defined roles, robust policies and integrated risk 
management, we ensure consistent decision-making and strengthen accountability across the organisation. Sustainability 
is embedded in our day-to-day choices, shaping how we operate, grow and deliver value responsibly and purposefully.

operations, empower people and uphold accountability. Across our facilities, we are improving resource efficiency, 
minimising waste and taking concrete steps to reduce emissions.
We are equally committed to creating a safe, inclusive and engaging workplace. Our efforts extend beyond business 
operations through community initiatives focused on education and healthcare, we aim to make a meaningful difference.

community outreach initiatives. Such engagements enable us to identify concerns, align our actions with broader social 
and business priorities and support informed decision-making. This ongoing dialogue fosters trust and strengthens the 
relationships that are vital to our continued success.
Materiality Assessment:
Our materiality assessment is a structured process used to identify the ESG topics most relevant to Safari. It draws 
on global and sector-specific trends, regulatory developments, industry best practices and direct stakeholders input. 
Insights are gathered from business leaders, employees, suppliers, customers and investors to ensure a well-rounded 
understanding of evolving expectations. These topics are then prioritised based on their potential impact on our business 
and their importance to stakeholders. The assessment outcomes guide our strategic planning and sustainability initiatives. 
Our materiality assessment was conducted in FY 2022–23 and the process is reviewed every three years to remain aligned 
with the evolving external landscape and stakeholder expectations.

Our ESG Strategy:
Safari’s ESG strategy is shaped by the organisation’s vision, mission, purpose, values and the material topics identified 
through a structured assessment. These inputs help shape our priorities and translate intent into measurable action. 
The strategy is structured around four strategic pillars that provide clear direction, promote cross-functional co-ordination 
and support seamless integration into core operations enabling us to address key ESG themes with clarity and consistency 
across the business.
Each strategic pillar includes defined focus areas that guide planning and execution. Key performance indicators (KPIs) 
are established to track progress across relevant functions and ensure alignment with overall strategic goals.

Pillar 1: Preserve Planet
Our environmental efforts centre on responsible resource management and maintaining ecological balance. We are 
continually improving energy and water efficiency across operations, while enhancing systems for effective waste 
reduction and management. Initiatives such as tree plantation drives and biodiversity conservation around our operational 
sites further support these goals. We are pursuing green building certifications at Jaipur Plant to integrate recognised 
environmental standards into infrastructure development. Our emission reduction measures are aligned with broader 
climate goals of climate resilience goals, reflecting our commitment to lowering our overall environmental footprint.

a 3 MW rooftop solar PV system at the new SML Jaipur plant, complementing the existing 1 MW system at Halol. 
These additions increased the share of renewable energy from 2.4% in FY 2023-24 to 8% in FY 2024-25. We continue 
to enhance energy efficiency using high performance equipment and process optimisation, while reducing emissions 
through renewable energy integration, equipment upgrades and improved logistics and transportation systems.

Resource 
efficiency - 
Water, waste, 
energy
Opportunity
Efficient use of water, energy 
and materials plays a key role in 
limiting environmental impact and 
supporting operational continuity. It 
also helps manage costs, respond to 
increasing regulatory expectations 
and meet the preferences of eco-
conscious customers. As awareness 
and compliance pressures grow, 
strong resource practices enable 
businesses to stay resilient and 
relevant. They also support 
innovation and the development 
of sustainable products, creating 
new opportunities across markets 
and customer segments.
NA

2
Climate 
Strategy & 
Emission 
Management
Risk
Climate change presents a significant 
and evolving risk with implications 
for operational continuity, supply 
chain resilience and long-term 
strategy. Physical risks such as 
extreme weather events can 
disrupt production and logistics. 
While transition risks stemming 
from regulatory changes, market 
shifts and stakeholder expectations 
may increase operational and 
financial pressures, addressing 
climate-related risks is essential 
to ensure resilience in a changing 
global environment.
Safari 
addresses 
climate-
related risks through structured 
interventions across operations, 
products and supply chains. 
We are expanding the share of 
renewable energy, improving 
energy efficiency and upgrading 
equipment to lower emissions. 
Process changes, logistics 
optimisation and integration 
of climate-aligned technologies 
support our decarbonisation 
efforts.
Negative

Employee

Opportunity
Employee engagement presents a 
valuable opportunity to strengthen 
organisational resilience and support 
both financial and non-financial 
performance. At Safari, a well-
engaged workforce contributes to 
higher productivity, improved well-
being and lower turnover. It enables 
stronger alignment with business 
goals and encourages collaboration 
across teams. Through structured 
engagement and meaningful growth 
opportunities, we can continue 
to build agile, motivated teams 
that navigate change effectively 
and deliver sustained value.

Occupational 
Health & Safety
Risk
Occupational health and safety 
represents a critical risk area with 
direct implications for employee 
welfare, operational continuity and 
regulatory compliance. Workplace 
incidents can result in injury, 
productivity loss, reputational 
damage and financial penalties.
We implement structured safety 
systems across operations to 
reduce health and safety risks. 
These are guided by our policies 
and relevant internal guidelines. 
Measures include hazard 
identification, risk assessments 
and implementation of Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs). 
Safety training is conducted 
at multiple levels, supported 
by mock drills and awareness 
sessions. Infrastructure checks, 
periodic audits and incident 
investigations help strengthen 
controls and prevent recurrence. 
Health surveillance and emergency 
preparedness are also integral 
to our safety framework.
Negative
5
Human Rights
Risk
Human rights represent a material 
risk area, with implications for 
business ethics, stakeholder trust 
and legal compliance. Issues such 
as discrimination, forced labour, 
child labour and the absence of 
effective grievance mechanisms may 
arise across the value chain. Any 
breach can result in reputational 
damage, disruption of operations 
and loss of stakeholder confidence. 
Addressing this risk is essential to 
maintain accountability and uphold 
responsible business conduct.
Human rights risks are addressed 
through clear policies, employee 
training and accessible grievance 
mechanisms. These are supported 
by regular assessments and 
communication across teams. 
The Company also responds 
to surveys at the request of 
key customers to confirm 
alignment with global human 
rights expectations.
Negative
6
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Corporate governance presents 
a 
strategic 
opportunity 
to 
build transparency, strengthen 
accountability and enable effective 
decision-making. A well-governed 
organisation earns stakeholder 
trust, mitigates business risks and 
ensures regulatory compliance. 
Strong governance practices 
also support long-term value 
creation by aligning organisational 
conduct with ethical standards 
and responsible business principles. 
As expectations from investors, 
regulators and customers evolve, 
governance becomes a key enabler 
of sustainable growth.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
Sustainable supply chain management 
presents a material risk due to 
increasing 
expectations 
on 
traceability, ethical sourcing and 
environmental compliance. Any 
lapses such as supplier misconduct, 
labour violations or non-compliance 
by suppliers  can disrupt operations, 
damage brand equity and result 
in financial or legal repercussions. 
Managing these risks is essential 
to ensure continuity, credibility 
and responsible conduct across 
the value chain.
We 
assess 
supply 
chain 
sustainability through supplier 
assessments and performance 
reviews. Our sourcing practices 
are guided by a Supplier Code 
of Conduct and related policies 
that set clear expectations for 
ethical, environmental and 
social performance. Through 
sustainable 
sourcing, 
we 
engage with partners to build 
long-term resilience, improve 
compliance and reduce risks 
linked to raw materials and 
vendor operations.
Negative
8
Customer 
Relationship 
Management 
(CRM)
Opportunity
Customer relationship management 
presents an opportunity to build 
trust and tailor services more 
effectively. 
Strong 
customer 
relationships can lead to higher 
sales, improved retention and 
brand loyalty. They also generate 
valuable data that supports product 
development and innovation. As 
expectations evolve, delivering 
consistent quality, timely service 
and clear communication helps 
deepen engagement and unlock 
opportunities in new markets.
NA
Positive
9
Compliance 
& Risk 
Management
Risk
Compliance and risk management 
remain key risk areas with implications 
across legal, financial and operational 
aspects of the business. Gaps in 
compliance or risk oversight can result 
in regulatory penalties, reputational 
damage and business disruption. 
As regulations and stakeholder 
expectations evolve, it becomes 
essential to maintain internal 
controls, ensure policy alignment 
and monitor risks systematically 
across functions and geographies.
Compliance and risk management 
is supported through oversight 
by the Risk Management 
Committee, with defined processes 
and systems anchored in the 
Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) framework. Internal controls 
enable ongoing monitoring, 
help manage exposures and 
support timely responses to 
emerging risks. These systems 
support sound decision-making 
and consistent organisational 
performance.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
	
Safari delivers high-quality and durable products that serve customers over an extended period, thereby reducing the 
need for frequent replacement. Due to the longevity and robustness of our products, instances of product disposal at 
the end of their life cycle are infrequent and as such, a formal product reclamation process is not currently in place. 
In alignment with the Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules under Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), the 
packaging material used, specifically Polycab CAT II Flexible is collected and disposed of through environmentally 
responsible recycling practices. In the rare event of a manufacturing defect, customers are encouraged to reach out 
to our customer service team to initiate a return. Such products are reclaimed to prevent them from entering the 
waste stream and are repurposed or reused wherever feasible. Additionally, e-waste generated by the Company is 
disposed of in a scientifically sound and environmentally responsible manner through authorized recyclers.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details:
	
Company has undertaken the following initiatives/ improvements in operational mechanisms to reduce GHG 
emission by improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption:
	
	
Solar Rooftop System at SML Halol Factory: Safari has advanced its renewable energy transition by installing 
a 1 MW rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system at the SML’s Halol Factory. This installation efficiently utilises 
rooftop space to generate clean energy on-site. In its commissioning year (FY 2023–24), it generated 3,80,351 
kWh, accounting for 7.8% of the site’s total energy usage. With full operational capacity in FY 2024–25, 
generation rose to 15,99,681 kWh, increasing the renewable energy share to 21% and avoiding nearly 1,163 
tCO2e of emissions. This shift reflects Safari’s larger sustainability ambitions and its commitment to climate 
responsibility.
	
	
3 MW Solar PV Installation at SML’s Jaipur Factory: Furthering its investment in clean energy, Safari has 
installed a 3 MW rooftop solar PV system at its newly operational Jaipur facility. The system is projected to 
generate approximately 44,44,488 kWh of electricity annually, enabling an estimated reduction of 3,231 tCOe 
in Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative plays a key role in advancing the Company’s low-carbon 
operations agenda.
	
	
Strategic Non-Use of Diesel Generators across Facilities: Safari has made a conscious choice to avoid the use 
of diesel generators across all its manufacturing units. By relying exclusively on grid electricity and renewable 
sources, the Company has eliminated the need for fossil fuel-based power backup, reinforcing its transition to 
cleaner, emission-free operations.
	
	
Installation of Water Cooled Chiller: Safari in SML’s newly operational Jaipur Factory has demonstrated 
commitment to energy efficiency and sustainability from the design phase itself. As part of this effort, Safari 
assessed various technologies and chose to install energy-efficient systems to minimize both environmental 
impact and operational costs. One of such technology implementation was to install water-cooled chillers 
instead of conventional air-cooled chillers. This design choice is expected to result in substantial energy savings.
	
	
High efficient Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) based air compressor: Safari in SML’s newly operational Jaipur 
Factory has installed a high-efficiency Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) based air compressor. Unlike conventional 
air compressors that operate at a constant speed regardless of demand, the VFD based system adjusts motor 
speed in real-time based on the air requirement. This significantly improves energy efficiency by reducing 
unnecessary power consumption during low-load conditions.
	
	
Electric Material Handling Equipment: Safari has adopted electric-powered, energy-efficient reach trucks and 
stackers for material handling, contributing to a reduction in overall emissions and energy usage.
	
	
Modification in Water Pump System of Cooling Tower: The replacement of the 7.5 kW submersible water pump 
with a 5.5 kW mono block water pump resulted in significant energy savings and operational efficiency in SIIL’s 
Halol Factory. By reducing the energy consumption from 180 kWh to 132 kWh per day, the project achieved 
notable reductions in energy use, contributing to our energy conservation efforts. Additionally, the new pump 
required less manpower for maintenance, further enhancing the efficiency of the cooling tower system.
	
	
Modification made to CNC machine to address energy consumption: The original design featured a continuously 
running vacuum blower, even during idle periods which resulted in excessive energy consumption. To address 
this inefficiency in SIIL’s Halol Factory, an initiative project was undertaken to implement an on/off switch for 
the blower, allowing operators to shut it down when not in use. This modification in the CNC system led to 
substantial energy savings.

Safari’s manufacturing operations are supported by a formal waste management system designed to reduce 
environmental impact through structured and compliant practices. Waste is segregated at the source to enable 
efficient reuse and recycling. All plastic waste generated within the facility is either reused or recycled on-site, 
thereby reducing the need for external disposal. Residual waste is managed through authorised third-party recyclers, 
ensuring safe processing in line with environmental regulations. Furthermore, no toxic chemicals are used within 
the premises, reinforcing our commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.

our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
5.	
We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition under Ind AS 115, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers (‘Ind AS 115’)
Refer note 2.9 – ‘Revenue recognition’ and note 25 
and 41 – ‘Revenue from operations’ to the standalone 
financial statements for the related accounting policy on 
revenue recognition and details of revenue recognised 
during the year.
Revenue for the Company consists primarily of sale 
of manufactured and traded goods. Owing to the 
multiplicity of the Company’s channels through which 
sale of products is made, and diverse terms of contracts 
with customers, revenue is determined to be an area 
involving significant risk and hence, requiring significant 
auditor attention.
Our audit included, but was not limited to, the following 
procedures performed in respect of revenue recognition:
• 
Understood the process of revenue recognition and 
evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting 
policy adopted by the management on revenue 
recognition in accordance with Ind AS 115.
• 
Evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness 
of 
manual 
and 
information 
technology internal financial controls around 
revenue recognition process, including controls 
over identification of the distinct performance 
obligations, determination of transaction price 
and satisfaction of performance obligations. 
Procedures 
performed 
included 
enquiry, 
observation and inspection of evidence in respect 
of operation of these controls.

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Further, the application of principles enunciated under 
Ind AS 115 involves significant judgements / material 
estimates relating to identification of performance 
obligations, 
determination 
of 
transaction 
price, 
including impact of variable consideration in the form 
of rebates and discounts, assessment of satisfaction of 
the identified performance obligations represented by 
the transfer of control of the products sold.
Revenue is a key performance indicator and there is 
presumed significant risk of revenue being overstated 
during the year on account of variation in the timing of 
transfer of control, due pressure to achieve performance 
targets and meeting the external expectations.
Owing to significance of the amount, multiplicity of the 
Company’s channels through which sale of products is 
made, volume of transactions, nature of customer with 
varied terms of contracts, audit of revenue recognised 
during the year requires significant auditor attention 
and accordingly, revenue recognition is considered to 
be a key audit matter for the current year audit.
• 
Selected channel-wise samples of contracts with 
customers, and performed the following procedures:
1.	
Read, analysed and identified the distinct 
performance obligations in these contracts;
2.	
Compared 
such 
performance 
obligations 
with those identified and recorded by the 
management; and
3.	
Reviewed 
contract 
terms 
to 
determine 
the transaction price including variable 
consideration (discounts, rebates, returns, 
etc.) if any, to determine the appropriate 
transaction price for measuring revenue.
• 
Tested, on a sample basis, revenue transactions 
recorded during the year, and in the period 
before and after year-end, relating to sale of 
products by inspecting supporting documents 
inter-alia customer contracts, sales orders, proofs 
of dispatch, customer acceptance, invoices, for the 
accuracy and completeness of revenue recorded 
for such transactions.
• 
Assessed the underlying assumptions used by 
the management for determination of provision 
recognised as at year end with respect to rebates, 
discount rates, sales returns, and traced inputs used 
to source data. 
• 
Further, evaluated historical accuracy of such 
estimates made in the earlier periods with actual 
results of current year to determine and consider 
estimation uncertainty involved.
• 
Tested on a sample basis, credit notes issued 
during the year and subsequent to year end to 
confirm revenue recognised during the period 
was appropriate.
• 
Performed analytical procedures for reasonableness 
of revenue recorded during the year, such as trend 
analysis by channel, by customer.
• 
Assessed the appropriateness and adequacy of 
disclosures included in the standalone financial 
statements for revenue recognition from sale of 
goods in accordance with the requirements of 
applicable accounting standards.
Information other than the Standalone Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
6.	
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible 
for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report, but does not include the standalone financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual Report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
	
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information identified above when it becomes 
available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Annual Report 2024-25
108
standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
	
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we 
are required to communicate the matter to those 
charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
7.	
The accompanying standalone financial statements 
have been approved by the Company’s Board 
of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors 
are responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
and presentation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the 
financial position, financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, changes in equity and 
cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. This responsibility also includes maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of 
the assets of the Company and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
financial statements that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
8.	
In preparing the standalone financial statements, 
the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
9.	
The Board of Directors is also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
10.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these standalone financial statements.
11.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards 
on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control;
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls;
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management;
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern; and

• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
12.	 We 
communicate 
with 
those 
charged 
with 
governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.
13.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
14.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
15.	 As required by section 197(16) of the Act, based on 
our audit, we report that the Company has paid 
remuneration to its directors during the year in

the Act we give in the Annexure A, a statement on

standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
In terms of the information and explanations sought by us 
and given by the Company and the books of account and 
records examined by us in the normal course of audit, and 
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we report that:
(i)	
(a)	 (A)	 The Company has maintained proper

physical verification of its property, plant 
and equipment, capital work-in-progress and 
relevant details of right-of-use assets under

phased manner over a period of three years, 
which in our opinion, is reasonable having regard 
to the size of the Company and the nature of 
its assets. In accordance with this programme, 
certain property, plant and equipment, capital 
work-in-progress 
and 
relevant 
details 
of 
right-of-use assets were verified during the year

management 
has 
conducted 
physical 
verification of inventory at reasonable intervals 
during the year, except for goods-in-transit 
and inventory lying with third parties. In our 
opinion, the coverage and procedure of such 
verification by the management is appropriate 
and no discrepancies of 10% or more in the 
aggregate for each class of inventory were 
noticed as compared to book records. In respect 
of inventory lying with third parties, these have 
substantially been confirmed by the third parties 
and in respect of goods-in-transit, these have 
been confirmed from corresponding receipts.

financial statements, the Company has been 
sanctioned a working capital limit in excess of ` 5

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members 
of Safari Industries (India) Limited on the standalone financial statements for 
the year ended 31 March 2025
Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal 
financial controls with reference to the standalone 
financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 
3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 
‘Act’) 
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of Safari Industries (India) 
Limited  (‘the Company’) as at and for the year ended 
31 March 2025, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the 
Company as at that date. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria 
established 
by 
the 
Company 
considering 
the 
essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance 
Note’) 
issued 
by 
the 
Institute 
of 
Chartered 
Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of the Company’s business, 
including adherence to the Company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Financial Statements 
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, and the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively 
in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements 
and 
their 
operating 
effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements includes obtaining 
an understanding of such internal financial controls, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements 
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.
Annual Report 2024-25
116
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements 
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such controls 
were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based 
on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
issued by the ICAI.

method of accounting and historical cost convention 
except for the following material items that have 
been measured at fair value as required by the 
relevant Ind AS:
•

2.3	 Current and non- current classification 
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current 
or non-current as per the Company’s operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to 
the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of 
products and the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realisation in cash and 
cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its 
operating cycle as not exceeding 12 months for the 
purpose of current and – non-current classification of 
assets and liabilities.
2.4	 Use of estimates and judgements
	
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements requires the management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent liabilities as at the date of the Standalone 
Financial Statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. The recognition, measurement, classification 
or disclosure of an item or information in the 
Annual Report 2024-25
124
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
Standalone Financial Statements is made relying on 
these estimates.
	
The estimates and judgments used in the preparation 
of 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements 
are 
continuously evaluated by the Company and are 
based on historical experience and various other 
assumptions and factors (including expectations 
of future events) that the Company believes to 
be reasonable under the existing circumstances. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively in current and future periods.
	
Following is an overview of areas involving higher 
degree of judgement or complexity:
	
Rebates, discounts and sales 
	
The revenue recognition policy requires estimation of 
rebates, discounts and sales returns. There are a varied 
number of rebates/ discount schemes offered which 
are primarily driven by the terms and conditions for 
each scheme including the working methodology to 
be followed and the eligibility criteria for each of the 
scheme. The estimates for rebates/ discounts are based 
on evaluation of eligibility criteria and the past trend 
analysis. The expected sales returns are estimated 
based on a detailed historical study of trends.
 
Provision for write-down of inventories
	
The Company writes down inventories to net realisable 
value based on an estimate of the realisability of 
inventories. Write downs on inventories are recorded 
where events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the balances may not realised. The identification 
of write-downs requires the use of estimates of 
net selling prices of the down-graded inventories. 
Where the expectation is different from the original 
estimate, such difference will impact the carrying 
value of inventories and write-downs of inventories in 
the periods in which such estimate has been changed.
	
Defined benefit obligation
	
The Company provides defined benefit employee 
retirement plans. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligations depends on a number of factors 
that are determined on an actuarial basis using 
a number of assumptions. The assumptions used 
in determining the net cost / (income) for post 
employments plans include the discount rate, salary 
escalation rate, attrition rate and mortality rate. 
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the 
carrying amount of such obligations.
	
The appropriate discount rate, salary escalation rate 
are determined and attrition rate at the end of each 
year. In determining the appropriate discount rate, 
the interest rates of government bonds of maturity 
approximating the terms of the related plan liability 
are considered and attrition rate and salary escalation 
rate is determined based on the past trends adjusted 
for expected changes in rate in the future.
	
Impairment of trade receivables
	
The impairment allowance for trade receivable are 
based on expected credit loss method. The judgement 
is used in making the assumptions in calculating the 
default rate required for identifying the allowance 
as per the expected credit loss method at the end of 
each reporting period. 
 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets
	
The useful life of the assets are determined in 
accordance with Schedule II to the Act. In cases, 
where the useful life is different from that or is not 
prescribed in Schedule II, it is based on technical 
advice, taking into account amongst other things, 
the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the 
asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past 
history of replacement, anticipated technological 
changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance. 
The Company reviews its estimate of the useful life of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
at each balance sheet date. 
	
Recognition of deferred tax assets 
	
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be 
recognised is based on an assessment of the 
probability of the Company’s future taxable income 
(supported by reliable evidence) against which the 
deferred tax assets can be utilised.
	
Evaluation of indicators for impairment of assets 
	
The evaluation of applicability of indicators of 
impairment of assets requires assessment of several 
external and internal factors which could result in 
deterioration of recoverable amount of the assets.
	
Contingent liabilities 
	
At each balance sheet date, basis the management 
judgment, changes in facts and legal aspects, the 
Company assesses the requirement of provisions 
against 
the 
outstanding 
contingent 
liabilities. 
However, the actual future outcome may be different 
from this judgement.

for the year ended 31 March 2025
	
Impairment of financial assets 
	
At each balance sheet date, based on historical default 
rates observed over expected life, existing market 
conditions as well as forward looking estimates, the 
management assesses the expected credit losses on 
outstanding receivables. Further, management also 
considers the factors that may influence the credit 
risk of its receivables / customer base, including the 
default risk associated with respective industry and 
country in which the customer operates.
	
Fair value measurements 
	
Management 
applies 
valuation 
techniques 
to 
determine fair value of equity shares (where active 
market quotes are not available). This involves 
developing estimates and assumptions around 
volatility, dividend yield which may affect the value 
of equity shares.
 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
	
In assessing impairment, the Company estimates 
the recoverable amounts of each non-financial asset 
based on expected future cash flows and uses an 
interest rate to discount them. Estimation uncertainty 
relates to assumptions about future cash flows and 
the determination of a suitable discount rate.
 
Share-based payments 
	
The grant date fair value of the option granted to 
employees is recognised as employee expense, with 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period 
that the employee become unconditionally entitled 
to the option. The increase in equity recognised in 
connection with share-based payment transaction 
is presented as a separate component in equity 
under ‘share based payment reserve’. The amount 
recognised as expense is adjusted to reflect the impact 
of the revision estimated based on the number of 
options that are expected to vest, in the standalone 
statement of profit and with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
	
Provisions 
	
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a 
present obligation as a result of past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made. Provisions (excluding defined 
benefit plan) are not discounted to their present 
value and are determined based on best estimate 
of the amount required to settle the obligation at 
the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current 
best estimates.
	
Estimates 
and 
judgements 
are 
continuously 
evaluated. They are based on historical experience 
and other factors including expectation of future 
events that may have a financial impact on the 
Company and that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances.
2.5	 Property, plant and equipment
	
All the items of property, plant and equipment 
are measured at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation 
and 
impairment 
losses, 
if 
any. 
Costs include purchase price, freight, import duties, 
non-refundable purchase taxes and other expenses 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
Cost also includes borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition criteria is met.
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Company and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. All other expenses of repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the standalone 
statement of profit and loss during the reporting 
period in which they are incurred.
	
Leasehold improvements are stated at historical 
cost less amounts amortised proportionate to 
expired lease periods.
	
Depreciation method, estimated useful lives and 
residual value:
 
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method 
applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of 
Schedule II to the Act or per that evaluated vide 
technical evaluations.
	
The range of estimated useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment are as under:

* Useful life of plant and equipment is determined based on 
the internal assessment supported by independent technical 
   evaluation.
	
The management believes that the useful lives, 
as given above, best represent the period over 
which the management expects to use these assets. 
The Company reviews the useful lives and residual 
value at each reporting date.
	
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the 
period of lease or their useful life, whichever is lower. 
	
Depreciation on the property, plant and equipment 
added/ disposed off/ discarded during the year is 
provided on pro- rata basis with reference to the 
month of addition/ disposal/ discarding. Gains and 
losses on disposals/ derecogniszing the assets are 
determined as the difference between the net 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and are recognized in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss. 
2.6	 Intangible assets
	
Intangible 
assets 
are 
measured 
at 
cost 
less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, 
if any. Intangible assets developed or acquired with 
finite useful life are amortised on straight-line basis 
over the useful life as specified below:
Category

2.7	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each Balance Sheet date. If there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal / external factors, 
an asset is tested for impairment. When the carrying 
cost of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, an 
impairment loss is charged to standalone statement 
of profit and loss in the year in which an asset is 
identified as impaired.
	
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior 
years is recorded when there is an indication that the 
impairment losses recognised for the assets no longer 
exists, or have decreased.
2.8	 Inventories
 
Inventories include raw material, work-in-progress, 
finished goods, stock-in-trade, stores and spares, and 
packing materials. Inventories are valued at lower 
of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory 
comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes (other 
than those subsequently recoverable from tax 
authorities) and all other costs incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and 
condition. Cost is determined on weighted average 
basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated 
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.
	
Raw material, stores and spares and packing materials 
are not written down below cost if the finished 
products, in which they will be used, are expected to 
be sold at or above cost. 
 
Finished goods and work-in-progress include costs 
of direct materials, direct labour and a proportion 
of variable manufacturing overheads based on 
the normal operating capacity but excluding 
borrowing cost.
	
Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory are 
duly provided on the basis of management estimates.
2.9	 Revenue recognition
	
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance 
obligation is measured at the amount of transaction 
price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that 
performance obligation. Revenue is recognised upon 
transfer of control of promised products to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration the 
Company expects to receive in exchange for those 
products. Revenue is measured net of rebates, returns, 
discounts and taxes. A receivable is recognised by the 
company when control is transferred as this is the 
point in time where consideration is unconditional 
because only the passage of time is required for the 
payment to be received.

for the year ended 31 March 2025
	
No element of financing is deemed to be present 
as the sales are made with a credit term of 
less than 365 days.
	
The Company applies the revenue recognition criteria 
to each component of the revenue transaction as 
set out below: 
	
Sale of products
	
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised 
when the Company satisfies performance obligation 
by transferring promised goods to the customer. 
Performance obligations are satisfied at the point of 
time when the customer obtains controls of the asset 
which is on dispatch of goods. Where performance 
obligations are satisfied upon delivery based on the 
terms of the contract, the revenue is recognised upon 
such delivery. 
	
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance 
obligation is measured at the amount of transaction 
price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that 
performance obligation. The transaction price of 
goods sold and services rendered is net of variable 
consideration on account of various discounts, 
rebates and other schemes offered by the Company 
as part of the contract.
	
Revenue (other than sale of products)
	
Revenue (other than sale of products) is recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue 
can be reliably measured.
	
Interest income
	
Interest income is recorded on accrual basis using 
the EIR method.
	
Dividend
	
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s 
right to receive dividend is established, which is 
generally when shareholders approve the dividend.
	
Other income
	
Other income is recognised when no significant 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
its 
determination 
and 
realisation exists.
	
Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity.
	
A.	
Non-derivative financial instruments:
	
1.	
Financial assets
	
(i)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
	
	
Financial assets are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions 
of 
the 
instruments. 
On 
initial 
recognition, a financial asset is measured at 
fair value. In case of financial assets which are 
recognised at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL), their transaction costs are recognised 
in the standalone statement of profit and loss. 
In other cases, the transaction cost are attributed 
to the acquisition value of the financial asset. 
	
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
	
	
Financial 
assets 
are 
classified 
as 
subsequently measured at:
	
	
(a)	 Amortised cost,
	
	
(b)	 Fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) or
	
	
(c)	
Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (‘FVOCI’)
	
	
The 
above 
classification 
is 
determined 
considering:
	
	
(a)	 the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and
	
	
(b)	 the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their recognition, except if and in the period 
the Company changes its business model for 
managing the financial assets.
	
	
(a)	 Measured at amortised cost:
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, if these financial assets 
are held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold these assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(b)	 Measured at FVOCI:
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at FVOCI, if these financial assets are held 
within a business model whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual 
Annual Report 2024-25
128
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
cash flows that give rise on specified dates 
to solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding and 
selling financial assets. Fair value movements 
are recognised in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). Interest income measured 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) method 
and impairment losses, if any are recognised 
in the standalone statement of profit and 
loss. On derecognition, cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the OCI is 
reclassified from equity to the standalone 
statement of profit and loss under the head 
‘Other income’/ ‘Other expenses’.
	
	
(c)	
Measured at FVTPL:
	
Financial assets, other than investments 
in equity instruments, are subsequently 
measured at FVTPL unless they are measured 
at amortised cost or at FVOCI. Such financial 
assets are measured at fair value with all 
changes in fair value, including interest 
income and dividend income if any, 
recognised in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
	
Investments in equity instruments:
	
On 
initial 
recognition, 
the 
Company 
can make an irrevocable election (on an 
instrument-by-instrument basis) to present 
the subsequent changes in fair value in 
OCI that would otherwise be measured at 
FVTPL pertaining to investments in equity 
instruments (other than investment in 
subsidiaries). This election is not permitted 
if the equity investment is held for trading. 
These elected investments are initially 
measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs. Subsequently, they are measured at 
fair value with gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value recognised in OCI 
and accumulated in the ‘Reserve for equity 
instruments through other comprehensive 
income’. The cumulative gain or loss is not 
reclassified to the standalone statement of 
profit and loss on disposal of the investments. 
However, the Company may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
Dividends 
on 
these 
investments 
in 
equity instruments are recognised in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss 
under the head ‘Other income’ when the 
Company’s right to receive the dividend is 
established, it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the dividend will 
flow to the entity, the dividend does not 
represent a recovery of part of cost of the 
investment and the amount of dividend can 
be measured reliably.
	
	
	
Investments in subsidiaries:
	
Investments in subsidiaries is carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Where an indication of impairment exists, 
the carrying amount of the investment is 
assessed. Where the carrying amount of 
an investment is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount, it is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount 
and the difference is transferred to the 
standalone statement of profit and loss. 
On disposal of investment, the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount is charged or credited to 
the standalone statement of profit and loss.
	
(iii)	 Impairment:
	
The Company recognises a loss allowance for 
expected credit losses (‘ECL’) on financial assets 
that are measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI. 
The credit loss is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to an entity 
in accordance with the contract and all the cash 
flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original 
effective interest rate (‘EIR’) . This is assessed on 
an individual or collective basis after considering 
all reasonable and supportable information 
including that which is forward-looking.
	
The Company’s trade receivables do not 
contain 
significant 
financing 
component 
and loss allowance on trade receivables is 
measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL 
i.e. expected cash shortfalls, being simplified 
approach for recognition of impairment loss 
allowance. Under simplified approach, the 
Company does not track changes in credit risk 
individually. Rather it recognises impairment 
loss allowance based on the lifetime ECL at each 
reporting date right from its initial recognition. 
The Company uses a provision matrix to 
determine impairment loss allowance on the 
portfolio of trade receivables. The provision 
matrix is based on its historically observed

default rates over the expected life of the trade 
receivable and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the historically 
observed default rates are updated and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
	
For financial assets other than trade receivables, 
the Company recognises 12-month ECL for all 
originated or acquired financial assets if at the 
reporting date the credit risk of the financial 
asset has not increased significantly since its 
initial recognition. The ECL are measured 
as lifetime ECL if the credit risk on financial 
asset increases significantly since its initial 
recognition. If, in a subsequent period, credit 
quality of the instrument improves such that 
there is no longer significant increase in credit 
risks since initial recognition, then the Company 
reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance 
based on 12-month ECL. The impairment losses 
and reversals are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss. For equity instruments and 
financial assets measured at FVTPL, there is no 
requirement of impairment testing.
	
(iv)	 Derecognition:
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when: 
	
(a)	 the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire, or 
	
(b)	 it transfers the contractual rights to 
receive the cash flows of the financial 
asset and has substantially transferred all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
financial asset, or
	
(c)	
it retains the contractual rights to receive 
the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the 
cash flows without material delay to one 
or more recipients under a pass through 
arrangement 
(thereby 
substantially 
transferring all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset), or
	
(d)	 it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset and does 
not retain control over the financial asset.
	
When the Company transfers a financial asset, it 
evaluates the extent to which it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
asset. If the Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the financial asset, but retains 
control of the financial asset, the Company 
continues to recognise such financial asset to 
the extent of its continuing involvement in the 
financial asset. In that case, the Company also 
recognises an associated liability. The financial 
asset and the associated liability are measured 
on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations 
that the Company has retained.
	
2.	
Financial liabilities:
	
(i)	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments. Financial liabilities 
are initially recognised at amortised costs 
or fair value, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs for all financial liabilities not 
carried at FVTPL.
	
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
	
The 
Company 
subsequently 
measures 
all 
non-derivative financial liabilities at amortised 
cost using EIR method. A gain or loss on a financial 
liability measured at amortised cost is recognised 
in the standalone statement of profit and loss 
when the financial liability is derecognised as 
well as through EIR amortisation process.
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of 
the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as 
finance costs in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss.
	
(iii)	 Derecognition:
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference between the carrying amount 
of the financial liability derecognized and 
the consideration paid is recognised in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss.

Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset, and the net amount is reported in the 
balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable 
legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, 
to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
	
3.	
Equity instruments:
	
An equity instrument is a contract that 
evidences residual interest in the assets of the 
Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are 
recognised at the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs.
	
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity 
instruments 
is 
recognised 
and 
deducted 
directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the standalone statement of profit and loss 
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation 
of the Company’s own equity instruments. 
Dividends paid on equity instruments are directly 
reduced from equity.
	
B.	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
	
The 
Company 
uses 
derivative 
financial 
instruments, such as forward foreign exchange 
contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks. 
Such 
derivative 
financial 
instruments 
are 
initially recognised at fair value on the date 
on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, 
with changes in fair value recognised in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.10	Fair value measurements
	
The Company measures financial instruments such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
 
• 
in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
 
• 
in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability 
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their best economic interest.
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets 
and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. 
derived from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
Standalone Financial Statements on a recurring 
basis, the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting year. For the 
purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis 
of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or 
liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.
2.11	Foreign currency transactions
	
The Company’s Standalone Financial Statements are 
presented in INR which is also its functional currency.
	
a)	
Initial recognition:
	
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
Statutory Reports
01-106
Standalone Financial Statements
107-182
Consolidated Financial Statements
183-253
131
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
the transaction. Exchange differences arising on 
foreign exchange transactions settled during the 
year are recognised in the standalone statement 
of profit and loss for the year.
	
b)	
Measurement of foreign currency items at the 
balance sheet date:
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currency remaining unsettled at the end 
of the year, are translated at the closing exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognised in 
the standalone statement of profit and loss.
 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non-monetary items measured at 
fair value is treated in line with the recognition 
of the gain or loss on the change in fair value 
of the item (i.e. translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in 
the OCI or the standalone statement of profit 
and loss are also reclassified in the OCI or the 
statement of profit and loss, respectively).
2.12	Taxes on income
	
Tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax 
expense is recognised in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss except to the extent it relates to items 
directly recognised in equity or in OCI.
	
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due 
to temporary difference between accounting and tax 
treatments, and due to items that are never taxable or 
tax deductible. Tax provisions are included in current 
liabilities. Interest and penalties on tax liabilities are 
provided for in the tax charge. The Company offsets, 
the current tax assets and liabilities (on a year-on-
year basis) where it has a legally enforceable right 
and where it intends to settle liabilities or realise the 
assets and liabilities on net basis, and they relate to 
income-tax levied by same authorities.
	
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance 
sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable 
temporary differences arising between the tax base 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount 
in Standalone Financial Statements. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
when it is more likely than not that the assets will not 
be realised in the future.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
income tax asset to be utilised.
	
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
	
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
While determining the tax provisions, the Company 
assesses whether each uncertain tax position is to be 
considered separately or together with one or more 
uncertain tax positions depending upon the nature 
and circumstances of each uncertain tax position.
2.13	Employee benefits
 
The Company has following post-employment plans:
	
(a)	 Defined contribution plan such as provident fund 
 
(b) Defined benefit plan-gratuity
 
(c) 
Short-term employee benefits
	
(d)	 Compensated absences
 
(e) Share-based payments
	
a)	
Defined contribution plan
 
Under defined contribution plan, the Company 
pays pre-defined amounts to separate funds and 
does not have any legal or informal obligation 
to pay additional sums. Defined contribution 
plan comprise of contributions to the employees’ 
provident fund with the government and certain 
state plans like employees’ state insurance and 
employees’ pension scheme. The Company’s 
Annual Report 2024-25
132
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
payments to the defined contribution plans are 
recognised as expenses during the period in 
which the employees perform the services that 
the payment covers.
	
b)	
Defined benefit plan:
	
The liability or asset recognised in the standalone 
balance sheet in respect of defined benefit 
gratuity plan is the present value of defined 
benefit obligations at the end of the reporting 
year less fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
actuary through actuarial valuation using the 
projected unit credit method.
	
The 
Company 
recognises 
the 
following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation 
as an expense in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss:
	
	
(i)	
Service costs comprising current service 
costs, 
past 
service 
costs, 
gains 
and 
losses on curtailment and non-routine 
settlements; and
	
	
(ii)	 Net interest expense or income
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying 
the discount rate to the net balance of the 
defined benefit obligation and fair value of 
plan assets. This cost is included in ‘Employee 
benefits expense’ in the standalone statement 
of profit and loss.
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit 
liability/ (asset) comprise of :
	
	
(i)	
actuarial (gains)/ losses,
	
	
(ii)	 return on plan assets, excluding amounts 
included in interest income and
	
	
(iii)	 any change in the effect of the asset 
ceiling, excluding amounts included in 
interest income are recognised in the 
period in which they occur directly in OCI. 
Remeasurements are not reclassified to the 
standalone statement of profit and loss in 
subsequent periods.
	
Ind AS 19, ’Employee benefits’ requires the 
exercise of judgment in relation to various 
assumptions including future pay rises, inflation, 
discount rates and employee demographics. 
The Company determines the assumptions in 
conjunction with its actuaries, and believes these 
assumptions to be in line with best practice, 
but the application of different assumptions 
could have an effect on the amounts reflected 
in the standalone statement of profit and loss, 
OCI and standalone balance sheet. There may 
also be interdependency between some of 
the assumptions.
 
c) 
Short-term employee benefits
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including 
non-monetary benefits that are expected to 
be settled wholly within 12 months after the 
end of the period in which the employees 
render the related service are classified as 
short-term employee benefits. These benefits 
include salaries and wages, short-term bonus, 
incentives etc. These are measured at the 
amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities 
are settled. The liabilities are presented as 
current employee benefit obligations in the 
standalone balance sheet.
	
d)	
Compensated absences
	
The Company has a policy for compensated 
absences to allow leave entitlements which 
would 
be 
non-accumulating 
in 
nature 
except for a certain class of employees. 
Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognised in the period in which 
the absences occur. Necessary impact of the 
same had been considered in the Standalone 
Financial Statements. 
	
The Company presents the entire leave as a 
current liability in the standalone balance sheet, 
since it does not have any unconditional right 
to defer its settlement for twelve months after 
the reporting date
 
e) 
Share-based payments
 
Equity-settled 
share-based 
payments 
to 
employees are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instruments at the grant date using an 
appropriate valuation model.
	
The fair value determined at the grant date 
of the equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Company’s estimate of 
equity instruments that will eventually vest, with 
a corresponding increase in equity. At the end 
of each reporting period, the Company revises 
its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
Statutory Reports

Consolidated Financial Statements
183-253

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
expected to vest. The impact of the revision of 
the original estimates, if any, is recognised in 
the standalone statement of profit and loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to 
the equity-settled share-based payment reserve.
	
No expense is recognised for options that do not 
ultimately vest because non-market performance 
and/ or service conditions have not been met.
2.14	Leases
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for buildings and land. The Company assesses 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception 
of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether:
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset,
	
(ii)	 the 
Company 
has 
the 
right 
to 
obtain 
substantially all of the economic benefits from 
use of the identified asset, throughout the 
period of use, and
	
(iii)	 the Company has the right to direct the use of the 
identified asset, throughout the period of use.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 
twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases 
of low value assets. For these short-term leases and 
leases of low value assets, the Company recognises 
the lease payments as an expense in the standalone 
statement of profit and loss.
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability. They are subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
if any. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates. The lease 
liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing 
the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease 
liability and reducing the carrying amount to reflect 
the lease payments made.
	
A lease liability is remeasured upon the occurrence 
of certain events such as a change in the lease term 
or a change in an index or rate used to determine 
lease payments. The remeasurement normally also 
adjusts the leased assets. Lease liabilities and right-of-
use assets have been separately presented in the 
standalone balance sheet and lease payments have 
been classified as financing cash flows.
2.15	Provisions and contingencies
	
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, 
the Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions for 
onerous contracts are recognised when the expected 
benefits to be derived by the Company from a 
contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of 
meeting the future obligations under the contract.
	
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made where 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may probably not require an outflow of resources 
or an obligation for which the future outcome cannot 
be ascertained with reasonable certainty. When there 
is a possible or a present obligation where the 
likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no 
provision or disclosure is made.
2.16	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the standalone balance 
sheet and for the purpose of statement of cash flows 
include cash and cheques in hand, balances in current 
accounts with banks, demand deposits with banks 
and other short-term highly liquid investments (with 
maturity up to 3 months) that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value.
2.17	Earnings per equity share
	
Basic earnings per equity share are calculated by 
dividing the net profit/ loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year. Earnings considered in ascertaining the 
Company’s earnings per equity share is the net profit/ 
loss for the year. 
Annual Report 2024-25
134
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit/ loss for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders and the weighted average number 
of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for 
the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.18	Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
Chairman and Managing Director, who is considered 
as chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’). As the 
Company’s current business activity primarily falls 
within a single business and geographical segment 
and the CODM monitors the operating results of its 
business as a single unit for the purpose of making 
decisions about resource allocation and performance 
assessment, there are no separate disclosures required 
under Ind AS 108, ‘Segment Reporting’. 
2.19	Borrowing costs
	
General and specific borrowing costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets are capitalised as 
a part of cost of those assets during the period till 
all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying 
assets for their intended use or sale are complete. 
Qualifying 
assets 
are 
assets 
that 
necessarily 
take a substantial period to get ready for their 
intended use or sale.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
2.20	Exceptional items
	
When an item of income or expense within profit/ 
(loss) from ordinary activity is of such size, nature or 
incidence that their disclosure is relevant to explain the 
performance of the Company for the year, the nature 
and amount of such items is disclosed separately in 
the standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.21	Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended 
31 March 2025, MCA has notified amendments to 
Ind AS 116, ‘Leases’, relating to sale and leaseback 
transactions, which is applicable w.e.f. 1st April 2024. 
The Company has reviewed the new pronouncements 
and based on its evaluation has determined that 
it is not likely to have any significant impact in its 
financial statements.

Extension and termination option
Extension and termination options are included in a number of leases . These are used to maximise operational flexibility 
in terms of managing the assets used in the Company’s operations. The majority of extension and termination options 
held are excersiable when mutually agreed between the lessor and the Company.
Variable lease payments
Some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to revenue generated from a store. Variable payment 
terms are used for a variety of reasons, including minimising the fixed costs base for newly established stores. Variable lease 
payments that depend on revenue are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which the condition 
that triggers those payments occurs.
Terms of leases
The Company’s major leasing arrangements are in respect of commercial premises (including furniture and fittings 
therein wherever applicable taken on leave and license basis) having various lease terms.

Defined benefit plan - gratuity
	
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded). The plan requires contributions to be made to a 
separately administered fund. The plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Every employee who has 
completed continuous services of five years or more gets a gratuity on death, resignation, retirement or permanent 
disablement at 15 days salary (last drawn salary) for each completed year of service. Gratuity is funded through 
investment with Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) under its respective Group Gratuity Scheme.

These assumptions were developed by the management with the assistance of independent actuarial appraisers. 
Discount factors are determined close to each year end by reference to government bonds of relevant economic 
markets and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related obligation. Other assumptions are 
based on management’s historical experience. The estimate of future salary increase considered in actuarial valuation 
take into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand in the 
employment market.

vii)	 Sensitivity analysis
	
The financial statements are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions. The changes to the defined benefit obligation 
for increase / decrease of 1% from assumed salary growth, attrition rate and discount rate are given below. 
The following table summarises the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions on the defined benefit 
obligation at year-end.

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting year, while holding all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the projected benefit 
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the 
assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the projected benefit obligation has been 
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year which is the same method as applied 
in calculating the projected benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior year.

viii)	 Risks associated with defined benefit plan:
	
Gratuity is a defined benefit plan and entity is exposed to the following risks
Interest rate risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the government securities will increase the present 
value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases 
the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of asset.
Salary risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future 
salaries of members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level 
will increase the plan's liability.
Investment risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which 
is determined by reference to market yield at the end of the reporting year on government 
bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Asset 
Liability 
Matching ('ALM') risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of 
Rule 101 of the  Income-tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.
Mortality risk
Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age 
only, plan does not have any longevity risk. Mortality rate during employment is calculated 
considering Indian Assured Lives Mortality 2012-14 (Urban) (Previous year: Indian Assured Lives 
Mortality 2012-14 (Urban))
Concentration risk 
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance company 
and a default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as insurance 
companies have to follow regulatory guidelines which mitigate risk.

Fair value hierarchy 
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value - recurring fair value measurement

Valuation techniques used to determine fair value 
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset 
and paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The following methods were 
used to estimate the fair values:
 
-  
Other non-current financial assets and liabilities : The carrying value is considered to be approximate to 
their fair value.
 
-  
Derivative financial assets and liabilities: The Company enters into derivative contracts with various 
counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Forward foreign currency 
contracts are determined using forward exchange rates at the reporting date.
 
-  
Current investments-The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value (‘NAV’) 
as stated by the  issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements as at Balance Sheet date. 
Annual Report 2024-25
168
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
(All amounts in ` Crores, unless otherwise stated)
NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the price at which 
issuers will redeem such units from the investors.
 
- 
Trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, other current financial assets, trade payables 
and other current financial liabilities: Approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term 
maturities of these instruments.
 
-  
Borrowings taken by the Company are as per the Company’s credit and liquidity risk assessment and there is no 
comparable instrument having the similar terms and conditions with related security being pledged and hence 
the carrying value of the borrowings represents the best estimate of its fair value.
iii)	 There have been no transfers amongst the levels of fair value hierarchy during the year.
iv) 	 Fair value of assets and liabilities which are measured at amortised cost for which fair value are disclosed:

Financial risk management
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks namely market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Company’s primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and to minimise potential adverse 
effects on its financial performance. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, 
which are summarised below:

Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes 
in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices) Market risk is 
attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments and all short-term and long-term debt. Market risk 
comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk 
or commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, trade payables, 
trade receivables, investments, derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments. The Company is 
exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of 
its investments
(a)	 Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates.  The Company is mainly exposed to this risk due to borrowings having variable 
rate of interest.

(b)	 Foreign currency risk
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s foreign exchange risk arises from its trade payables and trade 
receivables denominated in foreign currencies. The results of the Company’s operations can be affected as the 
Indian Rupees (‘INR’) is volatile against these currencies. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments 
such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency 
exposures and also inherent hedging as it is engaged in the export of manufacturing products and import of raw 
materials and stock-in-trade. The Company has a treasury team which monitors the foreign exchange fluctuations 
on a continuous basis and advises the management of any material adverse effect on the Company.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity in the USD, with other variables held constant. The below impact 
on the Company’s standalone profit or loss before tax is based on changes in the fair value of unhedged foreign 
currency monetary assets and liabilities as at standalone balance sheet date. The Company’s exposure to foreign 
currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

B	
Credit risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails 
to meet its contractual obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and 
cash equivalents, other financial assets as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets.
	
The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Company assesses the 
credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade 
and other receivables. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of allowance 
for expected credit loss for trade receivables( refer note 14).
	
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. 
The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer 
operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing 
credit limits, continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers.
 
Also, forward-looking information is also incorporated into expected credit losses, including the use of 
macroeconomic information.
	
In respect of trade receivables, the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any group of 
counter-parties having similar characteristics. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers in various 
geographical areas. The Company has very limited history of customer default, and considers the credit quality of 
trade receivables for evaluation of allowance for expected credit loss.
	
The credit risk on liquid funds such as balance in current and deposit accounts with banks and derivative financial 
instruments (included in other financial assets) is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings.

Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. 
The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due.
 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an 
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company’s short-term, medium-term 
and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The  Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining 
adequate reserves, banking facilities and committed borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and by monitoring rolling 
forecasts of its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining 
sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the Company does not 
breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Safari Industries (India) Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements of Safari Industries (India) 
Limited (‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as ‘the Group’), as listed in Annexure A, 
which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 
31 March 2025, the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow and the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for 
the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including material accounting 
policy information and other explanatory information.
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give 
the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (‘the Act’) in the manner so required and give 
a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified under 
section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India of 
the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 
March 2025, and their consolidated profit (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated cash 
flows and the consolidated changes in equity for the 
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group, in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the Code of 
Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
5.	
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Revenue Recognition under Ind AS 115, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers  (‘Ind AS 115’)
Refer note 2.10 – ‘Revenue recognition’ and note 25 
and 41 – ‘Revenue from operations’ to the consolidated 
financial statements for the related accounting policy on 
revenue recognition and details of revenue recognised 
during the year.
Revenue for the Group consists primarily of sale 
of manufactured and traded goods. Owing to the 
multiplicity of the Group’s channels through which 
sale of products is made, and diverse terms of contracts 
with customers, revenue is determined to be an area 
involving significant risk and hence, requiring significant 
auditor attention.
Our audit included, but was not limited to, the following 
procedures performed in respect of revenue recognition:
• 
Understood the process of revenue recognition and 
evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting 
policy adopted by the management on revenue 
recognition in accordance with Ind AS 115.
• 
Evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness 
of 
manual 
and 
information 
technology internal financial controls around 
revenue recognition process, including controls 
over identification of the distinct performance 
obligations, determination of transaction price 
and satisfaction of performance obligations. 
Procedures 
performed 
included 
enquiry, 
observation and inspection of evidence in respect 
of operation of these controls.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Further, the application of principles enunciated under 
Ind AS 115 involves significant judgements / material 
estimates relating to identification of performance 
obligations, 
determination 
of 
transaction 
price, 
including impact of variable consideration in the form 
of rebates and discounts, assessment of satisfaction of 
the identified performance obligations represented by 
the transfer of control of the products sold.
Revenue is a key performance indicator and there is 
presumed significant risk of revenue being overstated 
during the year on account of variation in the timing of 
transfer of control, due pressure to achieve performance 
targets and meeting the external expectations.
Owing to significance of the amount, multiplicity of 
the Group’s channels through which sale of products is 
made, volume of transactions, nature of customer with 
varied terms of contracts, audit of revenue recognized 
during the year requires significant auditor attention 
and accordingly, revenue recognition is considered to 
be a key audit matter for the current year audit.
• 
Selected channel-wise samples of contracts with 
customers, and performed the following procedures:
1.	
Read, analysed and identified the distinct 
performance obligations in these contracts;
2.	
Compared 
such 
performance 
obligations 
with those identified and recorded by the 
management; and
3.	
Reviewed 
contract 
terms 
to 
determine 
the transaction price including variable 
consideration (discounts, rebates, returns, 
etc.), if any, to determine the appropriate 
transaction price for measuring revenue.
• 
Tested, on a sample basis, revenue transactions 
recorded during the year, and in the period 
before and after year-end, relating to sale of 
products by inspecting supporting documents 
inter-alia customer contracts, sales orders, proofs 
of dispatch, customer acceptance, invoices, for the 
accuracy and completeness of revenue recorded 
for such transactions.
• 
Assessed the underlying assumptions used by 
the management for determination of provision 
recognised as at year end with respect to rebates, 
discount rates, sales returns, and traced inputs used 
to source data. 
• 
Further, evaluated historical accuracy of such 
estimates made in the earlier periods with actual 
results of current year to determine and consider 
estimation uncertainty involved.
• 
Tested on a sample basis, credit notes issued 
during the year and subsequent to year end to 
confirm revenue recognised during the period 
was appropriate.
• 
Performed analytical procedures for reasonableness 
of revenue recorded during the year, such as trend 
analysis by channel, by customer.
• 
Assessed the appropriateness and adequacy of 
disclosures included in the consolidated financial 
statements for revenue recognition from sale of 
goods in accordance with the requirements of 
applicable accounting standards.
Capital expenditure incurred towards property, plant 
and equipment (including capital work-in-progress)
Refer note 2.6 for the material accounting policy 
information and note 3 and 5 for the financial disclosures 
in the accompanying consolidated   financial statements.
During the current year, the Group has incurred 
significant capital expenditure of ` 135.65 Crore and 
` 12.10 Crore towards property, plant and equipment 
(‘PPE’) and capital work-in-progress (‘CWIP’), mainly 
with respect to setting up of a new production plant.  
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited 
to the following:
• 
Obtained an understanding of the management’s 
process of recording the transactions pertaining 
to capital expenditure incurred by the Group and 
assessed the appropriateness of the accounting 
policies adopted by the Group in accordance with 
the requirements of Ind AS 16.
• 
Evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
key 
controls 
around 
capitalisation of costs;
Annual Report 2024-25
184
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Such capital expenditure includes purchase costs and 
directly attributable costs, which have been capitalised 
in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 16, Property, 
Plant and Equipment (‘Ind AS 16’).
Determining 
whether 
expenditure 
meets 
the 
capitalisation criteria, specifically with regard to 
whether they are operational or capital in nature, 
involves significant management judgement and is 
essential in order to ensure that the recognition and 
measurement principles given under Ind AS 16 are met.
Considering the magnitude of capital expenditure 
incurred, the nature and volume of transactions and 
significant efforts involved in determination of eligible 
costs for capitalisation, this matter has been identified 
as key audit matter in the current year audit.
• 
Performed substantive testing by selecting samples 
from amounts capitalised during the year by 
inspecting supporting documents and evaluating 
whether assets capitalised satisfied the recognition 
criteria and were recognised accurately in the 
correct periods and in correct class of assets with 
correct amounts. 
• 
Assessed the appropriateness and adequacy of the 
related disclosures included in the consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards.
Information other than the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
6.	
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual Report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
	
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information identified above when it becomes 
available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
	
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we 
are required to communicate the matter to those 
charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
7.	
The accompanying consolidated financial statements 
have been approved by the Holding Company’s 
Board of Directors. The Holding Company’s Board 
of Directors are responsible for the matters stated 
in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, 
consolidated 
changes 
in 
equity 
and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance 
with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the 
Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. The respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group are responsible for maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, which have been used for the 
purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
8.	
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for assessing 
the ability of the Group to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those respective Board of Directors are also

process of the companies included in the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
10.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
11.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal controls;
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Holding Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls;
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management;
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern; 
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation; and
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the Group, to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of 
financial statements of such entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements, of which 
we are the independent auditors.
12.	 We 
communicate 
with 
those 
charged 
with 
governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal controls that we identify during our audit.
13.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
14.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
15.	 As required by section 197(16) of the Act, based 
on our audit, we report that the Holding Company 
incorporated in India whose financial statements 
have been audited under the Act has paid 
remuneration to their respective directors during the 
Annual Report 2024-25
186
year in accordance with the provisions of and limits 
laid down under section 197 read with Schedule V 
to the Act. Further, we report that two subsidiaries 
incorporated in India whose financial statements have 
been audited under the Act have not paid or provided 
for any managerial remuneration during the year. 
Accordingly, reporting under section 197(16) of the 
Act is not applicable in respect of such subsidiaries.
16.	 As required by clause (xxi) of paragraph 3 of 
Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2020 (‘the Order’)

of the Order reports issued by us, of companies 
included in the consolidated financial statements 
and covered under the Act, we report that there are 
no qualifications or adverse remarks reported in the 
respective Order reports of such companies.
17.	 As required by section 143(3) of the Act, based on our 
audit, we report, to the extent applicable, that:
a)	
we 
have 
sought 
and 
obtained 
all 
the 
information and explanations which to the best 
of our knowledge and belief were necessary 
for the purpose of our audit of the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements;
b)

as required by law have been kept by the 
Holding Company so far as it appears from 
our examination of those books, including the

trail feature was not enabled at the database 
level as further stated in paragraph 17(h)(vi) 
below on reporting under Rule 11(g) of the 
Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 (as 
amended) in case of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiaries;
c)	
The consolidated financial statements dealt 
with by this report are in agreement with the 
relevant books of account maintained for the 
purpose of preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements;
d)	
In our opinion, the aforesaid consolidated

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members 
of Safari Industries (India) Limited on the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2025
Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 
3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 
‘Act’) 
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of Safari Industries (India) 
Limited (the ‘Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as the ‘Group’), as at and for the year 
ended 31 March 2025, we have audited the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary companies, which are companies covered 
under the Act, as at that date.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary companies, which are 
companies covered under the Act, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial control with 
reference to financial statement criteria established 
by the respective companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting (the ‘Guidance Note’) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (the ‘ICAI’) . These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of the company’s business, 
including adherence to the company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal 
Financial Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary companies, as aforesaid, based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, and the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively 
in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements 
and 
their 
operating 
effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements includes obtaining 
an understanding of such internal financial controls, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to the consolidated financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
companies as aforesaid.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements 
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
Annual Report 2024-25
190
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements 
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary companies, which are companies covered 
under the Act, have in all material respects, adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal 
financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements criteria established by the respective 
companies considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
issued by the ICAI.

1.	
Corporate information
	
Safari 
Industries 
(India) 
Limited 
(‘the 
Holding 
Company’) is a public limited company domiciled 
in India and incorporated under the provisions of 
the Companies Act as applicable in India. Its equity 
shares are listed on BSE Limited (BSE) and the National 
Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE). The Holding 
Company is engaged in the manufacturing and 
marketing of luggage and luggage accessories.
	
The consolidated financial statements includes the 
financial statements of the Holding Company and 
its wholly owned subsidiaries, Safari Manufacturing 
Limited and Safari Lifestyles Limited.
	
Safari 
Manufacturing 
Limited 
is 
engaged 
in 
manufacturing and distribution of luggage and 
luggage accessories and Safari Lifestyles Limited is 
engaged in the marketing and distribution of luggage 
and luggage accessories. The Holding Company, along 
with the aforementioned two subsidiary companies is, 
hereinafter, collectively referred to as the ‘Group’.
2.	
Material accounting policies
2.1	 General 
information 
and 
statement 
of 
compliance
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise of 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2025, 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including 
other 
comprehensive 
income), 
Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity for year ended 31 March 2025 and 
notes including material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter collectively 
referred to as ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’).
	
These Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’), prescribed 
under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read 
with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 as amended and other relevant provisions of the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
All amounts included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are reported in Indian Rupees (‘INR’) 
in Crores unless otherwise stated and ‘*’ denotes 
amounts less than fifty thousand rupees.
2.2	 Basis of preparation
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared on going concern basis using accrual method 
of accounting and historical cost convention except 
for the following material items that have been 
measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS:
	
1.	
Certain 
financial 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
(including 
derivative 
financial 
instruments) 
measured at fair value;
 
2. 
Defined 
benefit 
and 
other 
long-term 
employee benefits; and 
 
3. 
Share-based payments.
2.3	 Current and non-current classification 
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current 
or non-current as per the Group’s operating cycle 
and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products 
and the time between the acquisition of assets for 
processing and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating 
cycle as not exceeding 12 months for the purpose 
of current and non-current classification of assets 
and liabilities.
2.4	 Principles of consolidation
	
Subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has 
control. The Group controls an entity when the Group 
is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power to 
direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiary is 
fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. It is deconsolidated from 
the date when control ceases.
	
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group are 
combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together 
book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses, after fully eliminating intra-group 
balances and intra-group transactions resulting in 
unrealised profits or loss in accordance with Ind AS 
110,’Consolidated Financial Statements’.
	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared 
using uniform accounting policies for like transactions 
and other events in similar circumstances and necessary 
adjustments required for deviations, if any, have been 
made in the consolidated financial statements.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
2.5	 Use of estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements requires the management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent liabilities as at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. The recognition, measurement, classification 
or disclosure of an item or information in the 
consolidated financial statements is made relying on 
these estimates.
	
The estimates and judgments used in the preparation 
of 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
continuously evaluated by the Group and are based on 
historical experience and various other assumptions 
and factors (including expectations of future events) 
that the Group believes to be reasonable under the 
existing circumstances. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. Any revision to accounting 
estimates is recognised prospectively in current and 
future periods.
	
Following is an overview of areas involving higher 
degree of judgement or complexity:
 	
Rebates, discounts and sales 
	
The revenue recognition policy requires estimation of 
rebates, discounts and sales returns. There are a varied 
number of rebates/ discount schemes offered which 
are primarily driven by the terms and conditions for 
each scheme including the working methodology to 
be followed and the eligibility criteria for each of the 
scheme. The estimates for rebates/ discounts are based 
on evaluation of eligibility criteria and the past trend 
analysis. The expected sales returns are estimated 
based on a detailed historical study of trends.
 
Provision for write-down of inventories
	
The Group writes down inventories to net realisable 
value based on an estimate of the realisability of 
inventories. Write downs on inventories are recorded 
where events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the balances may not realised. The identification 
of write-downs requires the use of estimates of 
net selling prices of the down-graded inventories. 
Where the expectation is different from the original 
estimate, such difference will impact the carrying 
value of inventories and write-downs of inventories in 
the periods in which such estimate has been changed.
	
Defined benefit obligation
	
The Group provides defined benefit employee 
retirement plans. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligations depends on a number of 
factors that are determined on an actuarial basis 
using a number of assumptions. The assumptions 
used in determining the net cost/(income) for post 
employments plans include the discount rate, salary 
escalation rate, attrition rate and mortality rate. 
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the 
carrying amount of such obligations.
	
The appropriate discount rate, salary escalation rate, 
and attrition rate are determined at the end of each 
year. In determining the appropriate discount rate, 
the interest rates of government bonds of maturity 
approximating the terms of the related plan liability 
are considered and attrition rate and salary escalation 
rate is determined based on the past trends adjusted 
for expected changes in rate in the future.
	
Impairment of trade receivables
	
The impairment allowance for trade receivables is 
based on expected credit loss method. The judgement 
is used in making the assumptions in calculating the 
default rate required for identifying the allowance 
as per the expected credit loss method at the end of 
each reporting period. 
 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets.
	
The useful life of the assets are determined in 
accordance with Schedule II to the Companies Act,

2013. In cases where the useful life is different from 
that or is not prescribed in Schedule II, it is based on 
technical advice, taking into account amongst other 
things, the nature of the asset, the estimated usage 
of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, 
past history of replacement, anticipated technological 
changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance.
The Group reviews its estimate of the useful life of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
at each balance sheet date.
Recognition of deferred tax assets 
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be 
recognised is based on an assessment of the probability 
of the Group’s future taxable income (supported by 
reliable evidence) against which the deferred tax 
assets can be utilised.
Evaluation of indicators for impairment of assets 
The evaluation of applicability of indicators of 
impairment of assets requires assessment of several 
external and internal factors which could result in 
deterioration of recoverable amount of the assets.
Contingent liabilities 
At each balance sheet date, basis the management 
judgment, changes in facts and legal aspects, the 
Group  assesses the requirement of provisions 
against 
the 
outstanding 
contingent 
liabilities. 
However, the actual future outcome may be different 
from this judgement.
Impairment of financial assets 
At each balance sheet date, based on historical default 
rates observed over expected life, existing market 
conditions as well as forward looking estimates, the 
management assesses the expected credit losses on 
outstanding receivables. Further, management also 
considers the factors that may influence the credit risk 
of its receivables, including the default risk associated 
with respective industry and country in which the 
customer operates.
Government grant 
Grants receivables are based on estimates for 
utilisation of the grant as per the regulations as well 
as analysing actual outcomes on a regular basis and 
compliance with stipulated conditions. Changes in 
estimates or non-compliance of stipulated conditions 
could lead to significant changes in grant income 
and are accounted for prospectively over the balance 
obligation period.
Fair value measurements 
Management 
applies 
valuation 
techniques 
to 
determine fair value of equity shares (where active 
market quotes are not available). This involves 
developing 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
around 
volatility, dividend yield which may affect the value of 
equity shares.	
 Impairment of non-financial assets 
In assessing impairment, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amounts of each non-financial asset 
based on expected future cash flows and uses an 
interest rate to discount them. Estimation uncertainty 
relates to assumptions about future cash flows and 
the determination of a suitable discount rate.
Share-based payments  
The grant date fair value of the option granted to 
employees is recognised as employee expense, with 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period that 
the employee become unconditionally entitled to the 
option. The increase in equity recognised in connection 
with share-based payment transaction is presented as 
a separate component in equity under ‘share based 
payment reserve’. The amount recognised as expense 
is adjusted to reflect the impact of the revision 
estimated based on the number of options that are 
expected to vest, in the consolidated statement of 
profit and with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a 
present obligation as a result of past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made. Provisions (excluding defined 
benefit plan) are not discounted to their present 
value and are determined based on best estimate 
of the amount required to settle the obligation at 
the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current 
best estimates.
Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated. 
They are based on historical experience and other 
factors including expectation of future events that 
may have a financial impact on the Group and that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
2.6   Property, plant and equipment
All the items of property, plant and equipment 
are measured at historical cost less accumulated

depreciation 
and 
impairment 
losses, 
if 
any. 
Costs include purchase price, freight, import duties, 
non-refundable purchase taxes and other expenses 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
Cost also includes borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition criteria is met.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other expenses of repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss during the reporting 
period in which they are incurred.
Leasehold improvements are stated at historical 
cost less amounts amortised proportionate to 
expired lease periods.
Capital work-in-progress and pre-operative expenses 
during construction period:
Capital work-in-progress includes property, plant and 
equipment under construction and not ready for use 
as on the balance sheet date.
Depreciation method, estimated useful lives and 
residual value:
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method 
applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of 
Schedule II to the Act or per that evaluated vide 
technical evaluations.
The range of estimated useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment are as under:
Category

* Useful life of plant and equipment is determined based 
on the internal assessment supported by independent 
technical evaluation.
The management believes that the useful lives, as 
given above, best represent the period over which the 
management expects to use these assets. The Group 
reviews the useful lives and residual value at each 
reporting date.
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the 
period of lease or their useful life, whichever is lower.
Depreciation on the property, plant and equipment 
added/ disposed off/ discarded during the year is 
provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the month 
of addition/ disposal/ discarding. Gains and losses on 
disposals/ derecognising the assets are determined 
as the difference between the net proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.7	  Intangible assets
Intangible 
assets 
are 
measured 
at 
cost 
less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, 
if any. Intangible assets developed or acquired with 
finite useful life are amortised on straight-line basis 
over the useful life as specified below:
Category

2.8	 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date. If there is any indication of 
impairment based on internal / external factors, an 
asset is tested for impairment. When the carrying 
cost of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, an 
impairment loss is charged to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss in the year in which an 
asset is identified as impaired.
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior 
years is recorded when there is an indication that the 
impairment losses recognised for the assets no longer 
exists, or have decreased.

2.9	 Inventories
Inventories include raw material, work-in-progress, 
finished goods, stock-in-trade, stores and spares, and 
packing materials. Inventories are valued at lower 
of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory 
comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes (other 
than those subsequently recoverable from tax 
authorities) and all other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. 
Cost is determined on weighted average basis. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale. 
Raw material, stores and spares and packing materials 
are not written down below cost if the finished 
products, in which they will be used, are expected to 
be sold at or above cost. 
Finished goods and work-in-progress include costs of 
direct materials, direct labour and a proportion of 
variable and fixed manufacturing overheads based 
on the normal operating capacity but excluding 
borrowing costs.
Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory are 
duly provided on the basis of management estimates.
2.10	 Revenue recognition
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance 
obligation is measured at the amount of transaction 
price (net of  variable consideration) allocated to that 
performance obligation. Revenue is recognised upon 
transfer of control of promised products to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration the 
Group expects to receive in exchange for those 
products. Revenue is measured net of rebates, returns, 
discounts and taxes. A receivable is recognised by the 
Group when control is transferred as this is the point 
in time where consideration is unconditional because 
only the passage of time is required for the payment 
to be received.
No element of financing is deemed to be present as the 
sales are made with a credit term of less than 365 days.
The Group applies the revenue recognition criteria 
to each component of the revenue transaction as 
set out below: 
	
Sale of products
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised when the 
Group satisfies performance obligation by transferring 
promised goods to the customer. Performance obligations 
are satisfied at the point of time when the customer 
obtains controls of the asset which is on dispatch of 
goods. Where performance obligations are satisfied 
upon delivery based on the terms of the contract, the 
revenue is recognised upon such delivery. 
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance 
obligation is measured at the amount of transaction 
price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that 
performance obligation. The transaction price of 
goods sold, is net of variable consideration on account 
of various discounts, rebates and other schemes 
offered by the Group as part of the contract.
	
Revenue (other than sale of products)
Revenue (other than sale of products) is recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will   flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured.
	
Interest income
Interest income is recorded on accrual basis using 
the EIR method.
	
Dividend
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right 
to receive dividend is established, which is generally 
when shareholders approve the dividend.
	
Other income
Other income is recognised when no significant 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
its 
determination 
and 
realisation exists.
2.11	Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity.
A.	
Non-derivative financial instruments:
1.	
Financial assets:
	
(i)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
	
	
Financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. On initial recognition, financial 
assets is measured at fair value. In case of financial 
assets which are recognised at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL), their transaction costs are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. In other cases, the transaction 
costs are attributed to the acquisition value of 
the financial asset.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
	
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
	
	
Financial 
assets 
are 
classified 
as 
subsequently measured at:
	
	
(a)	 Amortised cost,
	
	
(b)	 Fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) or
	
	
(c)	
Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (‘FVOCI’)
	
	
The above classification is determined considering:
	
	
(a)	 the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and
	
	
(b)	 the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their recognition, except if and in the period the 
Group changes its business model for managing 
the financial assets.
	
(a)	 Measured at amortised cost:
Financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, if these financial assets are held 
within a business model whose objective is to 
hold these assets in order to collect contractual 
cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified date to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
(b)	 Measured at FVOCI:
Financial assets are subsequently measured at 
FVOCI, if these financial assets are held within 
a business model whose objective is achieved 
by both collecting contractual cash flows that 
give rise on specified dates to solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and selling financial assets. 
Fair value movements are recognised in the 
consolidated other comprehensive income (OCI). 
Interest income measured using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method and impairment 
losses, if any are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. On derecognition, 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
the consolidated OCI is reclassified from equity 
to the consolidated statement of profit and loss 
under the head ‘Other income’/ ’Other expenses’. 
	
(c)	
Measured at FVTPL:
Financial assets, other than investments in equity 
instruments, are subsequently measured at FVTPL 
unless they are measured at amortised cost or at 
FVOCI. Such financial assets are measured at fair 
value with all changes in fair value, including 
interest income and dividend income if any, 
recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
Investments in equity instruments:
On initial recognition, the Group can make 
an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-
instrument basis) to present the subsequent 
changes in fair value in consolidated OCI 
that would otherwise be measured at FVTPL 
pertaining to investments in equity instruments. 
This election is not permitted if the equity 
investment is held for trading. These elected 
investments are initially measured at fair value 
plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are 
measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised 
in consolidated OCI and accumulated in the 
‘Reserve for equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income’. The cumulative gain 
or loss is not reclassified to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss on disposal of the 
investments. However, the Group may transfer 
the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Dividend 
on 
these 
investments 
in 
equity 
instruments is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss under the head 
‘Other income’ when the Group’s right to receive 
the dividend is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend 
will flow to the entity, the dividend does not 
represent a recovery of part of cost of the 
investment and the amount of dividend can be 
measured reliably.
	
(iii)	 Impairment:
The Group recognises a loss allowance for 
expected credit losses (‘ECL’) on financial assets 
that are measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI. 
The credit loss is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to an entity 
in accordance with the contract and all the cash 
flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original 
effective interest rate (‘EIR’). This is assessed on 
an individual or collective basis after considering 
all reasonable and supportable including that 
which is forward-looking.

203
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
The Group’s trade receivables do not contain 
significant 
financing 
component 
and 
loss 
allowance on trade receivables is measured 
at an amount equal to lifetime ECL i.e. 
expected 
cash 
shortfalls, 
being 
simplified 
approach for recognition of impairment loss 
allowance. Under a simplified approach, the 
Group does not track changes in credit risk 
individually. Rather it recognises impairment 
loss allowance based on the lifetime ECL at each 
reporting date right from its initial recognition. 
The Group uses a provision matrix to determine 
impairment loss allowance on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. The provision matrix is 
based on its historically observed default rates 
over the expected life of the trade receivable 
and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. 
At every reporting date, the historically observed 
default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward-looking estimates are analysed.
For financial assets other than trade receivables, 
the Group recognises 12-month ECL for all 
originated or acquired financial assets if at the 
reporting date the credit risk of the financial 
asset has not increased significantly since its 
initial recognition. The ECL are measured as 
lifetime ECL if the credit risk on financial asset 
increases significantly since its initial recognition. 
If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the 
instrument improves such that there is no longer 
significant increase in credit risks since initial 
recognition, then the Group reverts to recognising 
impairment loss allowance based on 12-month 
ECL. The impairment losses and reversals are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. For equity instruments and 
financial assets measured at FVTPL, there is no 
requirement of impairment testing.
	
(iv)	 Derecognition:
 
 
The Group derecognises a financial asset when: -
(a)	 the contractual rights to the cash flows from 
the financial asset expires, or 
(b)	 it transfers the contractual rights to 
receive the cash flows of the financial 
asset and has substantially transferred all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
financial asset, or 
(c)	
it retains the contractual rights to receive 
the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the 
cash flows without material delay to one 
or more recipients under a pass-through 
arrangement 
(thereby 
substantially 
transferring all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset), o
(d)	 it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset and does 
not retain control over the financial asset.
When the Group transfers a financial asset, it 
evaluates the extent to which it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
asset. If the Group has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the financial asset, but retains 
control of the financial asset, the Group continues 
to recognise such financial assets to the extent 
of its continuing involvement in the financial 
asset. In that case, the Group also recognises 
an associated liability. The financial asset and 
the associated liability are measured on a basis 
that reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Group has retained.
	
2.	
Financial liabilities
	
(i)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. Financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at amortised cost or fair value, net 
of directly attributable transaction costs for all 
financial liabilities not carried at FVTPL.
	
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
	
	
The 
Group 
subsequently 
measures 
all 
non-derivative financial liabilities at amortised 
cost using EIR method. A gain or loss on a financial 
liability measured at amortised cost is recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss 
when the financial liability is derecognised as 
well as through EIR amortisation process.
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of 
the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as 
finance costs in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
(iii)	 Derecognition:
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
Annual Report 2024-25
204
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference between the carrying amount 
of the financial liability derecognised and the 
consideration paid is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments:
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is reported in the 
consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
	
3.	
Equity instruments:
	
	
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences 
residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments 
issued by the Group are recognised at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
	
	
Repurchase of the Group’s own equity instruments 
is recognised and deducted directly in equity. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss on the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own 
equity instruments. Dividends paid on equity 
instruments are directly reduced from equity.
B.	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such 
as forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge 
its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
2.12	 Fair value measurements
	
The Group measures financial instruments such as , 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer liability takes place either:
 
• 
 in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
 
• 
 in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability. 
The principal or   the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Group.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their best economic interest.
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
considers a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest 
and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets 
and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. 
derived from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting year.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset 
or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.

2.13	Foreign currency transactions
	
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are 
presented in INR which is also its functional currency.
	
a)	
Initial recognition:
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
the transaction. Exchange differences arising on 
foreign exchange transactions settled during the 
year are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss for the year.
	
b)	
Measurement of foreign currency items at the 
balance sheet date:
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currency remaining unsettled at the end 
of the year are translated at the closing exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non-monetary items measured at 
fair value is treated in line with the recognition 
of the gain or loss on the change in fair value 
of the item (i.e. translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in the 
consolidated OCI or the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss are also reclassified in the 
consolidated OCI or the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss, respectively)
2.14	Taxes on income
	
Tax 
comprises 
current 
and 
deferred 
tax. 
Income-tax expense is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent it 
relates to items directly recognised in equity or in 
consolidated OCI.
	
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due 
to temporary difference between accounting and tax 
treatments, and due to items that are never taxable or 
tax deductible. Tax provisions are included in current 
liabilities. Interest and penalties on tax liabilities are 
provided for in the tax charge. The Group offsets, 
the tax assets and liabilities (on a year-on-year basis) 
where it has a legally enforceable right and where it 
intends to settle such liabilities or realise the assets on 
net basis,and they relate to income-tax levied by the 
same authorities.
	
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet 
approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary 
differences arising between the tax base of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the respective 
components financial statements. Deferred income tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
when it is more likely than not that the assets will not 
be realised in the future.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilised.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current income tax assets against current income tax 
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
2.15	Employee benefits
 
The Group has following post-employment plans:
	
(a)	 Defined 
contribution 
plan 
such 
as 
provident fund and
 
(b) Defined benefit plan- gratuity
	
(c)	
Short term employee benefits
	
(d)	 Compensated absences
 
(e) Share-based payments
Annual Report 2024-25
206
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
(a)	 Defined contribution plan:
 
Under defined contribution plans, the Group pays 
pre-defined amounts to separate funds and does 
not have any legal or informal obligation to pay 
additional sums. Defined contribution plan comprise 
of contributions to the employees’ provident fund 
with the government and certain state plans such as 
employees’ state insurance and employees’ pension 
scheme. The Group’s payments to the defined 
contribution plans are recognised as expenses during 
the period in which the employees perform the 
services that the payment covers.
b)	
Defined benefit plan:
	
The liability or asset recognised in the consolidated 
balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plan is the present value of defined benefit obligations 
at the end of the reporting year less fair value of plan 
assets. The defined benefit obligations is calculated 
annually by actuary through actuarial valuation using 
the projected unit credit method.
	
The Group recognises the following changes in the 
net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss:
i)	
Service costs comprising current service costs, 
past service costs, gains and losses on curtailment 
and non-routine settlements; and
ii)	
Net interest expense or income.
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net balance of the defined 
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets. 
This cost is included in ‘Employee benefits expense’ in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability/ 
(asset) comprise of:
	
(i)	
actuarial (gains)/ losses,
	
(ii)	 return on plan assets, excluding amounts included 
in interest income and
	
(iii)	 any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, 
excluding amounts included in interest income 
are recognised in the period in which they occur 
directly in the consolidated OCI. Remeasurements 
are not reclassified to the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss in subsequent periods.
	
Ind AS 19, ’Employee benefits’ requires the exercise of 
judgment in relation to various assumptions including 
future pay rises, inflation, discount rates and employee 
demographics. The Group determines the assumptions 
in conjunction with its actuaries, and believes these 
assumptions to be in line with best practice, but the 
application of different assumptions could have a 
effect on the amounts reflected in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss, OCI and consolidated 
balance sheet. There may also be interdependency 
between some of the assumptions.
c) 
Short-term employee benefits
	
Liabilities 
for 
wages 
and 
salaries, 
including 
non-monetary benefits that are expected to be 
settled wholly within 12 months after the end 
of the period in which the employees render the 
related service are classified as short-term employee 
benefits. These benefits include salaries and wages, 
short-term bonus, incentives etc. These are measured 
at the amounts expected to be paid when the 
liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented 
as current employee benefit obligations in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
d)	
Compensated absences
	
The Group has a policy of compensated absences 
to allow leave entitlements which would be 
non-accumulating in nature except for a certain 
class of employees. Expense on non-accumulating 
compensated absences is recognized in the period 
in which the absences occur. The necessary impact of 
the same had been considered in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
	
The Group presents the entire leave as a current 
liability in the consolidated balance sheet, since it 
does not have any unconditional right to defer its 
settlement for twelve months after the reporting date.
e) 
Share-based payments
 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at 
the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.
	
The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase 
in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss such 
Statutory Reports
01-106
Standalone Financial Statements
107-182
Consolidated Financial Statements
183-253
207
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled share-based payment reserve.
	
No expense is recognised for options that do not 
ultimately vest because non-market performance and/ 
or service conditions have not been met.
2.16	Leases
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for buildings. The Group assesses whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of a 
contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Group assesses whether:
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset,
	
(ii)	 the Group has the right to obtain substantially all 
of the economic benefits from use of the identified 
asset ,throughout the period of use, and
	
(iii)	 the Group has the right to direct the use of the 
identified asset, throughout the period of use.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group 
recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding 
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it 
is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve 
months or less (short-term leases) and leases of low 
value assets. For these short-term leases and leases 
of low value assets, the Group recognises the lease 
payments as an expense in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss.
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability. They are subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
if any. Right-of- use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates. The lease 
liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing 
the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease 
liability and reducing the carrying amount to reflect 
the lease payments made.
	
A lease liability is remeasured upon the occurrence 
of certain events such as a change in the lease term 
or a change in an index or rate used to determine 
lease payments. The remeasurement normally also 
adjusts the leased assets. Lease liabilities and right-of-
use assets have been separately presented in the 
consolidated balance sheet and lease payments have 
been classified as financing cash flows.
2.17	Provisions and contingencies
	
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past 
event, the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions for 
onerous contracts are recognised when the expected 
benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
future obligations under the contract.
	
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made where 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may probably not require an outflow of resources 
or an obligation for which the future outcome cannot 
be ascertained with reasonable certainty. When there 
is a possible or a present obligation where the 
likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no 
provision or disclosure is made.
2.18	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance 
sheet and for the purpose of consolidated statement 
of cash flows include cash and cheque in hand, in 
current accounts with banks, demand deposits with 
banks and other short-term highly liquid investments 
(with maturity less than three months) that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value
2.19	Earnings per equity share
	
Basic earnings per equity share are calculated by 
dividing the net profit/loss for the period attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year. 
Earnings 
considered 
in 
ascertaining 
the 
Group’s earnings per equity share is the net profit/
loss for the year. 
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings 
per equity share, the net profit/ loss for the period 
Annual Report 2024-25
208
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2025
attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive 
potential equity shares.
2.20	Borrowing costs 
	
General and specific borrowing costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets are capitalised as 
a part of cost of those assets during the period till 
all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying 
assets for their intended use or sale are complete. 
Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use or sale.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred.
2.21	Exceptional items 
	
When an item of income or expense within profit/ 
(loss) from ordinary activity is of such size, nature or 
incidence that their disclosure is relevant to explain 
the performance of the Group for the year, the nature 
and amount of such items is disclosed separately in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.22	 Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
Chairman and Managing Director, who is considered 
as chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’). As the 
Group’s current business activity primarily falls within 
a single business and geographical segment and 
the CODM monitors the operating results of its 
business as a single unit for the purpose of making 
decisions about resource allocation and performance 
assessment, there are no separate disclosures required 
under Ind AS 108, ‘Segment Reporting’.
2.23	 Recent pronouncements
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended 
31 March 2025, MCA has notified amendments to 
Ind AS 116, ‘Leases’, relating to sale and leaseback 
transactions, which is applicable w.e.f. 1st April 2024. 
The Group has reviewed the new pronouncements 
and based on its evaluation has determined that 
it is not likely to have any significant impact in its 
financial statements.

Variable lease payments
Some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to revenue generated from a store. Variable payment 
terms are used for a variety of reasons, including minimising the fixed costs base for newly established stores. Variable lease 
payments that depend on revenue are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which the condition 
that triggers those payments occurs.
Terms of leases
The Group’s major leasing arrangements are in respect of commercial premises and land (including furniture and fittings 
therein wherever applicable taken on leave and license basis) having various lease terms.

Gratuity Act, 1972. Every employee who has completed continuous services of five years or more gets a gratuity on 
death, resignation, retirement or permanent disablement at 15 days salary (last drawn salary) for each completed 
year of service. Gratuity is funded through investment with Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) under its respective 
Group Gratuity Scheme.

These assumptions were developed by the management of the Group with the assistance of independent 
actuarial appraisers. Discount factors are determined close to each year end by reference to government bonds 
of relevant economic markets and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
obligation. Other assumptions are based on management’s historical experience. The estimate of future salary 
increase considered in actuarial valuation take into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other 
relevant factors such as supply and demand in the employment market.

Category of funded asset

vii)	 Sensitivity analysis
	
	
The financial statements are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions. The changes to the defined benefit 
obligation for increase / decrease of 1% from assumed salary growth, attrition rate and discount rate are given 
below. The following table summarises the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions on the defined 
benefit obligation at year-end.

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting year, while holding all other assumptions constant.
	
	
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the projected benefit 
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of 
the assumptions may be correlated.

(All amounts in ` Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the projected benefit obligation 
has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year, which is the same 
method as applied in calculating the projected benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet.
	
	
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior year.
	
viii)	 Risks associated with defined benefit plan:
	
	
Gratuity is a defined benefit plan and entity is exposed to the following risks:	
Interest rate risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the Government Securities will increase 
the present value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the discount 
rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending on the 
duration of asset.
Salary risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the 
future salaries of members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more 
than assumed level will increase the plan's liability.
Investment risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount 
rate which is determined by reference to market yield at the end of the reporting 
year on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create 
a plan deficit.
Asset Liability  
Matching  ('ALM') risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in 
lines of Rule 101 of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.
Mortality risk
Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement 
age only, the plan does not have any longevity risk. Mortality rate during employment 
is calculated considering Indian Assured Lives Mortality 2012-14 (Urban) (Previous 
year: Indian Assured Lives Mortality 2012-14 (Urban).
Concentration risk 
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance 
company and a default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very 
less as insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines which mitigate risk.

Fair value hierarchy 
	
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value - recurring fair value measurements

ii)	
Valuation techniques used to determine fair value  
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset 
and paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The following methods were 
used to estimate the fair values:
 
- 
Other non-current financial assets and liabilities : The carrying value is considered to be approximate to 
their fair value.
 
-  
Derivative financial assets and liabilities: The Group enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties, 
principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Forward foreign currency contracts are 
determined using forward exchange rates at the reporting date.
 
-  
Current investments-The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value (‘NAV’) 
as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements as at Balance Sheet date. 
NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the price at which 
issuers will redeem such units from the investors.
 
-  
Trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, other current financial assets, trade payables 
and other current financial liabilities: Approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term 
maturities of these instruments.

Borrowings taken by the Group are as per the Group’s credit and liquidity risk assessment and there is no 
comparable instrument having the similar terms and conditions with related security being pledged and hence 
the carrying value of the borrowings represents the best estimate of its fair value.

A	
Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes 
in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices) Market risk is 
attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments and all short-term and long-term debt. Market risk 
comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk or 
commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, trade payables, trade 
receivables, investments, derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments. The Group is exposed to 
market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments.
(a)	 Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates.  The Group is mainly exposed to this risk due to borrowings having variable 
rate of interest.

Interest rate sensitivity
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of 
borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit or loss before tax is affected through 
the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:

(b)	 Foreign currency risk
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s foreign exchange risk arises from its trade payables and trade 
receivables denominated in foreign currencies. The results of the Group’s operations can be affected as the Indian 
Rupees (‘INR’) is volatile against these currencies. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments such as 
foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures 
and also  inherent hedging as it is engaged in the export of manufacturing products and import of raw materials. 
The Group has a treasury team which monitors the foreign exchange fluctuations on a continuous basis and advises 
the management of any material adverse effect on the Group.

B	
Credit risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and 
cash equivalents, other financial assets as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets.
	
The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Group assesses the 
credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of allowance for 
expected credit loss for trade receivables.
	
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. 
The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer 
operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing 
credit limits, continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers. Also, forward-looking information is also 
incorporated into expected credit losses, including the use of macroeconomic information.
	
In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any group of 
counterparties having similar characteristics. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers in various 
geographical areas. The Group has very limited history of customer default, and considers the credit quality of trade 
receivables for evaluation of allowance for expected credit loss.
	
The credit risk on liquid funds such as balance in current and deposit accounts with banks and derivative financial 
instruments (included in other financial assets) is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings.

C	
Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due.
 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors of the respective entities, 
which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s 
short-term, medium-term and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and committed borrowing facilities, by continuously 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities 
and by monitoring rolling forecasts of its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational 
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the 
Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.
