Five Star Business Finance Limited is a non-deposit taking 
Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) registered with 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Company provides 
secured financial solutions in the form of “ small business 
loans” 
to 
micro-entrepreneurs 
and 
self-employed 
individuals who typically lack access to the formal financial 
ecosystem, particularly in urban and semi-urban markets. 
The loans are secured by collateral, with approximately 
95% of the portfolio backed by self-occupied residential 
properties owned by the borrowers. Loan amounts 
generally range from ₹1 lakh to ₹10 lakh, with the majority 
of loans falling below ₹5 lakh. The Company offers longer 
loan tenures of 5 to 7 years to enhance affordability and 
convenience for its customers.
Five Star Business Finance Limited maintains prudent 
lending practices, following conservative credit norms 
such as a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio capped at 50% and a 
Debt Burden Ratio (DBR) ceiling of 50% at the time of loan 
origination. These measures ensure robust credit quality 
and adequate risk mitigation throughout the loan tenure.

About Five Star
Five-Star Business Finance Limited is registered as a Systemically 
Important Non-deposit taking Non-banking Financial Company (‘SI-ND-
NBFC’) with the Reserve Bank of India. The Company came into existence 
in 1984. After about two decades of providing loans to micro-entrepreneurs 
and self-employed individuals for their business, asset creation and oth=er 
requirements which has benefitted lakhs of customers, we stand tall as an 
industry leader.
We have significant presence in Tamil Nadu (including corporate 
headquarters in Chennai), Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and 
Madhya Pradesh. We have also started making early in-roads in the states 
of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat.
It is significant to note that a large part of our branch presence is in tier 3, 
tier 4, tier 5 and tier 6 cities and towns, which are semi-urban and rural 
geographies with rapid population growth, largely devoid of access to 
formal sources of financial services.  
A formidable workforce of over 11,900 employees work tirelessly to help 
the organization continue on its stellar growth path. Of these, around 9,000 
employees are field agents, who help take our business to prospective 
and existing customers in every nook and corner of geographies where 
we are present. 
Vision
Reaching the Unreached through suitable credit solutions.
Five Star has been attempting to bridge the credit gap in the market over 
the last couple of decades, extending financial service to the un-banked and 
under-banked sections of the society. This in turn, contributes to narrowing 
the socio-economic divide between urban and semi-urban/rural parts (to a 
large extent consisting of underprivileged segments of society) and helps 
achieve higher living standards. 
With years of experience and a sound understanding of the financing 
industry, Five Star strives to grow even farther while staying true to its vision. 
Presence and Reach
Mission
Provide appropriate credit solutions to the hitherto unreached segment 
of the market by developing a niche underwriting model, built towards 
evaluating the twin strengths of the borrowers' intention to repay and 
ability to repay, with the ultimate objectives of increasing customers 
satisfaction and maximising stakeholders returns
What does ‘ESG’ mean to us? 
There is increasing awareness that businesses do not operates in silos. 
Social and environmental value created by organizations has come to be 
recognized as being critical and continue to gain importance, indicating 
a paradigm shift from the traditional metrices that defined business 
successes only in financial terms. Corporates world-over have also 
recognized that they have an important role to play in fostering social 
equity and creating opportunities for development of members of the 
communities in which they operate. There is increasing realization that 
business growth is intricately interlinked with the growth and wellbeing 
of communities. Likewise, on the environmental front, every individual

or business is exposed to the risks emanating from irreversible climate 
change and its consequences, to varying extents.   
Financing businesses have the distinction of being uniquely positioned 
to contribute to sustainable development by empowering people and 
businesses to meet their growth aspirations. This is even more true in our 
case, given that for a substantial part of our customer base, hitherto, there 
may not have been access to structured financial services. 
We recognize the importance of taking cognizance of ESG related risks 
and opportunities for continued business success. Keeping this in minds,

organization in its journey to excellence.

Five Star sees an opportunity to contribute to 
India's growth story by meeting the financial 
services needs of underserved segments. Access 
to structured finance could be a game-changer for 
MSMEs, entrepreneurs and small businesses which 
employ millions of people.
Financial services is an industry that is highly 
regulated and compliance driven. Multiple risks 
may arise from ongoing/ quick changes in the 
markets and the regulatory environment for the 
sector.
Five Star stands for good corporate

process of identifying and integrating key ESG risks 
into the overall risk management framework. 
Positive: Framework for risk management and

Governance
At Five Star Business Finance, we believe that a sound corporate 
governance is integral to building long-term value for our stakeholders. 
Our operations are guided by an effective Board, that comprises industry 
stalwarts with decades of experience to their credit. 
The key pillars of our governance paradigm are accountability, 
transparency, fairness, and righteous behaviour. We have ensured that an 
effective governance framework is put in place based on these principles 
to safeguard the long-term interests of all our stakeholders including 
minority and individual shareholders. This is epitomized by the fact that 
several of our Board Committees (Audit Committee, Nomination and 
Remuneration committee, Risk Management Committee, IT Strategy 
Committee, Stakeholder Relationship Committee etc) are headed by 
Independent Directors.
Board Level Committees
•	 Audit Committee
•	 Nomination and Remuneration Committee
•	 Corporate Social Responsibility Committee
•	 Business and Resource Committee
•	 Asset Liability Committee
•	 Risk Management Committee
•	 IT Strategy Committee
•	 Stakeholders Relationship Committee
•	 Customer Service Committee
•	 Review Committee for Wilful Defaulter
Our strong governance framework enables us to improve our operational 
efficiency, boost financial returns, and reduce risks while ensuring 
compliance with applicable regulations. Periodic internal reviews are 
carried out to validate the functioning of the Management and the 
governance structures of the Company, including the Board and its 
committees. This goes a long way in ensuring that the organization 
adheres to its stated goals and business objectives, while staying true to 
its vision and mission. 
We have a comprehensive set of policies and guidelines that govern our 
actions. These policies provide a clear framework for decision making and 
are backed up by appropriate risk management frameworks to ensure 
compliance. In-line with the materiality assessment conducted and 
recognizing the rising importance of the ESG in our business, we have 
developed an ESG policy that has been reviewed and approved by our 
Board. The policy can be accessed in the link: ESG-Policy.pdf
The following sections discuss briefly some of our priority areas under 
Governance (including issues that may not have featured in the list of 
‘material’ issues, but have been deemed as significant by the Management. 
Risk Management
At Five Star, we recognise multiple risks including strategic, regulatory, and 
operational risks that can put our finances, human resources, physical, 
informational, and intellectual property assets as well as our reputation 
at risk. Like any other business, our business is also exposed to various 
internal and external risks, and we ensure that these risks are identified 
through a structured process. We have placed the ‘unlent’ segment as our 
top priority and have developed a clear strategy to analyse and mitigate 
the potential risks arising from such a business proposition.
We have identified the below mentioned risks as primary and have clear 
policies and procedures in place for monitoring and mitigation of the same.

Our business priority is to connect with consumers residing largely outside

loan channels to fund their business or personal needs.
The independent risk assessment, tracking, and control tasks are 
facilitated by Five Star's independent risk governance structure.
The Risk Management Policy has been posted on the website of the 
Company and is available on the web link: Risk-Management.pdf
Business Ethics & Transparency
At Five Star, we submit any cases relating to ethics & transparency to the 
Audit Committee which monitors them until satisfactory resolution. These 
are also documented rigorously and included in the minutes of the Audit 
Committee’s meetings. We have a well entrenched compliance framework 
managed by a capable team that ensures the Company's policies and 
business practices are in line with our established code. The stakeholders 
can file complaints about any unethical practices, misconduct, or 
grievances. We proactively maintain an ethics helpline that allows our 
employees to voice concerns or any incident of non-compliance. Every 
employee must immediately report to the management ethics helpline any 
real or potential breach of the Code, as well as any event of misconduct, 
misdemeanour, or act not in the best interests of the Company. 
Digitization
We are striving to digitise every aspect of our business as a means to 
facilitating ease of conducting business. Our front-facing employees' 
interactions with consumers are used to raise awareness of digital 
repayment options available, thereby reducing the need for handling/
transacting in physical cash. We take delight in observing a rise in online 
transactions during the previous fiscal year.
Data Privacy & Security
At Five Star, we have made significant progress in the recent years in 
data protection and cybersecurity. To reduce risks brought about by 
increasing complexities in the cyberspace, we have embraced cutting-
edge technology, such the Amazon cloud platform, periodic Information 
Technology audits, vulnerability assessments and penetration testing 
carried out by an independent third party agency. We are increasingly 
switching to SaaS models, hosting partners like Salesforce or Oracle 
to minimise the risks. As already stated, an independent information 
technology audit was conducted during the previous fiscal year.
Social
Financial Inclusion
Our organisational motto has been "Reaching the Unreached" or in other 
words “Lending to the Unlent”. By providing financial services to the 
‘unbanked and under-banked’ segments of society, we open the door 
to financial inclusion and economic empowerment to the masses. Our 
loans range from INR 1 lakh to 10 lakhs with the average ticket size being 
around INR 3 to 5 lakhs and help our customers cover their business or 
personal needs.
The consumers of Five Star predominantly avail loans for meeting their 
business requirements. They are typically first-time borrowers to the 
secured borrowing space in the formal financial ecosystem, who may not 
have been focused upon by large banks or other financial institutions. 
While about 25% of our customers are completely new-to-credit, we are 
the first formal lender providing a loan of the size mentioned above, to 
more than 75% of our customers and this is probably their first experience 
of availing a secured borrowing from a structured financial organization. 
To cater to such customers,  a significant part of our branch presence is in 
Tier-3 and below cities and towns, which have limited presence of other 
structured players.

Our unwavering focus on such a customer base has resulted in a steady

creates positive societal value.

large potential, particularly funding the demand from micro-entrepreneurs

In an effort to increase the women participation in businesses and major

next leg of growth for the Company towards building a robust portfolio. 
Customer Relationship Management

of our clients, and prioritizing meeting client needs. The organisation has 
made efforts in this direction through campaigns for financial literacy,

receiving their complaints. In case the customer feels their grievances may 
not have been handled appropriately, they have the option of escalating 
their concerns to the Grievance Redressal Officer.  The Grievance 
Redressal officer is mandated to respond again within 10 working days. 
Issues that have not been resolved at this level too, may then be escalated 
to the Head of Risk & Compliance, who also serves as the Company's 
Principal Nodal Officer.

•	 Email: customercare@fivestargroup.in
•	 Customers can get in touch with the branch and voice their compliants 
to the personnel. The compliant must be entered in the Branch's 
Compliant Register.
•	 Customers can file written compliants with branch manager of the 
branch where they obtained the loan by submitting a letter
In rare cases of non-resoultion at Company level, complainants may also 
reach out to the Reserve Bank of India, which oversees operations of non-
banking financial institutions.
However, most of the complaints are resolved at the Company level itself, 
which is a sign of our strong grievance redressal mechanism. A very 
small percentage of complaints get escalated to the regulator and even 
these relate to lack of understanding from the customers’ part, and the 
Company has been able to provide satisfactory responses to the regulator 
leading to closure of such complaints.  
We also have an Internal Ombudsman, who is an independent person 
looking at the merit of the complaints received, and resolutions provided 
thereon. We have not had any instance of the Ombudsman disagreeing 
with the view of the Company on the merits of complaints received at the 
Ombudsman office or from the regulator.
Talent Management and Retention
Our team of high-performing personnel are closely correlated with the 
organization's consistency in providing the best-in-class services. Our 
employees are our biggest assets and have been instrumental to our 
success since inception.
We select the ideal candidate from the market to ensure that top talents 
comprise our workforce at all levels. Recruitment in the Company is 
undertaken by a highly experienced team of Human Resource Personnel 
who identify and onboard candidates dynamically.
We are an equal opportunity employer and hire employees for permanent 
and contract positions. All our employees are on-roll employees and we do 
not engage any off the roll employees, as this may jeopardise their career 
prospects. For any senior and mid-level recruitment, internal applicants 
are primarily explored; the role extends to the external job market when 
the position does not get filled internally. In the last financial year, 756 
number of employees were promoted to the managerial positions 
internally.
Currently, 11,934 people (permanent and non-permanent) are employed 
by the Company in a variety of roles across our branch offices and regional 
offices and head office. The Company acts in a manner that demonstrates 
accountability for the security, safety and wellbeing of the employees.

origin, nationality, disability, age, gender, religion, marital status, family 
responsibilities, sexual orientation, social class, or other distinction 
unrelated to the requirements of the job. We reject all types of unjust and 
illegal discrimination. 
Diversity, Inclusion and Equity policy is available in the following weblink: 
Diversity-Inclusion-and-Equity-Policy.pdf.
While we have significant number of women employees in our corporate 
office, the overall percentage of women in the organization not being high 
is attributable to the fact that a majority of the organisation’s employees 
are field officers. While the Company is open to hiring women candidates 
for such positions, the job demands – i.e., job being predominantly travel 
based, having to securely carry cash from customers to the branch and 
having to work odd-hours at times – seem to be detrimental to women 
actively joining our ranks. We are actively working towards enhancing 
the number of women employees, where possible, in the face of such 
challenges.

Environment
A key component of sustainable development is the environmental 
wellbeing. While environmental issues were traditionally thought to be 
less important than economic considerations, recent challenges such as 
climate change and water scarcity have been global in nature, not sparing 
any industry sectors, including financial services.
