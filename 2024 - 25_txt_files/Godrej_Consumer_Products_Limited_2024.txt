Statutory Reports | Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR)
Basis for Conclusion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants (IESBA).
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform 
Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. 
This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Company’s Annual and Integrated Report (but does not include the BRSR Core and assurance 
report thereon). 
Additionally, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on select disclosures of GRI Standards and BRSR 
attributes and issued an independent assurance report on 14th July 2025. Our report thereon is included with the other 
information.
Our reasonable assurance opinion and limited assurance conclusion on the ISI do not extend to other information that 
accompanies or contains the ‘ISI and our assurance reports’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”).
In connection with our assurance report of the BRSR Core attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the BRSR Core or our knowledge 
obtained in the assurance or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core 
attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and 
understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Management’s responsibilities for the identified Sustainability Information (ISI) 
The management of the Company acknowledge and understand their responsibilities for: 
288
•	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
•	
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the ISI, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if 
any, related to reporting on the ISI, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation 
and presentation of the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria; disclosure of the applicable criteria used for 
preparation of the ISI in the relevant report/statement; 
•	
preparing, fairly stating and properly calculating the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria; and 
•	
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanation;
•	
establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such targets, 
goals and performance measures;
•	
providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in the report;
•	
ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;
•	
making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; 
•	
identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the measurement or evaluation of information covered by 
assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
•	
preventing and detecting fraud;
•	
selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand their 
information needs;
•	
informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI;
•	
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make 
determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG footprint, water footprint, and energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient 
appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the 
BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting 
Criteria in line with the section above. 
•	
Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, 
and
•	
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to Board of Directors of the Company.
289
Statutory Reports | Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR)
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed 
and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable 
assurance opinion. 
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgement, including an assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and 
the engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the ISI covered by 
reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out our engagement, we:
•	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by reasonable assurance. 
•	
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the preparation of 	
	
	
the information covered by reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company; and 
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the information covered by reasonable assurance.
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express an opinion on the same:
•	
Any form of review of the commercial merits, technical feasibility, accuracy, compliance with applicable legislation 	
	
	
for the project. We are also not required to verify any of the judgements and commercial risks associated with 	
	
	
the project, nor comment upon the possibility of the financial projections being achieved.
•	
The Company’s statements that describe the strategy, progress on goals (other than those listed under the scope of 	 	
	
assurance), expression of opinion, claims, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim to future intention provided by the 	
	
	
Company, and assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and 
environmental and social professionals.
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention to cause us to believe that 
the company’s Identified Sustainability Information in the Annual and Integrated Report relating to select GRI indicators 
and BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) for the year ended 31 March 2025, is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with  World Resource Institute (WRI) / World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and Reporting  Standards) and Regulation 34(2)(f) 
of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and 
with reference to the GRI Standards (2021) and basis of preparation set out in “About the Report” in page 5 and Section A: 
General Disclosures 13 of “Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report” of the Annual and Integrated Report in page 
298.
Basis for conclusion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410, 
Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards 
Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our 
report.
292
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants (IESBA).
KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP (“The Firm”) applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 
1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related 
Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system 
of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Company’s Annual and Integrated Report (but does not include the BRSR attributes (which are 
not part of BRSR Core) and GRI attributed and assurance report thereon).
Additionally, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on BRSR Core attributes and issued an independent 
assurance report on 14th July 2025. Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our limited assurance opinion on BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) and GRI attributes does not cover the 
other information, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our assurance report of the select BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) and GRI attributes, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) and GRI attributes or our knowledge obtained in 
the assurance or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR attributes 
(which are not part of BRSR Core) and GRI attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information 
in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Management’s responsibilities for Identified Sustainability Information (ISI)
The management of the company are responsible for: 
•	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
•	
selecting or developing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability Information and appropriately 
referring to or describing the criteria; and
293
Statutory Reports | Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR)
•	
preparing, fairly stating and properly calculating the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the 
reporting criteria.
•	
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanation;
•	
establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such targets, 
goals and performance measures;
•	
providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in the report;
•	
ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;
•	
making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; 
•	
identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the measurement or evaluation of information covered by 
assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
•	
preventing and detecting fraud;
•	
selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand their 
information needs;
•	
informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI;
•	
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations
The preparation of the company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or interpret the 
criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) and GRI attributes, some of which 
are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example GHG footprint, water footprint, 
and energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the 
uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free from material 	
	
	
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
•	
forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 	
	
	
obtained; and 
•	
reporting our conclusion to Directors of the Company. 
294
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed 
and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for limited 
assurance conclusion. 
Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the ISI covered by limited assurance and other engagement 
circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. In carrying out our 
engagement, we:
•	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the ISI covered by limited assurance; 
•	
interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning policies for 	
	
	
occupational health and safety, and the implementation of these across the business;
•	
through inquiries, obtained an understanding of  the Company control environment, processes and information 	
	
	
systems relevant to the preparation of the ISI covered by limited assurance, but did not evaluate the design of 	
	
	
particular control activities, obtain evidence about their implementation or test their operating effectiveness;
•	
made inquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of the 	 	
	
	
ISI covered by limited assurance;
•	
undertook all site visits out of which five were physical site visits and five were virtual site visits; we selected these 	
	
	
sites based on the relative size of the workforce of these locations to the total workforce, unexpected fluctuations in 	
	
	
the ISI covered by limited assurance since the prior period, and sites not visited in the prior period;
•	
inspected, at each site visited, a limited number of items to or from supporting records, as appropriate;
•	
applied analytical procedures, as appropriate; 
•	
recalculated the ISI covered by limited assurance based on the criteria; and
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the ISI covered by limited assurance to determine whether it is 	
	
	
	
consistent with the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the company’s occupational 	
	
health and safety.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent 
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed. 
Exclusions:
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:
•	
Any form of review of the commercial merits, technical feasibility, accuracy, compliance with applicable legislation 
for the project, and accordingly we will express no opinion thereon. We will also not be required to verify any of 
the judgments and commercial risks associated with the project, nor comment upon the possibility of the financial 
295

projections being achieved. The Company’s statements that describe the strategy, progress on goals (other than 
those listed under the scope of assurance), expression of opinion, claims, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim to future 
intention provided by the Company, and assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive 
issues.
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and GRI attributes and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.

Financial Implications of

(Positive or negative 
implications)
1.
Occupational 
health & safety
R
•	
There are physical 
risk to the workforce 
in our manufacturing 
operations and 
frontline distribution 
teams. Lack of 
appropriate and 
sufficient training 
to workers and 
employees on best-
practices related to 
OHS, might result 
in health and safety 
risks such as frequent 
incidents, accidents, 
and even fatalities. 
Indirect risks include 
workplace closures, 
increase in legal and 
compliance costs, 
intense scrutiny 
by stakeholders, 
lower morale in 
the workforce, and 
adverse impact on 
brand reputation. 
We have a robust Health & 
Safety policy and strong SOPs 
to ensure highest adherence 
to health and safety. Our 
governance mechanism 
ensures any incidents are duly 
investigated and resolved for 
the future. We ensure periodic 
review of safety procedures 
and the Central Safety 
Committee and committees 
at plants review monthly data 
for occupational health and 
safety. We have a consistent 
record in zero fatalities across 
our offices and manufacturing 
plants leading to high-morale 
and trust amongst employees 
and workers.
Negative Implications
2.
Product safety 
and Quality 
R
•	
Evolving regulatory 
landscape and 
changing guidelines 
pertaining to the 
composition of various 
ingredients and raw 
materials we use in 
our products poses a 
risk of disruption in our 
operations.
GCPL has implemented quality 
testing standard operating 
procedures for all its products. 
GCPL has also incorporated 
a robust products and raw 
material quality testing 
procedure. This is supported 
by ensuring to build the 
capabilities of team through 
skill development trainings.
Negative Implications
3.
Business Ethics 
and Ethical 
Marketing 
R
•	
Business ethics are 
the moral principles 
that guide decision-
making process for 
an organisation. It 
includes policies, and 
values that govern the 
way companies and 
individuals engage 
in business activity. 
Ethical marketing 
and product labelling 
is a crucial factor 
in marketing as it 
highlights the products’ 
unique selling point, 
composition, and 
claims on sustainability. 
Greenwashing and/or 
ethically and factually 
incorrect marketing 
practices and claims 
pose reputational risk 
to the business.
GCPL upholds moral principles 
that guides our decision-
making process and fosters 
a culture of ethics. GCPL has 
multiple policies that enable 
and enforce ethics such as 
code of conduct, whistle 
blower policy, anti-sexual 
harassment policy, human 
rights policy, and health 
and safety policy, to name a 
few. We recognise that our 
marketing, advertising, and 
sales practices directly impact 
our consumers, customers, 
and the broader community. 
For us, ‘trust’ is the most 
important and non-negotiable 
business value and we are 
committed to transparency, 
honesty, and ethical conduct. 
Our Responsbile Marketing, 
Advertising and Sales Policy 
ensures we not only adhere to 
local marketing standards and 
legal requirements but also go 
beyond and align with the best 
international standards.

Governance 
and 
accountability 
O
•	
It means adhering 
to all reporting 
and transparency 
requirements by 
market regulators 
and even voluntarily 
disclose information 
on other international 
frameworks on ESG 
GCPL adheres to BRSR in 
India and other international 
frameworks like CDP, GRI 
and Integrated Reporting 
<IR> frameworks. GCPL is 
consistently transparent in 
reporting leading to further 
investor and other stakeholder 
confidence.
Positive Implications
5.
Sustainable 
Packaging 
R
•	
Enforcement of strict 
regulations on plastic, 
waste generation, 
and disposal arising 
from geographies such 
as India and Africa, 
may result in higher 
short-term costs for 
compliance
As most of GCPL products 
involves plastic packaging, 
we focus on plastic packaging 
intensity. It is determined by 
the weight of the packaging to 
overall product weight. GCPL 
has reduced plastic packaging 
intensity by over 20% from the 
base year of 2019-20. This 
has resulted in cost savings 
and reduced its Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
requirements. 
Positive Implications
6.
Sustainable 
supply chain 
management 
R
•	
GCPL is engaged 
in procurement 
of materials and 
services from diverse 
suppliers. Some of 
the key risks that can 
impact the company’s 
supply chain are ESG 
compliance risk for 
critical suppliers, and 
unethical sourcing 
practices. 
In line with GCPL’s Policy 
for Responsible Supply, we 
have collated qualitative 
and quantitative data, and 
evaluated 70% of suppliers 
by procurement spends for 
their ESG performance. To 
drive supplier engagement 
effectively, GCPL has also 
shared industry best practices 
and suggestive actions. 
Negative Implications
7.
Renewable 
Energy 
O
•	
Adoption of renewable 
energy will lower 
GCPL’s emissions and 
save costs in the long-
term.
Currently, GCPL is utilizing 
close to 40% renewable 
energy in its India operations. 
In FY24-25, we started a 
co-generation plant at our 
Malanpur manufacturing site. 
We also use briquette based 
boilers and microturbines for 
steam generation, and invest 
in solar PV and apply for green 
tariffs wherever available.

8.
Research & 
Development 
O
•	
Strong R&D led 
initiatives with an 
ESG focus is a market 
opportunity and a 
brand differentiator. 
GCPL has completed Life 
Cycle Assessments for 
products constituting 56% of 
our India revenue. Through 
this, we are able to identify 
the areas of sustainable 
improvement across the 
lifecycle of our products. By 
addressing these gaps, we 
are able to innovate and offer 
products at a green discount 
rather than a green premium 
as we to pass on the savings to 
our consumers.
Positive Implications
9.
Sustainable 
and Greener 
Products
O
•	
GCPL aims to ensure 
that its products have 
lower environmental 
impact while ensuring 
they are affordable 
and accessible. 
GCPL has rolled out several 
green products, one example is 
the Godrej Magic Hand Wash. 
It uses lower water content 
compared to alternatives 
and has lower plastic packing 
impact thus further resulting in 
cost savings which is passed on 
to our consumers. 
Positive Implications
10.
Diversity & 
Inclusion
O
•	
Having an adequate 
diversity ratio and 
build capability of 
women leaders is a key

Does the Entity have Processes in place to avoid / manage Conflict of Interests involving Members of the Board of 
Directors? (Yes/No) and if yes, provide Details of the same:
	
Yes, we ensure that we’re compliant with the requirements stated in the Companies Act and SEBI Listing Regulations 
for ensuring that there is no conflict of interest. At the beginning of the year, we receive the disclosure from directors 
for the entities in which they are interested, and the similar disclosures are also received at the time of appointment 
of directors. Whenever any business decisions are taken, the Board is informed about the interest of any particular 
director in that matter and such director will not be included in the discussion and decision pertaining to the matter 
wherein he/she is interested. We ensure that an Independent Director on the board of GCPL should not be a Non-
Independent Director on the board of another company if there is a Non-Independent Director on GCPL’s board 
who is also an Independent Director on the board of the same other company. This prevents a situation where two 
directors might influence each other’s decisions across different companies and create conflict of interest.

Category
Yes/No 
(If Yes, then give details of the 
mechanism in brief)
Permanent 
Workers
Yes
We have a Grievance redressal committee to address Job related grievances 
of workers on regular basis. This is done through open houses, workmen 
representative, canteen and safety committees that happen once a month 
wherein representatives from unionized workmen are involved and concerns / 
suggestions are considered. Union bodies meet the management representatives 
on  a necessary basis if any urgent concern needs to be addressed.
Other than 
Permanent 
Workers 
Yes
We have an open house with plant management to address Job related grievances 
of workers on regular basis. Contract supervisors also have meetings once a 
month with the contract workers and any concerns raised are communicated to 
the management.
Permanent 
Employees
Yes
We use Amber, a chat bot, to interact with team members across geographies. 
Through this platform, we capture people’s experiences at a defined frequency 
based on their tenure in the company. The feedback has helped us take both 
faster individual actions and make organisation-level changes based on emerging 
themes. We also run an annual In tune survey partnering with Gallup, to know the 
pulse of our employees and we have the whistleblower policy for any grievance 
redressal against our people and process.
Other than 
Permanent 
Employees
Yes 
Other than permanent employees can use the whistleblower channel for 
grievances. They also have access to Amber chat bot to send in their feedback/
suggestions. They can also use informal channels where they can reach HR in 
person and voice their concerns.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, the coverage such system:
	
	
Yes, all of GCPL’s manufacturing sites are ISO 45001 certified with a detailed safety & health management 
system (SHMS) in place. The SHMS system covers all site operations, employees, contractors & other 
stakeholders associated with sites’ operations. It also covers all the legal requirements pertaining to the 
company’s operations.
	
	
We continually improve our SHMS implementation and effectiveness. Our internal system checks effectiveness 
based on findings from internal safety audits, inspection (internal & external), accident and incident 
investigations (Internal & external), CAPA, and legal changes. We also review and assesses the SHMS system 
every 3 years and update with the best industrial practices.
	
b.	
Processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity:
	
	
GCPL follows Hazard identification & risk assessment (HIRA) process based on ISO 45001 standard. We also 
use specific techniques such as HAZOP and QRA for specific operations and risk identification. Employees, 
contractors and all other stakeholders take part in HIRA process. We have a trained team to carry out HIRA for 
all its site operations.
	
	
All non-routine activities are controlled through a strong work permit system. The company ensures any new 
project or any change in terms of infrastructure, system or people goes through a detailed assessment for safety 
& health risk assessment. We have identified and created a list of significant risks named “Critical to Safety”. A 
detailed action plan to mitigate these risks at all sites is prepared and its status is reviewed up to board-level. We 
have invested more than INR 15 CR in this in the last several years in safety initiatives.
	
c.	
Whether the entity has processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks (Yes / No):
	
	
Yes, we understand and value the power of employee participation for improvement in safety and health 
condition. We encourage worker participation in identifying workplace hazards. Our workers are trained for 
identifying hazards, near miss, and safety related incidents. We have provided multiple reporting options such as 
a mobile base reporting app named as iSafe, safety suggestion box and hazard reporting register. They can also 
report any hazard through their safety committee representative. All our sites have safety committees with equal 
representation from workers. We check the effectiveness of hazard reporting system and safety committee 
effectiveness through SHMS evaluation system. We also organise number of safety celebrations throughout the 
year to increase safety awareness at all levels.
320
	
	
Our Safety and Health policy gives right to all employees, workers, contractors and stakeholders the freedom 
to take appropriate actions to save themself from any hazard arising out of work-related activities. We have a 
zero-tolerance policy that prohibits any forceful work in unsafe conditions.
	
d.	
Do the employees / workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes 
/ No)
	
	
Yes, all our sites have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services either on-site or through 
tie-ups with reputed medical entities in close proximity. In addition, trained first aiders are available to respond 
appropriately to medical requirements. We arrange frequent programmes to improve awareness about health 
and this includes yearly medical check-up, celebration of heart day, and yoga day among others. We consider 
mental health as one of the key risks & tied it up with 1to1 help. This service is freely available for all GCPL 
employees. In addition to this, we also celebrates mental health awareness month.

Statutory Reports | Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR)
	
We believe that people are the key to build a strong safety culture and as a company we should strive to connect each 
and every employee by using innovative ways like hands on training, skits and safety competitions. A strong safety 
culture is key to long-term performance. We have made significant progress through:
	
1.	
Behaviour-based Safety (BBS) with DSS+ in India  
In collaboration with DSS+ (DuPont Safety Solutions), we trained 50+ leaders, 100+ middle managers, and 
100+ shop floor colleagues in safety leadership. Leaders now conduct weekly site visits, ensuring hazards are 
addressed and fostering a culture of ownership, achieving 100% leadership engagement across sites.
	
2.	
Expanded Safety Beyond Manufacturing
	
•	
Warehouse Safety (India): Developed a safety plan, conducted risk assessments, and closed non-compliant 
warehouses.
	
•	
Safer Travel Policy: We launched a road safety policy, training employees and service providers while assessing 
safety compliance.
	
With these initiatives, we reinforce our commitment to a zero-injury workplace and a culture of shared safety 
responsibility.
	
We continue to focus on improving safety awareness among all employees, workers and contractual workforce. 
We arrange close to 200 safety training programmes across our plants. As per our commitment to close gaps on 
identified critical to safety areas, we have been investing in improving our safety infrastructure and systems. 
	
Automation and AI is the new way of working and we are exploring opportunities that can help make our operations 
safer. Our safety performance was also recognised by various renowned national agencies such as NSC, CII for 
improvement in safety.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity:
	
At GCPL we have identified and prioritised our key stakeholders on the basis of their influence on our operations and 
our impact on them. We engage with them through various mechanisms such as, interactions with local communities, 
supplier/ vendor meets, customer/ consumer / employee satisfaction and feedback surveys, investor forums, 
and media meets among others. As a responsible business, we work closely with our communities to understand 
their needs and build synergies. Our Board Members are a part of the CSR and ESG committee and the Board 
is updated about the discussions in these meetings during the Board Meetings. Few of our Board members and 
Senior Management travel to various geographies for market assessment and obtain first-hand feedback across 
stakeholders. Additionally, we organise Investor and Analyst calls multiple times a year wherein the investors interact 
with our senior management.

Leadership Indicators 
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the board of directors on economic, 
environmental and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided 
to the board:
	
We organise periodic materiality study findings and share with the GCPL Board. In addition, we formulated a 
stakeholder engagement process that will enable us to consult them, keep them informed of the latest activities, 
engage with them regularly and collaborate with or empower them. Regulatory changes, inputs, requests from 
investors, evolving supplier scenario, feedback from CSR implementation partners and local communities are 
informed to the Board and their guidance is sought for way forward on these matters.
	
Our Board Members are a part of the CSR and ESG committee and the Board is updated about the discussions in 
these meetings during the Board Meetings. Our CSR committee Board members visit our programmes on ground and 
communicate directly with our beneficiaries and NGO partners on ground.
2	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. We carried out a formal stakeholder engagement process during our double materiality assessment in 2024. Our 
stakeholders provided inputs and covered a number of ESG material concerns, which have been incorporated into 
our ESG focus areas. For example, sustainable packaging, product safety and greener products were some of our 
biggest priorities both in terms of impact materiality and financial materiality. These have become imperative to our 
focus, and we are working to reduce our plastic packaging intensity, craft a responsible chemical management policy 
to minimize hazardous substances and chemicals in our products and wherever possible remove them completely, 
and we are finding ways to lower the overall environmental impact of our products. In 2020, our previous materiality 
assessment revealed occupational health and safety as a top material topic. Since then, we have launched a Safety 
325
Statutory Reports | Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR)
and Health policy and have built a robust process to create a safe and healthy work environment for all GCPL 
stakeholders including our employees, business associates, processors, contractors, sub-contractors, vendors, 
transporters, customers, and visitors.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable / 
marginalized stakeholder groups:
	
We organise periodic in-person engagements to drive conversations on DEI with vulnerable and marginalised 
stakeholder groups such as people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ people. Through our interactions and 
conversations, we have crafted inclusive policies at our workplace to ensure there is no discrimination at our 
workplace. We have gender-neutral anti-harassment policy, same sex partner benefits at par with married spouses, 
gender neutral adoption benefits and even support gender transition and offer gender neutral washrooms.

against sexual harassment to enable anonymous reporting and discussions. We have also launched a POSH Hotline 
for all our facilities in India. Our gender-neutral policy enables our employees from all genders to avail the protection 
against sexual harassment at the workplace. Post resolution of POSH complaints, decision such as change of teams, 
locations, working arrangements, termination of respondent etc. further prevent adverse consequences.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Details of a Business Process being modified / introduced as a result of addressing Human Rights Grievances / 
Complaints:
	
One thing we implemented is for each employee to acknowledge the Code of Conduct at the time of their joining, to 
ensure they up-hold the values of safety, respect and Human Rights at Godrej. The Code of Conduct also provides 
information on points of contact who will take any complaints in this respect forward. We have also started POSH 
sensitization workshops in partnership with experienced third-party vendors and all employees have to mandatorily 
complete POSH eLearning module on the employee portal. The IC members must undergo training every 6 months on 
how to deal with cases and provide support to the aggrieved parties. Complaints and cases are tracked and reviewed 
at the central level by leadership and HR teams on a periodic basis.
2.	
Details of the scope and coverage of any Human Rights Due Diligence conducted:
	
During 2022-2024, we assessed close to 20,000 employees, workers, contract workers and community members 
across 36 manufacturing plants in 9 countries which covers 100% of our owned operations globally. In FY2024-25, we 
also assessed suppliers covering 70% of our procurement spends for human rights impacts. The assessments covered 
our own employees, third-party and contract employees, women, children, migrant workers, and local communities.
3.	
Is the premise / office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, as per the requirements of the rights of 
persons with disabilities act, 2016:
	
Our Godrej One (Global headquarters) is accessible for differently abled visitors and workers with infrastructural 
modifications being updated on an on-going basis. Our newly launched Nilgiri factory has been constructed with a 
strong focus on accessibility, adhering to inclusive design guidelines. Modifications are in progress for regional and 
manufacturing units. Third party contractors are employed to conduct independent audits of our infrastructure in our 
manufacturing units so that we improve our facilities at a regular basis.

Has the Entity implemented a Mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
	
Yes, we have set up a ZLD process at each of our plant locations. 
	
In the North, the Common effluent treatment plant (CETP) at the Baddi site acts as a central processing unit, where 
other plants transfer all the effluents after primary treatment, whereas at the Jammu location, we recycle treated 
water and use for domestic purpose like plantation and flushing in our plant, along with ETP/STP.
	
There is no wastewater generated in our processes at the south cluster; instead, lab wash waters are discharged. At 
South cluster, we ensure ZLD in all our units by utilising STP to treat household wastewater. No water is discharged out 
of any of our plant locations as the treated water is used for domestic purposes. 
 
Sites across all four of our India region have been assessed and certified by TUV India Private Limited as ‘Zero Liquid 
Discharge’ and ‘Zero waste to Landfill’ facilities.
