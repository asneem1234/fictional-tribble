Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt 
or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format.

1
Energy and 
Emissions
Both
Energy and Emissions management 
represents both a considerable 
opportunity and mitigation-
demanding risk for the company. 
On the risk front, stringent 
regulatory standards and 
the global transition towards 
greener manufacturing practices 
impose potential operational 
challenges and financial liabilities, 
particularly under the pressing 
threats identified by the board, 
such as those associated with 
the IC engine's viability long 
term. Embracing these changes 
presents the company with 
opportunities to innovate 
through the adoption of cleaner, 
more efficient technologies, 
enhancing operational efficiency 
and competitive positioning in a 
marketplace increasingly governed 
by environmental sustainability 
imperatives.
To address this dual aspect of risk and 
opportunity effectively, the company 
is strategically enhancing its energy 
management systems and targeting 
a reduction in emissions through 
several initiatives. First, significant 
investments are directed towards 
upgrading existing electrical fittings 
to ensure higher energy efficiency 
and lower emissions. The company 
is also expanding its reliance on 
renewable energy sources, aiming 
for a sizeable percentage of its total 
energy consumption to be sourced 
sustainably. Furthermore, continuous 
monitoring and reporting systems are 
being implemented to track progress 
and make data-driven adjustments 
promptly. These steps align with the 
broader ESG goals set by the board 
and cater to risk mitigation amidst 
the economic disruptions.
Positive
2
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Both 
The Company recognizes supply 
chain sustainability as both a 
risk and an opportunity that 
significantly influences its overall 
success. Risks arise from potential 
disruptions caused by economic 
downturns, geopolitical tensions, 
or environmental catastrophes, 
which have been exacerbated due 
to global instabilities. Additionally, 
with intensifying competition 
due to over-capacity and 
fluctuations in the replacement 
business, maintaining a resilient 
supply chain is more crucial 
than ever. Conversely, effectively 
managing these risks presents 
significant opportunities for 
boosting operational efficiency, 
enhancing brand reputation, 
and achieving compliance with 
increasing regulatory demands 
around environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) standards.
To combat potential risks and 
harness opportunities, the company 
has embarked on several strategic 
initiatives aimed at bolstering the 
resilience and sustainability of its 
supply chain. Key among these is the 
diversification of supply sources to 
minimize dependency on any single 
supplier or region, thereby mitigating 
potential disruption risks. The 
company is also increasingly engaging 
with suppliers on sustainability 
practices, ensuring that they align 
with the company’s ESG goals. This 
includes regular sustainability audits 
and collaborative efforts to improve 
environmental performance across 
the supply chain.

Employee 
Health, Safety, 
and Well-being
Opportunity
The Company views employee 
health, safety, and well-being as 
pivotal components of our strategic 
framework that drive substantial 
business value and operational 
excellence. By positioning these 
elements at the core of our 
operating principles, we align 
ourselves with international best 
practices, enhancing our reputation 
and establishing our company as a 
leader in workforce management. 
This proactive approach elevates 
our industry standing fostering 
a resilient and agile corporate 
culture capable of attracting 
and retaining exceptional talent, 
thereby promoting innovation and 
sustained productivity within our 
teams.
-
Positive
4
Digital Security 
and Data 
Privacy
Risk
The significance of digital security 
and data privacy cannot be 
understated, especially in an era 
where cyber threats are escalating 
in complexity and magnitude. The 
reliance on digital technologies for 
operational needs, coupled with 
the integration of sophisticated 
data-driven decision-making 
processes, places the company at 
a greater risk of cyber incidents. 
Such risks not only threaten 
the integrity of crucial business 
data but also pose substantial 
regulatory and reputational risks in 
case of data breaches.
To mitigate these risks, the company 
has adopted a robust and proactive 
approach towards digital security and 
data privacy. Our strategy is centered 
around implementing state-of-the-
art cybersecurity technologies that 
encompass advanced threat detection 
systems and strong encryption 
methods to protect data integrity 
and confidentiality. In addition, we 
conduct regular security audits and 
vulnerability assessments to identify 
and rectify potential security gaps in 
our digital infrastructure. Employee 
training programs are systematically 
rolled out to heighten awareness 
of cybersecurity best practices and 
data privacy laws, ensuring that all 
employees understand their critical 
roles in maintaining our security 
posture.
Negative

Corporate 
Governance 
and 
Compliance
Opportunity
The Company’s corporate 
governance and compliance 
proposes significant opportunities 
to strengthen the company’s 
market position and enhance 
stakeholder trust. Strong 
governance structures support 
transparent decision-making 
processes, ethical business 
operations, and consistent 
compliance with evolving 
regulations. These factors are 
crucial amid increasing global 
scrutiny over corporate practices. 
Improved governance and strict 
compliance also fortify investor 
confidence and foster positive 
relationships with regulators, 
customers, and the community.

Talent 
Management 
and Diversity
Both
The Company recognizes talent 
management and diversity as 
a vital opportunity to enhance 
organizational capabilities and 
drive innovation. In today’s 
competitive business environment, 
where talent is a critical asset, 
fostering a diverse and inclusive 
workforce enables the company 
to approach problems and 
opportunities from varied 
perspectives, enhancing creativity 
and decision-making.
The Company acknowledges that 
talent management and diversity 
also present potential risks if not 
effectively addressed. The inability 
to attract, develop, and retain 
skilled talent, particularly in a 
highly specialized manufacturing 
environment, can lead to operational 
inefficiencies, increased recruitment 
costs, and loss of competitive 
advantage. Furthermore, a lack of 
diversity and inclusion may hinder 
the company’s ability to foster 
innovation, adapt to evolving 
market demands, and meet the 
expectations of global stakeholders. 
As industry standards and customer 
expectations continue to evolve, any 
gaps in managing talent or promoting 
an inclusive culture may pose 
reputational and compliance risks, 
impacting long-term sustainability 
and growth.
Positive
7
Product 
Innovation 
and Lifecycle 
Management
Opportunity
The Company witnesses 
product innovation and lifecycle 
management as strategic 
opportunities enabling the 
company to remain competitive 
in a rapidly changing automotive 
landscape. With the automotive 
industry facing external shifts 
such as the threat to internal 
combustion (IC) engines and the 
increasing demand for sustainable 
automotive solutions, the capacity 
to innovate and effectively manage 
the lifecycle of our products 
from design to disposal becomes 
crucial. Proactive management 
and innovation in our products 
allow us to meet regulatory and 
environmental standards and lead 
the market with our competitive 
product offerings.

Community 
and Social 
Responsibility
Opportunity
The Company understands 
that community and social 
responsibility extends beyond 
corporate borders and plays a 
critical role in sustainable business 
practices. Engaging proactively 
with the communities where we 
operate enhances our goodwill; 
it’s strategically integral to our 
business model. The potential to 
bolster community relations aligns 
with our core values and enhances 
our brand reputation, potentially 
leading to increased business 
opportunities.

Climate 
Change 
Adaptation 
and Mitigation
Both
Climate change poses unique 
challenges and opportunities for 
the company, given the inherent 
vulnerability of manufacturing 
operations to environmental 
impacts and the evolving 
regulatory landscape on emissions 
and sustainability. From a risk 
perspective, the physical impacts 
of climate change, including 
increased frequency of natural 
calamities, can disrupt production 
processes and supply chains, 
directly affecting operational 
efficiency and costs. Additionally, 
policy changes aiming to reduce 
carbon footprints and greenhouse 
gas emissions could impose stricter 
compliance requirements, affecting 
the production and marketability 
of IC engines, which are under 
environmental scrutiny. Conversely, 
these challenges present a 
strategic opportunity for the 
company to lead in sustainability 
by innovating and adapting 
products and processes that are 
environmentally friendly and by 
enhancing resource efficiency, 
potentially opening new markets 
and strengthening consumer trust 
in the brand as a responsible 
environmental steward.
To navigate the risks and seize the 
opportunities associated with climate 
change, the company is adopting 
a dual strategy of adaptation and 
mitigation. Adaptation efforts 
include enhancing operational 
resilience by incorporating third 
party assessments and investing 
in diversifying the supply chain to 
minimize the risk of disruption. On 
the mitigation front, the company 
is actively reducing its carbon 
footprint through initiatives such as 
improving energy efficiency in its 
manufacturing plants, shifting toward 
more sustainable energy sources, 
and pursuing innovations in product 
design to reduce environmental 
impact. Additionally, the company is 
increasing investments in research 
and development focused on 
next-generation technologies, 
such as electric and hybrid vehicle 
components, aligning with global 
shifts toward reducing reliance on 
fossil fuels.

Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, high-lighting ESG related 
challenges, targets, and       achievements
The Company is dedicated to integrating Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles into our core operations. Our sustainability 
journey is characterized by various challenges, ambitious goals, and 
significant accomplishments. One of our main challenges is reducing 
our carbon footprint and managing waste effectively, which we tackle 
by continuously enhancing energy efficiency and adopting cleaner 
technologies. Socially, we prioritize the well-being and safety of our 
employees, especially during the ongoing pandemic, and maintain 
strong community relations. In terms of governance, we strive to 
uphold the highest standards of corporate governance and ensure 
compliance with evolving regulations.
Our goals include achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 through the 
adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements 
and reaching zero waste to landfill by 2026 through robust waste 
management practices. We are also committed to providing a safe 
and healthy work environment, aiming for zero workplace accidents 
and enhanced employee engagement. Among our achievements, we 
have reduced energy consumption over the past three years, positively 
impacted over 1,00,000 lives through our CSR initiatives, and received 
recognition for our strong corporate governance practices. We believe 
that our commitment to ESG principles will drive sustainable growth 
and contribute to a better future for all.

14Please note that last year reporting only consisted of Ghaziabad and Pathredi plants. However, the boundary of reporting has expanded in this reporting period to include assembly units of the Company. Hence, the 
performance data of current year are not strictly comparable with the last year.
Note: For consistency, 2023–24 data for waste intensity has been converted to the current year’s units. Last year, the data was reported in KG/Lakh INR. Now 2023-24 figures are in MT/million INR.
15If the boundary remains the same as the previous year, the waste intensity would also remain the same as reported for FY 2024-25.
*Kindly Note: Since SPRL is revisiting its data management approach from FY 2024-25 onwards, the weight of finished goods for all our products will be assurance-ready by next year reporting cycle. The Company will 
disclose its energy, water and waste intensity as per physical output from next reporting cycle onwards.
