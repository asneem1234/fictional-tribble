*Note: Excluding categories other than Employees ensures data consistency and accuracy, as contingent workers 
often have varied, short-term, or third-party contractual arrangements that can lead to unreliable or incomparable ESG 
metrics. Since our core business operations and culture are primarily driven by permanent employees, focusing ESG 
reporting on this group provides a clear and representative picture of our workforce practices. This approach also aligns 
with certain voluntary ESG frameworks that allow flexibility in defining the reporting boundary based on materiality and 
direct management control.

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
The strategic adoption 
of renewable energy 
technologies—particularly 
solar and wind power—
presents a transformative 
opportunity to diminish 
dependence on finite, 
carbon-intensive resources 
such as fossil fuels. This 
transition not only fosters 
long-term cost efficiency but 
also enhances the stability 
and resilience of energy 
systems. Moreover, renewable 
energy is instrumental 
in significantly curbing 
greenhouse gas emissions, 
thereby contributing to 
environmental preservation 
while simultaneously driving 
down operational and societal 
energy costs. Embracing these 
sustainable alternatives is a 
critical step toward a cleaner, 
more economically viable 
energy future.

Climate 
Transition & 
Physical Risks
Risk
The sector may face climate 
transition risks like regulatory 
shifts, rising energy costs, 
and pressure to adopt 
greener technologies, while 
physical risks include extreme 
weather disrupting data 
centers, supply chains, and 
infrastructure resilience.
Our focus is towards 
adopting renewable energy 
and investing in resilient 
infrastructure. Diversified 
supply chains and disaster-
resistant facilities help reduce 
vulnerabilities, while aligning 
with sustainability regulations 
ensures compliance and cost 
efficiency. Predictive analytics 
and AI-driven monitoring may 
further strengthen operational 
resilience and business 
continuity.

3.
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Cyient’s supply chain 
is subject to a range of 
potential risks that could 
impact both operational 
performance and corporate 
reputation. A key concern 
lies in the sustainability 
practices of its suppliers. If 
suppliers fail to adhere to 
environmentally responsible 
standards, it could lead to an 
increase in Cyient’s Scope 
3 emissions, undermining 
the company’s broader 
sustainability objectives. 
Additionally, any instances of 
regulatory non-compliance 
by suppliers may expose 
Cyient to legal liabilities, 
operational disruptions, 
and reputational damage. 
Proactive engagement 
and rigorous oversight of 
supply chain partners are 
therefore essential to mitigate 
these risks and uphold the 
company’s commitment 
to responsible business 
practices.
To fortify our commitment 
to responsible business 
practices, we adhere to 
a robust Vendor Code 
of Conduct (VCoC) and 
a meticulously designed 
Sustainable Supplier 
Assessment Framework. 
These initiatives serve as 
essential pillars in mitigating 
potential supply chain risks 
while fostering ethical and 
sustainable sourcing.
Furthermore, our recurring 
Vendor Meets act as a 
strategic platform for 
meaningful engagement 
with our partners. These 
interactions enable us to 
reinforce our sustainability 
objectives, ensure alignment 
with our core principles, and 
collaboratively drive progress 
towards a more resilient and 
environmentally conscious 
supply chain.

Risk
Risks in the service industry 
include ergonomic strain,

7.
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Stakeholders—including 
investors, regulators, 
and customers—expect 
transparent reporting on 
financial performance, ESG 
metrics, and governance 
practices. In a sector with high 
environmental and social risks, 
transparency is key to building 
credibility and maintaining 
access to capital. Inadequate 
or inconsistent disclosure can 
lead to regulatory scrutiny, 
loss of investor confidence, 
and reputational harm. It also 
affects the company’s ability 
to be included in sustainability 
indices or to qualify for 
ESG-linked financing. The 
quality and completeness 
of disclosures reflect the 
company’s governance 
maturity and accountability.

Business 
Ethics, 
Integrity & 
Transparency
Risk
Engaging in unethical business 
practices poses significant 
risks to Cyient’s financial 
stability and corporate 
reputation. Such actions 
can lead to serious legal and 
regulatory repercussions, 
including fines, sanctions, and 
operational conflicts. Beyond 
the immediate consequences, 
unethical conduct undermines 
stakeholder trust—eroding 
customer loyalty, diminishing 
market share, and weakening 
investor confidence.
Maintaining the highest 
standards of integrity is 
not only a legal obligation 
but a strategic necessity. 
By fostering a culture of 
transparency, accountability, 
and ethical decision-
making, Cyient reinforces its 
commitment to responsible 
governance and long-term 
value creation.
The Corporate Governance 
Manual serves as a 
foundational guide for 
the Board, management, 
and employees, providing 
insightful direction and 
strategic counsel. It empowers 
stakeholders to navigate 
decisions aligned with our 
vision, mission, and long-term 
growth strategy, ensuring a 
steadfast commitment to 
Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles.
By integrating ESG-
driven governance, we 
aim to foster sustainable 
development, enhance 
corporate responsibility, and 
create lasting value for all 
stakeholders. This manual 
not only reinforces ethical 
leadership but also acts as 
a blueprint for achieving 
resilience and prosperity in 
an ever-evolving business 
landscape.

Data Security 
& Privacy
Risk
Breaches in data privacy 
can have far-reaching 
consequences, exposing 
organizations to substantial 
legal liabilities, financial 
penalties, and reputational 
harm. Such incidents not 
only compromise sensitive 
information but also erode the 
trust of customers, partners, 
and other key stakeholders. 
A decline in confidence can 
lead to reduced business 
opportunities, customer 
attrition, and long-term 
damage to brand credibility.
At Cyient, protecting data 
privacy is a critical priority. 
By implementing robust data 
protection protocols and 
adhering to global compliance 
standards, we aim to ensure 
the confidentiality, integrity, 
and security of all stakeholder 
information—reinforcing our 
commitment to ethical and 
responsible data stewardship.
Cyient employs a robust 
Data Leak Prevention 
(DLP) solution designed to 
safeguard the intellectual 
property of both our clients 
and our organization. This 
advanced security mechanism 
proactively monitors, detects, 
and prevents unauthorized 
access or transmission of 
sensitive information. By 
implementing stringent data 
protection controls, our 
DLP framework ensures the 
confidentiality and integrity 
of critical assets—reinforcing 
our commitment to secure, 
responsible, and trustworthy 
business operations.

10. Systemic Risk 
Management
Risk
The rise of cloud computing 
and SaaS introduces systemic 
risks such as server downtime, 
programming errors, and 
cyber threats, which can 
disrupt critical industries 
like finance and utilities. 
These sectors rely heavily on 
centralized cloud data centers, 
increasing vulnerability 
to failures. Compliance 
challenges also arise, as 
shifting data storage to 
third-party providers requires 
strict adherence to privacy 
and security regulations. 
Additionally, service 
disruptions or breaches can 
lead to financial losses and 
reputational damage, making 
cybersecurity investments 
and disaster recovery 
strategies essential. While 
improved IT infrastructure 
creates market expansion 
opportunities, companies 
must balance innovation 
with robust risk mitigation to 
ensure long-term resilience.
Investment in robust 
cybersecurity, including 
encryption, multi-factor 
authentication, and real-
time threat monitoring to 
prevent breaches. Redundant 
data centers and disaster 
recovery plans can minimize 
service disruptions and 
ensure business continuity. 
Compliance with regional 
data privacy regulations is 
essential, requiring strict 
governance frameworks and 
periodic audits. Diversifying 
cloud infrastructure across 
multiple providers enhances 
resilience.
Negative
11. Competitive 
Behaviour
Risk
Software and IT service 
entities face risks such as 
costly litigation, regulatory 
scrutiny, and potential 
antitrust violations due to 
overlapping patent claims 
and restrictive IP practices. 
Legal challenges may impact 
market share, pricing power, 
and revenue, requiring 
careful IP management to 
balance innovation and fair 
competition.
Adopting transparent IP 
policies, ensure fair licensing 
practices, and engaging in 
proactive patent management 
to balance innovation with 
competition while minimizing 
litigation risks and regulatory 
scrutiny.

7. 	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
At Cyient, sustainability is at the core of our business philosophy, guiding our decision-making and long-term strategy. We 
recognize the importance of integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations into our operations 
to drive meaningful impact and contribute to a more sustainable future.
As a leading provider of engineering and technology solutions, Cyient operates in a sector that plays a pivotal role in driving 
industrial innovation, digital transformation, and sustainable infrastructure development. The engineering and technology 
services industry is increasingly focusing on ESG-driven initiatives, including energy efficiency, digital connectivity, and 
responsible sourcing. Companies in this space are expected to balance technological advancements with environmental 
responsibility, ethical labor practices, and community development.
As we advance our sustainability agenda, we acknowledge several challenges that require innovative solutions and persistent 
effort. Transitioning to renewable energy while maintaining operational efficiency demands strategic investments and 
collaborations. Reducing emissions and implementing circular economy principles across our owned sites and supply chain 
necessitates rigorous assessment, monitoring, and adaptation. Ensuring responsible water management and fostering 
a gender-responsive approach to human rights due diligence remain critical areas that require strong governance and 
stakeholder engagement.
Despite these challenges, we have established ambitious, time-bound targets to accelerate our ESG progress. Key 
environmental goals include increasing renewable energy utilization at our owned sites to 75.00% by FY 2040, reducing 
Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 18.00% by FY 2025 and 66.00% by FY 2040, and achieving 100.00% wastewater recycling at 
owned sites by FY 2030. Additionally, we aim to implement 50.00% rainwater harvesting in our owned offices by FY 2026 
and conduct ESG assessments of suppliers representing 75.00% of our total organizational spend by FY 2027.
As a key player in the engineering and technology services sector, Cyient is committed to aligning its business practices 
with global sustainability objectives, ensuring responsible innovation while fostering positive social and environmental 
impact. Through a structured and proactive approach, Cyient remains dedicated to creating lasting value for stakeholders 
and the broader industry. These targets reflect our commitment to building a resilient and responsible organization. As we 
move forward, we remain dedicated to transparent reporting, continuous improvement, and fostering partnerships that 
advance global sustainability efforts. Through a structured and proactive approach, Cyient is determined to create lasting 
value for stakeholders and the environment.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
At Cyient, stakeholder engagement is integral to our ESG strategy. We identify key stakeholders—such as investors, 
employees, clients, leadership, communities, and suppliers—through a structured mapping process based on their 
relevance and impact. Consultations are conducted via surveys, meetings, and focused discussions to gather insights 
on economic, environmental, and social issues. When delegated, feedback is formally documented and shared with the 
Board through periodic reports and ESG committee updates. This process ensures that stakeholder perspectives are 
embedded in strategic decisions, reinforcing our commitment to sustainable and responsible business practices.
2.

social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation plays a pivotal role in identifying and managing environmental and social topics at Cyient. 
We follow a structured five-step materiality assessment process to ensure that stakeholder insights are meaningfully 
integrated into our sustainability strategy:
1.	
Issue Identification: We begin by compiling a comprehensive list of environmental and social issues, aligned with 
sector-specific ESG standards and global frameworks.
2.	
Strategic Relevance: These issues are evaluated against our core business objectives, including growth, 
operational efficiency, brand equity, and long-term resilience.
3.	
Risk Prioritization: Each issue is assessed for its potential impact and associated risks, enabling prioritization 
based on business relevance and preparedness.
4.	
Stakeholder Engagement: We actively engage with internal and external stakeholders to validate the significance 
of these issues and understand their expectations.
5.	
Benchmarking: The findings are cross-referenced with global benchmarks such as the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC), and the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index (DJSI)
Insights from this process helps us curate our sustainability strategy and initiatives accordingly. Stakeholder input has 
led to the advancement of energy efficiency initiatives and the strengthening of health and safety programs, ensuring 
our actions remain both stakeholder-focused and strategically aligned.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.

specific concerns. Through ongoing dialogue with community members, local NGOs, and grassroots organizations, 
we identify key areas where support is most needed—such as access to education, digital literacy, employability, 
and environmental awareness. Based on these insights, we have implemented targeted initiatives including skill 
development programs for youth and women, digital literacy campaigns in underserved regions, and community-led 
environmental projects. We ensure that any issues raised such as accessibility challenges are promptly addressed.

The responsibility for overseeing human rights-related matters lies with designated individuals and committees, 
ensuring accountability and proactive management. Our Head of ESG and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) leads 
the efforts in identifying, assessing, and mitigating any potential or actual human rights risks. Additionally, a dedicated 
leadership panel is responsible for managing and reviewing all whistleblower complaints, with oversight from the Board 
of Directors. This multi-tiered approach ensures that human rights concerns are addressed promptly, transparently, 
and in alignment with our ethical commitments.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues

confidential platform for employees to raise concerns without fear of retaliation. In addition, we operate an independent 
Integrity Helpline, managed by an external agency, which allows both internal and external stakeholders to report 
issues anonymously. This ensures impartial investigation and resolution in line with regulatory and ethical standards. 
To further reinforce our commitment, we have constituted an Internal Complaints Committee in accordance with 
the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, to address these 
grievances. These mechanisms collectively uphold our human rights commitments and foster a culture of transparency, 
accountability, and trust.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Our Disciplinary Action Policy incorporates a comprehensive non-retaliation clause, which explicitly prohibits any 
adverse action against individuals who, in good faith, report violations of the Cyient Code of Ethics & Business Conduct, 
including human rights infringements. The policy acknowledges the emotional and professional stress that may 
accompany such disclosures and ensures that whistleblowers are protected throughout the investigative process. In 
alignment with our Whistleblower Policy & Procedures, every complainant is entitled to full protection from retaliation. 
This includes protection against demotion, dismissal, intimidation, or any form of discrimination arising from their 
decision to report misconduct or cooperate in an investigation. To ensure impartiality and transparency, Cyient has 
constituted dedicated Internal Committees at operational locations. These bodies are empowered by the Chairman 
and Managing Director to investigate complaints thoroughly and confidentially, in accordance with the provisions 
and other applicable laws. These mechanisms are periodically reviewed and strengthened to align with evolving legal 
standards and best practices in corporate governance. Through these proactive measures, Cyient reaffirms its zero-
tolerance stance on discrimination and harassment, and its unwavering support for those who courageously speak up 
in defense of ethical conduct and workplace justice.

Yes, Cyient has proactively initiated several strategic interventions aimed at curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
reinforcing our commitment to climate stewardship and sustainable operations. As part of our transition toward 
cleaner energy sources, we have significantly expanded our renewable energy footprint by deploying solar power 
infrastructure across key locations, including Kakinada, Vizag, Warangal, and Madhapur. These installations have 
meaningfully reduced our dependence on grid-based electricity and contributed to lowering our carbon intensity. Our 
Bangalore and Manikonda campuses now derive a substantial portion of their energy needs from solar power. In addition 
to renewable energy adoption, we are fostering a culture of green mobility by establishing electric vehicle (EV) charging 
stations at our Manikonda, Madhapur, and Bangalore facilities. These stations support both two- and four-wheeled EVs, 
encouraging employees to embrace low-emission transportation alternatives. Collectively, these initiatives reflect 
Cyient’s integrated approach to environmental responsibility combining clean energy, and sustainable infrastructure 
to drive long-term impact in reducing GHG emissions.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Cyient adopts a comprehensive approach to waste management, aimed at minimizing ecological impact and promoting 
sustainable operations across all its facilities. Our waste segregation system is designed to ensure efficient sorting at 
source, with clearly labeled bins for recyclables, organic waste, and non-recyclables. All waste streams are managed 
through authorized vendors certified by the Pollution Control Board, ensuring compliance with environmental 
regulations. To reduce paper waste, we collaborate with certified recycling partners and promote the use of recycled 
paper products, including notepads and office supplies. Organic waste, such as food and garden residues, is processed 
through on-site Organic Waste Converters, which transform biodegradable material into nutrient-rich compost 
used for in-house landscaping and gardening. In line with our commitment to environmental stewardship, Cyient has 
implemented stringent controls to minimize the use of hazardous and toxic substances in our operations. We actively 
discourage the use of non-biodegradable and harmful materials through internal awareness campaigns and regular 
employee communications. Where chemicals are necessary such as in cleaning processes or sewage treatment only 
certified, regulatory-compliant products are used. We employ dilution and neutralization techniques to reduce chemical 
concentration, ensuring safe handling and disposal. Wastewater generated at our facilities is treated through Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs), and the treated water is reused for non-potable applications like sanitation and irrigation, 
further reducing our environmental footprint.
