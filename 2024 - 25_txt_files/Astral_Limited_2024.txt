Replacing conventional lighting with energy-efficient LED fixtures is expected to 
significantly reduce electricity consumption and Scope 2 emissions in locations 
such as Hyderabad, Cuttack, Dahej, and Dholka. Similarly, the installation of 
percolated wells at Ghilloth is anticipated to improve the area’s water table. 
Improved workplace lighting conditions are also expected to enhance visibility, 
safety, and employee comfort, fostering better overall working conditions. 
Additionally, acquiring certain equipment has significantly reduced material 
usage by minimizing the number of trials required, resulting in substantial 
savings in material, machine hours, manpower, and energy consumption.

recycling through authorized pathways, and disposing of hazardous waste in strict compliance with the Hazardous Waste 
(Management, Handling, and Transboundary Movement) Rules of 2016. Additionally, Astral is properly registered under

enhancement of its Environmental Management System 
(EMS) and Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System (OH&SMS). The company is committed to 
providing a safe, healthy work environment, preventing 
work-related injuries and accidents, and addressing 
significant 
environmental 
aspects 
and 
OH&SMS 
hazards. The goals include legal compliance, process

management programs for environmental performance 
and OH&SMS improvement, employee training, regular 
mock drills, employee participation for policy fulfillment, 
and periodical audits and management reviews to ensure 
continual enhancement of the EMS and OH&SMS. 
Astral has implemented an integrated management 
system in compliance with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 
45001 standards. The ISO 9001 coverage spans across 14 
locations: Head Office, Pipe Plants at Santej, Dholka, Ghilot,

aims to expand this coverage in the coming years.
b. What are the processes used to identify  work-related 
hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine

Astral has successfully implemented Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment (HIRA) to promote a comprehensive 
approach 
in 
identifying 
hazards, 
assessing 
risks, 
implementing controls, ensuring compliance, and driving 
continuous improvement. The tools utilized for identifying 
and evaluating work-related hazards include Process 
Hazards Analysis through HIRA, employee engagement 
via the Safety Committee, regular safety training sessions, 
establishment of standard operating procedures (SOPs) 
and a work permit system, identification of unsafe acts 
and conditions through routine safety inspections and 
implementing Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) 
accordingly. Additionally, mechanisms for reporting near-
misses, comprehensive activity checklists, and regular 
audit and compliance activities are in place. Safety 
Committee meetings oversee and monitor work-related 
hazards and near-misses. Moreover, regular toolbox talks 
on the shop floor, theme-based trainings, safety inductions, 
identification of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
requirements, and motivational activities with rewards 
are conducted consistently. This diligent approach has 
cultivated a safety-centric culture, resulting in reduced 
accidents, enhanced protection for personnel and assets, 
and improved operational efficiency.

resolution to document all proceedings and retain these records as part of the resolution process. The resolution outcome 
must be communicated within a specified timeframe; if this does not occur, the employee has the right to escalate 
the issue to a higher level of management. Once the Steering Committee closes the case, the decision made will be 
considered final and binding. An internal Complaints Committee has been formed to redress POSH-related grievances.

Sr. 
No.
Initiative 
undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be

Outcome of the initiative
1
Process Innovation
Astral’s innovation in the manufacturing process of 
Silencio pipes involves directly feeding compounded 
PP with minerals to the extruders, bypassing the 
conventional method of reheating pellets.
This 
improvement 
saves 
a 
significant amount of energy, as 
reheating to 200-220 °C is no 
longer necessary.
2
Manufacturing 
Innovation
In another innovative step to save energy, Astral’s 
manufacturing process now utilizes an Extruder 
instead of a heat pump system to create pressure.
This 
improvement 
significantly 
reduces 
heat 
and 
torque 
consumption.
3
Reuse of waste
Waste or defective pipes produced during production 
can be reused in the manufacture of new pipes.
This not only reduces waste but 
also drastically cuts down on the 
consumption of virgin raw material.
4
Eliminating 
Substance of 
Concern
The product's manufacturing process and raw 
materials have been optimized to eliminate substances 
of concern
Results 
in 
toxic-free 
pipe 
production and minimising the 
emission of harmful gases into the 
environment.
5
As strong as Metal
Silencio, due to its high molecular weight, provides 
the pipes with superior physical and mechanical 
properties, making them a viable alternative to cast 
iron drainage pipes. 
With less environmental impact 
compared to cast iron, Silencio 
pipes offer a more sustainable 
option.
6
Improvement in Air 
quality
The plant is equipped with turbo ventilators that 
exhaust industrial pollutants and maintain air quality, 
thereby creating a comfortable working environment 
for employees. Additional roof insulation keeps the 
indoor temperature lower than outside. 
Reduces heat gain and mitigates 
the urban heat island effect.
7
Daylighting
The factory building has been provided with adequate 
daylight facilities so as to reduce the use of artificial 
light during the daytime. 
This helps the plant reduce its 
energy consumption in daytime
3. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan ? Give details in 100 words/web link.
Yes, Astral has a Business Continuity Plan in place. Astral keeps a disaster recovery site operational to secure the resilience

PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible 
manner
Essential Indicators
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
Customers are given various options to contact the company’s customer service, which include dialing the toll-free 
number 18002337957, visiting their website to report their issues, or notifying their Distributor, who will then create a Ticket 
in the Distributor portal. Upon filing a complaint, it is directed to the Customer Care Department and then delegated to 
the relevant field staff. This staff member contacts the customer to understand the issue comprehensively, followed by 
an on-site resolution. If required, material samples are taken for quality control laboratory testing, and the test results are 
shared with the customer. The results then dictate the necessary corrective steps to be enacted. 
Moreover, the Adhesive division has a specialized customer care number, 7311103331, and a portal for complaints, inquiries, 
recommendations, and feedback at wecare.astraladhesives.com. This portal allows any individual to post their comments, 
which generates a ticket and forwards the request to the concerned department for resolution. Each ticket number 
corresponds to an escalation matrix, and in case of a delayed response, a direct notification is sent to the Department 
Head.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting
INDEPENDENT 
PRACTITIONER’S 
REASONABLE 
ASSURANCE 
REPORT 
ON 
IDENTIFIED 
SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION IN ASTRAL LIMITED’S BRSR
We have undertaken to perform a reasonable assurance engagement for ASTRAL LIMITED in respect of the agreed 
Sustainability Information listed below (the “Identified Sustainability Information”) in accordance with the criteria stated 
below. This Sustainability Information is as included in the BRSR of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025. This 
engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners and engineers.
Identified Sustainability Information 
The Identified Sustainability Information for the financial year ended March 31, 2025, is summarized in Annexure 1 to this 
report.
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the financial year ended March 31, 2025, information only and 
we have not performed any procedures with respect to prior periods or any other elements included in the BRSR report, 
other than those listed as BRSR Core Key Performance Indicators ("KPIs") in Annexure 1 to this report and, therefore, do 
not express any opinion thereon.
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information are as follows:
Identified Sustainability 
Information (ISI) subject to 
Assurance
Period subject to 
assurance
Reporting criteria
BRSR Core (refer Annexure 1)
From 1 April 2024 
to 31 March 2025
- Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;
- 
Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability 
Reporting 
Requirements for listed entities per Master Circular No. SEBI/
HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/ 0155 dated November 11, 2024 and 
Industry Standard on Reporting of BRSR Core per SEBI Circular 
No. SEBI/ HO/ CFD/ CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated 
December 20, 2024.
Management's Responsibilities
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting 
or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
sustainability Information, taking into account applicable 
laws and regulations, if any, related to reporting on the 
Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in 
accordance with the criteria. This responsibility includes 
design, implementation and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the 
measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, 
which is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities. In addition, Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") 
quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because 
of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine 
emissions factors and the values needed to combine 
emissions of different gases.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have maintained our independence and confirm that 
we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI") 
and have the required competencies and experience to 
conduct this assurance engagement.
The firm applies Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 
1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other 
Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and 
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding 
compliance 
with 
ethical 
requirements, 
professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information 
based on the procedures we have performed and 
evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 
Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements 
("SSAE") 
3000, 
"Assurance 
Engagements 
on 
Sustainability Information" and the Standard on Assurance 
36
ASTRAL LIMITED | Annual Report 2024-25
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting
Engagements ("SAE") 3410, "Assurance Engagements 
on Greenhouse Gas Statements", both issued by the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards Board of the ICAI.
These Standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Identified Sustainability Information is 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
Criteria. A reasonable assurance engagement involves 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud 
or error and responding to the assessed risks as necessary 
in the circumstances.
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, 
evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing 
or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures listed above, we visited plant locations 
and head office to understand the processes involved in 
data gathering and verifying documentation ensuring the 
reported details are in line with the requirements.
Exclusions
Our reasonable assurance scope excludes the following 
and, therefore, we do not express an opinion on the 
following:
•	
Operations of the Company other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information listed in Annexure 1 to this 
report.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information 
(qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information.

any forward-looking assertions and/or data.
Opinion 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained, the Identified Sustainability 
Information for the year ended March 31, 2025 (as stated 
under “Identified Sustainability Information”) are prepared 
in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria.
Restriction on use 
Our Reasonable Assurance report has been prepared and

the request of the company solely, to assist company in 
reporting on Company’s sustainability performance and 
activities. Accordingly, we accept no liability to anyone, 
other than the company. Our Deliverables should not be
