Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emissions? If Yes, then provide 
details.
	
Yes, the Company has taken multiple initiatives for reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions as part 
of its sustainability agenda. The Company has invested in renewable energy by installing solar panels at 
its manufacturing facilities, thereby reducing reliance on conventional grid electricity sourced from fossil 
fuels. Energy efficiency measures have been implemented, including the upgrade of production machinery 
to energy-efficient models, optimisation of manufacturing processes to lower energy consumption, and 
installation of LED lighting across facilities.
	
In addition, the Company promotes sustainable supply chain practices, encourages responsible waste 
management, and integrates environmental considerations into its product designs to ensure lower emissions 
during the product life cycle. Moreover, the Company follows a sustainable waste management practice by 
ensuring that waste is not incinerated on-site. Instead, all waste is responsibly segregated and safely handed 
over to authorized, registered vendors for proper disposal, in compliance with environmental regulations 
and best practices. Through these initiatives, the organisation demonstrates its ongoing commitment to 
mitigating its carbon footprint and supporting broader climate change goals.
