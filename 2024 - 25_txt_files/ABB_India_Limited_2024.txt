Nelamangala campus, ABB 
India’s youngest location is one 
of the most enriched in terms of 
milestones and achievements. It 
is a manufacturing campus where 
dual armed industrial robots  
co-exist in harmony with parrots. 
Where productivity is not only 
defined by autonomous guided 
vehicles on industry 5.0 shopfloor 
but are complemented by the 
equally keen efforts for water 
conservation, increasing the 
water table by three times in the 
arid area, This location is notable 
for many firsts, including being 
ABB India’s first site to become 
water positive. The campus has 
shopfloors for robotic solutions, 
low and medium voltage drives,

Chairman and Managing 
Director’s message
Dear Shareholders,
As we present this message, we mark a 
significant milestone in reaching our 75th 
anniversary of serving this dynamic nation. 
Growing along with the country, we feel 
this achievement as a partnership built 
on technological leadership, a focus on 
sustainability and a deep understanding of the 
country’s evolving requirements. For three-
quarters of a century, we have been helping 
industries outrun leaner and cleaner. We at ABB 
India have been progressing across utilities, 
industries, infrastructure and transportation, 
aligning our efforts with India’s national 
priorities.
A legacy of innovation and strategic 
investments
Our 75th year in India is a time for both 
reflection and renewed commitment. Starting 
with a focused portfolio, ABB India now 
operates across 23 diverse and strategically 
important market segments.
Our best-in-class manufacturing facilities in 
Bengaluru, Nashik, Vadodara and Faridabad 
continue to support the ‘Make in India’ initiative, 
allowing us to provide customized solutions 
that meet the specific needs of our customers.
The past year has witnessed a significant 
surge in demand for energy-efficient and cost-
effective solutions, propelled by India’s strong 
economic growth and its ambitious goals 
towards sustainability and emissions reduction. 
Our strategic investments in local sourcing, 
research and development and advanced 
manufacturing have been crucial in enabling us 
to address these demands effectively, building 
stronger collaborations and partnerships within 
the local ecosystem.
New brand positioning – how do we want to be 
known to our customers
Our new brand positioning at ABB centers on 
‘Outrun.’ We have helped industries consistently 
achieve high performance while empowering 
them to enhance productivity, efficiency 
and sustainability, ultimately enabling them 
to outperform. ‘Leaner’ signifies our global 
leadership in automation, driving productivity 
and efficiency across industries. ‘Cleaner’ 
highlights our pioneering role in electrification, 
leading the decarbonization of crucial sectors. 
This strategic re-positioning of our brand marks 
our next phase as leaders in electrification and 
automation, focusing on delivering superior 
value by helping industries become leaner 
and cleaner, or as we like to say – ‘outrun’ the 
competition.
Driving growth through innovation and 
market focus
The year 2024 has been noteworthy for ABB 
India, characterized by record achievements 
in orders, revenue and margins. Building upon 
a robust performance in the preceding years, 
we have continued our growth trajectory. Our 
revenue expanded by a commendable 17%. 
Our order backlog saw a healthy 12% year-
on-year increase, reaching H 9,380 Crores as 
of December 31, 2024. This strong backlog 
provides revenue visibility and aligns well with 
our growth plans for the coming periods.
We are immensely proud of the dedication 
and performance of the ABB India team, which 
has consistently delivered a CAGR of 20% in 
topline in the last five years and bottom-line 
growth has doubled over the last four years. 
This consistent performance, achieved amid 
various economic and geopolitical dynamics, 
highlights our resilience and customer-centric 
approach. Our diversified portfolio, strategically 
deployed across numerous customer segments, 
allows us to navigate the complexities of the 
Indian market with agility and to capitalize on 
emerging opportunities.
Serving diverse customer segments
The recently announced India Union Budget 
2025 outlines a clear vision for the nation’s 
future with the key focus areas deeply 
resonating with ABB India’s strategic direction. 
Announcements in the budget like the urban 
challenge fund, extension of Jal Jeevan Mission, 
the National AI Mission, setting up CoEs in 
manufacturing and clean tech manufacturing 
mission augur well for ABB India’s growth given 
its portfolio to cater to energy transition and 
solutions in digitalization and AI.
09
Corporate overview
Keeping these tailwinds on our sail, we at 
ABB have set the standard for each of the 
bouquets of customer segments we serve. 
We provide low-voltage distribution panels 
based on our electrification technology to 
frozen food companies through our channel 
partners and integrators. We are partnering 
with power distribution and automation 
companies in their modernization efforts. Our 
low-voltage and medium-voltage solutions 
and equipment are key to making data centers 
more energy efficient especially in an age of AI 
and hyperscale verticalizations. Our solar pump 
drives are enabling sustainable water supply 
and helping cold storages use clean energy 
reliably in parts of northern India.
In the metals manufacturing sector, we 
continue to provide automation solutions for 
both existing plant expansions and greenfield 
projects. The rapidly expanding electronics 
sector is increasingly adopting our robotics 
solutions, recognizing our global expertise and 
local capabilities. We are also a key supplier of 
propulsion technology for railways, including 
for high-speed trains, in addition to providing 
electrification solutions for metros and 
airports.
Sustainability at ABB India
Sustainability remains a core focus in all our 
operations at ABB India. We are dedicated to 
resource conservation across our business, with 
a significant portion of our supplier partners 
actively involved in our green initiatives. In 2024, 
we achieved an impressive ~86% reduction in 
our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions compared to 
our 2019 baseline and 50% of our manufacturing 
facilities are now water-positive and zero 
waste to landfill. A key highlight is that supplier 
participation in our ESG program increased 
to 40.5%, a 33% rise from 2023, as we actively 
partner with them in their sustainability journey 
and strengthen our BRSR reporting.
Across all our campuses, we are advancing 
sustainability, having achieved significant 
carbon footprint reductions and optimized 
energy consumption through our own energy-
efficient technologies and renewable solutions 
like solar power, alongside practices like 
rainwater harvesting and waste recycling.
Long-term vision and strategic outlook
Throughout our 75 years in India, ABB India 
has been at the forefront of introducing 
cutting-edge global technologies adapted 
and engineered locally. Our experienced 
leadership team across all divisions will 
continue to navigate opportunities and 
challenges with agility and foresight, ensuring 
sustainable growth and value creation for all our 
stakeholders.
ABB India’s ‘local for local’ strategy, combined 
with our efficient and sustainable portfolio, 
ADRIAN GUGGISBERG
Chairman
10
ABB India Limited  |  Integrated Annual Report 2024
positions us strongly to serve the diverse needs 
of all our market segments. This ensures that 
we offer world-class ABB technologies that are 
competitive and relevant to the Indian market. 
We have witnessed an increasing demand for 
more sophisticated and premium products 
from tier 2 and 3 cities, which are hallmarks of 
our global portfolio with local engineering. Be 
it packaged or solar pump drives, robotics pixel 
paint technology, localizations in flameproof 
or smoke venting motors or eco-efficient 
switchgears and many other such examples 
across divisions – ABB has been expanding its 
portfolio to serve customer needs in an evolving 
market condition. In the process we have also 
built and helped develop a robust value chain 
of partners and suppliers of home grown 
entrepreneurs.
We see strong potential in segments such 
as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, automotive, 
power distribution, water, electronics and 
data centers, which are expected to attract 
significant investments in the upcoming 
financial year. We will remain vigilant in 
monitoring the global geopolitical situation and 
its potential impact on the local economy.
To a bright future
As ABB India celebrates 75 years of partnership 
with this great nation, we reiterate our profound 
pride in our contributions to India’s industrial 
journey and growth story. We extend our 
sincere gratitude to our shareholders for their 
continued trust and support. We also deeply 
appreciate the dedication and hard work of the 
entire ABB India team, whose commitment is 
instrumental to our success.
Our innovations are closely aligned with India’s 
ambitious national goals and we look forward 
with enthusiasm to continuing our journey as

and more – they need to meet global demand, 
be more sustainable, efficient and manage 
transitions. To them, ‘running’ is no longer 
enough – they need to outperform. Or as we say 
at ABB, they need to ‘outrun’, leaner and cleaner.
With our leading technologies in electrification 
and automation, we help industries run at high 
performance and become more productive, 
efficient and sustainable, enabling them to 
outperform. At ABB, we call this 
‘Engineered

RISK GOVERNANCE
In ABB, Risk Management is present in many areas and is essential to allow the company 
to make risk – based decisions. As a key element of Governance in ABB Purpose, Risk 
Management is present in all levels of the organization. To perform a structured risk 
assessment focused on the risk at higher level of the organization, ABB has a structured 
Enterprise Risk Management process in place.

The proactive and strategic management of risks is an 
integral part of how we do business. Our defined risk 
management framework enables us to identify and assess 
risks early and ensures that we have appropriate responses 
to manage and mitigate their effects across all levels of 
ABB. At the same time, we seek to turn the risks we face 
into potential opportunities and strive to manage both 
risks and opportunities in a responsible way. This approach 
supports the creation and protection of value for ABB, our 
stakeholders and society.

ENTERPRISE RISK 
MANAGEMENT
The enterprise risk management 
(ERM) process is our holistic approach 
to identifying risks which could 
adversely impact the achievement 
of ABB’s strategic business 
objectives and lead to a material 
financial impact. The ERM process is 
embedded in our ABB Way operating 
model and encompasses all levels 
of our organization. It provides our 
leadership, including our Executive 
Committee and the Finance, Audit 
and Compliance Committee (FACC) 
of the Board of Directors, with a 
comprehensive overview of the most 
critical risks faced by our business.
This intelligence informs our overall 
strategy and risk discussions and 
allows us to make well-informed 
decisions to safeguard value and take 
calculated risks to create value amidst 
a dynamic societal and business 
landscape.
The ERM process relies on the 
ongoing identification, assessment, 
mitigation and monitoring of the 
most critical risks affecting ABB. Our 
detailed methodology starts with 
the identification of our strategic 
business objectives. Then, we identify 
the most critical risks which could 
prevent us from achieving these 
objectives and lead to a potential 
material financial impact in the next 
five years.
These risks are then assessed in 
terms of their potential impact, 
likelihood and speed of occurrence. 
Specific responses to address these 
risks are then planned, implemented 
and continuously monitored to ensure 
they remain effective. We strive to 
turn risks into opportunities not 
only to minimize their downsides 
but to create value for ABB and our 
stakeholders, wherever possible.

Approach
ABB India has been working towards embedding circularity across its operations, 
products and solution as well as value chain based on its commitment towards 
resource preservation as per ABB Group’s 2030 sustainability targets. Across 
its manufacturing operations, we have established a comprehensive waste 
management system with systematic 5R approach namely, refuse, reduction, 
recyclability, reuse and recovery of energy from waste.
A clear guideline is also in place to 
ensure the compliance with the 
legal requirements in terms of 
segregation, storage, transportation 
and disposal of waste. In line with the 
‘Zero Waste to Landfill’, we have taken 
various measures to enhance waste 
management system such reduction 
of Non-hazardous/hazardous 
waste generation, diverting waste 
away from landfill and disposing 
through waste to energy processes. 
Till 2024, 50% of Company’s own 
manufacturing sites have been 
certified on ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ by 
external party by achieving >99% of 
waste diversion rate at these sites.  
Beginning with the design stage, 
we are committed to increasing the 
resource efficiency of our solutions 
and to making them more durable by 
means of our lifecycle management 
services and lifetime extension 
and modernization services, thus 
supporting principles of a circular 
economy. We are working closely with 
customers, suppliers and partners 
to embed circularity throughout our 
entire value chain. By assessing the 
impact of our offerings throughout 
their complete life cycle, our product 
managers and relevant functions 
identify ways to improve circularity 
across our product portfolio. This 
process encourages cooperation and 
partnerships with key stakeholders 
across industries and sectors 
on a wide range of activities – 
from engaging with suppliers to 
source materials with a smaller 
environmental footprint or reduced 
raw material content.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
The active management of Health, Safety, 
Environment and Security (HSE&S) is a natural 
extension to our business. Our talented and 
skilled employees are our most valuable asset. 
Promoting a safe and healthy work environment 
is a fundamental responsibility of ABB. It is 
our ambition, therefore, that no person shall 
suffer injury or ill health as a direct consequence 
of ABB’s industrial undertaking and that any 
negative impacts on the economy, society and 
our environment are minimized.
This is reflected in our Group-wide HSE&S 
policy that reinforces ABB’s commitment to 
putting health, safety, the environment and 
security at the heart of our activities. This 
commitment encompasses material sourcing, 
product design, operations, services and 
includes safe and healthy working conditions, 
identifying opportunities to eliminate hazards, 
reducing risks and adverse impacts and 
applying risk control and monitoring systems.
In addition to monitoring the physical impact 
on our workforce, mental well-being is also a 
very important topic for ABB. Beside division- 
and business area-led mental well-being 
initiatives, we are providing global support 
through the Employee Assistance Program 
as well as the new meQuilibrium app, which 
is specifically aimed at strengthening the 
mental resilience of line managers. To realize 
global leadership in health, safety and well-
being in our operations, we have launched our 
Guiding Principles for Resilient Operations. 
These support our HSE&S Management System, 
which is based on internationally recognized 
standards, principles and commitments. The 
Guiding Principles combine a more human-
centric way of looking at HSE&S topics with our 
values Courage, Care, Curiosity and Collabo-
ration and have been agreed to by all divisions 
and business areas. They will form the model 
for HSE&S going forward.

further reduce health and safety hazards.
Thanks to our health and safety measures, 
we continue to see a downward trend in our 
lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) to in-
dustry-leading levels with a 2024 LTIFR of 0.5. 
In 2024, we recorded 5 work-related injuries. 
An investigation into the workplace-related 
incidents has been concluded and we have 
drawn on the lessons learned to prevent any 
future recurrence.
The following three guiding principles set a framework 
underpinned by a set of behaviors we strive to follow at every level 
of our organization to achieve our objectives:
•	 Means that leaders at 
every level create an 
environment where 
colleagues feel safe, 
cared for and are 
confident to speak up
•	 Means everyone 
collaborates and 
draws on each other’s 
knowledge and strengths 
to ensure colleagues feel 
included and encouraged 
to contribute to our 
programs and HSE&S 
performance
•	 Means everyone is 
encouraged to have the 
curiosity to learn and

antitrust topics and on behavior drivers for 
misconduct were delivered across divisions. Our 
divisions also implemented tailored integrity 
learning programs for their teams, based on 
their bespoke risk management plans.
To track potential indicators of the 
effectiveness of our integrity-related initiatives 
and assess risk, we utilize data analytics 
provided by ABB analytics dashboard. An 
Integrity Analytics Report, a live dashboard is 
available throughout ABB via an integrity web 
portal, which provides insights into integrity 
program performance. Our Investigation 
updates are also made available to the 
appropriate stakeholders as part of our risk 
assessment and management strategy. 
At ABB, we are committed to a culture of ethics 
and transparency and encourage our people 
to speak up. We offer multiple channels for 
our stakeholders to report integrity violations 
and non-compliance with our Code of 
Conduct. Confidential reporting processes are 
available for both employees and our broader 
community of stakeholders, including options 
for anonymous reporting. Our commitment to 
non-retaliation applies whenever someone has 
raised a potential integrity concern in good 
faith, including cooperation in an investigation.
ABB’s business ethics helpline permits web 
and phone reporting and is operated by an 
independent service provider, which forwards 
the report to a dedicated investigations team 
within the Legal and Integrity function at ABB. 
All reports are subject to appropriate review 
and are brought to full closure using systematic 
processes and tracking systems so that due 
process is followed across our internal in-
vestigations. An employee or stakeholder who 
files a report can follow up on the status of their 
report and continue to engage with the ABB 
investigator using a personal PIN. The helpline 
permits reporting on conduct relating to all 
aspects of the ABB Code of Conduct, including 
corruption, fraud, trade compliance, antitrust, 
data privacy, workplace behavior, human rights, 
environment, occupational health and safety 
violations, workplace violence and more.

Board’s Report
Economic and market overview
In 2024, the global economy was perceived to achieve some 
stability after the last four years, with the much-discussed 
‘soft landing’ as it remained largely resilient. The global 
economy grew by 3.2% in CY 2024 against a volatile global 
economic landscape due to persisting geopolitical tensions. 
Further to this, the advanced economies such as the US 
and China grew by 1.7% whereas, the Emerging Market and 
Developing Economies grew by 4.2 % (Source: IMF)1. There 
were positive signs such as easing inflation level from 
6.7% in CY 2023 to 5.8% in CY 20242  (Source: IMF), robust 
trade growth, improvements in real incomes and more 
accommodative monetary policy in many economies though 
at a cautious pace. This was a year in which the World 
Economic Forum discussed new paradigms of prosperity 
which combined productivity with equity and sustainability 
and ways of driving growth in an intelligent age (of AI).

on government spending. However, in the second half post 
elections, the government capital expenditure was resumed. 
This happened as the government aims to keep its fiscal 
gap under 4.9% for 2024-25, as initially targeted and plans 
to reduce it below 4.5% in the following financial year. 
During the pandemic in 2020-21, the country's fiscal gap had 
surged to 9.3%.
For FY 2024-25 as per government and multiple other 
revised projections, India’s GDP is likely to grow at 6.4%. 
According to the current estimates, it is a mixed record on 
growth projections. Investments which grew by 9% the 
fiscal before, is likely to grow by 6.4% and consumption 
which comprises 58% of the GDP is set to expand by 7.3% 
year-on-year compared to 4% in the previous fiscal year.

The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI fell to 56.4 in December 
2024, slightly down from 56.5 in November and revised 
lower from an initial estimate of 57.4. This represented 
the easing of momentum in operating conditions since 
the beginning of the year. The sector has experienced 
expansion for over three years, consistently staying above 
the 50-mark that distinguishes growth from contraction. 
However, it stayed above its long-term average of 54.1, 
indicating a strong growth rate. Both output and new 
orders, which are key indicators of demand, continued to 
increase in December although the pace of improvement 
slowed. India's manufacturing activity concluded 2024 on 
a softer note, with moderate signs of a slowing trend in 
the industrial sector. The expansion rate of new orders was 
gradual in the year, indicating potentially weaker growth in 
future production. However, there was a notable increase 
in new export orders, which grew at the fastest pace since 
July 2024. Additionally, the rise in input prices eased slightly, 
capping off a year where Indian manufacturers faced 
significant cost pressures. The capacity utilization was at 
75.8% as of September 2024. Capacity utilization in India 
rose to 75.80% in the third quarter of 2024, up from 74% in 
the second quarter. From 2008 to 2024, capacity utilization 
in India averaged 73.44%, peaking at an all-time high of 
83.20% in the first quarter of 2011 and hitting a record low 
of 47.30%in the second quarter of 2020.
The rupee fell by 2.8% in 2024, closing the year at 85.6150 
per US dollar. Despite this decline, it performed better than 
many of its Asian counterparts, which saw drops ranging 
from 3% to 12% due to the strong dollar and fluctuating 
expectations regarding US policy rates. Despite the rupee's 
challenges over the past three months, it remains the least 
volatile major Asian currency, excluding the pegged Hong 
Kong dollar. This stability is largely attributed to the central 
bank’s regular two-sided interventions. 
The Indian bourses on the other hand witnessed major 
domestic retail investor resilience in the face of FII outflows, 
this performance made India rank third globally among 
the top 15 major markets in both percentage terms and 
absolute gains. By the end of the year, India is poised to 
secure its position as the world’s fifth-largest market by 
capitalization. The interest in small and mid-cap stocks 
with tailwinds in renewable, digital transformation and 
infrastructure, have contributed to the growth story. India’s 
foreign direct investment (FDI) peaked at a multi-decade 
high to reach USD 1 trillion since 2020. During the January-
September period this year, foreign direct investment (FDI) 
into the country increased by approximately 42%, reaching 
USD 42.13 billion. In comparison, the inflow was USD 29.73 
billion during the same period last year.
Sustainability remained a key focus area in 2024, with non-
fossil fuel-based energy making up 45% of the total energy 
mix of the country.  The country is therefore projected to 
be on track to make it 50% by 2030. India has successfully 
reduced its emissions intensity by 40% compared to 2005 
levels, demonstrating significant progress towards its 
NDC target of a 45% reduction by 2030. In 2024, a record-
breaking 24.5 GW of solar capacity and 3.4 GW of wind 
capacity were added. This represents more than double the 
solar installations and a 21% increase in wind installations 
compared to 2023.
With more than 75 years of manufacturing history in the 
country, a deep service footprint and an expanding portfolio, 
your company is maximally optimizing the country’s pockets 
of growth complemented by an improving, albeit uncertain 
global weather. Your company’s ‘local for local’ strategy 
and the development of a strong, diversified supply chain 
across the country-supported by capable partners near 
its manufacturing locations-enhance its resilience against 
trade and tariff-related uncertainties to a significant extent.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Outlook
As per the world economic outlook by IMF, the outlook 
for the global economy remains positive as the global 
GDP is anticipated to increase by 3.3% in CY 2025. In 
addition to this, the emerging market and developing 
economies are anticipated to grow by 4.3% whereas, 
the advanced economies will grow by 1.9% in CY 2025. 
This growth in the global economies is anticipated to 
be supported by growth in economic activities due to a 
decline in the global inflation level. 
In addition to this, the Indian economy is anticipated 
to retain its position as the fastest-growing major 
economy in FY 2025-26. The tax relief initiated in the 
Union Budget 2025-26 is expected to play a significant 
role in shaping the economic growth especially by 
increasing the household consumption. Additionally, 
the capital expenditure is anticipated to increase to 
4.3% in comparison to 4.1% thereby, creating a limited 
multiplier effectin enhancing the productivity and 
growth in the Indian economy (Source: Press Information 
Bureau of India).

uncertain landscape, ABB India’s diverse portfolio across 
these 23 market segments, each with its own cyclical growth 
patterns, has helped mitigate risks and provided the agility 
to seize opportunities as they arise. 
Evaluations suggest that the moderation in GDP growth 
indicates a gradual normalization of the economy’s growth 
trajectory, following the unusual contraction during the 
pandemic. This gradual easing in growth can be seen from 
8.6% to 7.8%, then to 6.7%, and finally at 6.5% in 2024. 
The tailwinds of back-end fiscal spending and improving 
credit growth by stimulating measures in 2024 is expected 
to continue at least for the first half of 2025 including 
government spending, services sector growth, rural demand 
and traction in high end or value-added manufacturing 
exports. The diverse portfolio offerings from ABB India 
is well placed to serve segments which are projected to 
receive investments in 2025 namely renewables, technology

revival and the capital absorption capacity with multiplier 
effect from the infrastructure investments during the year. 
A recent survey by the central bank of the country – Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI)-highlighted seven key risk areas to 
India’s financial stability, including geopolitical conflicts, 
global inflation, capital outflows, trade tariffs, domestic 
growth slowdowns, climate risks and cybersecurity threats. 
These soft patches are likely to combine with positives like 
growth in services, the government spending and monetary 
easing by mid-year, MSME recovery – where more data is 
required but a Periodic Labor Force Survey numbers show 
an improvement in salaried employment, which could be 
partly due to increasing non-casual jobs with MSMEs. The 
increasing participation of women in the labor force is also 
another positive.
The RBI has projected that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
inflation, which measures the cost of living for consumers, 
for FY 2024-25 at 4.8% with the fourth quarter (January to 
March) estimates at 4.4%. Assuming a normal monsoon 
next year, the CPI inflation for FY 2025-26 is projected at 
The external approach was complemented by aligned 
internal strategies across different divisions. Following the 
ABB Way, each division implemented tailored strategies to 
navigate specific segments and customer needs. 
At the same time, common strategic pillars such as digital 
offerings with ABB Ability, channel management and 
expansion, value-based selling, service enhancements, 
localization and innovation helped deepen ABB’s footprint.
Some divisions opted for integrated solutions for specific 
segments, while others prioritized account management, 
consultant and partner engagement and OEM collaborations. 
In addition, efforts were directed towards expanding 
outreach in Tier II and Tier III cities, while others focused 
on optimizing and showcasing sustainability and energy 
efficiency initiatives across all stakeholders

Your company will be keeping a close watch on the impact 
of global tariff changes on supply chains, import prices 
and currency volatility among other factors. It remains to 
be seen how the impended boost to consumption with tax 
cuts in the budget, rationalization of capital expenditure 
and infra spending, keeping it at similar levels as FY 2024-25, 
the Central Bank’s repo rate cut after 2020, easing up the 
cash reserve ratio – stack up for the medium to long term for 
the industries.
Business areas
To enable ABB India to deliver on its purpose and create 
value for its stakeholders, it builds on a decentralized 
operating model. Your company’s 18 divisions are organized 
into four business areas: Electrification, Motion, Process

Summarized performance
Segment outlook 
In 2025, the business foresees initial challenges in discrete 
industries but remains optimistic about a recovery fueled by 
improving pricing and growing demand. Cement is expected 
to remain steady, with renewables being a key focus. 
ABB’s acquisition of Siemens Gamesa's power electronics 
business will bolster its presence in the renewables sector. 
Drive Products will focus on Bio CNG growth, while System 
Drives advances a green hydrogen prototype for electrolyzer 
applications in O&G. The focus on water and conventional 
power will continue, while government investments in 
metros, high-speed rail, tunneling and infrastructure is 
expected to generate continued opportunities for growth. 
With innovation, sustainability and strategic strength, the 
Motion business is well-poised for growth in renewables, 
infrastructure and green hydrogen.
Segment performance
The year for the performance of Process Automation 
divisions was a combination of various factors. Some 
trends and sectors augured well for the business including 
the focus on pharma, chemicals, energy transition to gas-
based economy, metals and mining, EV battery and green 
hydrogen. The year also witnessed a robust performance for 
Measurement and Analytics with lot of impetus coming from

Robotics and Discrete Automation
Summarized performance
Segment outlook
The geopolitical uncertainties and its impact on energy 
markets and supply chains, cyclical nature of commodities 
and projects and only operational expenditure and R&M 
opportunities in sectors like thermal are some of the 
headwinds which could be at play. Continued investments in 
Petrochemicals from Government and Private players with 
a view to decarbonize and digitalize assets and operations 
is one of the tailwinds. The government’s focus on energy 
security, energy transition and clean technology with 
digitalization is expected to add buoyancy to opportunities. 
Specific areas like green hydrogen and ethanol blending 
solutions are expected to provide opportunities. Investments 
in infrastructure is expected to give boost to Metal and Steel 
industry in 2025. Project announcements related to Biogas, 
batteries and Silicon chip production shall be interesting 
space to watch. 
Segment performance
Along with productivity and quality factors, increasing 
customer demand for flexible automation solutions fueled 
continuous growth for Robotics business. Automotive 
segment accounted for major share of the business; 
however, significant activities were observed in electronics, 
food and beverages and service industries. Customers also 
continued to invest in value added services for productivity 
enhancements and production uptime. 
Major orders booked during the year -
	• Automation of painting process by major Auto OEM.
	• Investment of automation solutions by Electronics 
Customer.
	• Indirect channel involving system integrators contributed 
to order growth.
Segment outlook
Automotive demand will continue to remain strong with the 
ongoing transition to electric vehicles, thereby providing an 
additional avenue for growth. Food and Beverage, Consumer 
goods and Electronics segments are showing strong signs 
of growth. Manufacturing activity in metals, logistics and 
warehouse, chemical and plastics segment are expected 
to remain stable. There is also significant interest from 
educational universities for robotics lab and training center 
to have formal training on advanced robotics technologies.

10. 	 Health and safety management system: 
	
a. 	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, what is the coverage of such a system? 
	
	
Yes, ABB has implemented a comprehensive occupational health and safety management system. Over the year, 
the company worked to simplify the standards within this set of documents, referred to internally as “The ABB Way 
for HSE and Security Management System” so that they could be quickly and easily consulted by our employees 
and contractors. ABB is committed to achieving excellence in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) through both 
strategic, group-led programs and business specific initiatives based on internationally recognized standards, 
principles and commitments. The ABB Way Health Safety Environment & Security (HSE&S) management system 
is consistent with ISO standards ISO 14001/ ISO 45001/ISO 50001.  ABB's Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) 
management system is comprehensive and integrated into all aspects of their business.
	
	
Company has a clear HSE policy that outlines their commitment to providing safe and healthy working conditions, 
preventing incidents and work-related illnesses, and protecting the environment. The governance structure of 
ABB ensures that these policies are regularly updated and aligned with their strategic direction. Risk assessment 
is conducted with thorough planning and risk analysis to identify opportunities to eliminate hazards and reduce 
risks. ABB also emphasizes the importance of competence, communication, and support and provides training and 
information to ensure good participation and consultation among employees, promoting a culture of safety and 
awareness. Specific risk controls are implemented at company to manage changes and ensure safe operations which

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
At ABB, HSE & Security Risks Management is taken very seriously with the aim to reduce risks to the lowest practicable 
level and, where possible, eliminate those risks. The risk management process which is being implemented in ABB 
for HSE & Security focusses on the process Improvement, enhanced efficiency, quality & performance improvement 
and accountability. The company has established robust processes used to identify work-related hazards and 
assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis. 
	
	
In case of routine activities, Activity-Based Risk Assessment (ABRA) used for assessing the risks of every activity 
which is being performed by ABB. The purpose of ABRA is not just to identify risks and eliminate or reduce the risks 
to tolerable levels but to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the activity also. The ABRA process involves 3 
key parties: 
	
	
1.	
Risk Assessor are the trained individuals who are responsible for leading the risk assessment teams through 
the process and recording the findings on internal portal
	
	
2.	
Risk Assessment Teams are consisting of people who have situational knowledge and task awareness about 
the activity being assessed, these are typically the workers, managers and other specialists
	
	
3.	
Risk Owners are the individuals who are responsible for the activities which are being as-sessed. They are 
often the managers and supervisors who are responsible for assigning the workers’ tasks. They are required to 
accept the risk assessment and ensure the controls are suitable and then communicate the risks and controls 
to the workers whereas, Stop Take 5 is the risk assessment process that is carried out just before any activity 
is undertaken at ABB. This process is also considered to be a ‘Last Minute Risk Assessment’, ‘Dynamic Risk 
Assessment’, or ‘On the Job Risk Assessment’. 
	
	
	
Even though every activity undertaken in ABB is controlled by an Activity Based Risk Assessment (ABRA); the 
ABRA is often undertaken hours, days, months, or maybe years before the actual activity is undertaken. The 
Stop Take 5 addresses the things that can change or be different just before (or even during) the activity starts.
	
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks.
	
	
	
Yes
	
	
d. 	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?

transparent action to remediate in a fair and equitable manner in line with the UNGPs. If ABB finds impacts directly linked

Notes: 
Energy and water for leased offices: There were 26 leased offices during the reporting year. The electricity consumption for 16 leased offices 
is estimated as 1000 kWh per person per year multiplied by number of head-count in the office. Accordingly, the I-REC are purchased for the 
entire population. The data attributable to leased vehicle to employee is not part of disclosure as it is not possible to monitor exact fuel 
consumption. However, the GHG emissions are estimated based of assumed vehicle km usage. Water consumption- For all leased offices, 
the CGWA estimate of 45 lit/person/day multiplied by the number of working days is applied to report water withdrawal. Same withdrawal 
quantity is taken as water discharge after the primary treatment (septic tank) for all leased offices (except 7 nos. of offices which are zero 
discharge). 
Waste: The data of total waste recovered through recycling, re-using or other recovery operations or total waste disposed by nature of 
disposal method could be assessed based on interviews and sample records as presented during the onsite visit. The waste quantification 
for the leased offices is calculated based on specific waste generation based on headcount derived from Faridabad office data.  
The reporting boundaries includes 07 manufacturing facilities, 01 Corporate Office and 27 offices. The boundary includes Manufacturing 
facility at Peenya (Bangalore), Nelamangala (Bangalore), Faridabad, Vadodara, Nashik (Plant 1, 2 and 3). Set of on-site and remote

Our Responsibility 
TUVI's responsibility in relation to this engagement is to perform a reasonable level of assurance and to express a conclusion based on the 
work performed. Our engagement did not include an assessment of the adequacy or the effectiveness of ABB's strategy, management of 
ESG-related issues or the sufficiency of the Report against BRSR reporting principles, other than those mentioned in the scope of the 
assurance. TUVI's responsibility regarding this verification is in reference to the agreed scope of work, which includes assurance of non-
financial quantitative and qualitative information (09 attributes as per Annexure I - Format of BRSR Core) disclosed by ABB. Reporting Organization 
is responsible for archiving the related data for a reasonable time period. The intended users of this assurance statement are the

by ABB are complete and true. 
Verification Methodology 
During the assurance engagement, TUVI adopted a risk-based approach, focusing on verification efforts with respect to disclosures. TUVI 
has verified the disclosures and assessed the robustness of the underlying data management system, information flows, and controls. In 
doing so:  
a) 
TUVI examined and reviewed the documents, data, and other information made available by ABB for non-financial 09 attributes as per 
Annexure I - Format of BRSR Core (non-financial disclosures) 
b)

Opportunities for Improvement 
The following are the opportunities for improvement reported to ABB. However, they are generally consistent with ABB management's 
objectives and programs. ABB already identified below topics and Assurance team endorse the same to achieve the Sustainable Goals of 
organization. 
i. 
ABB can develop the SOP for reporting the 09 CORE attributes 
ii. 
ABB may conduct the formal internal audit procedure for verifying BRSR data on periodic basis 
iii.

systems — Requirements  
Conflict of Interest 
In the context of BRSR requirements set by SEBI, addressing conflict of interest is crucial to maintain high integrity and independence of 
assurance engagements. As per SEBI guidelines, assurance providers need to disclose any potential conflict of interest that could 
compromise the independence or neutrality of their assessments. TUVI diligently identifies any relationships, affiliations, or financial 
interests that could potentially cause conflict of interest. We proactively implement measures to mitigate or manage these conflicts, 
ensuring independence and impartiality in our assurance engagements. We provide clear and transparent disclosures about any identified 
conflicts of interest in our assurance statement. We recognize that failure to address conflict of interest adequately could undermine the 
creditability of the assurance process and the reliability of the reported information. Therefore, we strictly adhere to SEBI guidelines and 
take necessary measures to avoid, disclose, or mitigate conflicts of interest effectively. 
Our Conclusion 
In our opinion, based on the scope of this assurance engagement, the disclosures on BRSR Core KPI described in the BRSR report along with 
the referenced information provides a fair representation of the 9 attributes, and meets the general content and quality requirements of 
the BRSR. TUVI confirms its competency to conduct the assurance engagement for the BRSR as per SEBI guidelines. Our team possesses 
expertise in ESG verification, assurance methodologies, and regulatory frameworks. We ensure independence, employ robust

Independent Auditor’s Report
To 
The Members of 
ABB India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of ABB India 
Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the balance 
sheet as at 31 December 2024, and the statement of 
profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), 
statement of changes in equity and statement of cash 
flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial 
statements, including material accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs 
of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and its profit and 
other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its cash 
flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are independent of 
the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion on the financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue from fixed price contracts using percentage of completion method
See Note 2.3(a) and 2.6 to the financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue from fixed price contracts are recognized in 
accordance with Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, and as detailed in note 2.3(a) and 2.6 of the 
“material accounting policies” in the financial statements.
There are key judgments and estimates involved in the 
recognition of revenue relating to fixed price contracts on a 
percentage of completion method, which includes:
•	 Estimation of total contract costs and remaining costs 
to completion, which is a critical factor in measuring 
the progress of a contract and amounts of revenue to be 
recognized;
In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:
•	 We 
assessed 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
revenue 
recognition accounting policies by comparing with 
applicable accounting standards.
•	 We understood the process of revenue recognition of fixed 
price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
and tested key internal controls (both design and operating 
effectiveness) with respect to revenue recognition of such 
contracts on random sample basis.

Financial Statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
•	 Evaluation of risks arising from operational delays, contract 
terms, changes in estimations, technical, legal, external 
environment, etc. This requires the Company to estimate 
costs to capture such risks, including liquidated damages 
and warranties.
In view of the above and given the Company and its 
stakeholders focus on revenue as a key performance indicator, 
we determined this to be a key audit matter.
•	 We performed substantive testing on the statistically 
selected samples of revenue transactions recorded during 
the year by verifying the underlying evidences such as 
contracts and approvals.
•	 We 
evaluated 
management’s 
estimates 
over 
contract costs by performing analytical procedures 
on such estimates and discussed with designated 
management personnel.
•	 We performed a retrospective review for contracts 
completed during the current year by comparing the 
final outcome of the contracts with previous estimates 
made for those contracts to assess the reliability of the 
management’s estimation process.
•	 We tested provision for onerous contracts on statistically 
selected samples.
•	 We performed tests on whether actual costs have 
been accrued in the correct period, by testing the 
underlying 
documents 
for 
samples 
selected 
using 
statistical sampling
•	 We have verified the related disclosures in financial 
statements as required by relevant accounting standards.
Recoverability of trade receivables
See Note 2.3(c) and 2.12(a) to the financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Trade receivables, including retention money with customers, 
forms a significant part of the financial statements. 
Management’s 
assessment 
of 
recoverability 
of 
trade 
receivables, involves critical evaluation of all factors impacting 
recoverability, including impact of external environment such 
as capability of customers to pay.
Management makes an impairment allowance for trade 
receivables on the basis of its assessment of recoverability of 
specific customers and on the basis of expected credit loss 
model for the remaining customers in accordance with Ind AS 
109, Financial Instruments. For the purposes of impairment 
assessment, significant judgements and assumptions are 
made, including assessing credit risk, timing and amount of 
realization, etc.
In view of above, we determined this to be a key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:
•	 We 
obtained 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
processes 
implemented by management to estimate impairment 
provision against trade receivables.
•	 We tested key controls (both design and operating 
effectiveness) over management’s estimate of impairment 
loss on a random sample basis.
•	 We obtained and tested the appropriateness of relevant 
data elements used by the Management to prepare ageing 
of trade receivables on a random sample basis.
•	 We 
obtained, 
discussed 
and 
tested 
management 
assessment 
of 
impairment 
for 
specific 
customers 
on statistically selected samples and discussed with 
designated management personnel.
•	 We evaluated the appropriateness of impairment model 
used by management to estimate the expected credit 
loss and tested the reasonability of related assumptions 
(including 
involvement 
of 
internal 
subject 
matter 
experts). We have verified the mathematical accuracy 
of computations.
•	 We corroborated management’s estimates on the basis of 
past trends. We have also corroborated the forward looking 
assumptions used by the Management with independent 
and external market data.

Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the annual report, 
but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s 
report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made 
available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the 
applicable laws and regulations.
Management's 
and 
Board 
of 
Directors' 
Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these financial statements 
that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ 
loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity 
and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Management 
and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board 
of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
 
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparation of financial statements and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
203
Financial Statements
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.

Financial Statements
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the financial statements of  
ABB India Limited for the year ended 31 December 2024
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid financial statements under Clause (i) of  
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report  
of even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of ABB India Limited (“the 
Company”) as of 31 December 2024 in conjunction with our 
audit of the financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements and such internal financial controls 
were operating effectively as at 31 December 2024, based 
on the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s 
and 
Board 
of 
Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and 
the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 
Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements were established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
212
ABB India Limited  |  Integrated Annual Report 2024
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

Financial Statements
1	
Corporate Information
	
ABB India Limited (‘the Company’) has served utility 
and industry customers for over seven decades with 
the complete range of engineering, products, solutions 
and services in areas of Automation and Power 
technology. The Company has extensive installed base 
for manufacturing and a countrywide marketing and 
service presence. Besides catering to Indian domestic 
market, the Company is also playing an increasing role 
in the global market.
	
The Company is a public limited company domiciled 
in India and incorporated under the provisions of the 
Indian Companies Act. The registered office is located 
at Bengaluru. Its shares are listed on Bombay Stock 
Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE).
	
The financial statements are approved for issue by the 
Company’s Board of Directors on February 17, 2025.
2	
Material accounting policies
2.1	 Basis of preparation of financial statements
	
A	
Statement of compliance
	
	
These financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 are prepared in accordance 
with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to 
time notified under section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 ('Act'). 
	
B	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
The financial statements are presented in INR in 
Crores, rounded off to two decimal places, except 
when otherwise indicated.
	
C	
Basis of measurement
	
	
The financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost convention and on an accrual basis 
of accounting, except for the following assets and 
liabilities which have been measured at fair value:
 
• Derivative financial instruments
 
• Fair value of plan assets less present value of 
defined benefit obligations.
	
	
Historical cost is generally based on the fair 
value of the consideration given in exchange for 
goods and services.
2.2	 Use of estimates
	
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS requires management to make estimates, 
judgments 
and 
assumptions. 
These 
estimates, 
judgments and assumptions affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the period. Application of accounting policies that 
require critical accounting estimates involving complex 
and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions 
in these financial statements have been disclosed in 
Note 2.3. Accounting estimates could change from 
period to period. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are 
made as management becomes aware of changes in 
circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in 
estimates are reflected in the financial statements in 
the period in which changes are made and, if material, 
their effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial 
statements. Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
2.3	 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
	
a.	
Project revenue and costs (refer note 2.6)
	
	
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion 
method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. 
Use of the percentage-of-completion method 
requires the Company to estimate the costs 
expended to date as a proportion of the total 
costs to be expended. Costs expended have been 
used to measure progress towards completion as 
there is a direct relationship between input and 
productivity. Provisions for estimated losses, if 
any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in 
the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the expected contract estimates at the 
reporting date.
218
ABB India Limited  |  Integrated Annual Report 2024
b.	
Provision for litigations and contingencies 
(refer note 2.14)
	
	
The Company estimates the provisions that have 
present obligations as a result of past events and it is 
probable that outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed 
at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted 
to reflect the current best estimates. The Company 
uses significant judgements to assess contingent 
liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed only 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control 
of the Company or a present obligation that arises 
from past events where it is either not probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot 
be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised 
nor disclosed in the financial statements.
c.	
Expected credit losses on trade receivables [refer 
note 2.12(a)]
	
	
The expected credit loss provision on trade 
receivables are based on assumptions about 
risk of default and expected timing of collection. 
The Company uses judgment in making these 
assumptions and selecting the inputs to the 
expected credit loss calculation based on the 
Company’s history of collections, customer’s 
creditworthiness and market conditions at the 
end of each reporting period.
	
d.	
Provision for warranties (refer note 2.14)
	
	
The Company provides warranties for general 
repairs of defects as per contract. Provisions 
related to these assurance-type warranties are 
recognized when the product is sold, or the service 
is provided to the customer. Initial recognition is 
based on historical experience. The initial estimate 
of warranty-related costs is revised annually.
2.4	 Current versus non-current classification
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in 
the balance sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:
 
• Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
 
• 	Held primarily for the purpose of trading
 
• 	Expected to be realised within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or
 
• 	Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period.
 
• 	All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or 
non- current as per the Company’s operating cycle and 
other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies 
Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products and the 
time between the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realization in cash and cash equivalents, the 
Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 
months for the purpose of current and non- current 
classification of assets and liabilities, except for projects 
business. The projects business comprises long-term 
contracts which have an operating cycle exceeding one 
year. For classification of current assets and liabilities 
related to projects business, the Company uses the 
duration of the individual life cycle of the contract as its 
operating cycle.
	
A liability is current when:
 
•  It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
 
•  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading.
 
•  It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or 
 
• 	There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
 
• 	The 
Company 
classifies 
all 
other 
liabilities 
as non-current.
 
• Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents.
219
Financial Statements
2.5	 Foreign Currency
	
Functional currency
	
The functional currency of the company is the 
Indian Rupee.
	
Transactions and translations
	
Initial 
recognition 
transactions 
in 
foreign 
currencies are recorded by the Company at their 
respective functional currency spot rates at the 
date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. The 
gains or losses resulting from such translations are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured at 
fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent 
at the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured at 
historical cost are translated at the exchange rate 
prevalent at the date of the transaction.
	
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement 
of foreign currency transactions are included in 
determining net profit for the period in which the 
transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash flow 
items denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into the relevant functional currencies using the 
exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.
2.6	 Revenue Recognition 
	
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation 
is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration) allocated to that performance 
obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and 
services rendered is net of variable consideration on 
account of various discounts and schemes offered by 
the Company as part of the contract. Revenue is stated 
exclusive of goods and service tax and net of returns and 
trade and quantity discounts.
	
Revenue from sale of products is recognised on transfer 
of control of the products to the customers, which is 
usually on delivery of goods to the customer or as per 
contractual terms with the customer, when the risk and 
reward of ownership is transferred to the customer.
	
Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized on 
the percentage of completion method, in proportion 
that the contract costs incurred for work performed 
up to the reporting date bear to the estimated total 
contract costs. Contract revenue earned in excess 
of billing has been reflected under “Other current 
assets” and billing in excess of contract revenue has 
been reflected under “Other current liabilities” in the 
balance sheet. Full provision is made for any loss in the 
year in which it is first foreseen. Liquidated damages 
/ penalties are provided for as per the contract terms 
wherever there is a delayed delivery attributable 
to the Company.
	
Revenue from services is recognised as per the terms 
of the contract with the customer using the percentage 
of completion method, in proportion that the costs 
incurred for work performed up to the reporting date 
bear to the estimated total costs.
	
Revenue from the development services are recognised 
on a cost plus basis and billed in accordance with the 
terms of arrangement with the customer.
	
Commission income is recognised as and when the 
terms of the contract are fulfilled.
	
Interest income is recognised on time proportion basis, 
based on the underlying interest rates.
	
Contract modifications are accounted for when 
additions, deletions or changes are approved either to 
the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for 
modifications of contracts involves assessing whether 
the services added to an existing contract are distinct 
and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling 
price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted 
for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those are 
distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a 
separate contract, if the additional services are priced 
at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of 
the existing contract and creation of a new contract if 
not priced at the standalone selling price.
2.7	 Income Taxes
	
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred 
income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net 
220
ABB India Limited  |  Integrated Annual Report 2024
profit in the statement of profit and loss except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognized directly 
in equity, or in other comprehensive income. Current 
income tax for current and prior periods is recognized 
at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from 
the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws 
that have been enacted. 
	
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for all temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred 
tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred income 
tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates 
and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those 
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or 
settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income 
or expense in the period that includes the enactment or 
the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax 
asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and tax losses can 
be utilized. The Company offsets tax assets and tax 
liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the recognized amounts and where it intends either 
to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
2.8	 Property, plant and equipment 
	
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment 
shall be recognised as an asset if, and only if it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably.
	
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing 
part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs 
for long-term construction projects if the recognition 
criteria are met. When significant parts of property, 
plant and equipment are required to be replaced at 
intervals, the Company depreciates them separately 
based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a 
major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in 
the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
	
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised 
in statement of profit or loss as incurred. The 
Company identifies and determines cost of each 
component/ part of Property, plant and equipment 
separately, if the component/ part has a cost which 
is significant to the total cost of the Property, 
plant and equipment and has useful life that is 
materially different from that of the remaining asset. 
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment outstanding at each balance 
sheet date is classified as capital advances under other 
non-current assets and cost of assets not ready for use 
at the balance sheet date are disclosed under capital 
work- in- progress.
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment as at 
January 1, 2016, the Company's date of transition to Ind 
AS, was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as 
at the date of transition to Ind AS.
	
The 
Company 
depreciates 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment over their estimated useful life either 
using the straight-line method as per the Schedule 
II of Companies Act, 2013 or based on the technical 
evaluation, where management believes that the 
estimated useful life of the asset is different from 
those mentioned in Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013. 
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
	
Useful lives estimated by the management in years: 
•	 Leasehold improvements
Shorter of over the period 
of lease or useful life
•	 Factory buildings
15-30
•	 Other buildings
3-60
•	 Furniture and fixtures
10
•	 Office equipments
3-5
•	 Plant and equipment
6-21
•	 Vehicles
5
•	 Freehold land is not depreciated
	
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed periodically, including at each 
financial year end.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognised is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses 
arising from de-recognition of an property, plant and 
equipment are measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
221
Financial Statements
property, plant and equipment are recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss when the property, plant 
and equipment is derecognized.	
2.9	 Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured 
on initial recognition at cost. Following initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, 
excluding capitalised development costs, are not 
capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in 
the statement of profit and loss in the period in which 
the expenditure is incurred. The estimated useful life of 
assets in years are as follows:
•	 Technical know-how fees
3-10
•	 Capitalized software costs
3-5
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as 
either finite or indefinite.
	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over 
the useful economic life on a straight line method 
and assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite 
lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful 
life recognized on business combination are tested for 
impairment at least annually and when events occur or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable 
amount of an asset or cash generating unit to which 
the assets pertains is less than the carrying value.
	
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss when the asset is derecognised.
2.10	Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed 
in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs 
consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing 
cost also includes exchange differences to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
2.11	Inventories
	
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.  The comparison of cost 
and net realisable value is made on an item-by-item 
basis. The cost of various categories of inventories is 
arrived at as follows:
	
Stores, spares, raw materials, components and traded 
goods - at rates determined on the moving weighted 
average method.
	
Goods in Transit – at actual cost.
	
Work-in-progress 
and 
finished 
goods 
- 
at 
full 
absorption 
cost 
method 
which 
includes 
direct 
materials, direct labour and manufacturing overheads. 
Cost is determined on weighted average method. 
Work-in-progress are not written down below cost if 
the finished product in which they will be incorporated 
is expected to be sold above cost.
	
Provision for obsolescence is made wherever necessary.
2.12	Impairment
	
a	
Financial assets (other than at fair value)
	
	
Ind As 109 (“”Financial instruments””) requires 
expected credit losses to be measured through 
a loss allowance. The Company recognises 
loss allowances for Expected Credit Loss on 
financial assets measured at amortised cost; 
debt investments measured at fair value through 
other 
comprehensive 
income 
(FVOCI) 
and 
contract assets.
222
ABB India Limited  |  Integrated Annual Report 2024
	
	
The Company recognises lifetime expected losses 
for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables 
that do not constitute a financing transaction. For 
all other financial assets, expected credit losses 
are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month 
expected credit losses or at an amount equal to 
the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk 
on the financial asset has increased significantly 
since initial recognition. The Company assesses 
at each date of balance sheet whether a financial 
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. 
The impairment provisions for financial assets 
are based on evaluation of the risk of default over 
the expected life of the receivables and expected 
timing of collection. The Company uses judgment 
in making these assumptions and selecting the 
inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the 
Company’s past history of collections, customer’s 
credit-worthiness, existing market conditions as 
well as forward looking estimates at the end of 
each reporting period.
	
b	
Non-financial assets
	
Intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment
	
	
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, 
whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable 
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or 
groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is considered impaired and is written down to 
its recoverable amount.
	
	
Intangible 
assets 
and 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment 
are 
evaluated 
for 
recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may not 
be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) 
is determined on an individual asset basis unless 
the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets. In 
such cases, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the CGU to which the asset belongs.
	
	
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the 
impairment to be recognized in the statement 
of profit and loss is measured by the amount by 
which the carrying value of the assets exceeds 
the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. 
An impairment loss is reversed in the statement 
of profit and loss if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. The carrying amount of the asset is 
increased to its revised recoverable amount, 
provided that this amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been 
determined (net of any accumulated amortization 
or depreciation) had no impairment loss been 
recognized for the asset in prior years.
2.13	Cash flow statement
	
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of 
the Company are segregated.
2.14	Provisions, contingent liability and assets 
	
General
	
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation. If the effect of time value of money is 
material, Provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the liability.
	
Warranty provisions
	
Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognised 
when the product or services are sold to the customer. 
Initial recognition is based on historical experience. 
The initial estimate of warranty-related costs are 
revised annually.
223
Financial Statements
	
Contingent liability
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the 
Company or a present obligation that is not recognized 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there 
is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize 
a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the 
financial statements.
	
Contingent assets
	
Contingent assets are not recognised or disclosed 
in financial statements since this may result in the 
recognition of income that may never be realised. 
However, when the realisation of income is virtually 
certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset 
and is recognised.
	
Onerous contracts
	
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts 
are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous 
contract is considered to exist where the Company has 
a contract under which the unavoidable costs (full cost 
basis) of meeting the obligations under the contract 
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received 
from the contract.
2.15	Financial instruments
	
2.15.1 Initial recognition
	
	
The Company recognizes financial assets and 
financial liabilities when it becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
All financial assets and liabilities are recognized 
at fair value on initial recognition, except for 
trade receivables which are initially measured 
at transaction price. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets and financial liabilities, that are 
not at fair value through profit or loss, are added 
to the fair value on initial recognition.
	
2.15.2 Classification and subsequent measurement
	
	
Classification
	
	
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified 
as measured at amortised cost; FVOCI - debt 
investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or  fair 
value through profit and loss (FVTPL).
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their initial recognition unless the Company 
changes its business model for managing 
financial assets, in which case all affected financial 
assets are reclassified on the first day of the first 
reporting period following the change in the 
business model.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
a.	
Non-derivative financial instruments 
	
	
	
(i)	
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
	
	
	
	
A 
financial 
asset 
is 
subsequently 
measured at amortised cost if it is 
held within a business where the 
objective is to hold the asset in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and 
the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding. Any gain/loss 
on de-recognition is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
(ii)	 Financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income
	
	
	
	
A 
financial 
asset 
is 
subsequently 
measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if it is held 
within a business where the objective is 
achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling financial assets 
and the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding. The Company 
224
ABB India Limited  |  Integrated Annual Report 2024
has made an irrevocable election for 
its investments which are classified 
as equity instruments to present the 
subsequent changes in fair value in other 
comprehensive income based on its 
business model. Further, in cases where 
the Company has made an irrevocable 
election based on its business model, 
for its investments which are classified 
as equity instruments, the subsequent 
changes in fair value are recognized in 
other comprehensive income.
(iii)	 Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
	
	
A financial asset which is not classified 
in any of the above categories are 
subsequently 
fair 
valued 
through 
profit or loss.
	
	
	
(iv)	 Financial liabilities
	
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently 
carried at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method. For trade 
and other payables maturing within 
one year from the balance sheet date, 
the 
carrying 
amounts 
approximate 
fair value due to the short maturity of 
these instruments.
	
	
	
(v)	 Derecognition
	
	
	
	
A 
financial 
asset 
is 
primarily 
derecognised when:
 
• 	The rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset have expired, or
 
• The Company has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party 
under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; 
and either (a) the Company has 
transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	 A financial liability (or a part of a 
financial liability) is derecognized from 
the Company’s Balance Sheet when the 
obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
	
	
b.	
Derivative financial instruments
	
	
	
The company holds derivative financial 
instruments 
such 
as 
foreign 
exchange 
forward and option contracts to mitigate the 
risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign 
currency 
exposures. 
The 
counterparty 
for these contracts is generally a bank. 
Commodity risk is mitigated by entering into 
future contracts to hedge against fluctuation 
in commodity prices.
	
Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair 
value through profit or loss
	
	
	
This 
category 
has 
derivative 
financial 
assets 
or 
liabilities 
which 
are 
not 
designated as hedges.
	
	
	
Although the company believes that these 
derivatives 
constitute 
hedges 
from 
an 
economic perspective, they may not qualify 
for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, 
Financial Instruments. Any derivative that 
is either not designated a hedge, or is so 
designated but is ineffective as per Ind 
AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset 
or financial liability, at fair value through 
profit or loss.
	
	
	
Derivatives 
not 
designated 
as 
hedges 
are recognized initially at fair value and 
attributable transaction costs are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss. when 
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
these derivatives are measured at fair value 
through profit or loss and the resulting 
exchange gains or losses are included in other 
income/expenses. Assets/liabilities in this 
category are presented as current assets/
current liabilities if they are either held for 
trading or are expected to be realized within 
12 months after the balance sheet date.
225
Financial Statements
	
	
	
Certain commercial contracts may grant rights 
to the Company or the counterparties, or 
contain other provisions that are considered 
to be derivatives. Such embedded derivatives 
are assessed at inception of the contract and 
depending on their characteristics, accounted 
for as separate derivative instruments and 
shown at their fair value in the balance sheet 
with changes in their fair value recognized 
through profit or loss.
2.16	Offsetting financial instruments
	
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net 
amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
2.17	 Fair value of financial instruments
	
Fair value hierarchy:
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is directly or indirectly observable
	
Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
2.18	Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing 
the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period. The Company 
has no potentially dilutive equity shares.
2.19	Employee benefits
	
2.19.1 Gratuity & Provident Fund - Defined benefit plans
	
	
The present value of the obligation under defined 
benefit plans are determined based on actuarial 
valuation using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
In case of funded plans, the fair value of the 
plan assets is reduced from the gross obligation 
under the defined benefit plans to recognize the 
obligation on a net basis.
	
	
In case of defined benefit plans, remeasurement 
comprising of actuarial gains and losses is 
recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) 
and is reflected in retained earnings and is not 
eligible to be reclassified to profit or loss.
	
	
The Company recognises the following changes in 
the net defined benefit obligation as an expense 
in statement of profit and loss:
 
• Service cost including current service cost, past 
service cost and gains and losses on curtailments 
and settlements; and
 
• Net interest expense or income.
	
	
Provident fund has been considered as a defined 
benefit plan since any additional obligations on 
account of investment risk and interest rate risk 
are required to be met by the Company.
	
2.19.2 Superannuation - Defined contribution scheme
	
	
Contribution to Superannuation Fund, is made at 
pre-determined rates to the Superannuation Fund 
Trust and is charged to the statement of profit 
and loss during the period in which the employee 
renders the related services. There are no other 
obligations other than the contribution payable to 
the Superannuation Fund Trust.
	
2.19.3 Compensated absences
	
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilised 
within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term 
employee benefits. The Company measures the 
expected cost of such absences as the additional 
amount that it expects to pay as a result of the 
226
ABB India Limited  |  Integrated Annual Report 2024
unused entitlement that has accumulated at 
the reporting date. The Company presents the 
entire accumulated leave as a current liability 
in the balance sheet, since it does not have an 
unconditional right to defer its settlement for 12 
months after the reporting date.
	
	
The expected cost of accumulating compensated 
absences is determined by actuarial valuation 
performed by an independent actuary at each 
balance sheet date using the projected unit credit 
method on the additional amount expected to be 
paid/availed as a result of the unused entitlement 
that has accumulated at the balance sheet date.
	
2.19.4 Share based compensation 
	
	
The company recognizes compensation expense 
relating to share-based payments in net profit using 
fair-value in accordance with Ind AS 102, Share-
Based Payment. The estimated fair value of awards 
is charged to income on a straight-line basis over 
the requisite service period for each separately 
vesting portion of the award as if the award was in-
substance, multiple awards with a corresponding 
increase to share options outstanding account. 
	
	
For 
cash-settled 
share-based 
payment 
transactions, the Company measures the services 
acquired and the liability incurred at the fair 
value of the liability. The Company recognizes 
the services received, and a liability to pay for 
those services, as the employees render service. 
The liability is measured, initially and at the end 
of each reporting period until settled, at the fair 
value of the share appreciation rights, by applying 
an option pricing model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions on which the share 
appreciation rights (SAR’s) were granted, and 
the extent to which the employees have rendered 
service to date. The liability is remeasured at each 
reporting date and at settlement date based 
on the fair value of the SARs. Any changes in the 
liability are recognized in profit or loss.
2.20	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipt or 
payments and item of income or expense associated 
with investing or financing cash-flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of 
the Company are segregated.
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less, 
which are readily convertible into known amounts of 
cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
	
For the purpose of statement of cash flows, cash and 
cash equivalents consist of cash and cheque at hand 
and cash and deposit with bank.
2.21	Discontinued operations
	
A discontinued operation is a component of the 
entity that has been disposed of or is classified as 
held for sale and:
	
(a)	
represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations or;
	
(b)	 is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of 
such a line of business or area of operations;
	
(c)	
is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a 
view to resell.
	
The results of discontinued operations are presented 
separately in the statement of profit and loss. The 
comparative statement of profit and loss is re-
presented as if the operation had been discontinued 
from the start of the comparative period.
2.22	Leases
	
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
period of time in exchange for a consideration. To assess 
whether a contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
 
• the contract involves the use of an identified asset;
 
• the Company had the right to obtain substantially 
all the economic benefits from use of the asset 
throughout the period of use; and
 
• the 
Company 
had 
the 
right 
to 
direct 
the 
use of the asset.
227
Financial Statements
	
The Company as lessor
	
At inception or on modification of a contract that 
contains a lease component, the Company allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component 
on the basis of their relative standalone prices. When 
the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease 
inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an 
operating lease.
	
The Company as lessee
	
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset (ROU) 
and a lease liability at the lease commencement 
date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date, plus any initial direct 
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle 
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less 
any lease incentives received.
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated 
using the straight-line method from the commencement 
date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease 
transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the 
Company by the end of the lease term or the cost of 
the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will 
exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-
use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the 
underlying asset, which is determined on the same 
basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In 
addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced 
by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain 
remeasurements of the lease liability.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing 
rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental 
borrowing rate as the discount rate.
	
Lease payments included in the measurement of the 
lease liability comprise the following:
-	 fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
-	 variable lease payments that depend on an index or 
a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at 
the commencement date;
-	 amounts expected to be payable under a residual 
value guarantee; and
-	 the exercise price under a purchase option that 
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, 
lease payments in an optional renewal period if 
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an 
extension option, and penalties for early termination 
of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain 
not to terminate early.
	
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising 
from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change 
in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected 
to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the 
Company changes its assessment of whether it will 
exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or 
if there is a revised in substance fixed lease payment.
	
When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a 
corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in 
profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of use 
asset has been reduced to zero.
	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Company has elected not to recognise right-of 
use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low value 
assets and short-term leases. The Company recognises 
the lease payments associated with these leases as an 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Company’s significant leasing arrangements 
are mainly in respect of land & buildings, plant & 
equipment and vehicles.
2.23	Standards Issued but not Effective
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the financial year 
starting from January 1, 2025, MCA has not notified any 
new standards or amendments to existing standards 
applicable to the Company.

Goodwill and other intangible assets
	
Note:
	
Goodwill and CGU's impairment testing	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis as at 31 December. The 
recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require 
the use of  assumptions. The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the 
management. An average of the range of each assumption used is mentioned below.
	
The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) which represents the weighted 
average return attributable to all the assets of the CGU. The Company has considered terminal value growth rate of 5% 
from financial year 2029-30. These estimates are likely to differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows.
	
Based on the above assessment, there has been no impairment of goodwill.

Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs
	
	
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments 
that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are 
disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining 
fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting 
standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.
	
	
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
	
	
The carrying value of trade receivables, loans receivable, trade payables, other financial assets and liabilities, cash 
and cash equivalents and bank balance other than cash and cash equivalents are considered to be the reasonable 
approximation of their fair value, due to their short term nature.
	
	
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instruments could be 
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following 
methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
	
	
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with banks/financial institutions. Foreign currency 
forward contracts are valued using valuation techniques which employ the use of market observable inputs using 
present value calculations. The model incorporates various inputs including the deal specific fundamental, market 
conditions, maturity period, transaction size, high credit quality yield curve in the respective currencies, comparable 
trades, foreign currency spot and forward rates.
37	 Financial risk management objectives and policies
	
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise lease liabilities, trade and other payables. The main purpose of 
these financial liabilities is to support its operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include trade and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents and bank balance other than cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from 
its operations. 
	
The Company is exposed to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company’s senior management oversees 
the management of these risks. The Company’s senior management is supported by a risk management committee 
that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company. The risk 
management committee provides assurance to the Company’s senior management that the Company’s financial risk 
activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and 
managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for risk management 
purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the 
Company’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board of Directors 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
	
i.	
Market risk
	
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises two types of risk: Currency risk and other price risk, such as commodity 
risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include trade payables, trade receivables and deposits.

Foreign Currency Risk
	
	
The Company operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency 
transactions, primarily with respect to the CHF, USD and EUR. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial 
transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not Company's functional 
currency (INR). The Company enters into forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk.	
	
	
(a)	 Unhedged in foreign currency exposure
	
	
	
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the underlying foreign currency 
against the Indian rupee computed from historical data and is representative of the foreign exchange currency 
risk inherent in financial assets and financial liabilities reported at the reporting date.

ii	
Credit risk
	
	
Credit risk arises from cash held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients, 
including outstanding accounts receivable.  The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value 
of the financial assets.  The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. 
The Company assesses the credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past 
experience and other factors.
	
	
(i)	
Trade receivables
	
	
	
Trade receivables consists of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries. Trade 
receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on terms of 30 to 120 days of credit period. 
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivable. 
Under the simplified approach, the Company does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from initial recognition.
	
	
	
The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade 
receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of 
the trade receivable and is adjusted for forward looking estimates. At year end, the historical observed default 
rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
	
Loss rates are calculated using a 'roll rate' method based on the probability of a receivable progressing 
through successive stages of delinquency to write off. Roll rate are calculated separately for the exposures in 
different segments based on the credit risk characters such as geographical region, external credit rating, age 
of customer relationship etc.
255
Financial Statements
	
	
	
Based on the industry practices and the business environment in which the Company operates, management 
considers that the trade receivables are in default (credit impaired) if the payments are more than 3-5 
years past due.
	
	
	
Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount 
of trade receivable and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss within 
other expenses.

Management does not expect any significant loss from non-performance by counterparties on credit granted 
during the financial year that has not been provided for.	
	
	
(ii)	 Other than trade receivables
	
	
	
Management believes that the parties from which the receivables are due have strong capacity to meet the 
obligations and risk of default is negligible or nil and accordingly no provision for expected credit loss has 
been provided for.
	
iii.	 Liquidity risk
	
	
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk 
management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The 
Company consistently generated sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its financial obligations including 
lease liabilities as and when they fall due.

Contract assets

A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has 
transferred to a customer and hence is not a financial instrument. In Company’s contracts with customers, since 
the contractual right to payment arises only upon achievement of milestones specified in the contract, it is believed 
that the performance completed until the achievement of a particular milestone should be recorded as a contract 
asset under non-financial assets.
	
	
During the year, J 126.16 Crores (December 31, 2023 - H 123.16 Crores) from opening balance of contract assets has 
been reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.
	
	
Revenue recognized during the year from opening balance of contract liabilities amounts to J 272.05 Crores 
(December 31, 2023 - H 164.72 Crores).
c)	
There is no revenue recognised during the year from the performance obligation that is satisfied in previous year 
(arising out of contract modifications).
	
d)	
Performance obligation on fixed price contracts
	
	
The fixed price contracts are ordinarily presumed to consist of combined obligations which are not distinct in the 
context of the contract (i.e., single performance obligation). This is highly attributed to the long-term construction 
nature of the projects, whereby deliverables are typically highly interrelated and combined. The typical scope of 
turnkey contracts arrangements includes engineering, manufacturing, shipment, delivery installation, testing, 
erection and commissioning and civil works. Although there are several components to the overall scope of the 
contract, the turnkey contracts are generally considered one performance obligation. Further, payment terms are 
agreed on a contractual basis with each customer.
	
e)	
Remaining performance obligations
	
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be 
recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognize 
these amounts in revenue.
	
	
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at December 31, 
2024 is J 9,380.37 Crores (December 31, 2023 H 8,404.15 Crores). The conversion to revenue is highly dependent 
on meeting the delivery schedules, contractual terms and conditions with customers, availability of customer 
sites, changes/ variation in scope/ prices etc. In view of these, it is not practical to define the accurate timing of 
conversion to revenue. However, it will be in a range of 1 to 3 years.
