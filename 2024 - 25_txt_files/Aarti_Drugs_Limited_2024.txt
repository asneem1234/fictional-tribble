demand, while scrubbers capture airborne pollutants, thereby improving air quality. These technologies contribute 
to reduced environmental impact and healthier conditions for workers and nearby populations.
	
8.	
Employee Health and Safety Enhancements: The establishment of occupational health centres and provision 
of safety equipment like Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) sets demonstrate a strong commitment to 
employee safety. These initiatives promote a healthier workforce, reduce medical risks, and improve workplace 
productivity.
	
Conclusion: The Company’s capital investments are generating tangible environmental and social benefits. By adopting 
advanced, sustainable technologies and prioritizing responsible practices, the Company supports environmental 
protection, efficient resource use, and employee well-being. These efforts are closely aligned with ESG values, 
strengthening the Company’s position as a trusted and accountable industry leader in the eyes of stakeholders and 
investors.

Aarti Drugs is dedicated to adopting waste management practices that go beyond regulatory compliance. We have 
proactively implemented various measures to reduce waste generation and ensure that all waste is handled in an 
environmentally responsible way. Our approach is guided by the following key principles:
	
a)	
Plastic Waste (Including Packaging):
	
	
We follow a systematic process of collection and segregation of plastic waste, as per the classifications outlined 
in the Plastic Waste Management Rules. All plastic waste generated at our site is sorted accordingly and stored in 
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING (CONTD.)

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Our company has a process for identifying key stakeholder groups that is based on the following steps:
	
a.	
We define the Company’s business and its operations. This helps us to identify the groups of people who are most 	
directly affected by the Company’s activities.
	
b.	
We identify the groups of people who have a vested interest in the Company’s success. These groups of people are 
likely to be the most important stakeholders, as they have the potential to impact the Company’s performance.
	
c.	
We assess the influence and impact of each stakeholder group. This helps us to prioritise our stakeholder 
engagement efforts.
	
d.	
We develop a stakeholder engagement strategy. This strategy helps us to build relationships with our stakeholders 
and to ensure that we are meeting their needs.
	
We have identified the following key stakeholder groups:
	
Employees: Employees are the lifeblood of our company, and they play a critical role in our success. Employees are also 
the most directly affected by the Company’s activities, so they are likely to be one of the most important stakeholder 
groups.
	
Customers: Customers are the people who buy our products or services. Customers are also the ones who are most 
affected by the quality of our products or services. Therefore, customers are another important stakeholder group that 
we need to consider.
	
Suppliers: Suppliers provide us with the raw materials and other inputs that we need to produce our products or services. 
Suppliers are also affected by the Company’s activities, as they may be impacted by the Company’s demand for their 
products or services.
	
Investors and shareholders: Investors and shareholders are the people who own the Company. They are interested in the 
Company’s performance, as they want to see their investment grow in value. Therefore, investors and shareholders are 
another important stakeholder group that we need to consider.
	
Communities: The communities in which we operate are also important stakeholders. These communities are affected 
by the Company’s activities, as they may be impacted by the Company’s pollution or its impact on the local economy.
	
Government and regulatory bodies: Government and regulatory bodies are also important stakeholders, as they have the 
power to regulate the Company’s activities. We need to work with government and regulatory bodies to ensure that we 
are in compliance with the law.
	
We believe that these stakeholder groups are the most important to our company’s success. We will continue to engage 
with these groups in order to build strong relationships and to ensure that we are meeting their needs.
