Indicate 
whether

(R/O)
Rationale for 
identifying 
the risk/ 
opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the 
Risk or Opportunity (Indicate 
Positive or Negative 
Implications)
Customer 
Experience
Risk
Given that 
BHFL provides 
finance products 
and services 
to a large set 
of customers, 
any undesirable 
customer 
experience 
could result 
in loss of 
customers 
or even 
reputational 
loss.
Listening to customers and driving continuous 
transformation to provide them a frictionless 
experience is what BHFL has always strived for. 
Ethics, transparency, and accountability are deeply 
ingrained and practiced in daily operations, including 
in dealing with customers. For a better customer 
experience, BHFL appropriately addresses their 
grievances.
Customer experience is enhanced by offering 
products and services which meet the needs of 
customers, as well as adaptation of innovative 
technology solutions to provide a seamless and 
an “on the go” customer journey through its digital 
platforms.
A dedicated customer complaint reduction unit has 
been instituted to identify the root cause of customer 
complaints and taking corrective actions to modify 
the processes and avoid such grievances.
Negative: Loss of reputation 
can result in loss of customer 
thereby adversely impacting 
businesses of BHFL.
Financial 
Inclusion
Opportunity
The reach 
of financial 
products and 
services is still 
shallow in India 
especially in the 
mass segment 
and semi-urban/
rural parts of 
India.
BHFL customer reach is achieved through its 
distribution network & adapts innovative technology 
solutions to provide a seamless customer journey 
through its digital platforms and customised product 
offerings.
The Company provides Home Loans and Loan 
against property to non-prime customers across 
formal and informal segment.
Positive:
Near Prime and Affordable 
housing business can help 
the Company to expand the 
borrowing basket by raising 
resources through domestic as 
well as international markets as 
well as reduce borrowing cost 
as these borrowings generally 
come at funds at lower cost.
