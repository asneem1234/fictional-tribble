industry bodies) - are mapped through stakeholder analysis and materiality assessments. Inputs are also drawn 
from functional teams and compliance requirements under applicable laws. The list is periodically updated based 
on insights from grievance redressal systems, feedback mechanisms, and stakeholder engagement platforms.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting
 
HGS has established internal mechanisms to address grievances related to human rights, as outlined in its Human 
Rights Policy. Employees who believe that a violation of the policy has occurred are encouraged to report the 
matter promptly to their Manager, Business Head, Human Resources (HR), Compliance team, or through the 
company’s Whistle Blower mechanism. The policy also states that HGS does not tolerate retaliation against any 
employee who, in good faith, raises a concern or participates in an investigation regarding a possible violation. 
The responsibility for ensuring compliance with the policy and addressing reported concerns lies with the HR and 
Compliance teams.
 
These mechanisms support the company’s commitment to protecting and promoting human rights across all its 
operations.

As a business process management and digital services provider, HGS does not use hazardous or toxic 
chemicals in its operations, resulting in negligible generation of hazardous waste. For electronic waste and related 
disposables, HGS partners with authorized third-party vendors to ensure safe collection, disposal, and recycling 
in line with applicable e-waste management regulations. Additionally, across our delivery centers, we promote 
physical waste generation.
