Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report [FY 2024-25]
INTRODUCTION
India Power Corporation Limited (IPCL), established in 1919, is one of the most enduring and future-ready power utilities in 
India. With a distinguished legacy of over a century and a power distribution license granted in 1935, IPCL is the country’s 
only parallel licensee distribution utility, currently serving the Asansol-Raniganj region in West Bengal. This long-standing 
presence reflects a deep commitment to operational excellence, regulatory alignment, and sustainable business practices.
From its origins as a power supplier to coal mines and industrial establishments, IPCL has transformed into a diversified 
distribution utility serving a wide range of consumers—including residential, commercial, and institutional segments. The 
company operates with one of the lowest transmission and distribution losses in the country, at 3%, backed by a modern 
digital infrastructure comprising smart meters, SCADA systems, and GIS-enabled substations.
IPCL’s integrated management systems are certified to ISO demonstrating its strong focus on risk management, compliance, 
operational resilience, and stakeholder trust.
With 75% of its current power procurement sourced from renewable energy, IPCL is actively contributing to India’s clean 
energy transition. Its collaboration with Switzerland-based E2S Power to introduce Thermal Energy Storage Systems (TESS) 
represents a strategic step toward grid flexibility and long-term decarbonization goals, in line with India's net-zero target by 
2070.
Social responsibility is embedded in IPCL’s corporate ethos. Guided by the values of Discipline, Dedication, and Devotion, 
the company engages in wide-ranging community development initiatives, including education scholarships, gender 
empowerment programs, cultural preservation efforts, and health and environmental awareness campaigns.
This Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR) reflects IPCL’s ESG performance and strategic outlook, in 
accordance with national regulatory frameworks. With a strong foundation of governance, innovation, and stakeholder-
centric growth, IPCL is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in shaping India’s sustainable power landscape. The company 
continues to explore emerging opportunities in renewable energy and Waste to Energy, underscoring its commitment to 
responsible growth and long-term value creation.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25 | 89
In an era of growing environmental consciousness, sustainability has become the central theme of any business of social 
activity. At India Power Corporation Limited (‘IPCL’ or ‘India Power’ or ‘Company’) too, sustainability is more than an obligation 
– it is a responsibility for long-term goals. In the financial year 2024-25, India Power has taken several proactive steps to 
contribute to India’s net-zero emission goals. The strongest achievement of all is becoming a pioneering Green Utility, sourcing 
almost 75% of power from renewable sources. Embedding Environmental, Social and Governance Principles to India Power’s 
business has culminated into positive and goal-oriented results; delivering value to our stakeholders.
Transition to cleaner energy comes with a set of challenges, the most significant being provision of Round-The-Clock (RTC) 
power. As a power utility operating from a parallel licensee region, we often face behavioural and infrastructure challenges 
while implementing sustainability at a larger scale. Our key focus was to identify the areas of development, challenges and 
solutions to mitigate the same.
By adopting an asset-light approach and integrating renewable energy into our operations, we’re actively supporting India’s 
bold climate goals—like achieving 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and advancing green hydrogen development. 
Through initiatives like green tariffs for commercial and industrial customers and rooftop solar programs, we’re not just 
supplying energy—we’re helping people generate their own clean power and take part in the energy transition.
From setting up pioneering solar plants and introducing green energy tariffs to launching a 24×7 EV charging hub at Salt 
Lake Sector V—soon to be powered by solar—we’ve expanded our vision beyond traditional electricity supply. These efforts 
help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and move us closer to India’s net-zero target by 2070.
Today, we proudly serve a licensed area of 798 sq. km in the Asansol-Raniganj region, with one of the lowest transmission 
and distribution losses in the industry—just 2.47%. This has been possible because of our investments in smart grid 
technology and digital transformation. Tools like SCADA, IoT, machine learning, and GIS-based outage systems are helping 
us improve reliability and offer better service to our customers.
We’re also thinking ahead. As one of the early movers in energy storage, we’re working on pilot projects like a 250 kWh 
thermal storage system and a large-scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in collaboration with EY-Parthenon and 
the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet. This 100 MW / 400 MWh project in Asansol will strengthen the grid and 
help us use more renewable power.
Our renewable portfolio continues to grow. With wind projects in Gujarat and a solar plant in Jamuria, West Bengal, we’re 
maintaining an asset-light model supported by long-term Power Purchase Agreements. We’re also exploring pumped storage 
hydro opportunities to help meet the country’s clean energy targets.
On the digital front, we’ve installed over 2.5 lakh smart meters in Madhya Pradesh, playing an important role in India’s 
national smart metering mission. Our sustained investments in digital systems, cybersecurity, and clean technology are 
helping us become not just a power utility, but a sustainable energy enabler.
Yes, challenges remain—balancing growth with environmental responsibility, adopting new technologies quickly, and 
ensuring no one is left behind. But each step we take brings us closer to a more resilient, inclusive, and green energy future.
At India Power, we’re proud to be part of that future.

•	
Addressing Work-Related Issues: The company implements a systematic process-driven approach to prevent 
negative impacts from unresolved employee grievances or complaints. Employee support is monitored through 
key performance indicators including Employee Productivity, Grievances, Safety metrics, and Attrition rates. 
Proactive outreach initiatives target team members, managers, and department heads.

HRMS Management: Employee concerns are documented both digitally through the HRMS platform and through 
various offline forums. Information gathered is systematically compiled, evaluated, and used to implement 
effective corrective measures.
•	
HR Indicator Application: The organization analyses voluntary departure reasons to identify potential employee 
dissatisfaction factors. While absenteeism remains minimal, it is consistently monitored. HR indicator data drives 
improvements in employee engagement strategies.
•	
Key Initiatives: Corrective actions include counselling for reporting managers and providing enhanced infrastructure 
and support. At the Asansol facility, a dedicated Grievance register is maintained for workers. Regular Leadership 
Team meetings address reported issues and concerns. Union-Management discussions occur on a scheduled 
basis, with worker grievances resolved collaboratively between Union Leaders and Management representatives.

Principle 7 Businesses, when engaging in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a manner that is 
responsible and transparent
We recognize that engaging in public and regulatory policy is both a responsibility and an opportunity to drive meaningful, 
ethical change. Our approach is rooted in transparency, accountability, and integrity, ensuring that our advocacy efforts 
align with broader societal and industry interests while maintaining credibility and trust.
When influencing policy, we prioritize open dialogue with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to present well-
researched perspectives that contribute to informed decision-making. We ensure that our engagements are driven by facts, 
sustainability considerations, and long-term economic viability rather than short-term gains.
Transparency is fundamental to our approach. We disclose our positions, maintain compliance with regulatory frameworks,

demonstrate our commitment to constructive policy development.
Our advocacy extends beyond regulatory alignment; it is about shaping policies that promote industry growth, environmental 
sustainability, and social equity. By actively participating in policy discussions in a responsible and ethical manner, we 
reinforce our commitment to governance that benefits businesses, communities, and the broader economy.
