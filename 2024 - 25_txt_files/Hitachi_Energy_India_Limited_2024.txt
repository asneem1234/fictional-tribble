1
Health and 
Safety
R/O
Performance on health, safety, 
and environment (HSE) is critical 
and comes first in the Company’s 
decision-making, with safety being 
a key element in our ‘license to 
operate’. We foster a healthy, 
productive work environment, 
believing those working for the 
Company can only perform at their 
best when feeling safe, healthy, 
and well.
We are striving towards world-class 
HSE performance across the Company 
and have a framework setting out the 
focus areas for improvement:
• 	
Culture and leadership
• 	
Communication and learnings
• 	
Digitalization and analytics
•	
Operations and risk management
• 	
Governance and competencies .
The Company’s specific improvement 
activities reflect the scale of potential 
risk, its performance, and its evolving 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Negative
2
Climate 
change
R/O
Natural disasters will exacerbate 
damage to production facilities, 
increase downtime of assets, 
worsen working environments, 
and disrupt supply chains, leading 
to delays in deliveries and the 
procurement of parts
Increased need for mitigation 
activities will divert capital away 
from decarbonization activities 
such as grid expansion, renewables 
connection, and technology 
research and development
The Company is actively engaged in 
helping tackle climate change, starting 
with its own operations. Through 
market scenarios, it is also looking at 
potential climate impacts on economic 
growth and market/energy transition 
drivers such as pace of acceleration, 
bottlenecks, and governmental plans 
and targets. The Company has made 
efforts to accommodate internet of 
things (IoT) products.

3
Carbon 
neutrality
R
Unprecedented demand creating 
pressure on the sector to expand 
the supply chain and dilute levels 
of ESG performance
Investment in capacity extension 
might dilute the strategic focus 
on accelerating development of 
new technologies and/or business 
models to thrive after the peak of 
the industry super-cycle
Unbalanced grid development 
from the perspective of 
intermittent energy supply and 
storage might critically affect 
power quality
Investment in achieving the 
reduction targets is not balanced 
out by an increase in revenue or 
reduction in costs, increasing the 
costs of our products and services 
and reducing competitiveness
Carbon reduction targets are 
not achieved, reducing our 
competitiveness in the market
The path towards limiting global 
warming, as envisioned by the Paris 
Agreement, is a critical challenge 
for governments, businesses, and 
organizations. The Company has, 
therefore, defined and validated 
ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) 
reduction targets to set its own 
net-zero trajectory. The Company 
ensures compliance with emerging and 
future GHG emissions regulation or 
legislation.
Negative
4
Innovation
R/O
The risks landscape around 
innovation of sustainable products 
and solutions in our industry is 
quite complex.
Some of the risks are customer-
facing (for example, inadequate, 
or insufficient infrastructure, 
lack of grid capacity to connect 
renewable energy resources or 
electrification solutions for energy 
intensive industries, new product 
range price or usage and adoption 
anxiety), while others are design 
and manufacturing related (for 
example, availability of sustainable 
materials, quality control, 
upgrading of production lines, 
service, circularity and end of life 
recovery, training and recruitment 
of specialized resources, 
compliance with regulatory and 
legal requirements, investment 
costs).
Another risk area relates to 
regulatory environment, which may 
require technology providers to 
invest vast amount of funding to 
develop new sustainable solutions 
while the market adoption of them 
is relatively low.
Therefore, the regulatory actions 
need to balance between creating 
sustainability markets and 
developing sustainable technology, 
for a healthy development of 
sustainable solutions.
The Company’s innovative technologies 
and solutions help increase access to 
affordable, reliable, and sustainable 
energy vital for society to prosper 
and progress. As consumer needs 
and lifestyles continue to evolve, 
our forward-looking technologies 
help make the energy system more 
sustainable, flexible, and secure. 
The opportunity of innovating and 
bringing to the market sustainable 
products and solutions in its field of 
business is significant and it expects 
frontrunners to become the brand, 
supplier, employer, and investment 
of choice for its stakeholders. As 
electrification is one of the key pillars 
of decarbonization, the most innovative 
companies will also have the biggest 
contribution to a net-zero future. The 
Company identifies innovation as part 
of its DNA and strategy on a short-, 
medium-, and long-term basis.

Cybersecurity R
Embedding security into every

management program based on ISO 
27005, which provides guidance on 
systematically identifying, addressing, 
evaluating, and treating relevant risks. 
Treated as a continuous process 
involving all IT initiatives, services, 
and suppliers’ engagement, our risk 
management function is subject 
to security, legal, and regulatory 
requirements. The Company follows 
industry best practices such as ITIL 4 
and National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) recommendations 
to manage detected cybersecurity 
incidents effectively. Incidents are 
recorded, analyzed, confirmed, 
classified, and prioritized so that 
appropriate remediation and response 
actions are implemented while, at the

Social and environmental aspects are incorporated into R&D through:
	
Environmentally Conscious Design (ECD). ECD aims to reduce a product’s environmental impact, while 
maintaining or improving its functionality of the product. Integration of environmental aspects as early as possible 
into the product design and development process offers flexibility to make changes and improvements to our 
products. This enables us to make effective decisions about environmental aspects that we control.
	
Safety in Design: Incorporating design solutions for identified hazards and reasonably foreseeable risks that 
may occur as the product is manufactured, transported, installed, serviced and disposed of. The Company’s 
designers also consider the behavior of design components in context of the product life span – for example, how 
often a component might fail during the product life and the potential impacts of such failures. Consideration is 
also given to post-​life aspects through the elimination or minimization of exposure to toxic or environmentally 
damaging materials designed into the product.
	
HSE Checklist for the Company's Gate Model: The HSE Checklist helps to identify key Health, Safety, 
Environmental (HSE) and Sustainability aspects in the Company’s product and technology development 
projects. R&D systematically and comprehensively identifies and assesses health, safety and environmental 
risks and opportunities.
	
Guideline for material selection: Environmental impact of a product is determined by the material and energy 
inputs and outputs generated at all stages of its life cycle: raw-​material acquisition, manufacture, distribution, 
use and disposal. Material selection guidance on for energy conservation, pollution prevention, resource 
conservation, promotion of a safe work environment is provided to reduce impact of product on the environment.
	
Every year projects focusing on environmental improvements are identified in our operations as part of their 
environment management program and budget allocated.

Sustainability Development Program, which directs our strategy across the business and encompasses goal 
setting, performance assessment (internal and external, EcoVadis), monitoring and reporting processes, 
strengthening relations with external stakeholders, and ensuring overall accountability
	
	
The Company works with its suppliers to facilitate conflict-free sourcing that contributes to economic 
growth. As a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), the Company adheres to the OECD 
guidelines and supports transparency and responsible minerals sourcing. The Company is a downstream 
consumer of 3TG and cobalt and does not directly purchase raw minerals or ores. Although the Company 
does not perform direct audits of those second or third tier suppliers, it proactively assesses indirect links 
using a Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry report at the Group level.
	
	
Under the SSDP program, we have a new stream, the Greenhouse Gases Assessment Program, for our 
suppliers. This program aims to educate our suppliers about GHG emissions and their environmental effects, 
benchmark their GHG emissions, and monitor performance. The Company has partnered with Bureau Veritas 
India, who will train suppliers on carbon emissions and assist them in calculating and, ultimately, reducing 
their footprint.
 
c. 
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
In transformer business, the major components include transformer oil, electric steel, copper, Insulation 
material which comprises of 80% of the total input which are sourced sustainably.
	
	
The Company’s Supplier Sustainability Assessment Process is dedicated to systematically assess, manage, 
monitor and report the sustainability risks associated with our external suppliers’ operations and performance 
by assessing their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.
2. 
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Company is dedicated to minimizing the use of water, materials, and hazardous substances and reducing 
and designing out pollution and waste across the lifecycle of our offerings through a circular mindset. Steel, 
copper, aluminum, plastics, and insulating oil are the main materials of our products and are mostly recoverable 
at end-of-life. The Company recycles plastics from packaging and fulfills its extended producer responsibility 
requirement. Product manual has specific instructions on safe disposal of products after end of life as per 
local legislation.

Yes, EPR is applicable. Waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan and is periodically submitted to Central 
pollution control board as per the regulatory requirement.
Leadership Indicators
1. 
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
	
The Company’s lifecycle perspective on managing environmental risks, aspects, and impacts extends beyond its 
operations. It includes its supply chain, the use of its products, and their end-of-life. The application of lifecycle 
assessments (LCAs) is key to improving the environmental performance of our products, systems, and services. 
LCAs provide us with quantitative environmental information to improve the design of our products, systems, 
and services. Beyond that, LCAs quantify the environmental footprint of our products, systems, and services as 
requested by our customers.
	
LCAs are performed as per ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 on request. For our main product groups, we have 
assessed lifecycle environmental impact and provided transparent environmental information to our customers 
and regulators. Where needed, we verify LCAs according to ISO 14025 to provide an Environmental Product 
Declaration (EPD) based on LCAs. The Company understands the complexity of its portfolio and that systems 
it delivers are customized to its customer’s needs and specifications.
83
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
	
Over previous years, however, the Company has also performed LCAs for its solutions of complex systems 
such as High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC), Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS), grid 
connections, e-mobility solutions, and others. The LCAs helped identify the next focus areas for eco-design 
and improvements. The Company is investigating the quantification of the environmental impact and potential 
benefits of its service solutions and project installations. It is also implementing highly automated LCA tools 
that directly assess project-specific configurations, providing decision support at all project stages and during 
discussions with its customers.
	
EcoSmartTM is the Company’s in-house lifecycle assessment calculator for transformers, components, and 
services. This tool is based on lifecycle modeling by ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards on environmental 
lifecycle assessment and the applicable product category rules (PCR) of the International EPD System. It 
evaluates energy and resource consumption and environmental emissions from all lifecycle stages of transformer 
solutions (production and transportation of materials and parts to manufacturing sites; unit manufacturing; 
assembly and testing; transportation to customer site; product use, maintenance, and end-of-life).
	
Through its Service and Digital offerings, the Company is convinced that more trusted lifecycle partnerships 
will drive increased asset sustainability, given that service activities are designed to improve the sustainability 
footprint of installed assets, ensure efficient and safer operation, and extend asset life. To enable circularity, the 
Company has introduced eco-design for all new products, following the IEC 62430 approach.

management system as per ISO 45001:2018.
89
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
 
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
	
The Company identifies and assesses HSE risks and opportunities across the organization, ranging from 
individual actions to enterprise-level activities. A specialized and standardized audit program monitors 
the accuracy of our risk analysis, the program’s efficiency, and the identification of opportunities. Health 
Safety and Environmental impacts of each of our operating units are also assessed according to the ISO 
14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018, and ISO 50001:2018 standards. This information is used to identify and 
report hazards and opportunities for improvement available in a company-wide web-based tool. Based on 
findings within our assessment program, tasks carried out by or on behalf of the Company involving hazards 
with a high level of risk receive deeper analysis. Additional controls are implemented to ensure the safety 
and health of all employees and contractors, as well as to prevent environmental harm or damage.
 
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, a company-wide web-based tool is available to report work related hazards and incidents. Each 
Accountable Manager is aware of the entity’s top five risks and, considering these in conjunction with its 
top five incident categories, develops appropriate action plans for reducing the risks and implementing 
improvements. Action plans are reviewed twice annually and updated as necessary. We believe that a person 
who feels ownership of the safety process shifts from a reactive worker to a proactive business partner who 
shares decision rights to protect and sustain a workplace free of injury, illness, or other loss.
 
d. 
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
Safety is vital to our ‘license to operate’ and being a business that people want to work for or with. We minimize 
risk of harm and are committed to eradicating fatalities, life-changing injuries, and major environmental incidents.
	
Workers are protected against reprisals. Errors are accepted and expected, regardless of seniority, geography, 
or experience. These errors are addressed through a dedicated consequence management approach — Fair 
Process — that favors error prevention through learning.
	
The Company’s leaders and managers create an open and transparent reporting environment without fear 
of retaliation to promote the early detection and honest reporting of errors. Strong workers’ participation at 
the local level manages early detection, helping define relevant solutions to prevent errors that may lead to 
injuries and/or environmental and asset damages Fair Process assessments address an individual’s behaviors 
and, most importantly, their line management. People act according to, but not limited to, their leadership 
environment. When breaches to HSE requirements are identified, they are openly reported by workers and 
managed accordingly by the individual’s line management. This open reporting of breaches is understood as 
the best way to improve current practices and related standards to prevent harm to people, the environment, 
and assets. This open reporting environment is free from disciplinary action and retaliation when performed in 
due time.

Category managers classify suppliers as potential partners based on their long-term operational and sustainability 
performance, integrity, and anti-bribery compliance. This classification process also considers de-sourcing and 
blocking suppliers in cases of non-compliance For suppliers with higher sustainability risks, we offer a Supplier 
Sustainability Development Program (SSDP) that prioritizes partners according to a risk matrix, aggregating 
country and commodity risks, operational characteristics, the supplier’s criticality, and spending level. This 
program includes: Training, awareness, and capacity-building; Assessments and audits conducted remotely and 
on-site; Monitoring of supplier sustainability performance. Through assessments and corrective action plan (CAP) 
closures lasting from eight months to two years, we help suppliers assess their strengths and weaknesses. The 
Company works with suppliers to detect and implement corrective actions when potential risks are identified. If 
those are not implemented within a reasonable timeframe, the supplier is recommended for desourcing.

98
Hitachi Energy India Limited
Climate-related changes pose significant risks to communities, economies, and biodiversity, necessitating 
comprehensive adaptation strategies to build resilience. As a business directly involved in accelerating the energy 
transition, the Company has a responsibility to act accordingly. Adaptation involves adjusting practices, processes, 
and infrastructure to reduce vulnerability and enhance the capacity to cope with climate-related stresses. The 
transition to a low-carbon economy involves a shift from fossil-fuel dependency to renewable energy sources and 
the adoption of best practices in sustainability across all sectors. This transition not only contributes to mitigating 
future climate risks but also presents opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and the creation of a more 
sustainable and equitable society.
The Country Management Committee along with the ESG Committee comprising of Board members regularly reviews 
sustainability-related issues at the Company level, providing strategic oversight and governance responsibilities to 
support management in delivering strategy and achieving business objectives and is supported by the ESG steering 
committee comprising of key stakeholders at location and business unit level.
The Company’s Climate Transition Plan-focused actions include addressing the sources of CO2 emissions along the 
value chain, sourcing fossil-free electricity in its operations, reducing energy use in its factories, continuing to invest 
in alternatives for SF6 and minimizing its use in our products and operations and maximizing energy efficiency in

8. 
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
The main sources of the Company’s direct (Scope 1) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are the fuels used 
in our operations, such as natural gas usage and SF6 losses during production processes and gas handling 
on site. Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions from purchased electricity. The Company recognizes the need to 
limit global warming to no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, in order to avoid the worst affects 
of climate change. As such, our ambition is to become carbon neutral in our own operations by 2030 and 
achieve Net Zero across the entire value chain by 2050. To achieve this, we have implemented several projects 
and initiatives which include: Solar roof top installations at Maneja where 932 kW and Doddaballapur where 
600 kW were commissioned. Mysore facility has Power Purchase Agreements which caters to nearly 90% 
of its electricity requirement. The remaining carbon from grid electricity is offset by purchasing International 
Renewable Energy Certificates (IREC). Going forward the Company will focus on more direct, and potentially 
value adding methods such as green tariffs, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and own generation to meet 
its renewable electricity targets.
	
At project site, solar roof top installations are used to power offices at Adani HVDC project and 6 GPQS sites 
totaling 47.7 kW capacity. 6 sets solar based mobile charging facility with 3 lights and 2 USB installed in rest 
sheds and worker colony and 7 CNG vehicles are used at HVDC site.
	
Energy conservation activities include replacing conventional lamps with LED, installation of solar lights, 
electrical retrofits such as replacement of old drives and compressors with energy efficient equipment; process 
improvements such as optimizing operations of HVAC and AHUs and thermal insulation of hotlines to prevent 
heat loss. At Maneja, energy monitoring systems were installed to monitor energy consumption patterns and 
take appropriate actions. 7 nos. of HT/LT substations and 53 Energy meter are connected to the monitoring 
system. At Halo and Maneja, LPG was replaced by low carbon PNG while Mysore uses biofuel such as paddy 
husk and waste dust from own operations to fuel its boilers. Replacing old R22 based HVAC systems to high 
COP R410A at Maneja has also resulted in reduction in carbon emissions.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company constantly monitors its supply chain to identify and replace hazardous substances in its products 
and operations. The Company has established processes to meet the requirements from the following legislations:
	
•	
The European Union Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals 
(REACH)
	
•	
The European Union Directive on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical 
and Electronic Equipment (RoHS)
	
•	
European Union Waste Framework Directive (WFD) Database created and maintained by the European 
Chemicals Agency for information on Substances of Concern in articles as such or in complex objects 
(SCIP–Products)
	
•	
The US Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) restriction proposal 
	
•	
The US Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
	
To facilitate compliance and protect ecosystems, as well as workers, customers, and other stakeholders, the 
Company maintains a list of Prohibited and Restricted Substances. This is aligned with the global standards 
IEC62474 (Material Declarations for the Electrical and Electronics Industry) and the Railway Industry Substance 
List (RISL). The list’s scope includes goods supplied for product development, production processes, products 
and components, packaging materials, service activities, construction sites, and end-of-life phases. Embedded 
within the Company’s general terms and conditions of purchase, the list comprises a table of regulated 
substances most relevant to the Company’s products. While it does not replace specific national or international 
regulatory obligations, it is biannually reviewed along with REACH Candidate List updates. As a manufacturer, 
importer, and supplier of products in the EU, the Company understand’s the importance of environmental 
and regulatory management. The Company is registered with the European Chemicals Agency’s (ECHA) SCIP 
database for substances of concern for particular items (‘articles’) and products (‘complex objects’). This enables 
the identification of any items containing substances of very high concern (SVHCs) on the Candidate List at a 
concentration above 0.1 percent weight by weight. Those substances in the Company’s products are recorded 
in a blockchain web database tool that reports information about such products to the SCIP database. The 
Company works closely with all its vendors and suppliers to keep the ledger updated.
	
The Company future-proofs its business with resource efficiency as a key operational driver. This includes a 
commitment to send zero waste to landfill from its manufacturing sites and achieve 100 percent plastic waste 
recovery in our operations by 2030. Additionally, it extends its focus to enable circularity across its value chain—
or ‘value loop,’ Through the Company’s Service and Digital offerings, it is convinced that more trusted lifecycle 
partnerships will drive increased asset sustainability, given that service activities are designed to improve the 
sustainability footprint of installed assets, ensure efficient and safer operation, and extend asset life.
103
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
	
To enable circularity, the Company has introduced eco-design for all new products, following the IEC 62430 
approach. The Company holds a lifecycle perspective in mind, working with ISO 14040/44 principles while 
recognizing that system benefits can only be recovered if the focus is too narrow on individual products. The 
Company strives to create value sustainably, finding new ways to optimize resource use while minimizing or 
eliminating waste The Company is committed to creating resource efficient solutions to help achieve a truly 
circular economy by implementing our 5R principle – Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words / web 
link.
	
Yes, Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is part of the Company’s organizational resilience program. It is designed 
to reduce the impact of a business interruption which could occur due to a range of events ranging from financial, 
natural causes or man-made events. It helps Business Unit/Function to respond effectively to the disruption 
and restore its essential services and mission critical processes as quickly as possible to ensure timely recovery. 
It provides a reference tool for the actions required during or immediately following an emergency or incident 
that threatens to disrupt Business Unit/Function normal business activities.
	
The key objectives of this business continuity plan are to:
	
•	
Identify advanced preparations and procedures that will enable Business Unit/Function to respond quickly 
to disruptive incidents and ensure continuity of critical business functions.
	
•	
Reduce employee injury or loss of life, and minimize damage and losses
	
•	
Have documented plans and procedures to ensure effective execution of recovery strategies for critical 
business functions.
	
•	
Reduce and mitigate disruptions to business operations.
	
•	
Identify teams which would need to respond to incidents and define specific responsibilities.
	
•	
Quantify the impact of incidents in terms of monetary, time, operations, and work force.
	
•	
Recover quickly from an emergency and resume full operations.
 
The various steps are:
 
Key Business Processes & Recovery Priorities
	
List all the key processes and sub processes of that must be maintained or quickly restored in the event of a 
disruptive incident. It provides a high-level description for each of the process and assigns a priority (criticality) 
ranking to each of them.
107
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
	
Risk assessment
	
Risk assessment is one of the main parts of the BCM system. The RA process involves identification, analysis, 
and evaluation of all possible risks, hazards, and threats to the operating environment, and defines likelihood / 
impact of disruptive events caused by such threats.
	
Once the risks have been identified, their impact on different aspects of operations are gauged. Those risks 
which affect mission-critical operations should be handled first. The following strategy is used to handle risks:
	
•	
Prevent – Risks which are of high probability with high impact. These risks must be attended first by using 
mitigation, prevention or any other strategy to lessen or avoid its impact.
	
•	
Accept – Risks which have low probability and low impact. Nothing specific needs to be done for such risks, 
but the organization should be vigilant. If a back-up strategy is put in place for such a risk, all the better
	
•	
Contain – Risks which have a high probability of occurring but having low impact on operations. Use 
mitigation strategies to minimize impact of the risk on business operations.
	
•	
Plan – Low probability but high impact events. Though this may be once in a lifetime event, its impact could 
be disastrous. The business should plan the steps to be taken if such a risk occurs. Once the steps to be 
taken are in place, production can be resumed in the shortest possible time with the least loss.
 
Business Impact Analysis
	
The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies and prioritizes the mission-critical business processes and key 
functions, disruption related operational impacts, and the resources (internal and external) required to recover 
critical operations.f
	
A properly executed BIA will guide in reducing the overall operational and financial impacts, reduce potential 
losses, and enhance the business operations.
	
Business Continuity Strategy
	
Business Continuity Plan describes the strategy devised to maintain business continuity in the event of a disruption 
to operations. This strategy will be invoked when the primary facility(ies) somehow be damaged or inaccessible, 
and business critical operations are interrupted.
 
Recovery priorities
	
The strategy is to recover critical business functions at an alternate site location (if an off-site strategy has been 
put into effect to provide recovery service). Critical business functions are the most critical for immediate recovery 
at the secondary location.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What
