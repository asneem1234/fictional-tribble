Material 
issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O
Rationale for 
identifying
the risk/ 
opportunity
In case of risk, 
approach to
adapt or
mitigate
Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative
implications)
1
GHG Emissions
Risk
With an increase 
in the 
manufacturing 
capacity - to 
keep up with the 
production 
demand, the 
GHG emissions 
will go up
The Company is
progressively
working towards
use of new and
improved
technology
providing
efficient system
to reduce GHG
Emissions with
which this risk
can be mitigated.
Negative –
The Company may be
required to set up
improved and
efficient systems and
processes to reduce
the GHG Emissions
which will require a
new or additional
setting up of required
facilities resulting in
additional capital/
revenue expenditure.

Waste
Management
4
Water
Management
Opportunity
Risk
HAP has a robust 
collection and 
recycling process 
for its plastic 
waste. We also 
convert ETP scum 
to compost which 
is used in irrigation 
land
Water being a 
finite resource will 
pose a risk to the 
operations of our 
business.
HAP has a 
community led 
water management 
and conservation 
projects.
Rainwater 
harvesting is being 
practiced in our 
manufacturing 
locations.
Reduction in raw 
water usage in 
manufacturing 
facilities 
implemented.
Positive-
We are taking
efforts to ensure
efficient water
management to
reduce cost and
burden on the
environment.
Energy
Management
Opportunity
Processes and 
Systems are in 
place to ensure 
maximum energy 
efficiency and this 
will be 
continuously
improved
HAP sources
Power from Solar
panels, Bio gas
etc., this and
usage of LEDs
and natural
lighting ensures
effective energy
management and
mitigate the risk.
Positive –
Any cost incurred for
improving the energy
management system
will fetch positive
outcomes and reduced
cost in the long run.
5
Employee
Health and
Safety
Risk
This can lead
to decreased 
productivity
Many efforts and 
initiatives have 
been put in place to 
ensure employee 
health and safety. 
Neutral –
Immediate incurring of 
expenditure on this 
count will result in 
financial outgo.  But,
Any cost incurred 
towards employee 
health and safety will 
yield positive results in 
the long term
Better usage of 
our waste 
segregation and 
collection 
processes to 
improve the 
efficiency of the 
process
Positive –
The waste generated
(Scum) is used back
in our land. Plastic
recycling reduces
further costs on
plastic packaging.
