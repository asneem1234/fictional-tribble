ESG 
compliance
Risk and 
Opportunity
In the evolving business 
environment, ESG 
compliance has emerged as 
a critical factor for long-term 
sustainability and investor 
confidence. For the company, 
ESG considerations are 
particularly significant due to:
Stringent global regulatory 
expectations from importing 
countries (e.g., US FDA, EMA) 
around environment and 
ethical practices.
Increasing scrutiny from 
institutional investors and 
global supply chain partners 
on ESG performance.
Rising expectations around 
waste management, carbon 
footprint reduction, energy 
efficiency, and responsible 
sourcing.
Greater public focus on 
ethical business conduct, 
clinical trial transparency, 
employee welfare, and 
community engagement.
Non-compliance may result 
in reputational damage, 
regulatory penalties, and loss 
of market access. Conversely, 
proactive ESG alignment 
offers strategic opportunities.
Therefore, ESG compliance 
is not only a risk mitigation 
measure but also a strategic 
enabler of sustainable growth 
for the Company.
To address the identified ESG-
related risks, the Company has 
adopted a structured and proactive 
approach, including:
1.	 Policy Alignment:
	
Development and periodic 
review of internal policies 
aligned with global ESG 
standards such as ensuring 
compliance with SEBI’s BRSR 
guidelines.
2.	 Sustainable Operations:
	
Investment in energy-
efficient equipment and 
green manufacturing 
practices Improved waste 
segregation and safe disposal 
of hazardous pharma waste 
Water conservation initiatives 
and effluent treatment 
systems
3.	 Ethical and Inclusive 
Workforce Practices:
a.	 Implementation of fair labour 
practices, POSH policy, and DEI 
(Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) 
initiatives
b.	 Periodic training on ethical 
business conduct, data privacy, 
and workplace safety
4.	 Stakeholder Engagement:
	
Regular engagement with 
investors, regulators, suppliers, 
and community stakeholders 
to address ESG expectations 
and disclosures transparently.
Positive: Access to ESG & 
Sustainability-Linked Capital:
Strong ESG compliance can 
enable access to green bonds, 
sustainability-linked loans, and 
lower interest rates from ESG-
focused investors and banks.
Long-term Cost Efficiency:
Energy-efficient and 
sustainable manufacturing 
practices can reduce utility 
bills, waste disposal costs, and 
overall resource usage  
over time.
Market Differentiation & 
Brand Premium:
Strong ESG compliance 
enhances brand reputation, 
attracts ESG-conscious 
customers, and opens 
opportunities for export to 
regulated markets.
Improved Investor & 
Stakeholder Confidence:
Transparent ESG practices 
increase investor trust, 
employee satisfaction, and 
alignment with global supply 
chain ESG norms — potentially 
increasing firm valuation.
	
Through these measures, the 
Company aims to mitigate ESG 
compliance risks, enhance 
operational resilience, and 
create long-term value for  
all stakeholders.

2
Regulatory 
compliance
Risk and 
opportunity
The company operates in a 
highly regulated environment, 
governed by multiple national 
and international regulations. 
Failure to comply with 
such evolving and stringent 
regulatory frameworks can 
result in severe operational, 
financial, and reputational 
consequences such as 
product recalls, license 
suspensions, import bans, 
and loss of customer and 
investor trust.
Conversely, proactive and 
robust compliance systems 
not only mitigate these risks 
but also present opportunities 
for enhanced global 
market access, long-term 
business sustainability, and 
stakeholder confidence.
Hence, regulatory compliance 
is identified as both a 
critical risk and a strategic 
opportunity in the company’s 
business and sustainability 
planning.
To effectively manage the risks 
associated with evolving regulatory 
landscapes, the company has 
adopted a proactive, multi-layered 
compliance strategy:
Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs): All operations are 
governed by well-documented 
SOPs aligned with Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) 
and global quality standards. 
Regular updates are made based 
on regulatory revisions.
Internal Audits and Mock 
Inspections: Periodic internal 
audits are conducted to assess 
compliance readiness, identify 
gaps, and implement corrective 
actions.
Training and Capacity Building: 
Regular training sessions are held 
for all levels of staff—including 
production, R&D, quality assurance, 
and compliance—on regulatory 
requirements, ESG mandates.
Positive & Negative:
Fines and Penalties: Non-
compliance with domestic 
regulations may result in hefty 
penalties, warning letters, or 
even suspension of licenses.
Market Access Restrictions:
Regulatory violations can 
lead to import bans, product 
recalls, or delisting in critical 
export markets, leading 
to revenue losses and 
reputational damage.
Increased Compliance 
Costs: Delayed adaptation 
to changing regulations can 
lead to urgent remediation 
costs, legal expenses, and 
consultancy fees.
Operational Disruptions:
Non-compliance may cause 
temporary plant shutdowns, 
delayed product approvals, 
or loss of key supply chain 
certifications affecting 
business continuity.
Positive Implications 
Access to Global Markets: 
Compliance with international 
regulatory standards 
enhances eligibility for exports 
to highly regulated markets 
boosting revenue.
Investor Confidence: Strong 
compliance records improve 
ESG ratings and stakeholder 
trust, attracting institutional 
investors and long-term 
capital.
Reputation and Brand 
Value: A robust compliance 
framework strengthens brand 
credibility and market position.
Cost Optimization: Proactive 
compliance helps avoid costly 
litigation, reputational loss, 
and remediation, resulting in 
better financial planning and 
risk-adjusted returns.

Changing 
global political 
and economic 
conditions
Risk
The global political and 
economic environment 
plays a critical role in 
shaping the operations, 
market access, supply 
chain stability, and growth 
prospects of pharmaceutical 
companies. Given the 
sector’s heavy dependence 
on international markets for 
both raw materials (APIs, 
intermediates) and finished 
goods exports, shifts in 
geopolitical dynamics and 
macroeconomic policies can 
significantly impact business 
sustainability.
Risk Considerations:
Trade barriers or sanctions 
in key export or import 
countries could disrupt 
the supply chain or restrict 
market access.
Currency volatility, inflationary 
trends, or recessionary 
pressures in major markets 
(e.g., US, EU) can affect 
profitability and pricing 
strategies.
Regulatory shifts in global 
jurisdictions may lead to 
re-certifications, delays 
in product approvals, or 
additional compliance costs.
Geopolitical conflicts or 
instability, especially in 
countries with manufacturing 
bases or sourcing 
dependencies, could result in 
operational disruptions.
1.	 Reducing Supply Chain 
Diversification dependency on 
single-country by diversifying 
suppliers across geographies.
	
Establishing alternate vendors 
and strategic inventory buffers 
for critical APIs and raw 
materials. 
2.	 Regulatory Preparedness
	
Maintaining a dedicated 
Regulatory Affairs Team to 
monitor and comply with 
evolving global regulatory 
requirements.
	
Engaging with consultants 
and experts for faster product 
registration and compliance 
3.	 Active participation in industry 
bodies and trade associations 
to stay updated on policy 
changes and influence 
regulatory dialogue
Negative: Geopolitical events 
like wars, internal conflict, 
changes in governments 
and polices can have effect 
the way we do our business 
in distribution and client 
deliveries and possibility in 
increase in costs

Supply chain 
sustainability
Risk
The Company operates in a 
highly regulated and sensitive 
ecosystem, where supply 
chain sustainability plays 
a pivotal role in ensuring 
uninterrupted manufacturing, 
quality assurance, and 
timely delivery of essential 
medicines.
Given the increasing 
dependence on global 
supply networks, especially 
for Active Pharmaceutical 
Ingredients (APIs), excipients, 
and packaging materials, 
any disruption—whether 
due to geopolitical tensions, 
pandemics, trade barriers, 
environmental regulations, 
or supplier non-compliance—
poses a significant 
operational and  
reputational risk.
At the same time, 
strengthening and 
diversifying the supply 
chain in alignment with 
ESG criteria presents an 
opportunity to build long-term 
resilience, improve supplier 
collaboration, reduce carbon 
footprint, and meet evolving 
stakeholder and regulatory 
expectations. Sustainable 
sourcing, ethical labour 
practices, and transparency 
throughout the value chain 
are increasingly becoming 
key differentiators in the 
pharmaceutical sector.
The company has adopted a multi-
pronged and proactive approach:
Supplier Diversification & 
Localization:
Reducing over-dependence 
on a supplier by identifying 
alternate sources, encouraging 
domestic sourcing, and leveraging 
government schemes.
Inventory Buffering & Critical 
Stocking:
Maintaining safety stock of critical 
raw materials to mitigate the 
impact of supply delays or quality 
issues.
By implementing the above 
measures, the company aims 
to strengthen its supply chain 
continuity, ensure regulatory 
compliance, and advance long-
term sustainability objectives.
Negative: Increased 
procurement costs due to 
diversification of suppliers 
and ESG-compliant sourcing 
practices.
Higher operational expenses 
from inventory holding, 
real-time monitoring 
systems, supplier audits, and 
compliance training.
Potential revenue loss due 
to supply disruptions caused 
by geopolitical tensions, 
environmental factors, or  
non-compliant suppliers.

Product and 
quality risk
Risk
In the pharmaceutical sector, 
product and quality risk is a 
critical consideration due to 
its direct impact on patient 
safety, brand reputation, 
regulatory compliance, 
and market access. Strict 
regulatory environments 
demand consistent 
adherence to quality 
protocols and manufacturing 
standards. Any deviation or 
lapse in quality can result in 
product recalls, regulatory 
action, and loss of  
consumer trust.
To mitigate product and quality 
risks, the company has adopted 
a multi-layered quality assurance 
and compliance framework, which 
includes:
Stringent Quality Control (QC) and 
Quality Assurance (QA) Systems
Implementation of Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) 
aligned with global standards. Use 
of validated and automated quality 
testing procedures to minimize 
human error.
Robust Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs)
Regular review and updating of 
SOPs across manufacturing, 
packaging, and storage.
Continuous training programs for 
employees to ensure adherence.
Regulatory Surveillance and 
Internal Audits
Periodic internal audits and third-
party inspections to proactively 
detect non-compliance.
Monitoring of regulatory changes 
across all active markets.
Negative:
Regulatory Fines & Penalties:
Non-adherence to GMP or 
pharmacovigilance norms 
can attract substantial fines, 
warning letters, or import 
bans, impacting revenue.
Market Access Loss:
Suspension of approvals in 
key markets (US/EU) disrupts 
sales, leading to lost contracts 
and revenue shortfalls.
Reputational Damage: Brand 
erosion following quality 
incidents can depress share 
price, reduce market share, 
and increase customer 
acquisition costs.
