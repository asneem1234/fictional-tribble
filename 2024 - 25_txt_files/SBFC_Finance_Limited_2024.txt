Sustainable 
Finance
O
Financing has an 
important role to play in 
enabling businesses and 
economies to transition to 
a sustainable economy.
The MSME sector in India 
is one of the key drivers 
of the economy and 
significantly contributes 
to the country’s GDP as 
well as employment. As a 
financial services company, 
we recognize that directing 
capital towards such 
enterprises presents a 
substantial opportunity for 
us to make a meaningful 
impact. We firmly believe 
that achieving financial 
success should be 
intricately linked with our 
contribution to the greater 
good of society.
Being an NBFC, focusing on 
providing loans to businesses 
and individuals in the MSME 
sector that are underserved, 
we are addressing a major 
financing gap, thus, enables 
such businesses and 
entrepreneurs obtain loans 
to scale up their operations, 
improve efficiency or for other 
business expansion related 
purposes.
Our efforts involve placing a 
heightened focus on providing 
loans to entrepreneurs and 
small businesses with a focus 
on sustainability and inclusive 
growth.
Sustainable finance offers 
positive financial benefits 
to SBFC by enhancing risk 
management, improving 
access to capital, and driving 
long-term value creation 
through responsible and 
resilient business practices
1.	
Attracting Impact 
Investors: Sustainable 
finance initiatives 
often attract, impact 
investors and 
institutions focused on 
impactful investments. 
By aligning with 
sustainability goals, we 
may gain access to a 
new source of funding 
and partnerships	
with organizations that 
are keen on supporting 
socially responsible 
initiatives.
2.	
Risk Mitigation: 
Assessing and 
promoting sustainability 
in lending can help 
identify risks and 
opportunities more 
effectively. It can lead to 
better risk management 
by avoiding industries 
or projects with high 
risks, reducing the 
likelihood of loan 
defaults and losses
3.	
Improved Reputation: 
Incorporating 
sustainability into 
your business model 
can enhance your 
brand image and 
reputation. Customers, 
especially those from 
younger generations, 
are increasingly 
choosing businesses 
that align with their 
values, including 
environmental and 
social responsibility.

Climate 
Change
R
We recognize that climate 
change, poses a risk to our 
operations, our clients, and 
the broader economy.
We are committed to 
addressing climate change 
risks through proactive 
measures. We are primarily 
into mortgage loan and we 
have created policy around 
excluded activities. We 
exclude funding of loan in 
production of, or trade in, any 
product or activity deemed 
illegal under applicable local 
or national laws or regulations 
or subject to internationally 
agreed phase- outs or bans as 
defined in global conventions 
and agreements.
Financial Implications 
(Negative): We acknowledge 
that climate change related 
risks may have adverse 
financial implications for 
SBFC Finance Limited. These 
risks include the potential 
for increased loan defaults, 
reduced asset values, and 
losses on investments in 
sectors vulnerable to climate 
impacts, such as fossil fuels 
and agriculture.

Financial 
Inclusion	
and Capacity 
Building
O
MSMEs contribute 
significantly to India’s 
growth story by making 
up a substantial portion 
of the country’s GDP 
as well as employment. 
However, they do not 
have required access to 
formal credit or lending. 
As a result, financing 
becomes a major obstacle 
for such entrepreneurs 
and business owners as 
traditional banks do not 
provide financing tailored 
to their requirements. 
At SBFC, we aim to fill 
this gap by providing 
financing opportunities to 
business owners who are 
underserved and further 
unlocking India’s growth 
story. We are also deeply 
associated with uplifting 
other marginalized groups 
of the society including 
women, rural and local 
borrowers, people in old 
age etc., ensuring overall 
inclusion.
As an NBFC engaged in 
providing loans to small 
businesses and entrepreneurs 
in the MSME sector, women, 
and other marginalized 
groups, our business model 
aligns with key principles 
of financial inclusion. Some 
of our current approaches 
to capture the opportunity 
include,
1.	
Partnerships: 
Collaborating with 
government agencies, 
non- governmental 
organizations, and other 
stakeholders to promote 
financial inclusion and 
address challenges 
effectively. Through 
partnerships, we can 
leverage expertise, 
resources, and networks 
to scale our impact.
2.	
Data and Analytics: 
Leveraging data 
and analytics to 
identify regions and 
communities that 
have limited access to 
financial services. This 
data-driven approach 
will enable us to 
prioritize our efforts 
and allocate resources 
where they are most 
needed.
3.	
Ethical Selling 
and Responsible 
Marketing: Ensuring 
the highest quality of 
ethics during sale of 
our products. Through 
our training programs 
we ensure that all the 
product related terms 
and conditions are 
appropriately explained 
to the customer during 
the loan process. In 
case of grievances 
or complaints, the 
customer can raise their 
grievance to us through 
multiple channels at 
their disposal.
Embracing financial inclusion 
and capacity building as 
an opportunity can lead to 
several positive financial	
implications:
1.	
Market Expansion: 
Reaching previously 
underserved markets 
can expand our 
customer base and 
unlock new business 
opportunities.
2.	
Customer Loyalty and 
Retention: Providing 
tailored financial 
solutions can foster 
customer loyalty and 
retention, enhancing 
long-term profitability.
3.	
Reputation 
and Branding: 
Demonstrating our 
commitment to 
financial inclusion 
aligns with evolving 
consumer preferences 
and enhances our 
reputation as a 
socially responsible 
financial institution, 
attracting ethically 
minded customers and 
investors.

employee health and well- 
being presents a significant 
opportunity to create a 
positive and productive 
work environment while 
fostering a culture of care 
and support.
To prioritize employee health 
and well-being, we have 
developed a comprehensive 
approach that demonstrates 
our commitment to our 
most valuable asset - our 
employees:
1.

and insurance coverage 
to ensure that our 
employees have access 
to quality medical care 
and support in times of 
need.

arrangements, such as 
remote work options 
or flexible hours, to 
accommodate the 
diverse needs and 
responsibilities of our 
employees.
Financial Implications 
(Positive): Prioritizing 
employee health and well-
being can lead to several 
positive financial implications
1.	
Increased 
Productivity: 
Healthy and engaged 
employees tend to 
be more productive, 
resulting in improved 
operational efficiency 
and enhanced customer 
service.
2.	
Reduced Absenteeism 
and Turnover: By 
investing in employee 
well-being, we can 
potentially reduce 
absenteeism and 
turnover, leading to 
cost savings associated 
with recruitment and 
training.
3.	
Enhanced Employee 
Engagement: A focus 
on health and well-
being fosters a positive 
work culture, leading 
to higher employee 
satisfaction and 
increased loyalty to the 
organization.
4.	
Attracting Talent: 
Demonstrating our 
commitment to 
employee health and 
well-being makes us 
an attractive employer, 
helping us attract and 
retain top talent in the 
industry.

Customer 
Experience
O
Customer experience is 
a significant opportunity 
to enhance our 
competitiveness and build 
lasting relationships with 
our clients. By delivering 
exceptional services and 
products, we can increase 
customer	 satisfaction, 
retention, and loyalty.
To maximize the opportunity 
of customer experience, we 
have adopted the following 
approach:
Digital Innovation: 
Embracing digitalization 
and leveraging innovative 
technologies through our 
“PhyGital” model which uses 
technology and authentic in-
person service to create loans 
which support the ambitions 
of our customers. We engage 
directly with small business 
owners and work through 
loan applications together, 
in person, at the customer’s 
pace.
Grievance Redressal 
Mechanisms: We have a 
dedicated grievance redressal 
mechanism to promptly 
address customer related 
complaints and grievances 
through multiple channels. 
Each complaint is thoroughly 
reviewed, monitored, and 
resolved to achieve complete 
customer satisfaction. 
To bolster our support, 
a dedicated Grievance 
Redressal Officer is appointed 
and prominently displayed in 
all our branches.
Continuous Improvement: 
Continuously reviewing and 
upgrading our processes and 
systems to stay ahead in the 
dynamic financial landscape 
and provide the best possible 
experience to our customers.
Financial Implications 
(Positive): Improving 
customer experience can 
lead to several positive 
financial implications, such 
as:
Customer Loyalty: Satisfied 
customers are more likely 
to remain loyal and utilize 
a broader range of our 
services, increasing customer 
retention and lifetime value.
Word-of-Mouth Referrals: 
Delighted customers are 
more inclined to refer friends 
and family to our services, 
expanding our customer 
base through word-of- mouth 
referrals.
Competitive Advantage: 
By providing superior 
customer experience, we 
can differentiate ourselves 
from competitors and attract 
new customers seeking 
exceptional financial services.

Data privacy 
and Cyber 
security
R
Data privacy and 
cybersecurity is a 
significant risk for us due to 
the potential financial and 
reputational consequences 
of data breaches. In 
the event of a security 
breach, sensitive	
customer information 
could be exposed, leading 
to regulatory fines, legal 
liabilities, loss of customer 
trust, and damage to the 
company’s brand image. 
Ensuring robust data 
protection measures is 
essential to safeguard 
the interests of both 
the institution and its 
customers.
We have a well-defined 
framework and policy on cyber 
security and data privacy. This 
policy assures users that all 
personal information provided 
through the website is treated 
with the utmost confidentiality 
and is not shared with third 
parties in most circumstances, 
unless explicitly solicited and 
permitted by the user.
In alignment with our 
commitment to providing 
safe and secure banking 
services, we have a defined 
cyber security and data 
privacy policy for client data 
protection. Our Phygital 
Model blends technology with 
human touch, allowing us to 
understand and underwrite 
credit for our valued 
customers effectively.
Financial Implications 
(Negative): Data privacy and 
cybersecurity risks can have 
several adverse financial 
implications for us at SBFC. 
Some of these implications 
include, but not limited to,
1.	
Reputation Damage: 
A data breach or 
cybersecurity incident 
can severely impact our 
reputation, leading to a 
loss of customer trust 
and potential business 
opportunities
2.	
Financial Losses: 
Cyberattacks may result 
in financial losses, 
such as regulatory 
fines, legal costs, and 
compensating affected 
customers for any 
damages incurred.

Economic

to expand their lending 
capabilities and reach a 
wider customer base. It 
enhance ability to offer 
competitive interest

Business 
Ethics and 
Governance
R/ O
At SBFC, we recognize 
that having strong 
Business Ethics and 
Governance present 
significant opportunities 
for us to establish 
ourselves as responsible 
and trustworthy 
organization in the 
financial industry. This 
is particularly crucial 
considering the inherent 
risks associated with 
the financial sector, and 
the need to safeguard 
the interests of 
customers, investors, and 
stakeholders.
The evolving financial 
regulatory landscape 
places greater emphasis 
on ethical conduct, 
transparent disclosures, 
customer protection, 
and responsible lending 
practices.
By adhering to strong 
ethical practices and 
adopting robust governance 
mechanisms, we seek to 
enhance our reputation in 
the market. Trust is a vital 
asset in the financial sector, 
and customers are more 
likely to engage with an 
organization that prioritizes 
ethics and governance. 
We have a strong Code 
of Conduct at place along 
with other policies to ensure 
that ethical practices are 
upheld at all times and 
throughout the hierarchy of 
our operational system.
At SBFC, we have 
developed robust 
governance frameworks, 
ethical business practices, 
and proactive	
compliance management 
systems that position us 
to mitigate regulatory 
risks while capitalizing on 
emerging opportunities 
such as faster approvals,	
 preferential partnerships, 
and enhanced investor 
confidence.
Financial Implications 
(Positive)-
Ethical behavior improves 
the reputation of the 
company, attracting 
more customers, thereby 
increasing revenue. It may 
also help to attract more 
investments and capital. 
Compliance with ethical 
standards reduces legal and 
regulatory expenses and 
also facilitate easier access 
to capital markets for further 
growth.
Regulatory Sanctions 
(Negative): Failure to 
adhere to these ethical 
and governance standards 
exposes SBFC to regulatory 
sanctions, reputational 
damage, and financial 
penalties.

Risk 
Management
R/ O
Risk Management 
presents a significant 
opportunity for SBFC 
since it helps us to 
enhance our stability, 
resilience, and 
sustainable growth.  
As we operate in an 
inherently risk-prone 
financial	 environment, 
effective risk 
management strategies 
help us minimize 
our losses, maintain 
regulatory compliance, 
and enhance investor 
confidence which in turn 
helps us in optimizing our 
capital allocations, thus 
maximizing returns on 
investments.
We have a highly 
comprehensive risk 
management strategy 
that helps us to navigate 
uncertainties and achieve 
long term success in our 
business.
We have identified potential 
sources of risks specific 
to our business model, 
operations and industry 
and accordingly we have 
implemented risk mitigation 
strategies and controls to 
reduce the likelihood and 
impact of the identified risks.
We have also established 
a robust system to 
continuously monitor risks 
and ensure the proper 
approach towards mitigation 
of the risks.
Financial Implications 
(Positive)-
A comprehensive risk 
management strategy 
will positively impact our 
financial performance by 
reducing losses, enhancing 
profitability, optimizing 
capital allocation, improving 
creditworthiness, ensuring 
compliance, attracting 
investments, and fostering 
customer trust.
Proactive management of 
risks reduces the likelihood 
and severity of financial 
losses and avoid potential 
expenses associated with 
managing and recovering 
from risk related incidents.
It positions the company 
as a stable and reliable 
financial institution, 
supporting sustainable 
growth and success in 
the competitive financial 
industry.

Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any,may

Outcome of the initiative
1.	
In strict adherence to the guidelines laid out by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), lending companies are mandated 
to furnish welcome kits to their borrowers. To align with these directives and bolster sustainable practices, SBFC has 
transitioned to delivering digital welcome kits to all borrowers. This strategic shift has yielded twofold benefits. Firstly, 
it has substantially curtailed direct paper consumption, leading to reduction in our ecological footprint. Secondly, by 
circumventing the need for physical transit, the initiative has tangibly minimized indirect fuel consumption, contributing to 
a more environmentally conscious operation.
2.	
All loan documentation files stored in our warehouses were meticulously digitized and are now accessible in electronic 
format. This transformation has notably diminished the need for physical transportation of files across various locations, 
thus significantly decreasing indirect fuel consumption. Formerly, these files necessitated transport for verification, audit, 
and inspection purposes. As a result of this forward-looking endeavor, we have not only streamlined our operational 
processes but also achieved a substantial reduction in our carbon emissions footprint.

(a)	
Do you have a preferential procurement policy where you give preference to purchase from suppliers comprising 
marginalized/vulnerable group
	
	
Being a NBFC, our service offerings include financial products and services to a wide range of consumers. Since 
such activities neither involve procurement of raw materials, nor production of tangible goods, the procurement 
activities associated with our operations remain low and of limited scope. However, we are committed to uphold 
and promote sustainability throughout our value chain, including the aspect of the materials we procure for our 
day-to-day functioning including administrative needs at offices and branches. Consequently, we have Sustainable 
Procurement Policy that reflects our commitment to incorporate sustainable practices and develop a holistic 
approach to address ESG risks across our value chain. For the limited procurement activities that we conduct, we 
ensure that they are conducted in a manner that aligns our ESG principles and objectives catering to sustainable 
value chains.
	
(b)	
From which marginalized/vulnerable groups do you procure?
	
	
While our current activities do not involve the procurement of raw materials or the production of tangible goods, 
our procurement activities associated with operations are currently negligible. Nevertheless, we are dedicated to a 
future where we actively enhance representation from diverse groups within our value chain whenever applicable.
