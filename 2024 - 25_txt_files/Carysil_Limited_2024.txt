During the financial year, the Company was levied monetary penalties 
by the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE 
Limited (BSE) for non-compliance with the provisions of Regulation 
19(1) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, relating to the composition of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC). The Company duly remitted the 
penalties to both NSE and BSE for the said non-compliance.
The deviation was inadvertent and unintentional. Notwithstanding 
the technical non-compliance, the NRC continued to comprise a 
majority of Independent Directors during the relevant period, thereby 
preserving the spirit of independent decision-making. The Committee 
was reconstituted on August 8, 2024, and now comprises four Non-
Executive Independent Directors and one Executive Director, in full 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
The Company has strengthened its internal governance and 
compliance processes to ensure such instances do not recur.
