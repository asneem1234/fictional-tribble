5. Does the entity have a framework/policy on cyber security and risks related to 
data privacy? (Yes/No) If available, provide a web-link of the policy.
In alignment with our commitment to maintain the utmost security and confidentiality of the information systems 
and associated data, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive cyber risk management policy that 
adheres to industry best practices and regulatory standards. Here is an overview of our core cybersecurity strategies:
1.  Firewall Management: Utilizing advanced Dell Sonic Firewall devices, we have updated our firewalls with the 
latest anti-virus packages. These are configured with stringent policies to restrict both external and internal 
access, with WAN policies explicitly limiting external accessibility.
2.  Network Configuration: Our network leverages MPLS connectivity and Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
implementations across various locations, thereby ensuring secure and seamless access to data and our 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.
3.  Malware Defense: We have positioned our servers behind firewalls with updated anti-virus software capable of 
scanning and neutralizing a wide spectrum of malicious threats, including Malware, Ransomware, and various 
other viruses.
4.  Data Backup and Recovery: Comprehensive in-house data secure management is maintained, with backups 
conducted bi-daily and redundant copies stored on cloud.
5.  Technical Team Oversight: A dedicated and experienced technical team is in place to manage the firewalls, 
servers, and network infrastructure.
6.  Mobile Device Management (MDM): The implementation of MDM ensures that emails are configured by the IT 
team exclusively on senior officers' devices, following precise management guidelines.
7.  Domain Policy Enforcement: We employ stringent Domain Group Policies to restrict users from attaching 
unauthorized mobile devices, and to govern Internet usage across the organization.
8.  Email Security: Utilization of Microsoft's O365 suite provides robust virus and spam management capabilities, 
enhancing email security.
9.  IT Department Security: The IT department across all locations is safeguarded through restricted access to 
authorized personnel only, further mitigating potential internal threats.
10.  Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: Our cyber risk management policy ensures compliance with all 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, providing an additional layer of assurance to our investors.
These advanced technical implementations underline our robust approach to cybersecurity, emphasizing both 
proactive and reactive strategies to safeguard the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of our digital assets. We 
continually assess and update our security posture to align with emerging threats and technological advancements, 
reflecting our unwavering commitment to protect shareholder value and uphold our reputation as a secure and 
trustworthy organization.
