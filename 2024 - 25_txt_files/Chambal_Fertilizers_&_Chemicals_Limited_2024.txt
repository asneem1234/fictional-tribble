1.
Safety and 
working 
conditions
Risk
Safety and working conditions are 
important due to the inherent hazards 
associated with handling of Ammonia 
in a fertiliser plant. Ensuring employee 
safety, mitigating environmental impact 
and adhering to regulations are therefore 
paramount. Safety incidents can lead to 
loss of life, damage reputation and incur 
significant financial costs.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
a comprehensive Health & Safety 
Management System aligned with ISO 
45001:2018, identifying the risks and 
hazards and preparing appropriate 
mitigation plans. Additionally, the 
Company conducts regular trainings 
and mock drills and has developed 
an on-site disaster management plan 
to enhance preparedness. A three-
tier safety review system operates 
at the plant, management, and safe-
operations committee levels to address 
workplace safety concerns.
Negative
2.
Energy & 
emission 
management
Risk
As a fertiliser Company, energy-intensive 
processes and emissions contribute 
to climate change and environmental 
degradation. 
Prioritizing 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
emission 
reduction 
aligns 
with 
global 
sustainability 
goals, regulatory requirements and 
stakeholder expectations. The incentives 
and subsidies in fertiliser sector are 
also linked to energy optimization. By 
managing energy consumption and 
emissions responsibly, the Company 
has 
enhanced 
its 
environmental 
stewardship, kept its operational cost 
low and ensured a long-term business 
resilience.
The Company is committed to reducing 
energy consumption and has adopted 
several key strategies to achieve 
this goal. These strategies include 
implementing initiatives to reduce 
energy usage, utilizing waste heat, 
pursuing renewable energy options, 
and using energy-efficient products 
wherever 
possible. 
Additionally, 
the Company has engaged process 
licensors to develop and implement 
energy efficiency measures and to 
reduce and offset emissions. Further 
initiatives include conducting periodic 
air quality checks, monitoring stack 
emissions, and implementing the 
plant’s trip interlock system.
Negative
3.
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
Efficient waste management can lead 
to resource recovery, cost savings 
and reduced environmental impact. 
Implementing 
recycling 
and 
waste 
reduction 
practices 
has 
optimized 
resource utilization and lowered disposal 
expenses. Moreover, meeting waste 
management standards and regulatory 
compliance has enabled the Company 
to foster positive relationship with 
stakeholders and reinforces Company’s 
commitment 
to 
environmental 
stewardship.

4.
Water 
Management
Risk
The 
Company’s 
operations 
require 
significant water for various processes 
which may lead to potential impact 
on local water resources. Ensuring 
responsible 
water 
management 
is 
crucial to conserve this vital resource, 
minimize environmental harm and meet 
regulatory requirements.  
The 
Company 
has 
developed 
a 
water management plan to ensure 
business continuity. This plan includes 
construction of anicuts on Kalisindh and 
Parwan Rivers to harvest rainwater for 
process water consumption, Additionally, 
the plan focuses on reuse and recycling 
of 
utilized 
water 
and 
maintaining 
water storage within the complex to 
meet 7-days’ requirement and support 
maintenance work. The Company also 
has an arrangement to draw water from 
the Right Main Canal, Kota as needed, 
especially in drought years.
Positive
5.
Product 
Stewardship
Risk
As the Company deals in fertilisers 
and agri-inputs, the products can 
have implications on soil, water and 
ecosystem health. Failing to prioritize 
responsible product design, usage and 
disposal could lead to environmental 
contamination, harm to biodiversity and 
risks to human health. Non-compliance 
with product safety regulations can 
also result in legal consequences and 
damage the Company’s reputation. 
We deal only in compliant products. 
The Company has taken a conscious 
and responsible decision to focus 
exclusively on promoting and selling 
green triangle chemistry products, 
while refraining from the sale of 
red 
triangle 
chemistry 
products. 
This reflects our commitment to 
ensuring farmer safety, environmental 
sustainability, 
and 
regulatory 
compliance. The Company has a well-
structured farmer advisory programme 
which focuses on sharing awareness 
on promoting responsible usage of 
products, boosting farmers’ income 
and promoting sustainable farming 
practices. Apart from this programme, 
the farm advisory services of the 
Company also include soil and water 
testing services. 
The social media platforms of the 
Company are used to educate farmers 
on safe usage of the products. 
Additionally, a leaflet promoting safe 
and responsible usage of product is 
made part of the product packaging. 
A major milestone in our sustainability 
journey is our collaboration with The 
Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) 
to establish the “CFCL–TERI Centre 
of 
Excellence 
for 
Advanced 
and 
Sustainable 
Agriculture 
Solutions.” 
This partnership aims to develop 
cutting-edge, eco-friendly agricultural 
technologies that improve soil health, 
enhance 
climate 
resilience, 
and 
contribute to national food security.

compliance requirement, but as a key 
enabler of sustainable and responsible 
farming.
6.
Customer 
Centricity
Opportunity
Customer centricity is important to the 
Company as it directly affects farmers’ 
yields and livelihoods. It enables the 
Company to understand customers’ 
situations, perceptions and expectations.

support and farm advisory is crucial 
for building trust, fostering long-term

Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure)
I am pleased to present CFCL’s ESG journey during FY-25. For us, ESG is not merely a responsibility, 
but a strategic imperative to future-proof the business and create long-term stakeholder value.
In the past, we have fortified our approach to sustainability by pro-actively addressing the critical 
environmental challenges, expanding our social impact, and reinforcing robust governance 
practices. The key focus areas included reducing carbon footprint, expanding circularity in 
operations, promoting sustainable agriculture, and enhancing transparency and accountability.
On the environmental front, we achieved a further reduction in specific carbon emissions to 
0.415 MT CO₂ per MT of Urea, and specific water consumption declined to 4.04 m³/MT of Urea. 
Energy-saving initiatives implemented across all the three plants in Gadepan, especially those 
which were implemented during the annual turnaround, delivered better-than-expected 
outcome. We continue to invest in technology upgradation, drive resource efficiency, and 
actively work towards reducing our carbon footprint.
On the social front, our focus is embedded on enhancing stakeholder well-being via a 
comprehensive approach that includes skill development programs, occupational health and 
safety measures, targeted CSR interventions, and inclusive growth initiatives. For the communities 
we serve, efforts of CFCL span critical areas such as education, healthcare, women empowerment, 
livelihood generation, and rural infrastructure development. Collectively, these initiatives 
have positively impacted thousands of lives across the operational ecosystem, reaffirming our 
commitment to inclusive and sustainable development.
A cornerstone of our long-term environmental and social commitment is our drive to empower 
farmers with knowledge and sustainable solutions. Under our flagship ‘Seed-to-Harvest’ program, 
we engaged over 9,000 villages, conducted 11,825 demonstrations, and facilitated soil testing 
of over 10.5 lakh samples. Our collaboration with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to 
establish the “CFCL - TERI Centre of Excellence for Advanced and Sustainable Agriculture Solutions” 
is a significant milestone in our endeavour to develop innovative eco-friendly agri-solutions to 
improve soil health, bolster climate resilience, and support food security. 
The successful launch of Uttam Superrhiza (Biofertilizer) and upcoming introduction of 
biological fungicides and nematicides further underscore our commitment to green farmer-
centric innovation. In addition, our crop residue management initiatives helped to offset 
3.66 lakh tons of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing meaningfully to air quality improvement 
in the region.
On the governance front, we have reinforced the risk management framework and continued 
to embed a culture of integrity and compliance across the Company’s operations. We adopted 
digital monitoring systems, strengthened grievance redressal mechanisms, and maintained 
transparent stakeholder engagement around key ESG themes. Our operational and financial 
discipline is reflected in our impressive performance and zero net debt position.
Going forward, we remain committed to push the boundaries to scale up sustainable technologies, 
deepening community partnerships, and upholding good corporate governance.

If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products / services, as 
identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken 
to mitigate the same. 
Name of Product/ Service
Description of the risk/ concern
Action Taken
Urea
The Life Cycle Assessment identified high 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated 
with the production of Urea, particularly 
from natural gas, used both as a feedstock 
and energy source. The embodied emissions 
of upstream natural gas extraction and 
transportation, coupled with combustion 
emissions 
during 
steam 
and 
power 
generation, 
significantly 
contribute 
to 
climate change impact (394.48 kg CO₂ eq 
per tonne of Urea produced).
The Company has adopted several mitigation 
strategies to reduce environmental impact. 
These include utilizing CO₂ generated from 
ammonia production internally in the urea 
synthesis process (thereby reducing external 
carbon input), optimizing energy efficiency, 
deploying waste heat recovery systems, 
and 
benchmarking 
emissions 
against 
global datasets (Ecoinvent). The study 
estimates an environmental cost savings 
of approximately ₹9 lakh/day through 
mitigation measures compared to standard 
practices. The Company continues to 
pursue technology upgrades and efficiency 
improvements to further minimize lifecycle 
impacts.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
The Company’s Stakeholder Engagement and Advocacy Policy serves as the cornerstone of our approach and commitment to 
stakeholder identification and engagement. We undertake stakeholder mapping exercises periodically to identify key stakeholders, 
enabling us to discern those who exert positive or negative influence on our business operations and are likely to be impacted by 
them. Stakeholders are categorized based on their influence, priority, and impact on the Company’s operations. Our key stakeholders 
encompass Shareholders/Investors, Farmers, Dealers/Distributors, Employees/Workers, Local Community, Contractors/Vendors, Banks/
Financial Institutions, Industry Associations, and State and Central Government entities. 
Stakeholder engagement, collaboration, and dialogue form an integral and ongoing process for shaping long-term value and informing 
business strategies. Through stakeholder engagement initiatives, the Company identifies key material topics which possess the potential 
to impact our business and are of significance to our stakeholders. We recognize that each stakeholder group is unique, with distinct 
needs and priorities. Hence, our stakeholder engagement approach is tailored to accommodate these differences, ensuring that diverse 
perspectives contribute to shaping the Company’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) parameters and guiding our trajectory 
for the future.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
The management of the Company regularly engages with key stakeholders including employees, communities, government authorities, 
investors, customers, etc. These engagements focus on identifying concerns and expectations related to economic, environmental, 
and social (EES) topics. Inputs gathered through these interactions are derived from grassroots-level consultations and day-to-day 
operational feedback.
Insights from stakeholder engagement are systematically analyzed and shared with senior management. The leadership team reviews 
material topics and stakeholder concerns on a periodic basis and channels relevant updates, insights, and recommendations to the 
Board through structured platforms such as quarterly Board meetings and committee-level deliberations.
Board-level committees such as the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee, Risk Management Committee, and Audit 
Committee regularly assesses developments and progress related to EES matters. This process ensures that feedback from stakeholders 
are meaningfully integrated into the Company’s strategic deliberations and that the Board is equipped to take informed decisions 
aligned with sustainability imperatives and stakeholder expectations.
2. 	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). 
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and 
activities of the entity. 
Yes. The Company is committed to inclusive decision-making process involving stakeholders engagement and consultation with 
stakeholders. Issues concerning the environment, society, and community development are identified, prioritized, strategized, and 
implemented. The sub-section below are highlights of stakeholder consultations conducted by the Company:
Materiality mapping
During the Financial Year 2022-23, the Company conducted a Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality Assessment exercise to assess 
and prioritize sustainability within the context of overall business priorities, management, and performance. Key stakeholders were 
consulted, and significant material issues were ranked from low to high importance for both internal and external stakeholders.
Community consultation
As part of its commitment to inclusive community development, the Company conducted a comprehensive need-based assessment 
survey. This included both formal and informal consultations with local community members to understand their needs, aspirations, 
and key social challenges. Based on these insights, targeted action and implementation plans were developed to address the most 
pressing issues:
	
Poor quality of education in Anganwadi centers and shortage of qualified teachers in primary and secondary schools.
	
Insufficient teaching and learning resources, low foundational literacy levels, and inadequate school infrastructure.
	
Limited access to preventive healthcare services in nearby areas.
	
Lack of skill training and post-education employment opportunities for youth.
	
Unhygienic practices, absence of safe drinking water, and inadequate sanitation facilities in schools.
	
Shortage of community infrastructure and recreational spaces in villages.
To address these issues/challenges, the Company has undertaken several interventions over the years, including:
	
Transformation of Anganwadi Centers into vibrant, preschool-aligned spaces with libraries, digital tools, functional toilets, and 
child-friendly furniture.
	
Renovation of Government Schools, addition of classrooms, and creation of inclusive, child-friendly infrastructure with a special 
focus on girl students and marginalized communities.
	
Adoption and upgradation of four Government Primary Health Centers (PHCs) with specialized OPD services, X-ray facilities, 
minor OT units, pathological testing, and maternal care facilities.
71
Additionally, during periodic stakeholder meetings, community members suggest improvement areas in rural development, sanitation, 
hygiene, and waste management. The Company assessed and prioritized the areas of intervention, and action plans were developed 
under the Corporate Social Responsibility program, as detailed below:
	
Established the Chambal Fertilisers Skill Institute offering 5 vocational courses for rural youth.
	
Adopted 4 Public Health Centers (PHCs) to strengthen preventive healthcare services.
	
Expanded waste management programs to more villages with door-to-door segregation and collection.
	
Created alternate livelihoods for women under the “One Village – One Product” model with 4 new centers and 2 dedicated 
buildings.
	
Built rainwater harvesting structures in 5 government schools to aid water conservation.
	
Installed solar panels in 7 Anganwadi centers (1.5 KW) and at the Skill Institute (75 KW).
	
Constructed community halls and installed streetlights in nearby villages.
	
Set up open gyms to encourage fitness in rural communities.
	
Renovated schools and Anganwadi centers to ensure safe learning environments.
	
Launched a three-year CSR project to establish an English medium school for rural children.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder 
groups.
The Company actively engages with rural communities through structured communication and inclusive stakeholder engagement plans, 
ensuring meaningful participation of vulnerable and marginalized groups, including women, youth, and marginalized populations.
Rooted in the ethos of “Investing Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow,” the Company’s CSR framework spans eight thematic areas: 
Education (including technical and vocational training), Rural Development, Healthcare & Sanitation, Employability & Empowerment, 
Environmental Sustainability, Animal Welfare & Soil Health, Disaster Management, and Sports Promotion — all aligned with the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Key actions addressing the concerns of vulnerable groups include:
	
Skill Development for Rural Youth and Women: Chambal Fertilisers Skill Institute provides short-term vocational training to 
rural youth, with a focus on training young women. From October 2024 to March 2025, over 150 youth were trained in job-oriented 
courses like General Duty Assistant, Banking Correspondent & Facilitator, and Customer Relationship Management, achieving a 
100% placement rate. Village-based vocational training programs further empower young women to start local enterprises.
	
Access to Healthcare: Adoption of four Government Primary Health Centers has improved rural healthcare delivery by upgrading 
facilities and introducing services such as OPD consultations, diagnostics, minor surgeries, and institutional deliveries—benefiting 
especially those with limited access to medical care.
	
Rural Infrastructure for Inclusion: The Company has invested in building community infrastructure like cement concrete roads, 
drainage systems, and rejuvenated ponds, along with creating safe and inclusive community spaces to enhance the quality of life 
for all residents, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds.
Through these targeted initiatives, the Company continues to foster inclusive development and drive rural transformation in the 
communities surrounding the Gadepan plant.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company’s waste management practices are robust, reflecting our strong commitment to environmental stewardship and 
sustainable operations. Across our facilities, we adhere to a well-defined strategy aimed at minimizing ecological impact and promoting 
responsible utilization of resources. 
At the core of our waste management framework is the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3R) principle, which governs our approach to managing 
effluents generated during operations. A substantial portion of the water used in our processes comprises recycled effluents treated 
through a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant. The treated water is reused as make-up water in cooling towers. The RO reject is further processed 
through a Zero Liquid Discharge system, which includes a Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) and the resulting waste is sent to the cement 
industry for co-processing. Additionally, our Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) are equipped with tertiary treatment systems, and the 
treated wastewater is effectively utilized for green belt maintenance within the premises. 
For solid and hazardous waste management, we employ best-in-class practices guided by proper waste categorization. Dedicated waste 
bins are placed strategically across our facilities to encourage proper segregation and disposal. Horticultural waste is composted into 
organic manure, and the use of polythene bags is strictly prohibited to minimize plastic pollution. 
In our efforts to continuously improve, we have achieved noteworthy progress in diverting waste from landfills. During financial 
year 2024-25, 85.63% of waste from our RO-ZLD (Reverse Osmosis - Zero Liquid Discharge) plant was sent to the cement industry for 
co-processing, significantly reducing landfill burden. Periodic audits by external consultants are conducted to ensure adherence to the 
best environmental practices, and any identified gaps are promptly addressed through corrective actions. 
We also emphasize on employee and contractor awareness, regularly conducting training and sensitization programs on responsible 
waste management. Hazardous wastes, such as used oil and spent catalysts, are sold only to registered recyclers, and contaminated 
material is disposed of through approved methods like incineration. 
In line with our resource recovery initiatives, biodegradable waste is processed in our biogas plant with the generated biogas used for 
cooking and the residual liquid manure applied in horticulture. Other waste streams, such as e-waste, battery waste, biomedical waste, 
and construction & demolition debris, are managed in strict compliance with applicable environmental regulations.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
Installation of the thermo-compressor in Urea-III 'A' train
In the existing configuration of Urea-III, 
steam condensate is flashed in a low-
pressure steam flash drum, generating 
saturated low-pressure(SLL) steam at 
2.5 kg/cm²g and 138 °C. Approximately 
2.0 MT/hr of this steam per urea train 
is produced in excess and previously 
vented to the atmosphere, resulting 
in energy loss and environmental 
impact. To improve energy efficiency 
and reduce steam wastage, a thermo-
compressor is being installed. This 
technology recovers and pressurizes 
the low-grade steam, enabling its 
redirection to a steam turbine for 
effective utilization in downstream 
processes. 
This modification is expected 
to 
save 
approximately 
0.9 MT/hr of high-pressure 
steam, leading to enhanced 
energy efficiency, reduced 
fuel consumption, and a 
corresponding decrease in 
associated emissions.
Note : Energy saving schemes has been implemented in March-2025. Actual annual energy shall be realized in financial year  2025-2026.

quickly restore the critical business functions, in the event of a disruption of normal operations. As part of the Business Continuity Plan, 
the Company has identified the events, the occurrence of which may impact particular functions or facilities resulting into disruption of 
normal operations of business. The Business Continuity Plan forms part of the Risk Management Policy of the Company.
Risk Mitigation measures for the identified business interruption factors have been prepared and implemented by the Company to 
ensure business continuity. 
The Company also has a disaster management plan with detailed disaster control measures, and keeping it up to date is the obligation 
of the Occupier of the factory. The scope of the plan covers the existing activities/facilities and is aimed at:
	
Quick relief and rescue operation without delay.

mitigation and emergency preparedness. To maintain a high state of readiness, mock drills are conducted every six months and fire 
drills are carried out every three months, in line with the stipulations of the Disaster Management Plan. The plan is periodically reviewed 
and updated to reflect process changes, technological advancements, and learnings from previous drills.
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation 
measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
Impact
Mitigation
The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) undertaken for Urea production 
at Chambal Fertilisers’ Gadepan complex identified significant 
environmental impacts arising from upstream activities in the 
value chain, primarily due to the use of natural gas as a feedstock 
and energy source. The impact includes:
	
High embodied emissions from natural gas extraction, 
processing, and transportation.
	
Methane leakage during upstream operations, which poses 
a potent climate risk given methane’s high global warming 
potential.
	
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with direct 
combustion of natural gas for steam and power generation.
These upstream activities contribute to Scope 3 emissions, which 
constituted around 68% of total emissions for Urea production 
The Company has implemented a series of mitigation and 
adaptation measures. A key initiative involves the complete 
utilization of carbon dioxide generated during ammonia 
production in the subsequent urea synthesis process, thereby 
reducing the need for external carbon inputs and minimizing 
emissions. The Company has also installed waste heat recovery 
systems to improve energy efficiency by capturing and reusing 
thermal energy from high-temperature processes. Additionally, 
operational processes have been optimized to reduce steam and 
electricity consumption, thereby lowering the overall energy 
intensity. As quantified in the LCA report, these mitigation efforts 
collectively contribute to an estimated environmental damage 
cost avoidance of approximately ₹9 lakh per day. CFCL continues to 
pursue further improvements in resource efficiency and emissions 
reduction across its operations.

along with our farm advisory services, including farmer training programs, crop demonstrations, and soil and water testing services, 
underscore our commitment to promoting sustainable and responsible farming practices.
Additionally, our social media platforms serve as valuable channels for educating farmers on safe product usage. Moreover, we ensure 
that product packaging includes a leaflet promoting safe and responsible usage of our products.
Expanding on our efforts, the Company has launched the “Uttam Balanced Nutrition Campaign (USPA)” project, spanning from 2023 to 
2027. This five-year endeavor aims to educate farmers on modern techniques for improving soil health and crop production. The project 
involves demonstrations on balanced fertilizer application, alternative sources of fertilizers, and organic fertilizers. The project’s objective 
is to enhance agricultural yield and productivity, while reducing chemical usage and mitigating its adverse environmental effects.
Furthermore, selected farmers’ fields undergo testing to determine suitable fertilizers, with agricultural experts regularly inspecting 
crops and collecting data on vegetative growth and yield. These field demonstrations serve to showcase different techniques and their 
impact on crop production.
To enhance accessibility and engagement, we have introduced a Whatsapp bot solution named “Uttam Samadhan.” This solution enables 
automated interaction with farmers, providing them with essential information about our products and practices. The said solution is 
available in five languages i.e. Hindi, English, Marathi, Punjabi, and Telugu. This solution ensures that users can access information in their 
preferred language, facilitating effective communication and learning.
