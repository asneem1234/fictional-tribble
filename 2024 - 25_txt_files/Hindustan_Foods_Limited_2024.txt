1.
Business 
Continuity 
Plan and 
Disaster 
Resilience
Risk
HFL’s Business Continuity Plan 
(BCP) 
primarily 
focuses 
on 
identifying the resources and 
capabilities 
required 
by 
the 
organisation to prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from 
potential threats. These potential 
threats 
include 
homogeneity 
in the customer portfolio, the 
location 
of 
operations, 
and 
inadequate succession planning. 
Furthermore, 
HFL 
considers 
political issues in various areas 
of 
facilities 
and 
operational 
interruptions due to equipment 
breakdown.
Additionally, 
HFL 
considers 
disasters or emergencies at 
facilities or the head oﬃce 
resulting from natural disasters 
such as earthquakes, hurricanes, 
storms/cyclones, lightning, etc., 
as well as ﬁre, explosions, riots, 
terrorism, and power failures.
HFL’s 
key 
measures 
for 
the 
Business 
Continuity 
Plan 
include 
establishing 
operational 
units 
across 
India 
and 
implementing 
proper succession planning. 
A major focus is to diversify 
the customer base and 
avoid overdependence on a 
select few.
Ice-cream 
manufacturing 
capacities 
created 
in 
Nashik and Sandila oﬀers 
risk 
mitigation 
for 
our 
customers 
providing 
alternate production centres 
in the event of any disaster/
emergency.
Additionally, 
all 
manufacturing 
facilities 
have well-prepared disaster 
management 
plans 
and 
are equipped for disaster 
preparedness.
Positive: 
Impact of 
HFL’s key 
measures on 
the business 
continuity 
plan. However, 
costs can 
be incurred 
negatively 
during the 
time of disaster 
preparedness.
2.
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
The rapidly changing regulatory 
environment and adapting to 
major regulatory changes can 
cost the Company more.
In its current practice, HFL is 
compliant with all applicable 
laws and regulations. HFL 
always follows updates in 
the regulatory framework.
Positive: 
Ensuring 
compliance 
with all 
applicable laws 
and regulations 
fosters a 
positive 
environment 
for businesses.

3.
Business 
Ethics and 
Conduct and 
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
HFL operates within a context 
where it faces risks associated 
with 
corporate 
governance 
and ethical business practices. 
Engaging in unethical conduct 
can signiﬁcantly damage the 
Company’s 
reputation 
and 
result in ﬁnancial repercussions, 
such as ﬁnes and penalties. On 
the other hand, implementing 
strong corporate governance 
practices contributes to the 
long-term 
sustainability 
and 
resilience of the business.
HFL recognises that good 
corporate governance plays 
a vital role in establishing 
trust among stakeholders, 
including 
shareholders, 
employees, the environment, 
and 
the 
communities 
it 
serves. 
Corporate 
governance is seen as an 
essential 
component 
of 
eﬀective 
management 
at 
HFL, and the Company is 
committed to upholding the 
highest standards of integrity, 
ensuring compliance with 
laws and internal policies. To 
facilitate this, the Board of 
Directors has implemented a 
Code of Conduct Policy and 
a Whistle Blower Policy that 
applies to all.
HFL has established various 
committees 
dedicated 
to 
sustainability matters. As per 
the Companies Act, 2013, HFL 
has a CSR Committee, which 
is a committee of the Board 
duly constituted to formulate 
and 
recommend 
CSR 
activities to be undertaken by 
the Company to the Board. 
Additionally, HFL has a Risk 
Management 
Committee 
that consists of a framework 
for identifying internal and 
external 
risks 
speciﬁcally 
faced 
by 
the 
Company, 
which also includes ESG-
related risks.
Positive: Good 
governance 
leads to ethical 
actions and 
stronger 
stakeholder 
relationships.

4.
Climate 
Change
Risk
Customer 
expectations 
are 
leaning 
towards 
embracing 
sustainability and implementing 
a low-carbon transition plan. This 
shift is due to the rapidly growing 
focus on climate change and 
responsible operations. As a 
result, the Company has taken a 
proactive stance towards climate 
change and the management 
of its emissions, recognising 
the complexity of this process. 
Moreover, 
companies 
are 
facing regulatory expectations 
concerning 
their 
eﬀorts 
to 
address climate change.
The Company is focusing 
on the importance of GHG 
emission 
reduction 
and 
eﬀective utilization of energy 
by 
selecting 
appropriate 
low-carbon 
transition 
technologies. 
Currently, 
Bio briquette is being used 
at 
some 
manufacturing 
facilities. 
The 
Company 
identiﬁed opportunities for 
improving energy eﬃciency. 
The Company has taken 
steps to increase renewable 
energy 
sourcing 
for 
its 
power 
requirement 
for 
three of its major facilities, 
through participation in a 
Group Captive arrangement 
under an SPV.
Negative: 
In the short 
term, there 
are capital 
and operating 
expenditures 
involved in 
the adoption 
of renewable 
energy sources 
and switching 
to cleaner 
fuels.
5.
Operational 
Excellence
Opportunity
Operational 
excellence 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
business 
performance. It can be achieved 
by implementing and executing 
its day-to-day business better 
than its peers. It focuses on 
continuous improvement and 
lower costs when compared to 
competitors in their market and 
industry.
HFL 
has 
implemented 
various strategies to achieve 
operational excellence in 
manufacturing 
activities. 
These 
strategies 
include 
improving the eﬃciency of 
the equipment, increasing 
safety 
standards 
and 
measures, enhancing the 
quality 
of 
the 
products 
being 
developed, 
and 
evaluating the process for 
improvement opportunities.
HFL has also implemented 
the 5S model and has been 
accredited with certiﬁcations 
such as ISO 9001:2008, 
BRC Food Certiﬁcates, and 
ISO 14001. Additionally, HFL 
aims to continually improve 
the organisation by focusing 
on customer requirements 
and process optimization.
Positive: Due 
to the increase 
in Productivity

Employee 
and Workers 
Wellness 
Engagement 
and Talent 
Attraction and 
Retention
Opportunity
HFL 
believes 
that 
healthy 
employees and workers lead to a 
healthy Company. They prioritise 
wellness and enthusiasm to 
create the best place to work, 
which, in turn, attracts more 
talent to the Company.
The availability of skilled Indian 
workers at relatively lower costs 
provides a signiﬁcant advantage 
for companies to outsource 
and access a large pool of 
trained workers, which will 
help meet increasing business 
requirements.
HFL 
provides 
additional 
wellness 
beneﬁts 
to 
its 
employees, 
such 
as 
recognition, 
leadership, 
and 
behavioural 
training, 
in addition to maintaining 
work-life balance and overall 
health. HFL’s success largely 
depends on our highly skilled 
workers and our ability to 
hire, attract, motivate, retain, 
and train these personnel.
There are 
positive 
ﬁnancial 
implications 
resulting from 
the quality and 
productivity 
of their 
employees’ 
work.
7.
Workers 
Development 
and Skill 
Building
Opportunity
Worker development and skill 
development provide an excellent 
opportunity for Company to 
thrive. By investing in improving 
our workforce’s expertise, HFL 
open the door to a brighter future 
ﬁlled with top-tier talent and a 
highly skilled workforce. This 
business decision ensures that 
our organisation is well-equipped 
to face tomorrow’s challenges 
and ensure long-term growth.
HFL is fortunate to have an 
excellent record of worker 
and 
employee 
relations. 
HFL up-skills the workforce 
constantly through various 
training programmes. These 
investments meet workforce 
aspirations and provide us 
with increasing skill sets 
in a win-win relationship. 
Moreover, 
various 
programmes and initiatives 
taken 
by 
governments 
are further enhancing the 
availability of skilled workers.
Positive: 
Through 
Increased 
revenues
8.
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Community engagement is one 
of the key constituents for HFL 
to maintain harmony with the 
community and ensure smooth 
operations. In the long run, 
support from the communities 
is crucial for HFL’s business 
operations. Therefore, building 
trust between the community 
and HFL’s business operations is 
essential.
HFL ensures that the well-
being of the local community 
is vital to their business. They 
achieve this through various 
CSR initiatives, which not 
only increase reach but 
also ensure the adoption 
of these initiatives by the 
communities.
Positive: It 
creates a 
positive brand 
image and 
goodwill. It 
maintains a 
reputation 
among 
communities.

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Embracing 
gender 
equality, 
diversity, and inclusion helps 
companies attract and retain 
top talent. Promoting these 
principles is not only a matter 
of 
social 
justice 
but 
also 
makes good business sense. 
Companies 
that 
foster 
an 
inclusive environment where 
all 
employees 
feel 
valued 
and respected tend to have 
higher employee engagement, 
satisfaction, and productivity.
HFL focuses on and prioritises 
gender equality. Currently, 
female 
representation 
at
