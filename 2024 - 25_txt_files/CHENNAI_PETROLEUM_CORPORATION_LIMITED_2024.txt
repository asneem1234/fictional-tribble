CPCL exports certain petroleum products like HSD, Naphtha, and LOBS when local supply surpasses demand. These

manufacturer. CPCL's share in exports as a supporting manufacturer is 11.68%.

A brief on types of customers 
	
CPCL primarily concentrates on supplying its petroleum products to its parent company, IOCL. Additionally, it caters to 
nearby petrochemical industries that use these products as essential raw materials for producing finished goods. CPCL 
also directly markets specialty items, including Food Grade Hexane, Mineral Turpentine Oil, and Paraffin Wax, to end 
consumers. Beyond its core petroleum offerings, CPCL further diversifies its portfolio by selling by-products such as 
Sulphur and Petroleum Coke directly to consumers, enhancing its market presence.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
At CPCL, waste is systematically segregated into hazardous and non-hazardous categories. Hazardous waste is managed 
and disposed of in strict accordance with the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) 
Rules, 2016. Non-hazardous waste is directed to authorized recyclers or disposed of through safe and compliant methods.
	
Chemical dosing is continuously monitored and maintained in alignment with specified design parameters. To minimize 
chemical wastage, drainage from processes is collected in a solvent blowdown system or a designated collector and then 
pumped back into the system for recovery and reuse.
	
E-waste: In accordance with E-Waste (Management) Rules, E-waste is being disposed by way of buy-back against new 
procurements or through government approved trading agency. 
	
Hazardous waste: 
	
Spent Catalyst: Spent catalyst bearing precious metals are sent to authorized recyclers for recovery of precious metals, 
co-processing in cement plants and manufacturers of refractories, ceramics etc., or sent for storage in Common 
Hazardous Waste Disposal sites or sites developed within refineries which are constructed with safety features like proper 
impermeable liners, leachate collection system, protection from rain etc. These sites are regularly monitored for ground 
water contamination.
	
Slop Oil: Slop Oil refers to the crude oil settled at the bottom of the tank, which is emulsified with water and solids making 
it unfit for the refining operation. Slop Oil recovered from storage tank and Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) facilities in 
refineries undergoes treatment processes where oil is recovered. This oil is further treated in a storage tank for removal of 
water by using heat and settling time. The resultant water free slop oil is sent for reprocessing in different process units in 
the refinery for recovery of valuable intermediate products which are suitably blended to get finished product. In marketing 
and pipeline locations slop oil is recycled after decanting in sump tank and pumping back to product system.
	
Oily Sludge: The bioremediation process involves mixing the oily sludge with soil and tilling it for proper mixing. Oil-
degrading microbes, along with nutrients, are then spread over the mixture of soil and sludge, followed by additional tilling. 
The mixture is left for the action of microbes for several months. After this period, the sludge is tilled again, and random 
222
59th Annual Report 2024-25
Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited
samples are collected for testing the oil percentage. If the oil content is found to be above 1%, the process is repeated 
until the oil percentage reaches 1% or below. If the oil content is below 1% and the heavy metal concentration is below the 
approved limit, the soil is either disposed off or used within the refinery's battery limit for filling or construction purposes. 
Oily sludge that meets these criteria is sold to authorized recyclers through e-auction.
	
Bio-Medical Waste (BMW): BMW generation, treatment & disposal is guided by Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 
2016. BMW generated is collected and primarily stored at designated place in the hospital and then handed over to an 
outsourced agency approved by TNPCB for treatment and disposal.
	
Battery Waste: Battery waste is disposed of through registered recyclers with buy-back policies
	
Other Hazardous/Recyclable Waste: Disposed of via government approved trading agency by following standard 
procedures

The Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has passed an order in February 2025 levying environmental compensation 
of ₹ 73.68 crore for the environmental and socio-economic damages alleged to be caused due to the oil spill occurred 
during Michaung cyclone in December 2023. 
	
CPCL has contested the levy by TNPCB, and interim stay has been granted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 
March 2025 with condition to deposit/ Furnish Bank Guarantee in respect of 50 % of the portion of demand specified as 
environmental damage in the aforesaid order amounting to ₹19.12 crore till further proceedings. Subsequently, the company 
has complied with the same by submitting a Bank guarantee of ₹ 19.12 Crore on 15.04.2025.

(a)	
NGT on its own motion initiated proceeding regarding Oil leakage in Nagapattinam district based on the news item 
published. Albeit, report of all the Institutions including Joint Committee reported of no adverse environmental impact 
stating that the oil leakage was only due to external impact and hence no remedial measures is recommended, the 
NGT however levied a no-fault liability of ₹ 5 cr to be utilized for environment improvement and health of local people. 
An amount of ₹5 crore has been levied as “no-fault liability”, and the same has been paid.
	
(b)	 TNPCB had raised demand amounting to ₹ 6.24 crore towards environmental compensation, which was accounted 
in the previous year. The same is being contested before the National Green Tribunal and NGT has granted an interim 
stay on the condition that CPCL shall deposit 50% of the environmental compensation representing ₹ 3.12 Crore and 
the same was deposited with TNPCB on 25/4/25.
