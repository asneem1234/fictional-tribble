Environment: The climate 
change
Risk
There is a strong need 
for 
the 
industry 
to 
reduce 
their 
carbon 
footprints amidst the 
growing 
concerns 
of 
global warming.
Increased 
focus 
on energy efficient 
processes 
and 
minimization 
of 
wastes. The company 
has 
declared 
to 
become 
net 
zero 
carbon 
emitting 
corporate by the year 
2035.
Negative: 
The 
initial 
investments 
would be required to install 
clean energy facilities to 
reduce the scope-1 and 
scope-2 emissions of the 
company.
2
Environment: 
To 
offer 
value-added 
and 
clean 
energy technology to the 
clients to meet their energy 
transition objectives.
Opportunity
The 
ongoing 
energy 
transition requires the 
implementation of clean 
energy technologies in 
the energy sector which 
is our core business 
segment. EIL is already 
involved in development 
of 
clean 
energy 
technology both on its 
own or in collaboration 
with 
the 
industry, 
national laboratory and 
academia.
Negative: 
It 
requires 
manpower 
efforts 
in 
development 
of 
green 
energy technologies and 
investments/ funding for 
collaborative clean energy 
technology 
development. 
The investment would be 
largely funded by the R&D 
budget of the company. 
It will help secure more 
business 
in 
the 
clean 
energy segment that will 
significantly 
outnumber 
the initial investment

7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure:
EIL’s new vision statement, “To be a Global Leader Offering Total Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future,” reflects its core 
principles, which are translated into various actions, including a commitment to innovation in sustainable energy fields such 
as green hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). EIL offers diverse sustainable engineering solutions, including effluent 
recycling and zero liquid discharge, innovative water and wastewater management, biodiversity improvement projects like 
Miyawaki forests, and services for carbon footprint estimation and reduction. The company’s efforts in carbon capture, waste-
to-energy solutions, and sustainable infrastructure development underscore its dedication to creating a sustainable future.
As a responsible corporate citizen, EIL is actively reducing its carbon footprint, aiming to become a net-zero carbon-emitting 
corporate entity by 2035. This ambitious goal is supported by strategic initiatives such as enhancing energy efficiency across its 
assets, optimizing HVAC systems with Building Management Systems (BMS), and adopting smart, energy-efficient devices. The 
company is expanding its green energy portfolio through new solar power systems, energy storage solutions, and Compressed 
Biogas utilization. Furthermore, Miyawaki Forest Plantations in its office complexes and a transition to an e-office environment 
are integral to its carbon neutrality roadmap.
To significantly reduce Scope-2 emissions, Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) systems are being installed on rooftops across EIL offices 
and housing complexes nationwide. By FY 2024-25, a total combined capacity of 1292 KWp of SPV has been commissioned and 
is fully operational. In FY 2024-25, the company commissioned approximately 297 kW of additional solar panels at various EIL 
offices across India, further reducing its organizational emissions.
This not only lowers EIL’s direct emissions but also allows for the export of surplus green power to the grid during off-peak 
hours. The long-term plan includes further investment in high-efficiency solar power generation, strict adherence to the 3Rs 
principle (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) for resource conservation, and maximizing the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) for employee 
transportation. A dedicated interdisciplinary team is diligently working to achieve these objectives within defined timelines.
EIL’s commitment to a greener environment extends to community initiatives, such as the development of a Miyawaki forest 
in Gurugram, Haryana. Planted in April 2023, over 8,000 saplings have achieved a remarkable 95% survival rate, enhancing air 
quality, conserving water, and supporting local flora and fauna. Simultaneously, EIL is optimizing resource utilization through the 
widespread adoption of digital platforms across its operations.
Energy Asset Integrity Management is crucial in the current energy transition. EIL has developed advanced IIoT-based digital 
interventions to optimize existing asset performance in refineries. Its digital solutions for enhancing the energy efficiency of 
fired heaters, for instance, have demonstrated significant potential in reducing operational energy requirements, as proven in 
an Indian refinery. The company has also pioneered EngCO2{MÌU, a web-based platform for realistic industrial CO2 footprint 
assessment, employing the latest GHG emission calculation protocols. Through its dedicated Digital Technology Solutions (DTS) 
department, EIL offers a suite of digital products and services tailored to the evolving needs of the energy sector clientele.
In essence, EIL is a pivotal stakeholder, providing ESG-compliant, sustainable, and low-carbon technological solutions to industrial 
sectors on their path to decarbonization.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
 
EIL has certified its HSE Management system to ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health and Safety Management System) and ISO 
14001:2015 (Environmental Management system). An independent department (CQA&HSSE) audits the HSE Management System of all 
divisions/departments including construction sites. The results of these audits are reported to the Management through Management 
Review Committee Meetings. Apart from other agenda, the performance of the HSE Management System and opportunities for 
improvement are presented to the Management in these meetings. A number of improvements pertaining to Health, Safety and 
Environment are triggered and addressed through these meetings. Improvements are also initiated based on the feedbacks received 
on HSE from EIL employees through Feedback Management System (FBMS). Digitization of employee claims, arranging OPD visits of 
various specialists, organizing Health camps, health talks, yoga sessions and improvement in safety processes are few examples.
 
On the engineering front, HSE aspects that are to be addressed in the design and engineering phases are built into the 
procedures/specifications/guidelines of various engineering departments. Exhaustive HSE check lists are in place to ensure that 
these aspects are complied positively during design and engineering phases.
 
Being a renowned engineering consultant in the hydrocarbon sector, EIL deploys proven risk assessment methodologies like 
HAZOP, RRA, QRA, SIL etc. to ensure the process safety of the plants.
 
On the office infrastructure front, EIL is continuously making efforts to provide a Healthy, Safe and environment friendly work 
place to its employees. Mock Evacuation Drills and Fire Safety Trainings are conducted periodically. Incident Reporting System 
has been implemented for ease of reporting of Safety incidents by EIL employees.
 
On the construction front, the specification for HSE Management at construction sites, which specifies the HSE requirements to 
be complied by construction contractors, is revisited periodically to bring it in line with the current trends and to improve the 
HSE performance. Reward and recognition of construction sites based on HSE performance, issue of appreciation certificate 
to the best performing construction contractors, issue of LTA-free certificates to contractors ensure improvement in safety 
awareness. We have in place a mechanism for reporting HSE observations through mobile application which is implemented 
for ease of reporting of Safety non-compliances occurring at EIL sites.
 
HSE Performance Rating system for Construction Sites and HSE award mechanism for Individuals are in place to foster and 
promote HSE culture both at site as well as individual level.
 
To enhance HSE competence, employees have attended various trainings in HSE domain, namely, ISO 45001 Lead Auditor 
certification, ISO 14001 Lead Auditor certification and other special trainings specific to construction safety. In-house HSE 
awareness sessions are also organized from time to time for sensitization of employees.
 
To raise awareness and communicate the happenings on the HSE front to all employees, an in-house HSE 
publication - 'HSE Pulse' is released every quarter.
