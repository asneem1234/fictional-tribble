Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
We at Refex Industries Limited (RIL) are pleased to present our third Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(BRSR), highlighting our commitment to the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct 
(NGRBC) in India. Upholding these principles remains fundamental to our mission as a responsible and sustainable 
business, ensuring the well-being of all our stakeholders. 
At RIL, we continuously strive to create sustainable value for all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, 
communities, and the environment. We have made significant progress in embedding these principles across our 
operations, guided by a robust Sustainability Framework that informs our business decisions. We regularly measure our 
performance against industry benchmarks and international standards, demonstrating our commitment to sustainable 
growth. 
One of our significant achievements this year is that our CSR spending was three times the mandated amount, focusing 
on child education, water stewardship, biodiversity conservation, and clean energy. This emphasises our commitment to 
social responsibility and community development. 
In our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship, this reporting financial year, we established the Centre for 
Business Leadership on Nature Restoration in collaboration with the United Nations Global Compact Network India 
(UNGC NI). This center actively promotes training, awareness, research, and collaboration on nature conservation. 
We have also launched a Coastal Ecosystem Enhancement Project at Uyyalikuppam near Kalpakkam, and completed the 
civil work intending to plant 10,000 mangroves in FY 2025-26.  
Our refrigerant plant at Thiruporur now operates entirely on solar energy, making us a net exporter to the grid in FY 2024-
25. 
Our Green Mobility business has made remarkable strides in scope 3 emission reduction, abating 1,708 tons of eCO2 in 
FY 2024 -25. This reflects our dedication to promoting low-carbon mobility solutions. 
As part of our water stewardship initiatives, we have pledged to restore at least one water body per year. This year, we 
successfully restored a 28,000 square feet remote hilltop water body in Nekhnamali village, tamilnadu and initiated the 
restoration of a 1-kilometer-long water body in Titlagarh, Odisha, moving closer to our goal of water neutrality. 
Moreover, our focus on health and safety has yielded excellent results, with zero lost-time injuries and fatalities reported 
in this financial year. This is a testament to our commitment to ensuring a safe and healthy workplace. 
This year, as BRSR disclosure becomes mandatory, we are excited to present our performance, marking the third 
consecutive year of sharing our ESG initiatives. This commitment reflects our dedication to corporate citizenship, business 
ethics, and integrity. We believe that transparency and responsible practices are at the heart of sustainable success.
