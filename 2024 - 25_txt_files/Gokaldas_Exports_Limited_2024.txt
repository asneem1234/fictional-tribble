1.
Water and 
chemical 
management
Risk
Water 
and 
chemical 
management 
is critical in the apparel industry 
due to its heavy reliance on water-
intensive 
and 
chemically 
driven 
processes such as dyeing, printing, 
and finishing. The industry is one of the 
largest consumers of freshwater and 
generates 
substantial 
wastewater, 
often laden with harmful chemicals. 
Improper management can lead to 
contamination of freshwater sources, 
harm to aquatic ecosystems, and 
health risks to communities. Moreover, 
the 
extensive 
use 
of 
hazardous 
chemicals 
poses 
environmental 
and regulatory risks if not properly 
handled or treated. Proactive water 
and 
chemical 
management 
open 
doors for innovation, cost savings, 
and 
leadership 
in 
sustainable 
manufacturing. Responsible water and 
chemical 
management 
is 
essential 
for 
environmental 
protection, 
regulatory compliance, and long-term 
sustainability in the textile industry. 
It supports cleaner production and 
strengthens 
the 
industry's 
shift 
toward more cleaner and sustainable 
manufacturing.

Energy 
Management 
& Renewable 
Transition
Opportunity
Effective energy management offers 
significant 
opportunities 
for 
the 
textile industry to lower environmental 
footprint to a great extent. Adopting 
energy-efficient 
technologies, 
automation, 
and 
smart 
monitoring 
systems 
can 
lower 
operational 
costs, reduce carbon footprints, and 
improve productivity. Transitioning to 
renewable energy sources can further 
enhance sustainability while insulating 
manufacturers from volatile fossil fuel 
prices. Traditionally reliant on fossil fuels, 
the sector faces mounting pressure to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
transition to cleaner energy sources. 
This shift also aligns with global climate 
goals and presents a competitive edge 
and improved brand image. While the 
renewable transition poses financial 
and operational challenges, it also 
bargains long-term resilience, cost 
savings, and a leadership position in 
sustainable manufacturing.

As the governments and regulatory 
bodies are introducing stricter emission 
norms and offering incentives for green 
energy 
investment, 
early 
adoption 
positions companies to benefit from 
these 
schemes 
and 
meet 
global 
sustainability expectations. Effective 
energy management and renewable 
transition are essential for reducing 
carbon emissions, lowering costs, and 
ensuring the long-term viability of the 
textile industry in a climate-conscious 
world.
3.
Waste 
management 
and circularity
Risk and 
Opportunity
Waste management and circularity are 
key to minimizing environmental impact, 
creating economic value from waste, 
and driving long-term sustainability in 
the textile industry. Poor waste handling 
leads 
to 
landfills, 
environmental 
pollution, and lost economic value, 
making sustainable waste solutions a 
top priority and vital to meeting both 
regulatory and market expectations. 
Effective 
waste 
management 
involves reducing waste generation, 
improving segregation, and promoting 
recycling and reuse. Circularity takes 
sustainability a step further by creating 
a closed-loop system where materials 
are reused, recycled, or repurposed. 
This includes using recycled textiles, 
designing garments for durability and 
recyclability. Such practices reduce 
dependence 
on 
virgin 
materials, 
lower carbon footprints, and create 
additional value streams. Adopting 
circular 
strategies 
brings 
multiple 
benefits as it can reduce raw material 
consumption and waste disposal costs, 
cut emissions, and support resource 
efficiency.

Managing climate impact and GHG

stewardship. 
From 
raw material production to garment 
processing, the industry contributes 
significantly to global carbon emissions, 
primarily 
through 
energy-intensive 
processes, fossil fuel use, and chemical 
treatments. 
This 
environmental 
footprint makes the sector a key player 
in the fight against climate change.

Addressing GHG emissions is essential 
not only for environmental responsibility 
but also for business sustainability. 
Reducing emissions through energy 
efficiency, renewable energy adoption, 
and low-impact materials can help 
manufacturers align with international 
climate 
goals. 
global 
brands 
and 
conscious 
consumers 
increasingly 
demand climate accountability in the 
supply chain. Manufacturers that take 
proactive steps to measure, report, 
and reduce their carbon footprint can 
gain a competitive edge, improve buyer 
relationships, and access green finance 
or 
sustainability-linked 
incentives. 
Failure to act on climate risks may lead 
to operational disruptions, reputational 
damage, and loss of market share. 
In contrast, climate action opens 
opportunities 
for 
innovation, 
cost 
savings, and leadership in responsible 
manufacturing.
5.
Attrition and 
absenteeism
Risk
Attrition and absenteeism are critical 
workforce challenges in the garment 
manufacturing 
industry, 
directly 
affecting 
productivity, 
quality, 
and 
operational stability. In an industry 
that relies heavily on skilled and semi-
skilled 
labor, 
maintaining 
a 
stable 
workforce 
is 
essential. 
Consistent 
absenteeism and high attrition rates 
lead to frequent employee result in 
increased recruitment and training 
costs, disruption of workflow, and 
loss of experienced workers. Similarly, 
high absenteeism causes  production 
delays, missed deadlines, and reduced 
efficiency on the factory floor. It also 
impacts product quality, as frequent 
staff changes can lead to errors 
and lack of accountability. Managing 
attrition and absenteeism is crucial 
for sustaining a reliable workforce, 
ensuring consistent production quality, 
and maintaining competitiveness in 
the garment manufacturing industry. 
Investing in people is key to long-term 
operational success and sustainability.

Supply chain 
transparency 
and 
traceability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Supply 
chain 
transparency 
and 
traceability are no longer optional; 
they are vital for risk management, 
compliance, 
responsible 
sourcing, 
and building trust in the garment 
manufacturing industry. Due to rising 
concerns 
around 
environmental 
degradation, labor rights, and ethical 
sourcing, global brands, regulators, 
and consumers are demanding greater 
visibility into textile supply chains. 
The industry often involves complex, 
multi-tiered 
supply 
chains 
spread 
across countries, making it vulnerable 
to unethical practices such as child 
labor, unsafe working conditions, and 
environmental 
violations. 
Without 
transparency, brands risk reputational 
damage, 
regulatory 
penalties, 
and 
loss of consumer trust. Transparency 
measures 
allow 
clearly 
identifying 
and 
sharing 
information 
about 
every stage of the supply chain. 
Implementing 
traceability 
systems 
allows manufacturers and brands to 
monitor sourcing, labor conditions, and 
environmental impacts at each stage 
and help track the origin and movement 
of materials, ensuring ethical and 
sustainable practices.

Condition
Risk 
Maintaining strong safety standards 
and good working conditions is essential 
for 
ethical 
manufacturing, 
legal 
compliance, and long-term success in 
the garment industry. Workers in this 
sector often face risks such as poor 
ventilation, 
exposure 
to 
hazardous 
chemicals, long working hours, and 
inadequate emergency preparedness. 
A safe workplace is the foundation of 
a sustainable business. Ensuring a safe 
and healthy work environment not only 
protects workers’ lives but also boosts 
morale, 
reduces 
absenteeism, 
and 
improves productivity.

7.5 MW Solar 
Park
The solar park became fully operational, and 13 of our manufacturing 
units in Karnataka have been integrated under the wheeling and 
net metering scheme. As a result, approximately 72%–73% of our 
grid electricity consumption is now offset by solar energy.

To enhance operational efficiency, precision, and productivity 
across our manufacturing units, the Company has adopted several 
automation technologies, including automated hanger systems, 
twin-head needle detection machines, button feeders, and 
universal flap machines. Installed Computer-Aided Manufacturing 
(CAM) software for cutting machines in phased manner during the
