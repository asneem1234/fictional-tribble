Data Security

Risk
Safeguarding digital 
information is a crucial step 
in providing data security 
and privacy. Consequences 
of non-compliance to the 
data privacy and security 
of the customer may lead 
to regulatory and legal 
risks. Non-existence of

to information of the 
company. This may cause 
reputational damage and 
loss of customers.
 Adhere to the existing 
Privacy Policy
 Regularly audit the 
data processing 
activities to identify 
vulnerabilities and 
ensure compliance 
with data protection 
regulations

Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
We have a large and 
complex global supply 
chain with several small, 
medium and large size 
suppliers. Responsible 
procurement is a necessary 
step for integrating 
sustainability in the 
business operations. Also, 
collaboration and support 
of suppliers becomes 
extremely important 
for achieving ESG goals. 
We are designing the 
Responsible procurement 
policy and planning to 
integrate the supply chain 
into our ESG efforts.
Black Box has also started 
including a dedicated 
‘ESG Obligations’ as an 
Annexure with all the 
Purchase orders. By 
making this a standard 
part of every purchase 
order, we aim to ensure 
that ESG compliance is 
clearly communicated 
and integrated into all the 
communications with our 
supply chain.

Climate 
Resilience
Risk
Climate change is a 
growing concern around 
the world as it causes 
direct and indirect 
economic impacts on 
businesses.
As a trusted supply 
chain partner to many 
of the Fortune 500 
companies, Black Box is 
committed to transparency 
in climate-related 
disclosures, including 
CDP and SBTi reporting. 
A comprehensive 
assessment of the global 
GHG footprint was 
conducted to meet the 
customer expectations. 
In alignment with 
our commitment 
to sustainability 
and environmental 
stewardship, ambitious 
targets for reducing 
emissions have been set.
Black Box’s business 
operations are spread 
across the globe with our 
office locations, employees, 
supply chain, partners, and 
customers as an integrated 
part of our value chain. 
The physical risks posed by 
Climate Change - such as 
extreme weather events, 
and changes in climate 
patterns may cause threats 
to the safety of people, 
damage to infrastructure, 
and disruption of the 
supply chain because 
of delays in deliveries, 
which may have financial 
implications in the future.

Energy 
Efficiency
Opportunity
Black Box provides design, 
installation, maintenance, 
and consultancy services in 
the Information technology 
and telecommunication 
infrastructure domain. This 
domain largely depends 
on the electricity for the 
operation. By emphasizing 
energy efficiency 
beginning with the design 
stage, we can reduce our 
customers’ electricity 
consumption. This 
creates the opportunity 
to serve large customers 
across the globe who are 
committed to the emission 
reduction targets which 
in turn creates a revenue 
opportunity for us and at 
the same time reduces the 
scope-3 GHG footprint of 
Black Box. Black Box has 
about 53 office spaces 
across the globe, including 
warehouses, distribution 
centers and data centers. 
The energy efficiency 
approach helps reduce the 
office energy consumption 
by reducing electricity 
consumption, refrigerant 
use, and the quantity of 
fuel consumed for power 
backup and space heating. 
This provides us the 
opportunity to reduce our 
Scope-1 and Scope-2 GHG 
emissions.

Safety
Risk
Black Box has many

engaged in day-to-day 
activities of installation 
and maintenance of the 
equipment.
Mitigating the 
environmental impacts of 
our business activities and 
prioritizing the health and 
safety of the workforce are 
crucial aspects for us.
Being a global organization 
with about 3000 
employees, prioritizing 
the Health and Safety 
of the workforce and 
understanding country-
specific applicable 
regulations is crucial 
for Black Box. It is also 
important to comply with 
the regulations related to 
Environment, Health, and 
Safety.
The Health and Safety 
parameters, if not 
managed adequately, may 
affect our reputation in 
the market, the safety and 
productivity of our human 
resources, and customer 
satisfaction.

approach to bribery and 
corruption. It is important 
to act professionally, 
fairly and with integrity 
while non-compliance

companies to legal and 
regulatory risks. It may 
cause financial losses, 
damage to employee 
morale, and reputational 
damage, which may

customers.
It also leads to increased 
scrutiny, oversight, and

requirement is important.
We have a robust

management. Non-
compliance to regulatory 
requirements poses the 
risk of financial penalties, 
legal consequences, and

Governance (ESG) principles. In the USA, all subcontractors undergo structured Health & Safety training, and 
contractors are briefed on ESG expectations during their onboarding. We also update partners on our ongoing 
sustainability initiatives to keep them informed and aligned with our goals. To further strengthen ESG performance 
across the value chain, we plan to share periodic informational briefs with all the value chain partners. These briefs will 
cover ESG expectations, industry best practices, sustainable operations, Health and Safety, regulatory compliance, 
and ethical standards helping value chain partners assess and enhance their ESG practices.

a.  
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
 
 
Yes. To integrate sustainability in the supply chain, Black Box ensures that its supply chain partners adhere to 
ethical and sustainable practices.
 
 
As part of our efforts towards sustainability into procurement practices, Black Box has also started including 
a dedicated ‘ESG Obligations’ as an Annexure with all the Purchase orders. By making this a standard part of 
every purchase order, we aim to ensure that ESG compliance is clearly communicated and integrated into all 
the communications with our supply chain.
 
 
Black Box has a broad network of global suppliers. Some of them provide materials, some are contract 
manufacturers, some are OEM suppliers and some of them provide software and services. Though we have 
an active approved vendor list, we conduct supplier assessments to maintain supplier quality and assurance 
throughout the supply chain. A basic requirement for approval of a supplier is quality testing, production 
samples, and evaluation of the quality system. For critical materials (which make up more than 20% of the 
product group, sole-sourced, or which has long-term customer requirements), a due diligence assessment is 
conducted. Also, factory inspection is conducted in some cases. The supplier questionnaire contains questions 
to check the existence of the Export Compliance Program, Quality Management System, Health, Safety and 
Environment policy, International Traffic in Arms Rules (ITAR), etc. We conduct quarterly business reviews and 
periodic re-audit and re-evaluations for our suppliers.
 
 
Our customers are also made aware of the E-waste management system at Black Box through which they can 
recycle their products at the end of the product’s life. Through these sustainable sourcing practices, Black Box 
aims to reduce its environmental impact, support ethical supply chains, and contribute to a more sustainable 
industry. This year, we are planning to introduce a Sustainable procurement policy for integrating environmental, 
social, and governance considerations into our purchasing and supply chain practices.
 
b.  
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 
 
Currently, we do not track this information. However, the implementation of a sustainable procurement policy 
is planned for this year onwards.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposal at the end of 
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste, and (d) other waste
 
We are primarily an Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) Solution Integration and consulting firm; the 
overall environmental impact is minimal. We have robust processes for waste management. We identify and manage 
each type of waste and follow regular waste management practices. We abide by the region-specific regulatory 
norms for the management of waste.
 
The following are the processes in place for reuse, recycling, and disposal:
 
a.  
Plastics (including packaging):
 
 
Plastic used in the packaging is recycled through authorized recyclers. We are also exploring the option of 
biodegradable plastic and reusing recycled parts of the product through discussion with our value chain.
 
b.  
E-Waste:
 
 
Black Box has implemented the e-waste collection system through the third-party authorized vendors across 
the USA. This ensures that all the e-waste is collected and recycled.
 
 
Black Box complies with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations. In regions such as 
Austria, Finland, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and the UK where Black Box has established recycling contracts 
with authorized recyclers, it provides finance for the treatment, recycling, and recovery of WEEE from customers 
on a one-for-one and like-for-like basis.
 
 
Region-specific regulations are adopted by the Black Box to comply with WEEE regulations:
	
	
 
The Austrian Ordinance on Waste Prevention, Collection, and Treatment of Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment (WEEE Ordinance) in Austria
	
	
 
The Finnish Waste Act which implements regulations for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) 
in Finland
	
	
 
Regulation 013/2005 for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in Luxembourg
	
	
 
The Spanish Royal Decree 208/2005 on Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Management in Spain
	
	
 
The Sweden Regulation on Producer Responsibility for Electrical and Electronic Equipment in Sweden
	
	
 
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in the United Kingdom.
 
 
In Hungary and Poland, dealers sell Black Box equipment. They comply with the WEEE regulations.
 
 
In Switzerland, Black Box has joined the compliance scheme of SWICO which is approved by Swiss authorities.
 
 
In Norway, Black Box has joined the compliance scheme of RENAS which is approved by the Ministry of 
Environment of Norway.
 
 
In some regions, such as Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, regardless of whether the equipment 
is being replaced by a new piece of equipment from Black Box, we take back the equipment for recycling 
and disposal.
 
 
France complies with the French Decree on the Prevention and Management of Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment (WEEE), Germany complies with the Germany Act Governing the Sale, Return and Environmentally 
Black Box Limited

Belgium has three different regions Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussel Capital that comply with two different 
regulations – Waste Prevention and Management Ordinance (VLAREA) in Flanders, Producer Responsibility 
Decree in Wallonia, and Brussel Capital.
 
 
In Denmark, The Danish Order transposes the WEEE directive for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
where local authorities establish a collection system that collects WEEE arising from households as well as 
from businesses.
 
 
In Italy, the WEEE directive is transposed by the Italian Decree to implement the 2002/96/EC Waste Electrical 
and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive.
 
 
Black Box does not have a sales office in facilities such as Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, and Slovakia. Black Box products are sold directly to business end-users 
from sales offices in other Member States through Distance selling. The WEEE Directive and Member State WEEE 
Regulations state that Black Box is not responsible for WEEE arising from distance sales of business products. 
Instead, it is the business end-user’s responsibility to ensure that products that they buy through distance selling 
arrangements are managed in an environmentally responsible manner at the end of life.
 
 
In India, Black Box is complying with E-waste management rules, 2022. Black Box has collaborated with E-Waste 
Recyclers India (EWRI) to comply with the E-Waste Management and Handling rules by providing drop-off 
centers and environmentally sound management of end-of-life electronics. There are 24 collection centers of 
EWRI where customers can drop their E-waste for recycling.

Management and Handling Rules, 2022. We actively collect, treat, recycle, and recover e-waste as part of our 
commitment to responsible waste management. We continuously work to improve our existing e-waste management 
systems and remain attentive to the proper handling of other waste types, including plastic and battery waste.

10. Health and safety management system:
 
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity. 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
 
 
Yes, Black Box has implemented robust Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management systems across 
all operations both at our own facilities and at customer sites. We also align with our client’s OHS requirements 
during installations, maintenance, and service delivery. Additionally, we require our suppliers to adhere to 
relevant OHS standards when operating at our premises or at client locations.
 
 
Our Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Policy focuses on individual responsibility in maintaining a safe 
workplace. It includes clear protocols for preventing accidents such as falls, fire, and electrical hazards, along 
with ergonomic guidelines for office settings. All employees are trained in emergency evacuation procedures, 
and fire drills are conducted annually at every location. Offices are equipped with fire safety systems such as 
sprinklers, smoke detectors, and extinguishers, while critical equipment—including air conditioners, chillers, and 
UPS units—is routinely inspected. Emergency contact information, including numbers for the nearest police 
station and a 24/7 facility emergency line, is prominently displayed on notice boards and at building entrances.
 
 
Our comprehensive Safety Policy and Procedure Manual outlines structured processes for risk assessment, 
hazard identification, incident reporting, record keeping, and emergency response. It also defines safe work 
practices for tasks involving potential risks, supporting a proactive and consistent approach to workplace safety.
 
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
 
 
Black Box prioritizes Health and Safety through regular workplace inspections and strict avoidance of hazardous 
equipment or flammable substances. Our Safety Policy outlines safe practices for all potentially hazardous tasks. 
Hazard assessments are certified in writing, detailing the workplace, assessor, date, and certification statement. 
We continuously monitor new risks due to changes in operations or customer environments. On project sites, 
hazard analyses may be required before any tasks begins. We use tools such as Job Hazard Analysis (JHA), Pre-
Task Planning (PTP), and PPE checklists, with risks ranked using a matrix. Assessments are updated when there 
is any change in processes, equipment, or layouts.
 
 
An ergonomic assessment was carried out at a customer’s facility and identified high-risk tasks such as Copper/
Fiber Installation, Rack Cleaning, and Material Handling. Copper/Fiber Installation pose a risk due to awkward 
postures and extended reaching; Rack Cleaning involves strain from poor visibility and grip challenges; and 
Material Handling was classified as very high risk (NIOSH Lifting Index of 2.76), primarily due to heavy lifting, 
high shelving, and poor ergonomics. Recommendations include using adjustable platforms, kneeling pads, 
vacuum extensions, ergonomic carts, improving task setups, and exploring equipment like powered lifts and 
slide-out shelving.

Additionally, a comprehensive risk assessment was conducted at one of our sites in Lawrence, covering 
warehousing, production, shipping/receiving, and maintenance activities. Key hazards identified included falls 
from stock pickers and ladders, collisions with forklifts, manual handling injuries from lifting and repetitive 
tasks, chemical exposure due to outdated SDS records and improper labeling, and incomplete equipment 
inspection logs. Control measures implemented include the use of harnesses and self-retracting lanyards for 
working at heights, certified training for operators of powered equipment, mechanical aids for heavy lifting, 
routine inspections for tools and PPE, and strict housekeeping and fire safety protocols. It was observed that 
chemical safety requires immediate attention, as the SDS binder had not been updated since 2019 and several 
containers lacked GHS-compliant labels. Updating documentation and retraining staff is essential. Noise levels 
across all work areas were below the 85 dBA threshold, meaning hearing protection is not currently required. In 
warehouse operations, team lifting or mechanical aids are used for packages over 50 lbs, and the SAP system 
ensures accurate inventory and logistics management.
 
 
Another risk assessment was conducted at our Inver Grove Heights Facility that identifies and mitigates safety 
and health risks in warehouse, production, cleaning, painting, and shipping operations. High-risk activities at 
this site include powered equipment use, working at height, cold environments, and high-traffic warehouse 
areas. Controls include PPE, training, inspections, and fall protection. Multiple chemicals such as Windex, alcohol, 
paint thinner are used for various processes which need improvement in labelling of secondary containers. 
Mechanical aids, ergonomic practices, and load limits (50 lbs max per person) are to be emphasized at this site. 
All areas were tested below 85dBA. Fire exits, extinguishers, eye wash stations present, though access issues 
and lack of spill kits were noted.
 
c.  
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
 
 
Yes. We have incident reporting processes in place. Employee/worker can inform his/ her immediate supervisor 
of a potential hazard, violation, or deficiency in safe and healthy working conditions, recommending corrective 
measures, if possible, or correcting the hazard. The employee’s immediate supervisor is to be notified of every 
injury, accident, or near-miss incident regardless of how trivial such an accident or incident may appear at 
that time.
 
 
The supervisor reports about the injury/accident to the Risk Management Committee. The Committee provides 
the appropriate incident report template to document the event to the affected person and their supervisor. 
The affected person and/or their supervisor should complete the appropriate form and shall submit it to the 
Risk Management Committee within 24 hours of the event.
 
 
The processes vary to a certain extent as per the location-specific scenarios; however, the overall approach that 
we adopt globally for work-related hazard reporting is described in this section.
 
d.  
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
 
 
Black Box has a first aid room with a medical bed for all the employees in case of medical emergencies. The 
emergency contact numbers of doctors and ambulances are displayed on the notice boards of the company so 
that employees can have quick access to the information. Additionally, wheelchairs are accessible for employees 
who are sick. A medical emergency facility is available on campus along with trained doctors and nurses. First 
aid kits are always available at all facilities.
 
 
Black Box regularly conducts health check-up camps, yoga sessions, etc. for all the employees.

conditions are further addressed through a specific action plan. These action plans are implemented internally by 
the Corporate Safety Manager and Corporate Safety Manager as well as through third-party vendors.
 
At the Minnesota site, a general risk and noise mapping exercise was conducted by the Corporate Safety Manager. The 
recorded noise levels ranged from 32–63 dBA in the warehouse and production areas, and 72–75 dBA in the paint 
booth. These levels were found to be within acceptable limits, and therefore, no immediate corrective actions were 
recommended. An 8-hour Time-Weighted Average (TWA) noise study along with air contaminant measurements 
is planned for FY 2026.
 
At Lawrence site, a general risk and noise mapping exercise was conducted by the Corporate Safety Manager. 
Measurements in the warehouse and production areas ranged between 40–65 dBA, and in the receiving/repack 
section, levels were slightly higher at 76–80 dBA due to forklift operations. These levels were found to be within 
acceptable limits, and therefore, no immediate corrective actions were recommended.
 
An ergonomic risk assessment was carried out at the customer’s facility in June 2024. Based on the findings, several 
corrective actions were implemented. These included the use of long-handled cleaning tools, rearranging heavy 
boxes to waist height to minimize lifting strain, and providing knee pads and mats for tasks requiring work at or 
below knee level.
 
A site-level assessment was conducted at the Lawrence, representing 14% completion across all sites. As a result 
of this assessment, several improvements were made, including the replacement of deteriorated concrete steps at 
the east entrance and upgrades to the shipping and receiving dock and associated safety equipment.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all their stakeholders.
Essential Indicators
1.  
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
 
At Black Box, our stakeholder management process is built on a foundation of transparency, integrity, and meaningful 
engagement. It begins with the identification of both internal and external stakeholders, based on the nature and 
extent of their interactions with our business.
 
At Black Box, we frequently engage with stakeholders through consultation sessions. To identify and refine material 
topics, we conduct consultations with stakeholders periodically by engaging both internal and external perspectives. 
These consultations are further strengthened by the involvement of independent ESG consultants, who offer objective 
insights and participate in select stakeholder discussions. Also, as part of our materiality assessment process, 
we recognize that certain stakeholders have a significant influence on our business operations. We proactively 
understand high-impact stakeholders and engage with them more frequently to ensure their expectations, 
concerns, and insights are effectively integrated into our decision-making. This focused engagement helps us align 
our sustainability priorities with stakeholder expectations.
 
The stakeholder identification, prioritization, and engagement processes are reviewed by the Board periodically. 
Outcomes from the stakeholder consultations are regularly reported to the Board in the form of feedback, analysis, 
and any proposed actions or recommendations resulting from the consultation process by our Stakeholder 
Relationship Committee, which ensures the effectiveness and accountability of our engagement mechanisms.
 
We aim to build strong, trust-based relationships, gather valuable insights, and actively involve stakeholders in our 
decision-making processes.

Leadership Indicators
1.  
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
 
We regularly engage with stakeholders through consultation sessions, covering key economic, environmental, social, 
and governance topics. The Board periodically reviews our stakeholder identification, prioritization, and engagement 
process to ensure its effectiveness.
 
The Stakeholder Relationship Committee oversees these consultations, supported by internal teams and, when 
needed, third-party experts. Outcomes such as feedback, analysis, and recommended actions are reported to the 
Board to inform strategic decisions and ensure stakeholder perspectives are integrated into our business practices.
2.  
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into the policies and activities of the entity.

helps us to identify and manage environmental and social topics and provides valuable insights into our governance.
 
Stakeholder consultations provide input on the existing policies and regulations and new activities that will enhance 
our performance on ESG. Understanding material issues and their impact on the environment and business is 
discussed during the stakeholder consultations, which help in understanding the risks, and opportunities that can 
affect the business operations.
 
The consultation with our customers helps us to understand the various requirements under environmental and 
social topics (e.g., GHG emissions, waste management, sustainable sourcing, labor welfare, and human rights). These 
inputs are further utilized to plan the relevant actions and initiatives. Through consultations with our supply chain 
partners, we engage with them and ensure our environmental and social requirements are captured in the contract 
documents and fulfilled by our suppliers as part of business transactions.
 
In addition, based on the input from stakeholder consultations, we are redesigning some of our policies such as ESG 
policy, Sustainable Procurement Policy, etc. We have also planned to extend our current efforts on GHG emission 
estimations and disclose under the CDP and SBTi, to begin with the decarbonization journey with an aim to achieve 
Net Zero by 2050 and started analysing our GHG footprint.
3.  
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/
