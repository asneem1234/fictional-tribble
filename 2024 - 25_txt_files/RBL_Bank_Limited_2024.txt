*In FY 2024-25, the Bank amended its methodology for estimating water withdrawal, using an estimate of 45 litres of water consumption per 
head per working day for offices, as per guidelines published by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) and relevant adjustments with 
respect to calculation of number of working days. The amendments have been applied retrospectively to the corresponding data points for FY 
2023-24 and the data for water withdrawl has been restated. Accordingly, the water withdrawal for FY 2023-24, has increased by 50,636 KL.
	
^ Further, Water discharged is considered as 80% of the water withdrawn from source based on Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) database 
report dated December 24, 2009. Therefore, it is assumed that of the total water withdrawal, only 20% is consumed. The data in the above table 
for FY 2023-24 has been restated in order to ensure consistency with the methodology followed in the current financial year.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, the bank has many initiatives for reducing GHG emissions within its operations. A few notable initiatives and their potential 
impacts are summarized below. 
	
Green buildings: Three of our largest offices by carpet area – Corporate Office, Airoli and NOC Goregaon (all in Mumbai 
Metropolitan Region) are situated in certified green buildings. This is about 51% of the carpet area among our all the regional 
offices (barring branches) and 17% of all carpet area, inclusive of all India branches.
	
The 8th floor of NOC, Goregaon office is using 100% renewable energy from September 2022. Similarly, CO, Parel and Airoli are 
also on 100% renewable energy. With a monthly consumption of 2.16 lakh units, this initiative will help avoid emissions of 1,575 
tCO2 annually. 
	
Solar roof top in branches: The bank has installed solar panels in its 24 branches, generating about 268 MWh of solar power and 
thus avoiding GHG emissions of 195 tCO2. In addition, the bank finances various renewable energy, other emission reduction 
projects and electric vehicles etc. These in turn also help reduce the total GHG emissions. The third-party data centers used are 
also Green Certified and use significant renewable energy for their operations.
	
Further, the bank has also taken a voluntary goal of being carbon neutral within its own operations by FY 2034 through use of 
energy efficiency and renewable energy. In Q3 FY23, Bank’s Board has approved a Coal Policy. Accordingly, the exposure to coal 
based thermal power generation will be restricted to 2.5% of total exposure, with ultimate objective of reducing it to zero by FY 
2034.
