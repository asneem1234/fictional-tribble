their life cycle is limited. However, the company maintains strong systems for the responsible recycling of e-waste, hazardous 
waste, and other materials through certified recycler partnerships. Moreover, BFIL actively supports waste minimization by 
reusing iron pallets and bins within its packaging operations.
