Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
26.
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, and approach to adapt 
or mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format
S.No. Material  
issue  
identified
Indicate  
whether risk or  
opportunity (R/O)
Rationale for 
identifying the risk /  
opportunity
In case of risk, approach  
to adapt or mitigate
Financial implication of 
the risk or opportunity 
(indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Energy  
Management  
and Transition
Risk
Autoline has five plants across 
the country, with one plant 
beginning operations in FY24-25. 
Since energy is a major cost 
component, fluctuations in 
energy prices represent a 
significant risk. The cost of 
electricity and potential energy 
disruptions also pose challenges. 
In view of this expansion, we 
are actively exploring ways to 
improve our energy efficiency.
We are developing proposals 
to mitigate energy cost risks 
by investing in solar power 
projects. The electricity 
generated from these 
projects will help lower our 
overall energy expenses. 
This initiative is designed to 
reduce our environmental 
footprint while providing 
a more sustainable and 
dependable energy source.
Positive: Shifting partially 
to clean energy instead 
of relying solely on the 
grid will help lower our 
power-related expenses.

(indicate positive or

2
GHG Emissions
Opportunity
Given the evolving landscape 
of the automobile industry, it is 
essential for us to implement 
programs aimed at reducing 
our overall carbon footprint. 
While our operations inherently 
have a lower direct emissions 
impact, a substantial portion 
of our emissions arises from 
our value chain.
This year, we aim to track 
carbon emissions across 
Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 
3 categories in more detail.
Positive: Reducing 
emissions will help ensure 
lower fuel consumption.
3.
Waste  
Management
Opportunity
The majority of waste generated 
at our facilities comprises 
metal waste, which is formally 
disposed of through sale as 
scrap and is subsequently 
recycled or repurposed 
for further use.
Our target is to achieve 
a reduced rate of waste 
generation through the 
efficient and optimized 
utilization of materials 
across our processes.
Positive: We are actively 
pursuing cost-saving 
measures by minimizing 
waste generation to the 
greatest extent possible.
4.
Employee
Health and
Safety
Risk
Given the nature of activities 
on our shop floor, it is crucial 
to ensure that employees and 
workers are protected from 
injuries at all times.
We intend to implement a 
strict, zero-tolerance policy 
towards safety breaches. 
To support this, we have 
established ‘Gurukul’ 
within our premises, where 
employees undergo regular 
safety training. In addition, 
Autoline has introduced 
annual health check-ups 
and counseling sessions to 
promote the overall well-being 
of its workforce. In alignment 
with the Factories Act, a 
qualified doctor is available 
on-site, and employees are 
also covered under group 
health insurance.
Negative: Any safety 
incident can adversely 
affect the brand’s 
reputation and 
diminish employee 
and worker morale.
5.
Product Life  
Cycle  
Management 
Risk
The Company is introducing 
new product lines to address 
specific customer requirements. 
However, if the developed 
products do not align with 
customer expectations, 
there is a risk of 
non-acceptance in the market.
We intend to initiate product 
development only after 
conducting comprehensive 
research and development 
to ensure alignment with 
customer needs.
Negative: Developing 
a new product 
requires substantial 
initial investment.
6.
Supply Chain  
Sustainability  
and Reporting
Risk
There exists a risk that vendors 
may fail to comply with the 
applicable laws and regulations 
governing their operations.
We have established a robust 
quality control system and 
vendor onboarding process, 
which also incorporates 
the assessment of 
vendor compliance with 
relevant regulations.
Negative: Non-compliance 
by vendors may hinder the 
smooth functioning of the 
Company’s operations.

Financial implication of 
the risk or opportunity 
(indicate positive or

7.
Business Ethics
Opportunity
The Company has maintained 
a clean record with no 
history of involvement in 
bribery, corruption, fraud, 
money laundering, or similar 
irregularities. Upholding ethical 
practices is fundamental to the 
Company’s sustainability and 
plays a vital role in securing its 
long-term success.
We have initiated the 
quarterly monitoring of 
key indicators related to 
business ethics.
Positive: The adoption of 
ethical business practices 
significantly minimizes the 
risk of legal liabilities and 
reputational damage.
8.
Risk  
Management
Opportunity
We are fully aware of the 
inherent risks associated with 
our organization. These include 
operational risks such as safety 
issues and energy management, 
as well as compliance and 
financial risks. A cornerstone 
of our risk management 
approach over the years has 
been to identify key risks and 
establish effective mechanisms 
to mitigate them.
We have been proactively 
engaged in identifying and 
addressing potential risks. 
The mitigation measures 
currently in place or planned 
for implementation have 
been outlined alongside each 
identified risk in this section.
Positive: Timely 
identification and 
mitigation of potential 
risks help safeguard 
our financial stability 
and strengthen our 
organizational credibility.
9.
Data Privacy
Risk
Robust data privacy policies and 
procedures are a reflection of 
strong corporate governance. 
Our policies emphasize 
transparency, accountability, and 
ethical conduct. However, as the 
Company manages sensitive 
customer information, any 
mishandling of such data 
presents a potential risk.
At Autoline, we have 
established mechanisms 
to minimize the risk of data 
breaches. Our comprehensive 
IT security framework 
includes robust firewalls, 
controlled access systems, 
and various other safeguards 
to ensure the protection of 
sensitive information.
Negative: Data breaches 
can lead to significant 
financial consequences 
at both operational 
and financial levels. 
Implementing optimal 
checks and safeguards 
helps us avoid such costs.
10.
Human  
Rights and  
Labour  
Practices
Risk
The automotive parts 
industry inherently involves 
operations that may pose 
potential risks to human rights. 
Therefore, it is essential to 
identify and assess these risks 
across the entire supply chain.
We are committed to:
Ensuring full compliance 
with labor laws, including 
regulations on wages, 
working hours, and workplace 
safety conditions.
Implementing robust 
measures to prevent and 
address instances of forced 
labor and child labor across 
our supply chain.
Fostering inclusive 
workplaces that are free from 
all forms of discrimination.
Negative: Human 
rights violations can 
significantly harm a 
company’s credibility and 
may result in financial 
penalties. In severe 
cases, such violations 
can lead to substantial 
business losses.
11.
Water  
Management
Opportunity
Water consumption at Autoline 
plants is limited to a minimal 
level, due to the inherent nature 
of our operations.
Although our industrial 
processes inherently involve 
low water usage, we remain 
committed to enhancing 
overall water efficiency. 
We are adopting water-saving 
practices in our office spaces 
and actively exploring 
opportunities for water reuse 
within our facilities.
Positive: Limited water 
consumption leads to 
minimal wastewater 
generation, thereby 
reducing the risk of 
non-compliance and 
potential penalties 
related to wastewater 
disposal regulations.

Leadership Indicators
1. 	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
	
Our objective is to establish open and effective communication channels that enable meaningful dialogue with 
stakeholders and keep the Board well-informed. At present, the Board actively engages in discussions on economic, 
environmental, and social matters. We are in the process of refining this engagement framework to ensure it adequately 
addresses the concerns and expectations of all relevant parties. Our ultimate aim is to develop a robust system that 
facilitates comprehensive and ongoing Board involvement in these critical areas.
2. 	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics 
were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Stakeholder input plays a vital role in identifying and addressing environmental and social concerns. Their insights 
are crucial in shaping and setting targets for Autoline’s ESG initiatives. In alignment with this approach, we had 
conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment in FY23-24 involving in-depth engagement with both internal and 
external stakeholders. This process included meaningful interactions with employees, workers, customers, vendors, 
shareholders, and the Board to gain a clear understanding of the issues most significant to them and to our organization 
from an environmental and social standpoint.
3. 	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of   vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Workers have been recognized as a vulnerable and marginalized group within the organization. Engagement with 
them has provided valuable insights into enhancing safety on the shop floor. In response, Autoline is set to revamp 
its safety policies and introduce a new Code of Conduct that enforces a zero-tolerance approach toward injuries and 
workplace accidents.
