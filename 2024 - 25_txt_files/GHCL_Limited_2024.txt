Performance of the 
entity against the specific 
commitments, goals, and 
targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
We are proud 
to announce 
the successful 
implementation of our 
Internal Carbon Price 
initiative at GHCL. As 
part of our commitment 
to sustainable business 
practices, we have 
adopted an internal 
shadow carbon 
price to guide our 
investment decisions 
across all operations. 
By incorporating a 
carbon price into our 
investment evaluation 
process, we ensure 
that the financial 
implications of 
carbon emissions are 
adequately considered. 
This internal mechanism 
helps us prioritize 
low carbon projects, 
identify opportunities 
for emission reductions, 
and drive innovation 
toward cleaner and 
more sustainable 
technologies. 
We are proud to 
report a commendable 
attrition rate of 6.14% 
in the executive cadre, 
maintaining a single-digit 
attrition since FY’20, 
reflecting our focus on 
employee retention and 
creating a fulfilling work 
environment. This year, 
against our target of 5% 
we have achieved 3.5%, 
in female representation, 
effective steps are being 
taken to improve this 
number in due course of 
time. 
To drive our 
improvement plan, 
we have implemented 
emission reduction 
projects and 
embraced renewable 
energy sources 
for a greener and 
more sustainable 
future. Committed 
to continuous 
improvement and 
environmental 
stewardship, GHCL 
Foundation Trust has

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/

Board? (Yes/No) If yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes, GHCL has robust processes to manage conflicts of 
interest, as detailed in our 'Code of Conduct for Board 
of Directors and Senior Management Personnel of the 
Company.' This code mandates that Directors and Senior 
Management avoid and disclose actual or apparent conflicts 
of interest defined as situations where personal or related 
entity interests may clash with the Company's interests.
	
Specifically, the code addresses the following:
 
 
Outside Employment and Directorships: Directors and 
Senior Management require prior Company’s approval 
for any outside employment or business engagement. 
Board 
approval 
is 
mandatory 
for 
accepting 
directorships, particularly in competing companies.
 
 
Personal 
Investments: 
Directors 
and 
Senior 
Management must ensure personal investments in 
customers, suppliers, developers, or competitors do not 
compromise their Company’s responsibilities and must 
obtain board’s approval. Factors like investment size, 
influence potential, access to confidential information, 
and the nature of the relationship are considered.
 
 
Related Party Transactions: Conducting Company’s 
business with relatives or associated businesses is 
generally avoided. Employment of relative is restricted 
in positions with financial dependence or influence.
 
 
Gifts and Payments: Gifts or favors must be of nominal value 
(not exceeding H 5,000 in aggregate), non-cash, consistent 
with business practices, and not construed as bribes.
 
 
Corporate Opportunities: 
Directors 
and 
Senior 
Management cannot exploit corporate opportunities 
discovered through Company resources for personal 
gain unless disclosed and declined by the Board.

2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. GHCL has implemented procedures for sustainable 
sourcing. Our 'Green Procurement Policy,' established 
on January 1, 2017, mandates that suppliers and 
contractors adopt robust environmental management 
practices, aligning with GHCL's core environmental 
principles. We require suppliers to implement 
effective 
environment 
management 
systems, 
ensuring workforce awareness and encouraging 
environmentally responsible behavior. This includes 
continuous assessment of process and product 
environmental 
impact, 
establishing 
improvement 
objectives, and monitoring and minimizing greenhouse 
gas emissions through appropriate technology.
	
	
Further, our policy emphasizes responsible use of 
resources, including energy, raw materials, and water. 
We encourage product stewardship, focusing on 
reuse, recycling, and life-cycle environmental effects. 
Suppliers are expected to respect the environment, 
collaborate with us to improve product environmental 
profiles, and protect biodiversity by respecting and 
enhancing wildlife habitats and green belts.
	
	
Recognizing the diverse nature of supplier operations, 
our policy allows for flexibility in the emphasis of 
environmental 
management, 
ensuring 
practical 
application across various industries. Complementing 
this, we operate a comprehensive supply chain risk 
mitigation program. This program identifies and 
addresses potential vulnerabilities through a structured 
evaluation of suppliers based on Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) criteria. We then actively 
collaborate with suppliers to ensure alignment with 
GHCL’s standards and expectations

Yes, the Managing Director, through the Human Resource Department, and Functional Heads, drives policy implementation. This 
encompasses detection, prevention, and mitigation of adverse human rights effects from our operations. We foster a culture in 
which personnel are encouraged to report incidents of harassment, victimization, intimidation, or bias without fear of reprisal or 
inequitable treatment. Upon receipt of a complaint, the responsible committees undertake a comprehensive inquiry and enact 
necessary measures to achieve resolution that satisfies all involved, ensuring a just and transparent process. Corrective actions are 
then enacted to safeguard employee rights and cultivate a respectful work environment.

GHCL Limited
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress 
grievances related to human rights issues.
	
GHCL is committed to the protection of human rights, as 
articulated in our 'Policy on Human Rights' (https://www.
ghcl.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BRR-Policy-5.pdf ), 
which obligates us to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse 
human rights impacts. We have implemented a transparent 
grievance redressal mechanism that ensures employees 
can raise concerns safely, confidentially, and without fear 
of retaliation.
	
The process follows a two-tier committee structure—a 
Grievance Redressal Committee at the location level for 
initial resolution, and an Apex Committee for escalation, 
if required. In case grievances are not resolved at Apex 
Committee level, the concerns are taken forward to the 
Managing Director for final resolution. Grievances may 
relate to workplace issues, interpersonal conflicts, or policy-
related matters and are submitted through a digital platform 
(GEMS ESS portal) for secure documentation and tracking.
	
All concerns are acknowledged within two working days 
and resolved within 30 days. The Human Resources 
team is accountable for ensuring procedural compliance, 
confidentiality, and respectful handling of each case. 
	
Further the POSH Committee is tasked with the identification 
and prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace, 
operating under the Sexual Harassment of Women at 
Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 
applicable to all GHCL employees and workers.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 11 of Essential Indicators above, provide details of 
significant direct and indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and remediation 
activities.
	
Within the ecologically sensitive Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) where our soda ash plant operates, GHCL recognizes the potential 
direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity. To mitigate these impacts and enhance ecological resilience, we have implemented the 
following prevention and remediation activities:
 
 
Coastal Conservation Efforts: Our Mangrove Plantation Initiative is a dedicated project aimed at forestalling the impacts of 
climate change and enhancing coastal community resilience in Gujarat. Launched in the coastal districts of Bhavnagar, Amreli, 
Gir Somnath, and Junagadh, we focus on the plantation of 500,000 mangrove trees within 122 hectares in two years. This 
initiative employs strategic activities, including in-depth research and direct community engagement, establishing nurseries, 
and regular plantation maintenance. This project has empowered local community members by fostering ownership and 
stewardship over the green areas and studying Carbon Sequestration. Associated benefits include improved soil quality, 
elevated water table levels, and an estimated carbon offset of 1,440 tonnes per year from the project’s 3rd year up to 25 
years. It is implemented by the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat India.
 
 
Extensive Tree Plantation: Through various tree plantation programs, GHCL has planted over 100,000 trees in degraded areas 
of the Saurashtra region, restoring ecosystems and enhancing soil fertility. These efforts combat desertification and provide 
habitats for wildlife.
 
 
Sapling Distribution to Farmers: To empower local communities, GHCL distributes saplings to farmers, supporting sustainable 
agriculture, promoting biodiversity, and creating green cover. Over 35,000 saplings have been distributed, covering more than 
164 hectares of land

279 MT/day in FY 2024–25 (from 202 MT/day in 
FY 2023–24). Production of Refined Bicarbonate 
involves absorption of CO2 gas in process 
Higher CO₂ utilization and consequently 
reduced process CO₂ emissions to the 
atmosphere.

1 C Liquor scrubber 
installation 
The installation of the 1 C Liquor scrubber is 
expected to enhance process gas absorption 
efficiency and improve the capture of CO₂-rich 
emissions from the liquor line.
This will lead to reduced process-
related CO₂ emissions, supporting the 
organization’s overall decarbonization and 
sustainability goals.
