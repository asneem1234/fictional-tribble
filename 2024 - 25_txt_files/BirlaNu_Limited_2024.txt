1
Water 
Management 
(Efficiency, 
Recycle & 
Reuse)
Risk
Effective water management 
is a focus area for BirlaNu, 
due to its importance for the 
Company’s 
manufacturing 
operations and maintaining 
positive 
relationships 
with 
the 
communities 
around 
which 
the 
Company 
operates. Growing demand 
for the industrial use of water 
may lead to more stringent 
regulations for water usage, 
as well as for the treatment 
and discharge of wastewater. 
BirlaNu 
is 
committed 
to 
minimising 
water 
consumption 
and 
improving 
water 
recycling 
across its operations. The Company operates Zero 
Liquid Discharge plants and doesn’t discharge 
any effluents. It has deployed water flow meters 
integrated with a telemetry system for real-time 
monitoring of water usage to drive efficiencies. It 
has made investments to increase its domestic 
wastewater treatment capacity to 215 KLD across 
all plants. This enables the reuse of approximately 
2,424 KL of treated water per month for maintaining 
the green belt and other utility purposes.
Negative
Many regions of India are 
facing significant water stress 
and two of BirlaNu’s plants 
are 
located 
in 
Faridabad 
and Thimmapur, that are 
respectively categorised as 
“Over-Exploited” and “Semi-
Critical water-stressed zones”.
Additionally, to enhance groundwater recharge, 
BirlaNu has upgraded its rainwater harvesting 
infrastructure. This includes the construction of roof 
rainwater harvesting pits across all locations,with a 
recharge capacity of 22.4 m³/hr, along with a roof 
rainwater storage system capable of holding 900 
m³ for reuse.  These initiatives contribute to the 
Company’s long-term water sustainability goals. 
For performance data on water consumption, 
please refer to Principle 6: Essential Indicators 3, 4 & 
Leadership Indicator 1.
2
Waste 
Management 
& Circular 
Economy
Risk and 
Opportunity
While 
ineffective 
waste 
management practices pose 
compliance and regulatory 
risks due to pollution, health 
hazards, and other adverse 
effects on the communities 
surrounding 
BirlaNu’s 
operations. Further, increased 
waste 
related 
regulations, 
including Extended Producer 
Responsibility 
(EPR) 
Rules 
could lead to significant legal 
and regulatory repercussions.
However, this also offers an 
opportunity  to BirlaNu to 
consciously reuse waste in 
its manufacturing processes 
to 
minimise 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
environment. 
In 
addition, enhancing resource 
efficiency, 
minimising 
waste, and optimising waste 
management practices, may 
lead to improved margins.
BirlaNu 
has 
implemented 
robust 
waste 
management processes to ensure the proper 
storage and disposal of waste as per regulations. 
Waste disposal is managed by Pollution Control 
Board (PCB) authorised vendors for hazardous 
wastes and approved recyclers for non-hazardous 
waste. In addition, the Company complies with the 
EPR Rules for plastics. 
BirlaNu is placing greater emphasis on applying the 
3R’s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) principles in its waste 
management practices. There is increased focus 
on improvements in manufacturing processes 
to help reduce waste generated. The Company 
actively recycles green and dry waste within its 
manufacturing 
operations 
while 
maintaining 
strict quality standards. The Company collaborates 
with its vendors to optimize packaging of raw 
materials including use of recyclable materials. 
BirlaNu continued it’s emphasis on housekeeping 
for appropriately identifying and disposing of 
accumulated non-hazardous, non-recyclable waste.

Indicator 10 and Principle 2, Essential Indicator 
4, and Principle 2, Leadership Indicator 3, and

GHG 
emissions
Risk and 
Opportunity
The 
Risk 
is 
from 
the 
Company’s 
products 
and 
some of its key raw materials 
that have energy intensive 
manufacturing 
processes. 
Additionally, upstream and 
downstream transportation, 
waste and other elements 
contribute 
to 
BirlaNu’s 
carbon footprint. Due to the 
impact of GHG emissions on 
climate change, regulatory 
risks 
could 
impact 
the 
Company and the dynamics 
of its target markets.
The Opportunity is due to 
the 
increase 
in 
adoption 
of green buildings which 
reduces 
GHG 
emissions 
during 
the 
operations/use 
phase. 
Additionally, 
the 
Green Building norms place 
emphasis on sustainability 
across the product lifecycle 
including 
the 
embodied 
carbon 
in 
construction 
material. 
Multiple 
key 
stakeholders including end-
consumers, 
contractors, 
investors, and regulators are 
paying increasing attention 
to 
the 
GHG 
footprint 
of 
products and companies. 
BirlaNu recognizes climate change related risks and 
the importance to its stakeholders that it improves 
its performance on this aspect. The Company’s 
strategy 
emphasizes 
addressing 
stakeholder 
concerns around the impacts of GHG emissions.
The Company currently monitors its operational Scope 
1 and 2 emissions and has taken targets to address 
underlying parameters to improve its performance 
on emissions intensity. It has experimented with 
using PNG instead of diesel and has been substituting 
carbon intensive fossil-fuels with solid biomass boiler 
fuel. Additionally, energy efficiency and improving 
renewable mix are strategic operational focus areas 
discussed in Energy Management. The Company 
has obtained “Green” product certifications (Refer 
to Section B, Certifications) for relevant products to 
address the opportunity among customers focusing 
on green buildings. 
For details, please refer Principle 6, Essential 
Indicator 8, Leadership Indicator 4, and for 
performance in Principle 6, Essential Indicator 7.

Energy 
Management 
and 
Renewable 
Energy
Opportunity
Energy costs contribute 
significantly to the operating 
costs of the Company, and 
their availability is critical for 
ensuring optimal production 
and capacity utilisation.  
Increased scale of renewable 
energy adoption, coupled 
with technology evolution, 
has reduced renewable 
energy costs. Operational 
focus on energy efficiency 
reduces costs. Adopting 
renewable energy sources 
and innovative technologies 
helps mitigate long-term 
risks tied to energy price 
fluctuations and regulatory 
changes.  
The Company has undertaken a series of energy 
efficiency improvement initiatives including 
operational improvements and making capital 
investments across its plants. These include motor 
management, air and pressure management, 
use of variable flow drives etc. The Company has 
initiated benchmarking of energy intensity and 
actively deploys successful projects horizontally 
across similar processes and equipment.
The Company has been evaluating opportunities 
to increase renewable energy in its energy 
consumption mix. These will be in addition to the 
existing installed capacity of its wind and solar 
energy assets.  Increased focus on energy has led 
to recategorization of the RE energy consumption 
more accurately and the data for FY24 has been 
restated accordingly.
For details, please refer Annexure VI - of Board’s 
Report, Principle 6 Leadership Indicator 4, and for 
performance in Principle 6 Essential Indicator 1.

Occupational 
Health & 
Safety (OHS)
Risk
Inadequate 
OHS 
practices 
can lead to workplace injuries, 
illnesses, or fatalities. These 
have a negative impact on 
employee well-being, human 
rights and expectations of 
responsible 
employment. 
Poor 
safety 
performance 
can also result in significant 
reputational damage, legal 
liabilities, 
and 
regulatory 
penalties. Additionally, these 
incidents increase downtime, 
reduce 
productivity, 
increase 
insurance 
and 
compensation costs besides 
raising stakeholder concerns 
around governance and risk 
management.
BirlaNu takes a proactive approach by undertaking 
mandatory 
safety 
training, 
ongoing 
hazard 
identification and risk assessments. Though the 
focus is on the prevention of injuries, there are 
some near misses and unsafe conditions that 
are identified and reported. Detailed corrective 
and preventive actions are implemented with 
learnings and best practices being horizontally 
deployed across plants. Two of the Company’s 
plants have been certified for compliance with 
the ISO 45001 standard and the same processes 
are being deployed across its plants. The Company 
continues to expand identification of opportunities 
to deploy technology solutions to improve working 
conditions.

Installers 
engaged 
in 
installation, 
maintenance, 
and 
repair, 
as 
well 
as 
building 
occupants 
face 
associated risks. Compliance 
with 
asbestos 
regulations 
governing its use, handling, 
and disposal adds complexity 
and any product liability risks 
stemming from failures and 
disposal require meticulous 
management.
The Company ensures that the materials used and 
the manufacturing processes it deploys prioritize 
customer safety during the product use stage. 
In addition, BirlaNu adheres to industry-leading 
standards for a harm-free manufacturing process 
to ensure safety and compliance at every stage of 
the manufacturing process. Particular attention 
is paid for products which require handling of 
asbestos fibre. These  are complemented with 
communication of safe handling and disposal 
instructions mitigates risks across the product 
lifecycle. In the reporting year, Fibre Week was 
organized across all its relevant plants wherein 
focused training and awareness sessions were 
carried out. Regular audits are undertaken to 
ensure robustness of risk mitigation measures. 
Additionally, BirlaNu has developed products 
which prioritize safer alternatives to align with 
evolving market and regulatory trends towards 
environmental sustainability.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflicts of interest involving members 
of the Board? (Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same. 
	
Yes, BirlaNu has implemented robust processes to manage conflicts of interest involving Board Members 
and Senior Management. Directors are required to disclose their interests in the Company, or companies 
or bodies corporate or firms or other association of individuals including details of shareholding, annually 
or upon any change. Directors also submit an annual declaration (as per the Code of Conduct), affirming 
their commitment to act in the Company’s best interest and ensure that any other business or personal 
association that they may have, does not involve any conflict of interest with the operations of the Company. 
	
The Company’s Secretarial team maintains a comprehensive database of the Directors and their declared 
interests. These are shared with the Finance team to help identify and monitor any potential conflicts of 
interest related to the Directors and the KMPs of the Company. Senior Management similarly confirms 
each year that they have not engaged in any material, financial and commercial transactions that could 
conflict with the Company’s interests at large. Directors with a declared interest in any Board agenda item 
recluse themselves from related discussions and decisions.

2.	
a. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) :
	
	
No, the Company’s critical raw material suppliers are large entities with established sustainability 
practices and certifications. BirlaNu is in the process of approval for its sustainable sourcing policy 
which lays down the Company’s principles towards sustainable sourcing. In addition, the Company 
will be rolling out its Supplier Code of Conduct which lays down its expectations from its suppliers on 
a variety of ESG aspects. 
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?  
	
	
~5.6% (by value) of our raw material is recycled and reused waste from other industries as detailed in 
Principle 2 Leadership Indicator. 
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and 
disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste, 
and (d) other waste. 
	
BirlaNu recognizes the significance of end-of-life management for its products. Safe recovery, reuse, 
recycling, and disposal of products at the end of their life fall outside the Company's direct control and 
responsibility, given their long lifespan. As BirlaNu manufactures building and construction materials, they 
are ultimately disposed of as Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste. The Company’s products do not fall 
under E-Waste at end-of-life. Plastic and E-Waste during the Company’s operations are disposed of as per 
Waste Management Rules as detailed in Principle 6, Essential Indicators 9 and 10. Post-consumer plastic 
packaging waste is addressed through EPR as explained in Principle 2, Essential Indicator 4.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). 
If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the 
same. 
	
Yes, the Company has obtained EPR Targets as both an importer and brand owner for plastics (E-Waste is 
not applicable). For FY25, the minimum plastic recycling targets are approximately 63.5 tons of CAT-1, 61.5 
tons of CAT-2, 63.5 tons of CAT-1 EOL, and 143.5 tons of CAT-2 EOL. Additionally, BirlaNu successfully achieved 
its targets for FY24 by purchasing Plastic Credits.

10.	 Health and safety management system: 
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system? 
	
The health and safety of its employees and workers is a critical priority for BirlaNu. The Company 
adheres to both global and National Occupational Health and Safety standards. The Company monitors 
its Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety practices to ensure compliance with all 
applicable regulations and abides by the Occupational Health and Safety Management System at all 
its plants. The Occupational Health and Safety Management System covers 100% of its employees and 
workers. The Company has achieved ISO 45001 certifications at two of its plants—Golan and Faridabad. 
Furthermore, BirlaNu has developed a progressive plan to expand the ISO 45001 certification across its 
operations nationwide. 
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity? 
	
BirlaNu conducts Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) on a routine and non-routine basis to 
ensure workplace safety. Hazards are identified through inspections, worker feedback and incident reports 
covering unsafe acts and unsafe conditions. Risks are assessed using a 5x5 matrix based on likelihood 
and severity, with controls implemented via engineering solutions, administrative measures, and PPE. The 
EHS lead of each plant conducts regular inspections and collaborates with department heads to address 
safety issues. Quarterly safety meetings and interdepartmental EHS audits ensure continuous safety 
improvements, with processes in place to identify and assess work-related hazards and risks regularly. 
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Yes/ No)
	
Yes, BirlaNu has established clear processes for workers to report work-related hazards and remove 
themselves from potential risks. Employees are encouraged to suggest safety improvements via written 
submissions in a suggestion box. The Company has implemented a robust system for reporting and 
investigating Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) events, ensuring proper categorization of incidents. 
This approach ensures consistent reporting and investigation while identifying and addressing bottlenecks 
in processes, procedures, and practices. 
	
Each work area and shift are assigned a designated supervisor to whom hazards must be reported. In cases 
of high-severity risks, operations are paused to mitigate potential harm. Regular mock drills are conducted 
as part of the emergency preparedness plan, with specific emergency scenarios identified to ensure 
employees are equipped to respond swiftly and effectively. 
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No) 
	
The well-being of its people is integral to the success of BirlaNu’s employer brand and its vision for the 
future. The Company has developed a robust system to monitor employees' overall health, addressing both 
occupational and non-occupational illnesses. Employee health is prioritized from the pre-employment 
medical check-up and continues throughout their tenure, extending to a year post-retirement from 
the Company. Regular medical check-ups are provided to all employees, along with personalised health 
education and counselling sessions. Each plant location has tie-ups with local hospitals nearby, which offer 
access to discounted healthcare services for BirlaNu’s employees and workers.
	
Further, in compliance with regulatory requirements, the Company has conducted asbestos-related health 
check-ups. State-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are in place for periodic health check-ups, 
which include half-yearly pulmonary function tests (PFT) and X-rays every three years. Retired permanent 
workers are also contacted every three years to encourage follow-up X-ray examinations, ensuring ongoing 
health monitoring.

Health and Safety at the workplace is a focus for BirlaNu and is regularly reviewed by the executive 
leadership. The Company has implemented a formal program that outlines management and employee 
responsibilities to maintain a safe working environment. The program includes policies and procedures 
for identifying hazards, assessing risks, implementing control measures, and providing employee training 
and education.

inspected to evaluate hazards and the effectiveness of control measures and ensure compliance with 
relevant regulations and standards.

shoes). Over 25,740 hours of training till March 2025 and a 100% EHS Induction rate for new employees 
have been conducted across locations to ensure comprehensive safety knowledge. A 2-day workshop 
on EHS and Safety was held for leadership teams to strengthen their knowledge and commitment to 
safety. In addition, third-party safety training is conducted regularly on PPE usage and factory safety 
procedures to ensure adherence to best practices.

14.	 Assessments for the year:
15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety related incidents (if 
any) and on significant risks/concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and 
working conditions:
	
Based on a near miss, the Company implemented a work permit compliance check to minimize the risk of 
accidents. This has been implemented across all plants and Strategic Business Units (SBUs) and is monitored 
regularly. The Company achieved an average of 94% compliance across all plants. Additionally, the team took 
appropriate steps to fine-tune processes, including implementing a daily work permit system, assigning 
supervisors for higher-risk tasks, and enhancing worker awareness of EHS protocols to improve safety. In 
response to another incident at the Faridabad Sheet Plant, the height of pulp storage was reduced, and a 
"work permit" discussion forum was created for real-time communication. Also, CAPA measures, including 
stricter monitoring of storage areas and enforcement of safety policies, have been deployed across plants 
to ensure ongoing safety improvements and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.
13.	 Number of Complaints on the following made by employees and workers:
Leadership Indicators:
1.	
Does the entity extend any life insurance or any compensatory package in the event of death:
	
BirlaNu's permanent employees are covered under Term Life Insurance at no additional cost. Under this, 
in the unfortunate event of an employee's demise during their employment, the nominee will receive an 
amount equivalent to "40 times the last drawn monthly basic salary of the deceased employee". In addition, 
workers are also covered under the ESIC Act. For FY25, there was one reported death case, and H 8,39,286/- 
was paid as compensation.
2.	
Provide the measures undertaken by the entity to ensure that statutory dues have been deducted 
and deposited by the value chain partners:
	
Contractual workforce service providers are routinely assessed to verify compliance with statutory 
obligations, including PF, Gratuity, Insurance, Taxes, and related dues. Additionally, approval of the current 
month’s billing is contingent upon certification from the respective unit HR, confirming that all statutory 
payments for the previous month have been duly met.  In addition, all contracts with the Company’s value 
chain partners specify their obligations towards the payment of "Taxes & Duties", "Compliance with Laws", 
"Compliance with Statutory Obligations”, “Indemnification", "Audit Provisions", etc. These bind the value 
chain partners to ensure the timely and complete payment of statutory dues.

Leadership Indicators:
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Board has delegated the responsibility of stakeholder consultation on environmental and social topics 
to the Executive Leadership of BirlaNu. Functional leaders have a structured engagement mechanism as 
discussed in Principle 4, Essential Indicator 2 (above). These ongoing engagements, actions taken and 
implications for the business are periodically reviewed by the Board through the Board Familiarization 
Programmes (please refer Principle 1, Essential Indicator 1). Investor and Shareholder concerns are 
presented to the Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee while the CSR Committee reviews inputs received 
from its communities. These committees and Board Familiarization Programmes provide a critical forum 
for ensuring that the Board takes cognizance of diverse stakeholder perspectives and concerns during 
decisions related to economic, environmental, and social impacts.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into the policies and activities of 
the entity.
	
Yes, Stakeholder consultation is a key process for identifying both the environmental and social needs of 
the stakeholders. Employee feedback and input are gathered through BirlaNu’s engagement platforms, 
which inform the development of new initiatives and policies.

For example, based on employee feedback, BirlaNu has introduced optional holidays for both office and 
field-based employees, providing the option to use Advance PL in case of medical exigencies, increased 
the limit for paternity leave, and introduced bereavement leave. Similarly, customer feedback is crucial 
in guiding the R&D team to develop new products and enhance existing ones. The implementation of 
health and safety continuous improvement programs (Kaizen) has led to the successful completion and 
horizontal deployment of several initiatives. On the basis of feedback from its influencers, the Company has 
launched a digital loyalty program to smoothen the process for coupon redemptions and other activities 
thereby building stronger engagement with this key stakeholder group.  
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with and actions taken to address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
BirlaNu actively engages with vulnerable and marginalized communities near its plant operations to 
understand their needs and address them, demonstrating its strong commitment to social responsibility. 
Through structured initiatives, the Company ensures community voices are heard and incorporated into 
decision-making, leading to improved access to education, healthcare, and livelihood opportunities. One 
such initiative is the “Rural Mental Health Program” in Odisha, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, which aims 
to enhance quality of life by raising mental health awareness, providing free psychiatric consultations and 
treatment, and supporting those with mental illnesses. All of BirlaNu’s CSR activities are similarly tailored 
to the needs of the communities surrounding the operational facilities of the Company.

5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation:
	
BirlaNu has made substantial investments to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) across all its plants. None 
of the manufacturing processes across plants generate any process effluents. Only domestic wastewater is 
generated from toilets and the canteen, which is treated, and the treated water is utilized for the irrigation 
of the green belt. This helps ensure no water is discharged, with no liquid waste released onto land or into 
water bodies. In addition, BirlaNu has invested in digital monitoring systems using water flowmeters with 
Telemetry for efficient monitoring and reducing water wastage. The Company has also expanded rainwater 
storage across various plant locations in India. For more details, please check Principle 6 of Leadership

Being a future-focused organisation, BirlaNu recognises Climate Change and GHG Emissions as a material 
ESG risk, which also aligns with the Govt of India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) towards GHG 
emission reduction. The Company has taken quantified goals to help drive this focus. The manufacturing 
operations of BirlaNu’s plants are taking focused programs for improving the renewable energy mix, use 
of biomass, and energy efficiency. The Company has undertaken the initiative to assess opportunities to 
enhance solar energy across its plants. A number of energy saving initiatives have been implemented 
including use of VFD’s, motor management through optimizing power, air compression management 
among others. There is a significant focus on manufacturing excellence to minimize waste and improve 
yield which have an impact on energy consumption and GHG impact of waste disposal.
	
Given BirlaNu’s focus on improving the environmental impacts of its business, the Company ensures a 
minimum of 33% of the land in its plants is dedicated to the green belt. In some of the Company locations 
including Faridabad, the green cover is significantly greater which would effectively help offset its GHG 
emissions. For more details, please refer to Annexure VI of the Board’s Report.

Non-hazardous waste generated includes metal and wood scrap, process waste, and garbage (including food waste). Recycled 
waste consists of non-hazardous waste materials including metal and wood waste, plastic scraps, tyre waste, and MS barrels 
by an authorised waste recycler as well as composted wet waste. Any asbestos-based dry waste that cannot be recycled 
is transferred annually to TSDF (Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility). Incineration is done for biomedical waste per the 
Hazardous Waste Management Rules. Landfilling involves the disposal of boiler ash, broken powder blocks, process sludge 
containing non-asbestos fibre, and non-asbestos discarded sheets. The Company endeavours that the majority of landfills 
are directed toward the reclamation of land by the communities surrounding its manufacturing facilities. However, the rest is 
handled by an authorised waste disposal Company. There has been one-time disposal of Construction and Demolition waste 
and other non-recyclable waste to landfill for some of our plants.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by the Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes:
	
BirlaNu is committed to its goal of environmental responsibility which is executed through a detailed 
waste management strategy. Hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated at all locations is collected 
and segregated according to its characteristics, in line with the Waste Management Rules for specific 
types of waste. 
	
Hazardous waste is sent to PCB-authorized vendors for safe disposal, in compliance with regulatory norms. 
Any asbestos waste deemed unsuitable for reuse is disposed of at a Treatment, Storage, and Disposal 
Facility (TSDF), ensuring safe and environmentally sound management. Dry waste, which may contain 
asbestos or used lubricant oil, is meticulously handled with advanced dust collection systems and strict 
safety protocols. For non-hazardous waste such as metal, wood, and MS drums, the Company has mapped 
various waste streams and ensures appropriate storage. This waste is then sold to authorized dealers for 
recycling, repurposing, or proper disposal.
	
Additionally, BirlaNu adopts circular economy and 5R principles, prioritizing waste reduction and resource 
efficiency. The Company incorporates alternative materials from thermal power plants and steel production 
units into its manufacturing processes. All discarded or defective products, including pipes, boards, panels, 
and sheets, are grounded and converted into Dry Waste Recycle (DWR) wherever applicable and reused 
as input material in manufacturing. Furthermore, synthetic packaging materials wherever possible have 
been replaced with sustainable alternatives to foster a culture of reuse and recycling. 
	
The Company ensures that all relevant regulations, protocols and processes enforcing strict safety, handling, 
and disposal of asbestos fibre are followed to prevent exposure. In addition, it continues to invest its R&D 
efforts towards reducing asbestos in its products. No other hazardous or toxic chemicals are used in our 
manufacturing processes.
