1
Air Emissions
Risk
In India, emissions of SOx, 
NOx, SPM, and particulate 
matter from diesel generators 
(DG) and boilers have been 
linked to serious health 
hazards. In addition to 
frequently resulting in hefty 
fines, non-compliance with 
the standards established by 
regulatory agencies such as 
the CPCB can have serious 
long-term effects on human 
health and the environment. 
To lessen these effects, it is 
essential to observe and abide 
by these rules.
APL consistently monitor air 
emissions from manufacturing 
operations and apply 
necessary controls to ensure 
that emissions stay within 
permissible limits. Our 
operation's key air emissions, 
such as particulate matter, 
Sulphur oxides, and nitrogen 
oxides, are consistently 
monitored by an independent 
third party to guarantee 
adherence to all relevant 
regulatory standards.
Negative
2
GHG 
Emissions
Risk
In addition to contributing to 
climate change, unmanaged 
GHG emissions expose 
businesses to tangible risks 
such as resource shortages, 
supply chain disruptions, 
and extreme weather. 
Stricter government rules 
on emissions, like carbon 
pricing and reporting 
obligations, make non-
compliance risky from a legal 
and financial standpoint. 
Furthermore, rising investor 
and customer knowledge 
of environmental issues can 
undermine a company's 
brand by undermining 
consumer confidence and 
competitiveness.
Considering the energy-
intensive nature of our activities, 
we consider effective emission 
control to be a major objective 
and a significant emphasis. 
The company's extensive 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) policy 
demonstrates its commitment 
to addressing climate change. 
Our proactive strategy for 
lowering GHG emissions across 
all operations is described in this 
policy. By deploying sustainable 
technology, switching to 
renewable energy sources, 
and adopting energy-efficient 
practices, we aim to reduce our 
carbon footprint.
Negative
3
Energy 
Management
Risk
Inefficient energy 
consumption raises 
greenhouse gas emissions, 
which affects a business's 
reputation, sustainability, 
and compliance as well as 
its environmental impact. 
Companies that rely on non-
renewable energy sources 
run the danger of resource 
scarcity and price instability; 
therefore, switching to 
renewable energy is essential 
to lowering reliance on limited 
resources.
Due to the energy-intensive 
nature of the chemical industry, 
efficient energy management 
is essential. We understand 
the significance of energy 
consumption and greenhouse 
gas emissions in the chemicals 
and fluorocarbons industry. 
Through increased productivity 
and ongoing improvements 
in manufacturing techniques, 
we intend for to achieve better 
sustainability and lessen our 
carbon impact.
Negative
4
Water and 
Effluent 
Management
Risk
Water is used in many 
different processes in the 
chemical industry. Different 
phases of the production 
process require varying 
degrees of water purity. 
We believe it is our duty to 
increase water reuse and 
recycling while lowering 
freshwater consumption and 
wastewater creation.
APL has progressed towards 
attaining Water Positive status 
at its manufacturing facility by 
installing a plant featuring a 
Zero Liquid Discharge system 
that utilises multi-stage reverse 
osmosis and a permeate system. 
Zero Liquid Discharge plant 
incorporates a multi-stage 
Reverse Osmosis (RO) system 
for the treatment and reuse 
of effluent from the current 
Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP).

Waste 
Management
Risk
Being a major participant in 
the chemical business, we 
are committed to reducing 
waste production and making 
sure that each and every 
rule pertaining to hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste 
is managed, handled, and 
disposed of properly. Effective 
waste management, in 
our opinion, is crucial to 
environmental preservation. 
Making ensuring that the 
waste generated at our 
facilities is appropriately 
separated and disposed of in 
complete accordance with the 
applicable regulations is our 
duty.
We strictly adhere to the 3R 
principle of reduce, recycle, and 
reuse.
The management, storage, 
and disposal of both hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste 
adheres strictly to all legal 
requirements, as outlined in 
APL's "Environmental Policy for 
Waste Management".
The waste generated by 
our Company is within the 
permissible limits set by Central 
or State Pollution Boards (CPCB/
SPCB).
Negative
6
Human Rights
Risk
Prioritising human rights 
helps businesses establish 
enduring, mutually beneficial 
relationships with all of their 
stakeholders, including 
customers, communities, 
workers, and investors. 
A strong human rights 
governance framework 
might have a detrimental 
effect on our company's 
social performance, 
particularly with regard to 
workers, the workforce, and 
the community. Working 
conditions, child and forced 
labour, fair wages, gender 
diversity, sexual harassment 
prevention, freedom of 
association, and collective 
bargaining are all important 
topics that should be covered 
under this framework.
APL has a robust Code of 
Conduct, Whistle Blower 
Policy and POSH Policy. All 
these policies are applicable to 
Employees, and affiliates.
Negative
7
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Encouraging diversity 
and inclusion (D&I) boosts 
a company's brand and 
stakeholder connections 
while demonstrating a 
commitment to equality, 
fairness, and human rights. 
Additionally, it promotes 
a courteous and upbeat 
workplace, which raises 
employee engagement, 
morale, and retention.
By contributing a variety of 
views, talents, skills, and areas 
of experience, a diverse staff 
expands our capacity to serve 
our clients. Our HR philosophies 
support treating all workers 
fairly, irrespective of their social 
standing, gender, age, ethnicity, 
religion, or colour, among other 
factors.

Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Establishing connections 
built on trust and 
maintaining active 
community engagement 
with APL are essential 
for promoting social 
development and 
resolving any possible 
objections or concerns 
from these groups.
APL’s CSR activities support 
developmental areas across 
education, healthcare, and 
environmental sustainability.
Positive
9
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Hazardous chemical 
exposure is a possibility 
for APL employees and 
workers. In the worst 
situation, disregarding 
health and safety 
regulations may result in 
more mishaps and injuries, 
expensive legal action, 
a smaller staff, worse 
employee morale, or even 
potentially jeopardise 
business profitability. 
As a reflection of our 
commitment to protecting 
the health and safety of 
our workers, we have put 
in place a robust EHS 
management system that 
includes thorough hazard 
identification, mitigation 
techniques, root cause 
analysis of events, and 
corrective action plans 
in order to prevent these 
risks.
The health and safety of our 
employees is our top priority 
at APL. Our factories have 
proudly reached zero deaths, 
and there haven't been any 
shutdowns or malfunctions 
brought on by a shortage of 
workers. To guarantee the 
safety and wellbeing of our 
employees, we have put in 
place a number of measures, 
such as health insurance, 
safety training, high-quality 
PPE kits, frequent third-
party safety audits.
Negative
10
Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
The dynamic and complex 
environment in which 
we operate exposes us to 
risks pertaining to ethical 
business practices and 
corporate governance. Any 
unethical behaviour might 
harm our company's 
reputation and result 
in fines, penalties, and 
unfavourable financial 
outcomes.
At APL, we believe that 
sound corporate governance 
is a prerequisite for efficient 
management techniques. 
We maintain the greatest 
standards of morality and 
conduct, making sure 
that all applicable laws 
and internal guidelines 
are followed. The Vigil 
Mechanism (Whistle-
Blower Policy) and Code of 
Conduct Policy have been 
put into place by the Board 
of Directors and apply to 
all dedicated employees, 
senior management, key 
managerial staff, and 
directors.

Data Security 
and Privacy
Risk
Data security breaches 
pose a serious threat to 
intellectual property and 
competitive advantage 
in the chemical sector 
because of its reliance on 
proprietary research and 
methods. Cyberattacks 
may damage company 
relationships, interfere 
with operations, and steal 
confidential information. 
In order to defend the 
company's reputation 
and preserve confidence 
with stakeholders, 
investors, and consumers, 
strong data protection 
procedures are essential.
The data protection and 
information security policy 
of APL guarantees the 
availability, confidentiality, 
and integrity of data by 
adhering to regulatory 
requirements, putting risk-
based security measures 
in place, and enforcing 
stringent access restrictions.

5. Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation.
Yes. Amines & Plasticisers Limited has progressed towards attaining Water Positive status at its manufacturing 
facility by installing a plant featuring a Zero Liquid Discharge system that utilises multi-stage reverse osmosis and 
a permeate system. Zero Liquid Discharge plant incorporates a multi-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) system for the 
treatment and reuse of effluent from the current Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). The treated effluent undergoes pre-
treatment prior to entering Stage I of the RO system (75 CMD capacity), yielding 64 CMD of permeate for reuse and 
11 CMD of reject. The reject undergoes further processing in Stage II, producing an additional 6 CMD of permeate 
and 5-6 CMD of reject. The residual reject (7.5 CMD) is directed to an evaporation system, where condensate is 
reclaimed for reuse, and the residue is disposed of securely. This procedure optimises water recovery (70 CMD of 
combined RO permeate), reduces discharge, and guarantees environmental sustainability.
