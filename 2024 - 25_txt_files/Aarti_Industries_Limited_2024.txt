1
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
As a responsible chemical 
manufacturing company, 
we are cognisant of our 
responsibility to safeguard 
the health and safety of 
individuals. AIL strives to 
prevent injury by sustaining 
an injury-free workplace 
with a mindset of zero 
tolerance towards any 
incident or injury.
Health impact or injury 
during working may lead to 
financial implications and 
reputation loss to AIL. Any 
accident may also impact 
the morale of the workers 
leading to production 
losses. Non adherence to 
OHS requirement may also 
lead to fines and penalties
We have developed and adopted a robust, 
comprehensive, and reliable Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System under 
Aarti Management System. All our employees, 
contract employees and visitors are covered 
under our Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System. Process safety and risk 
management, Emergency mitigation system.
In addition we have implemented following 
safety interventions across our manufacturing 
locations:
•	
Plant-level initiatives such as daily toolbox 
talk, monthly awareness sessions, etc.
•	
Process safety is managed through 
process management guidelines. Risk 
assessment is carried out through HAZOP, 
HIRA, QRA and chemical exposure study. 
JCC is also done to check the adherence 
to SOP, other than these regular third party 
audit through external auditor (expert in the 
field) is done to identify process risks

Waste 
management
Risk
Waste generated from 
our operations consists 
of hazardous as well as 
non-hazardous waste. 
Environmental Impact 
due to improper disposal 
of these waste is a 
compliance as well as 
regulatory risk. It may lead 
to fines and penalties from 
regulatory authorities
Our waste management approach is 
systematically divided into three priorities 
depending upon the various operating 
conditions and type of waste generated. Our 
priority to reduce hazardous wastes are:
First Priority: Produce less hazardous waste
•	
Change industrial process to eliminate use 
of harmful chemicals
•	
Use less hazardous product
•	
Reduce packaging materials in products
•	
Change industrial processes to reduce or 
eliminate hazardous waste production
Second Priority: Convert hazardous waste to 
less hazardous or non - hazardous substance by 
using 4 R’s
•	
Buy reusable and recyclable products
•	
Reuse
•	
Recovery
•	
Recycle
•

Last Priority – Treatment & disposal of all our 
waste:
•	
Treating waste to reduce toxicity
•	
Incinerate waste
•	
Waste in landfills

Climate 
change and 
Governance
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
There are risks associated 
with climate change such 
as manufacturing losses 
due to climate events, 
restrictions due to existing 
and emerging regulations 
leading to reputational 
damage.
Opportunity:
Reduction of carbon 
emissions by the 
deployment of 
technologies, collaboration 
with other peers and 
industries, etc
We have embedded the process of climate 
action governance across AIL and we have 
defined the roles and responsibilities of 
individuals in assessing and managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities. We 
have also integrated the process of addressing 
climate-related issues when reviewing and 
guiding strategy, risk management policies, 
annual budgets, monitoring implementation 
and performance, and overseeing major capital 
expenditures, acquisitions, and divestitures.

Opportunity
People are the backbone 
of our organization. 
Recruitment, training, 
and retention of talent 
are crucial to our 
growth story
We believe in ensuring that our workplaces 
are safe and inclusive. We make efforts to 
build a satisfactory work culture that nurtures 
employee growth and increases employee 
satisfaction. We provide training and awareness 
programmes to our employees to ensure 
capacity building and skill upgradation across 
all levels. We also provide medical and non-
medical benefits to all our employees
Positive
5
Human Rights Risk
Human rights impact 
the business internally 
and externally from 
procurement of raw 
materials to distribution 
and disposal. It may also 
impact the reputation 
of the company and 
lead to regulatory non- 
compliances making this 
topic significant for AIL.
We have developed a comprehensive 
Human Rights due diligence framework for 
a systematic assessment of our operations. 
We have undertaken human right vulnerability 
assessment at our operation location for 
addressing human rights risks, mitigating 
impacts, and monitoring and reporting 
performance to substantiate our commitment 
to respect Human rights in all our business 
operations. Responsibility of respecting human 
rights is also extended to our business partners 
in the form of their alignment with our policies, 
contract agreements.
Negative
6
Business 
Ethics and 
compliance
Risk
Negative brand reputation 
due to non-compliance 
with regulatory and legal 
requirements.
We have in place stringent and comprehensive 
Code of Conduct and policies to ensure ethical 
behaviour at all levels. We also provide training 
on the Code of Conduct to all our employees 
and workers to educate them about appropriate 
behaviour at the workplace. To adhere and track 
the regulatory compliance applicable on AIL we 
are using online compliance management tools.
Negative
7
IT security and 
data privacy
Risk
Enterprise risks associated 
with IT and cybersecurity 
such as Operational 
costs related to dealing 
with cyber crime, theft 
of sensitive information, 
non-compliance and fines 
and penalties.
We are building cybersecurity architecture 
through a layered defense approach. We are 
also undertaking Vulnerability Assessment and 
Penetration Testing (VAPT) of our IT Systems 
and Network Infrastructure with an intent of 
providing a safe and secure environment to  
our customers. We have taken several measures 
to protect our IT security systems and adhere to 
regulatory guidelines. We reported zero cases of 
data breaches and IT-related issues.
AIL has also obtained ISO 27001 Information 
security management system certification for 
its R&D facility in Navi Mumbai, R&D office at 
Vadodara, Zone 1 at Vapi including pilot plant, 
Zone 3 (Dahej and Bhachau) this covers more 
that 80% of our manufacturing locations, we are 
in process of obtaining the same for remaning 
manufacturing locations this will reduce IT 
related risk of AIL.

Water and 
effluent
Risk
Water supply is important 
for our manufacturing 
locations, water scarcity 
can affect our operations 
leading to impact on 
revenue generation. 
Additionally, the probability 
of polluting a water 
resource and nearby habitat 
as a result of improper 
treatment or failure of 
technologies also poses 
a risk.
We have taken measures to ensure availability 
of water for our operations as well as the 
local communities through CSR initiatives. 8 
of our manufacturing facilities are Zero Liquid 
Discharge, 3 of our manufacturing facilities 
are Zero Liquid Discharge ready and rest of 
the manufacturing facilities are in process of 
becoming Zero Liquid Discharge ready. We 
are in the process of reducing the amount of 
water being discharged from other locations. 
At the same time, we are also making process 
improvements such as recycling back 
condensate and RO permeate to reduce the 
volume of effluent generated thereby decreasing 
the requirement of freshwater as well as 
decrease the load on our effluent treatment 
plants. Further to this we are exploring the 
technologies that control reactions on adiabatic 
conditions enabling us to prevent water loss 
through cooling systems
Negative

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Leveraging renewable 
energy sources, adopting 
energy efficient solutions 
and reducing dependency 
on non-renewable sources 
for energy consumption 
will assist us in reducing 
the GHG emissions, 
improve resource efficiency, 
cost saving, cleaner 
environment etc.
We have adopted an IT-based Energy 
Management System (EnMS) for controlling, 
managing and conserving energy.
AIL has started receiving 13.2 MW of hybrid 
renewable energy. Further to this board of AIL 
has also approved the phase-2 investment for 
25.7.MW in hybrid renewable power. Collectively 
it has the potential to reduce 112,400 mt tCO2e.
We have regularized usage of Biomass for 
replacing coal gradually in order to reduce 
carbon emissions.
We have several energy efficiency programs 
through process optimization. Under this, 
one such program is to recover energy from a 
distillation condenser in the form of steam by 
supplying hot water, this enables us to save 
cooling water loss and recover energy saving 
fuels and eliminating CO2 emissions.
Based on our several energy efficiency 
initiatives, we have saved approx 5.0 million 
KWH of energy in 2024-25.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for
 
a) 
Plastic Waste (Including packaging) - Plastic waste generated due to packaging our product is collected under EPR 
through third parties as per Plastic waste management rules, plastic waste collected is recycled. During last FY 24-25, 
716 MT of total plastic waste was collected. For plastic material exported or sent to other industries as raw material, 
the customer are required to safely dispose off the product as per local regulations
 
b) 
E-waste - E-waste is not generated by AIL products as we are into manufacturing of speciality chemicals. The E-waste 
generated from after use in-house is sold to approved vendors for recycling and safe disposal
 
c) 
Hazardous waste - Our products are used as intermediate by other industries to produce finished goods. Hazardous 
waste generated during usage of the product is handled by our customers as per respective regulatory approvals.
 
d) 
Other waste -
 
 
i) 
Battery Waste - Battery-waste is not generated by AIL products as we are into manufacturing of speciality 
chemicals. The Battery-waste generated by AIL after use is sold to approved authorized recyclers.
4.

collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If 
not, provide steps taken to address the same.
 
Yes, EPR is applicable to AIL. We are manufacturing speciality chemicals which are intermediate products for our 
customers, they use it as raw material to produce finished products. Hence the packaging material becomes a pre-
consumer plastic waste for customers who recycle it through authorized recyclers. We have one B2C Product (fertilizer) 
and EPR is applicable to us for that product. We are registered under the category of ‘Brand Owner’ on the CPCB EPR 
Portal. A detailed waste collection plan has been developed and submitted to the Central Pollution Control Board. The 
registration has been completed for the same.
 
In FY 24-25, we had a target of collection of 716 MT of Plastic waste as per EPR. We have collected and recycled 716 MT 
of plastic waste.

b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
 
 
With commitment of Zero harm to our people and the environment, it becomes very essential that the hazards at 
the workplace are effectively assessed and managed. This also ensures reliability of our operations.
 
 
We have developed several tools to regularly evaluate potential workplace-related health and safety hazards and 
their risks. We deploy Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), a qualitative risk assessment tool for our 
routine activities.
 
 
Additionally, for non-routine tasks, we conduct Job Safety Analysis to identify and analyze job-related hazards. 
We then implement control measures to minimize risks. Safety audits are being conducted internally by deploying 
external subject matter experts to verify our control measures. These audits are documented, tracked, and reviewed 
regularly at various governance platforms. The concept of TACIT Knowledge for learning and development is 
introduced which enables safety capability building. To ensure inherent safe design and operation, we conduct 
process safety studies for existing and new projects, including Thermal Safety Studies (DSC, TSu, RC1e) and Powder 
Safety studies & also to ensure continual Risk reduction, process parameters validation, Criticality Class Study, SIL, 
QRA, and HAC studies are conducted.
 
 
Implementation of Risk based approach for process safety through risk register & barrier management. Plant-wise 
top risk’s controls are evaluated through monitoring the healthiness of existing barriers.
 
 
External assessments and certifications further validate our commitment to excellence. At AIL, our unwavering 
dedication to health and safety assessment guarantees the wellbeing and protection of our valued employees and 
other relevant stakeholders.
 
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
 
 
Yes, to create a safe and supportive work environment, we have established a process for workers to report work-
related hazards and hazardous situations through implementation of our module General Plant Condition. We also 
actively encourage incident reporting and investigation, allowing and recognising anyone in the plant to report unsafe 
conditions and unsafe acts for prompt action.
 
d.

AIL fosters a culture of safety, accountability, and transparency, ultimately creating a safer and more productive work 
environment for all employees. We have established and implemented a clearly defined process for incident reporting and 
investigation of occupational injuries and illness. A well-defined incident investigation process helps to identify the critical 
factors that are involved in an incident. It also helps to take appropriate corrective actions to avoid such recurrence. The 
investigation is being carried out through the ‘5 Whys technique’ in which for each identified cause, the team asks “why” 
repeatedly to identify the root cause of the incident. It helps to cover the causes involving organizational, procedural, and 
systemic factors that may have contributed to the incident. We follow a hierarchy of controls to determine appropriate 
corrective measures.. The learnings from the incident investigation are shared with other locations for horizontal deployment.

company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
 
We are in the process of manufacturing specialty chemicals that are hazardous in nature. By the nature of chemistry 
itself, our operations are subjected to the generation of hazardous waste. Our R&D and technology management teams 
continuously strive to reduce waste generation by improving the performance of existing technologies and considering the 
principles of sustainability in the design of new products. We have adopted standardized protocols for waste identification 
and categorization, waste collection and segregation, labelling, storage, and responsible disposal of hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste. Our waste management policies are intended to handle hazardous and non-hazardous waste in 
accordance with legal requirements and globally accepted best practices.
 
Our waste management approach is systematically divided into three priorities depending upon the various operating 
conditions and type of waste generated. These are as follows:
 
Measures taken to minimize primary pollution, waste prevention and our priority to reduce hazardous waste are:
•	 Change industrial process to eliminate use of harmful chemicals
•	 Use less of a harmful / product
•	 Reduce packaging and materials in products
•	 Make products last longer and are recyclable, reusable, or easy to repair
•	 Change industrial processes to reduce or eliminate hazardous waste production
•	 Buy reusable and recyclable products
 
Measures taken to minimize secondary pollution and waste prevention and second priority to reduce Hazardous or Non-
Hazardous waste are:
•	 Reuse
•	 Recovery
•	 Recycle
•	 Repair
 
Treatment and disposal of all our waste:
•	 Treating waste to reduce toxicity
•	 Incinerate waste

Outcome of the initiative
1
Process intensification
The hydrodynamic/mixing study and kinetics study for Ammonlysis 
were conducted with the help of CFD software, alongside several pilot 
trials, aimed at reducing BCT.
Based on these studies several DOEs were proposed for Lab Trials at 
LCTM ensuring the alignment with the Process safety via systematic 
ARC & TSU studies. The proposed DOEs have changes in operating 
parameters like Temperature, mixing, Concentrations, etc & validated 
in the Pilot plant.
Through the power of 
process intensification 
studies, we were able to 
achieve a remarkable over 
50% reduction in batch 
cycle time.
2
Energy efficiency
A systematic heat integration study, leveraging pinch analysis, was 
implemented at one of our monitoring location to optimize energy 
utilization. Process-side integration utilized the sensible heat of hot 
product gases/vapors to preheat/vaporize raw material streams, 
reducing direct heating requirements. Utility-side integration captured 
reaction exothermicity to preheat hot oil, decreasing thermopack load.
These integrated 
strategies achieved a 30% 
overall energy saving, 
enhancing process 
efficiency and reducing the 
plant's carbon footprint.
5. 
Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
 
In line with our commitment to prevent injury and provide a safe and healthy workplace we have developed and adopted 
detailed onsite and off site emergency plans (OSEP) for all our manufacturing locations. These carefully drafted plans 
outline the strategies for detailed response, escalation hierarchies and control measures to contain the emergencies 
effectively. We have a dedicated team of skilled experts equipped with infrastructure at each of our manufacturing 
locations to handle any emergency. By conducting regular mock drills we prepare our employees to tackle a variety 
of emergencies.
6. 
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
 
As majority of our raw materials are sourced from oil and gas value chains which are typically energy intensive, we are 
cautious of the environmental impact arising from our value chain. In order to better understand the emission hotspot, 
we have conducted LCA for our 81% product by spending. Additionally, we have undertaken various initiatives to reduce 
emissions across our value chain and promote the use of a diverse energy mix.

implemented to mitigate or eliminate any undue influence on the assurance process. We are committed to maintaining independence
