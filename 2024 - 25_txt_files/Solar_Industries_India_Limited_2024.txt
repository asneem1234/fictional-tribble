Subject: Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on KPIs/
Metrics in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(BRSR) of Solar Industries India Limited (hereafter referred to as 
“Solar” or “Company”) for the Financial Year Ended March 31, 2025
1.	
Introduction and Scope
	
Moore Singhi Advisors LLP (“Moore Singhi” or “we” or “us”) 
has been engaged by Solar Industries India Limited to provide 
independent reasonable assurance on Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) / metrics under nine (9) ESG attributes 
(listed in Annexure 1) following the BRSR Core – Framework 
for assurance and ESG disclosures for value chain (“BRSR 
Core”) stipulated in SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/
CIR/2023/122, dated July 12, 2023 and Industry Standards on 
Reporting of BRSR Core, circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/
CIR/2024/177, dated December 20, 2024 (“Circular”) and 
under the terms of the engagement letter dated September 14, 
2024. Our assurance on disclosures is for the period starting 
from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. We have not performed 
any procedures on any other elements included in the BRSR 
report, and therefore do not express any opinion thereon.
2.	 Boundary 
	
The reporting boundary for the BRSR disclosures includes 
Solar’s operations of 17 manufacturing locations at Chakdoh, 
Warur, Waidhan, Korba, Ramgarh, Jharsuguda, Bhilwara, 
Pallewada, Bailadila, Barbil, Talcher, Asansol, Dhanbad, 
Manendragarh, Ramagundam, Kotputli, Bagadih, and 3 offices 
including Solar House, Ramdaspeth office, and Bharat Nagar. 
An on-site verification was conducted at the Nagpur Office, 
Chakdoh plant.
3.	 Management Responsibilities
	
Solar’s management is responsible for the selection of 
the reporting criteria, reporting period, reporting boundary, 
preparation, and disclosure of BRSR information and the 
BRSR Core KPIs / metrics under the nine attributes as per 
“Annexure I – Format of BRSR Core” of the aforesaid Circular. 
This responsibility includes stakeholder engagement; design, 
implementation, and maintenance of internal control, including 
policies and processes; maintenance of adequate records; 
calculations; making estimates that are reasonable in the 
circumstances; and ensuring that they are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Moore Singhi 
was not involved in the preparation of the BRSR report, BRSR 
Core KPIs and/or related backup data. 
4.	 Moore Singhi’s responsibilities
	
Our responsibility is to provide reasonable assurance on the 
BRSR Core KPIs based on the procedures we have performed 
and the evidence we have obtained from the Company. We do 
not accept or assume any responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person or organization. We have considered 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in; (i) planning 
the scope of our work and evaluating the results of our work; 
and (ii) evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements 
in the BRSR Core. Moore Singhi expressly disclaims any liability 
or co-responsibility for any decision a person or entity would 
make based on this assurance statement and for any damages 
in case erroneous data is reported. This assurance engagement 
relies on the assumption that all data and information provided 
by Solar Industries is accurate and complete.
	
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance 
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and 
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3410: Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements, Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core, 
as well as the terms of reference for this engagement as 
agreed with Solar in the engagement letter dated September 
14, 2024.
	
Those standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in 
all material respects, the KPIs presented to us are prepared in 
accordance with the reporting criteria chosen by the Company 
as per the Circular. 
	
A reasonable assurance engagement includes performing 
procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence 
assessing the risk of material misstatement of the KPIs 
disclosed in BRSR Core. In this connection, we have performed 
the following procedures:
	
1.	
Evaluated the suitability of the quantification methods 
used for the BRSR Core KPIs.
	
2.	
Engaged in discussions with the personnel at both 
corporate and facilities responsible for the information 
presented in the report.
	
3.	
On a sample basis, verified the data collected, recorded, 
and aggregated to ensure the veracity of the reporting. 
	
4.	
Enquired with the senior management of the Company 
and obtained management representation towards all 
the stated matters of the report.

Statutory Reports
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
	
Exclusions:
 
 
Management controls, including testing internal controls 
or verifying the aggregation and calculation of data 
within the IT systems.
 
 
The Company’s statements that describe expressions 
of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or future 
intentions or any forward-looking assertions and/or data.
 
 
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance 
indicators’ included in the Report on which KPI reporting 
is based.
5.	 Inherent Limitations
	
The reliability of assurance on non-financial information is 
subject to uncertainties inherent in the assurance process. 
The lack of a significant universal body of established practice 
for measuring and evaluating non-financial information allows 
for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement 
techniques, potentially affecting comparability between 
entities. Specifically, the uncertainties in greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions estimation arise due to incomplete scientific 
knowledge, limitations in quantification models, assumptions, 
or conversion factors used to arrive at results. Due to these 
inherent limitations, there are possibilities that material 
misstatements in the sustainability information of the 
BRSR Core KPIs in the Report may remain undetected. The 
application of this assurance statement is limited to the 
aforementioned “Circular”.
6.	 Opinion
	
Based on our procedures performed and evidences obtained as 
mentioned in the section 4, information and explanations given 
and management representations provided to us, we are of the 
opinion that the BRSR Core KPIs mentioned in Annexure – 1 of 
our report, are prepared in accordance with the criteria chosen 
by the Company based on the requirements of the Circular. 
7.	 Restriction on Use 
	
Our work was performed solely to assist management in 
meeting their responsibilities in relation to Solar’s assurance 
requirements as per the Circular. The report is addressed and 
provided to the Board of Directors of the Company, solely for 
the purpose of enabling it to comply with the aforementioned 
requirements of the Circular, and should not be used, referred 
to or distributed for any other purpose or to any other party 
without our prior written consent. Accordingly, we do not 
accept or assume any liability or duty of care for any other 
purpose for which or to any other person to whom this 
assurance report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
without our prior consent in writing. 
	
Other than as described in paragraph 1, which sets out the 
scope of our engagement, we did not perform any assurance 
procedures on the remaining information. Accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion on that information.
8.	 Statement of Independence, Impartiality, and 
Competence 
	
Moore Singhi is a professional services firm offering a range 
of services in assurance and advisory to both domestic and 
international clients across industries. We have complied 
with independence and ethical requirements, which are 
founded on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 
professional competence and due care, confidentiality and 
professional behaviour. This assurance engagement comprises 
multidisciplinary experts with deep knowledge in sustainability, 
ESG reporting principles and standards, and related assurance 
standards.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders 
and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics 
or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board. 
	
The Respective business / functional heads engage with the 
stakeholders on various ESG topics and the relevant feedback 
from such consultation is provided to the Board, wherever 
applicable. They act as a link between the Board & Stakeholders 
and are responsible for seeking feedback, inputs, suggestions 
from the Board on ESG topics. The respective heads take 
initiative on prioritising our strategies, and action plans to 
address our economic, environmental, and social impacts. 
	
Materiality Assessment is one of the ways of identifying 
material issues along with ESG issues in consultation of various 
stakeholders. This is done though circulating questionnaire 
among stakeholders to assess and rank the relative importance 
of selected ESG topics. The outcome of the assessment 
is plotted on the graph so as to focus ESG initiatives and 
building out a comprehensive strategic framework. We did 
this Materiality assessment in the year 2025.
	
We have different committees which take care of matters 
related to different stakeholders including ESG topics & inform 
the board about the updates. Viz, Risk Management Committee 
(RMC), Corporate Social Responsibility Committee (CSR), etc.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the 
identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how 
the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Yes, to create long-term value, we take steps to understand 
each stakeholder group’s needs and priorities. The Materiality 
Assessment was conducted in FY 2025. In consultation with 
stakeholders, we identified the material issues. After taking 
poll, issues were prioritised & plotted on a graph. This helped 
us formulating time bound ESG targets, short term/long term 
plans and goals with a monitoring mechanism.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions 
taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups. 
	
The Company identifies the need of communities, including 
vulnerable and marginalized groups and accordingly works 
on various programs through Corporate Social Responsibility 
initiatives. The initiatives undertaken by the Company under the 
thrust areas of Corporate Social Responsibility are undertaken 
after assessing the need of the communities including the 
vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups and other members 
of the community. The Company has undertaken the initiatives 
like provision of low-cost medical facilities for such classes of 
people, Skill development program for Women, Infrastructural
