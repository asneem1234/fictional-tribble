processes 
for 
consultation 
between 
stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is 
feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
 
IFGL manufactures and supplies refractories to customers 
in both domestic and international markets. The Board of 
Directors (BOD), through its various committees, actively 
gathers feedback from both internal and external 
stakeholders. These committees engage in ongoing, 
proactive dialogue to understand stakeholder concerns 
across a range of areas, including economic and financial 
performance, 
environmental 
sustainability, 
social 
responsibility, and governance matters. This approach 
allows IFGL to remain closely attuned to the evolving 
needs and expectations of its stakeholders.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the 
identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as 
to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the 
entity.  
 
Yes, IFGL actively consults with a range of stakeholders 
including employees, suppliers, customers, service 
providers, and local communities to identify and manage 
ESG topics that are material to its business operations. 
Striking a harmonious balance between business growth, 
sustainability, and long-term value creation remains a key 
priority for IFGL. Insights gained through stakeholder 
engagement are instrumental in shaping the Company’s 
ESG policies and strategic initiatives. 
 
3 
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and 
actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.  
 
There are no vulnerable or marginalized stakeholders 
directly associated with the Company’s business 
operations. However, IFGL has undertaken a range of CSR 
initiatives through the IFGL Refractories Welfare Trust. 
These programs have been developed based on feedback 
and concerns received from key stakeholders and are 
focused on addressing critical issues and meeting the 
needs of communities surrounding its manufacturing 
facilities in India. IFGL’s CSR efforts include supporting 
schools, establishing vocational training centers for skill 
development, promoting health and hygiene awareness 
among school children, and encouraging participation in 
sports.

IFGL adheres to the principles of the 3R philosophy—Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle—
across all its manufacturing facilities in India. The Company is committed to minimizing 
the use of hazardous and toxic substances by applying a structured risk mitigation 
approach, including elimination, reduction, and substitution, evaluated on a case-by-
case basis. Through advanced manufacturing practices, IFGL ensures operational 
efficiency while actively reducing waste generation. 
Hazardous waste generated from manufacturing operations is managed in strict 
compliance with the provisions of the "Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and 
Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016." The Company secures requisite authorizations 
from regulatory authorities and follows the guidelines prescribed by the respective State 
Pollution Control Boards. Waste materials are disposed of through authorized re-
processors, facilitating the recovery and reuse of valuable resources wherever feasible. 
Additionally, IFGL conducts regular training programs for employees and workers to 
promote awareness and best practices in waste minimization and safe handling.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
2024-25 
 
IFGL continues to advance its commitment to environmental sustainability through a series of proactive 
measures designed to reduce its ecological footprint and enhance resource efficiency across its operations. 
The following key initiatives have been implemented: 
 
• 
Water Re-circulation Systems: A closed-loop water circulation framework has been introduced, 
substantially lowering the withdrawal of fresh water. Enhancements to the Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP), including the addition of new catchpits and the installation of a Sewage Treatment Plant 
(STP), further support water conservation efforts. 
• 
Air Emission Controls: High-efficiency bag filters and Retrofit Emission Control Devices (RECD) have 
been installed to effectively mitigate particulate emissions and improve overall air quality. 
• 
Reuse of Waste Wood: Discarded wooden pallets are being repurposed for packaging applications, 
promoting circularity in material use and reducing solid waste generation. 
• 
Energy Efficiency Measures: Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) have been deployed on motors and 
pumps, contributing to improved energy performance and reduced power consumption. 
• 
Integration of Renewable Energy: Solar lighting systems have been installed across various plant 
zones and administrative areas, decreasing reliance on conventional energy sources. 
 
These initiatives underscore IFGL’s dedication to sustainable industrial practices and its ongoing efforts to 
operate in an environmentally responsible manner.

Does the entity have a 
business continuity and 
disaster management 
plan? Give details in

IFGL has a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) in place, along with facility specific Emergency 
Response Plans (ERP). The BCP outlines potential scenarios that could disrupt business 
operations and includes recovery strategies. It addresses key areas such as raw material 
supply, use of natural resources, data and information security, regulatory compliance, and 
related disruptions. The ERP identifies possible emergencies, both man-made and natural, 
that could impact operations in the short or long term. It also defines the roles and 
responsibilities of on-site emergency responders, communication protocols with external 
agencies, and a high-level post-emergency action plan.
