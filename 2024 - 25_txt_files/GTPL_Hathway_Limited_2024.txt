Customer  
relationship

Opportunity
As a service provider, Customer 
Relationship 
Management 
(CRM) 
serves a critical function by providing 
deeper 
insights 
into 
customer 
behaviour, thereby contributing to 
improved customer satisfaction and 
higher retention rates.
The 
organisation 
has 
implemented a comprehensive 
complaint 
management 
system, 
supported 
by 
dedicated call centres and 
complaint centres, to ensure 
prompt resolution of customer 
issues and maintain strong, 
trust-based relationships. This 
system is designed to enhance 
responsiveness and customer 
satisfaction. 
Furthermore, 
E-support 
services 
are 
offered 
to 
ensure 
smooth 
and uninterrupted day-to-day 
operations, enabling customers 
to 
access 
assistance 
and 
information efficiently across 
multiple touchpoints.
Positive
Employee  
Training  and  
Development
Opportunity
Investing in employee training is a 
strategic approach that enhances 
workforce productivity, encourages 
innovative thinking, and contributes 
to 
overall 
job 
satisfaction—
factors 
essential 
for 
maintaining 
competitiveness. 
It 
supports 
employee retention, minimises hiring-
related expenses, and strengthens 
the organisation’s appeal to high-
calibre 
professionals. 
Moreover, 
training helps ensure adherence to 
compliance requirements, mitigates 
operational 
risks, 
and 
elevates 
service quality, resulting in improved 
customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Investing in employee training 
enhances productivity, drives 
innovation, 
and 
improves 
job satisfaction, which helps 
organisations 
maintain 
a 
competitive 
edge. 
It 
also 
contributes to higher employee 
retention, lowers recruitment 
costs, and attracts skilled talent. 
Training 
ensures 
regulatory 
compliance, minimises risks, 
and 
strengthens 
customer 
service, which in turn leads to 
greater customer satisfaction 
and loyalty. By viewing training 
as 
a 
valuable 
opportunity, 
companies foster a culture 
of continuous improvement, 
positioning 
themselves 
for 
long-term success.

Waste  
Management 
and  circular

Risk
Inadequate 
waste 
management 
can cause serious environmental 
and health issues. Not adhering 
to 
regulations 
imposed 
by 
governing bodies may result in legal 
consequences and harm the brand’s 
image.
The Company has established 
waste 
management 
procedures, ensuring the use of 
recyclable materials like copper 
cables. Additionally, all metal 
waste is properly discarded 
through authorised recyclers 
in compliance with relevant 
regulations.
Negative
Information 
Protection
Risk
The 
Company 
relies 
on 
its 
technological infrastructure to protect 
data and information. As the majority 
of data is stored and transactions are 
carried out online, this elevates the 
risk of security breaches.
The organisation has a strong 
cyber risk management system 
managed by its IT team. In 
addition, there has been an 
increased focus on educating 
employees, 
customers, 
and 
stakeholders about cybercrime, 
data privacy, and related issues.
Negative
Risk  
Management
Opportunity
We have established a comprehensive 
complaint 
management 
system 
through call centres and complaint 
centres to ensure quick response 
times and maintain strong customer 
relationships. Additionally, we treat 
risk management as a strategic 
initiative to improve resilience and 
operational efficiency. By proactively 
identifying and mitigating risks, we 
protect our assets, reputation, and 
build 
stakeholder 
trust. 
Effective 
risk 
management 
also 
uncovers 
opportunities 
for 
innovation 
and 
growth, ensuring business continuity, 
This 
approach 
helps 
minimise 
financial losses, avoid regulatory 
penalties, and enables us to navigate 
uncertainties, 
driving 
long-term 
success.
The 
Company 
recognises 
and implements the highest 
standards in risk management 
and compliance to create a 
robust, 
proactive 
approach 
for effectively mitigating and 
managing all significant risks to 
the business.

E-Waste
At GTPL, our core business revolves around providing top-notch cable TV and 
broadband services, rather than manufacturing physical products. However, we 
recognise our responsibility in managing the lifecycle of related components, 
such as set-top boxes and other essential devices. As part of our commitment to 
sustainability, we have developed innovative approaches to minimise waste and 
reduce environmental impact. 
One of our key initiatives is the promotion of set-top box reuse. Through our extensive 
network of local cable operators, we collect used set-top boxes, refurbish them, 
and reintroduce them to customers. This not only cuts down on waste but also 
enhances operational efficiency, allowing us to optimise resources while maintaining 
a commitment to sustainability. 
For products that cannot be refurbished, we ensure their responsible disposal through 
a well-established process involving certified e-waste recyclers. This procedure 
adheres strictly to government regulations for handling e-waste, battery waste, 
and hazardous materials, guaranteeing environmentally safe practices in all our 
waste management efforts. By embracing these practices, we contribute to a more 
sustainable future while offering efficient, eco-friendly solutions to our customers.
At GTPL, our primary business revolves around providing high-quality cable TV and 
broadband services, rather than producing physical products. However, as part of our 
service delivery, we rely on essential components like set-top boxes and other related 
devices. With this in mind, we take on the responsibility of managing the disposal of 
outdated, defective, or unusable products in an environmentally conscious way.

For items that cannot be refurbished, GTPL follows a thorough disposal process in 
collaboration with certified e-waste recyclers. This process complies with all relevant 
government regulations regarding the safe disposal of e-waste, battery waste, and 
hazardous materials, ensuring responsible environmental practices in every step of 
the product lifecycle. In doing so, GTPL contributes to sustainability and ensures safe,

discontinuation of service. This approach has enabled the Company to reclaim a significant portion of its equipment, facilitating

Water Conservation
Use of sensor-based taps that reduces 
the flow of water, hence the daily water 
consumption
We identify it as effective means to reduce 
waste of water

Waste Management
STBs (Set top boxes) that are not functioning 
properly are taken back from the customers 
via the LCOs and supplied to vendors where 
they are cleaned and repacked to be re-used 
by the customers
This reduces the use & dependency of virgin/ 
new STBs by the customers. This helps to 
reduce the manufacturing of new STBs and 
further reduce the generation of waste
5.	
Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
The Company relies on three essential components for business continuity: the Headend, the Wired Network across all 
operational locations, and the IT Infrastructure for its Conditional Access System (CAS) and Subscriber Management System 
(SMS). These elements are vital for the Company’s operations, necessitating a Disaster Management Plan focused on them. 
	
As part of its Business Continuity Plan, the Company has established a Disaster Recovery (DR) Site in Kolkata, strategically 
positioned away from its main facility in Ahmedabad, western India. The DR Site includes backup instances for Customer Data, 
utilising Oracle 19c database in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to ensure real-time data synchronisation with live data (T+5 
minutes). For CAS Data, key instances (NSTV & Nagra) are replicated at the DR site, covering 80% of the current base. The SMS 
Applications, crucial for operational support and billing, have a set of applications (GTPL Saathi, Edge+, MQ, Report Server, 
Workforce, etc.) replicated daily at the DR site, with a NUTONIX cluster implemented at the STT Global Data Centre in Kolkata. 
	
The Headend Compression System employs multiple compression systems across Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Mehsana, and 
Tiruchendur, with all locations interconnected via dedicated Point-to-Point links and a backup dish antenna site in Ahmedabad. 
Additionally, the Company’s ERP Data is supported by equivalent infrastructure in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and the 
Wired Network features a Ring or Redundancy Network for enhanced reliability. This Disaster Management Plan ensures that 
the Company can sustain business continuity and safeguard critical operations in the event of a disaster.
