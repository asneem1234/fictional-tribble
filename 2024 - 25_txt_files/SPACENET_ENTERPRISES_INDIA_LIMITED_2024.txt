BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 
 
FOREWORD 
 
Over the past few years, sustainability reporting is gaining importance globally as an important communication tool for 
corporates to display their commitment of being a sustainable and responsible business. The Indian reporting scenario 
is also rapidly evolving in line with the global trends wherein corporates are expected to maintain transparency and 
accountability in reporting. 
 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), regulator of capital markets in India, has put in place the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (“BRSR”) framework which requires listed companies to disclose information 
under the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct. The BRSR disclosure has become 
mandatory from FY 2022-23 onwards for the top 1,000 Indian listed companies by market capitalization. 
 
Staying strong on our commitment of being a responsible business adopting the BRSR framework from FY 2022-23 to 
maintain transparency in sustainability reporting. The BRSR disclosures presented herein are strictly as per the format 
prescribed by SEBI for the FY 2024-25

We strive to reduce waste and recycle as much as possible. Our waste primarily comprises of food, waste, paper, plastic 
and e-waste.  
 
Curbing generation of plastic waste: We have stopped procurement of plastic stationery and encourage our employees 
to use bottles made from environment friendly materials at our offices to reduce the number of plastic bottles being 
discarded after use. All our facilities use 100% biodegradable plastic garbage bags to collect and dispose off dry and wet 
waste. 
 
Reducing paper and printing consumption: We have implemented strong measures like digitizing our processes to reduce 
the need for paper. Further minimizing the usage of paper across offices is an ongoing activity. Customer accounts have 
now transitioned to digital opening. The documents required as supporting are also uploaded digitally; accounts are 
being opened without any paper consumption. Paper based Office stationeries also have now been stopped apart from 
the mandatory ones.

All such E-wastes are being disposed of through registered E-waste vendors.
