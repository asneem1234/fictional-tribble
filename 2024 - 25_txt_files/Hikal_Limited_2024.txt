pollution
R/O
Energy efficiency, carbon 
emissions, and air pollution 
pose risks and opportunities for 
our organisation. Neglecting 
these issues leads to regulatory 
pressures, fines, and reputational 
damage. However, embracing 
efficiency and reducing emissions

Sustainable practices save costs 
and improve efficiency. Prioritising 
energy efficiency and emissions 
aligns with environmental goals, 
driving growth and sustainability.
Our organisation has implemented 
effective measures to address 
energy efficiency and carbon 
emissions/air pollution risks. 
These include dust collectors, 
bed scrubbers, and flue gas 
monitoring. We recycle organic 
vapors and have a green belt and

cell for ongoing monitoring. 
These efforts demonstrate our 
commitment to environmental 
sustainability and regulatory 
compliance.

Water and 
effluent 
management/
Waste 
management
Risk
Water scarcity, pollution, and 
inadequate waste management 
pose risks to our organisation and 
the environment. Insufficient water 
availability disrupts operations, 
raises costs, and jeopardizes 
well-being. Improper waste 
handling risks environmental 
harm, health hazards, and non-
compliance. Addressing these 
risks is crucial to avoid penalties, 
reputation damage, and 
strained relationships. Effective 
management brings financial and 
environmental benefits, enhancing 
our position in the sector.
Our organisation prioritizes waste 
and water/effluent management. 
We securely store and responsibly 
dispose of discarded containers, 
hand them over to authorised 
recyclers, and ensure proper 
recycling practices. Specific 
wastes are securely stored and 
safely disposed of in authorised 
incinerators. We reprocess spent 
solvents using environmentally 
sound technology and 
government-approved recyclers. 
These measures showcase our 
commitment to responsible 
waste management, reducing 
environmental impact, and 
complying with regulatory 
requirements.

protection
Risk
We understand that business 
operations have an impact 
on biodiversity. Pollution and 
contamination worsen the

diversity and ecological balance. 
Addressing these risks is crucial 
to safeguard biodiversity and 
promote responsible practices in 
our industry.
The green belt near our chemical 
manufacturing factory acts as 
a refuge for diverse species, 
conserving biodiversity. It serves as 
a buffer zone, reducing pollution 
impacts and improving air and 
water quality. The green belt 
acts as an environmental asset, 
fostering ecological resilience and 
mitigating risks associated with 
our operations.

Risk
Occupational health and safety are 
a critical risk for our organisation. 
Neglecting a safe working 
environment leads to accidents, 
injuries, and illnesses, impacting 
employee well-being, morale, 
productivity, and absenteeism. 
Non-compliance results in legal

rights and 
community 
development
Risk/
Opportunity
Human rights violations or 
perceived violations pose a 
significant risk to our organisation, 
causing reputational damage, 
legal consequences, and loss 
of stakeholder trust. Failing to 
uphold labour rights can result in 
employee dissatisfaction, protests, 
and potential boycotts. Respecting 
human rights, complying with 
laws, and addressing grievances 
transparently are crucial. On 
the other hand, community 
development offers opportunities. 
Engaging in initiatives like 
education, skills training, and 
infrastructure development builds 
relationships, enhances reputation,

impact, leading to community 
support, market access, and long-

to ensure that the human rights 
of our internal and external 
stakeholders are secured. There

Risk
Data integrity and security are 
crucial for protecting valuable 
assets and maintaining 
stakeholder trust. Breaches or

damage, and legal liabilities. 
Data integrity issues undermine 
decision-making and operational 
efficiency. Implementing robust

Opportunity
Risk management and business 
continuity pose both risks and 
opportunities. Inadequate

engagement, we actively communicate our expectations around ESG practices and responsible business 
conduct, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability and transparency across the supply chain.

2. 
a.  Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Hikal has a formal Green Supply Chain and Sustainable Procurement Policy that outlines structured 
procedures for sustainable sourcing. The policy is applicable to all value chain partners and reflects our 
commitment to responsible business practices across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
dimensions. It includes principles such as risk-based supplier assessments, promotion of ethical conduct, 
environmental stewardship, and community engagement. We expect our suppliers to align with these 
standards and undergo periodic ESG evaluations to ensure compliance and continuous improvement 
across the supply chain.
	
b. 
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
100% of inputs from critical suppliers in India are sourced sustainably. We conduct due diligence audits 
for sustainability and EHS compliance among key raw material suppliers and share our Green Supply 
Chain Policy and supplier code of conduct to communicate expectations on sustainability and green 
supply principles.
3. 
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Given the nature of our business, scope for product reclamation for reusing, recycling, and disposal at the 
end of life is limited. However, we have implemented robust waste management system across all our 
facilities. All the categories of wastes are collected, segregated, stored, transported, and disposed of in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and best industry practices. We have detailed SOPs 
for collection, storage and disposal of various type of waste generated and we have dedicated teams to 
ensure its effective implementation.
	
Waste is segregated into recyclable and non-recyclable wastes. Recyclable waste is disposed of in an 
environmentally sound manner to authorised recyclers, and other recyclable waste is managed through 
co-processing in the cement industry, incineration, or secured landfill, based on calorific value. The packing 
material generated by raw materials and in-process material are disposed through authorised plastic 
recyclers or via Common Hazardous Waste Collection, Treatment, Storage & Disposal Facilities (CHWTSDF).
	
We have been consistently enhancing our waste management practices and have embedded them with 
our circular economy approach. In terms of process improvements, we have:
•	 Implemented solvent recovery systems to reuse organic solvents in the same process.
•	 A dedicated lab working exclusively on waste treatability studies and converting by-products into 
desired intermediates.
•	 Initiated process of reusing the plastic material used in the internal product transfer for storage and 
disposal of hazardous, reducing the overall consumption of virgin plastic products and packaging 
material in our operations.
	
Additionally, under our “Wealth from Waste” programme, each waste stream is identified and assessed for 
its environmental and economic footprint. Site-level task forces, led by Site Heads and comprising cross-
functional teams, are responsible for driving waste reduction, reuse, and recycling initiatives. These include 
enhancing the purity of by-products to increase their commercial value, converting waste into usable 
or less hazardous forms, and integrating waste characterisation early in the R&D phase to enable better 
downstream waste management.
	
The programme also promotes employee involvement through shop-floor working groups and, where 
necessary, engages external experts to support technical innovation in waste valorisation. Progress is 
reviewed monthly by the Management Committee to ensure alignment with sustainability goals.
4. 
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Hikal falls under the purview of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations as an importer. Hikal 
has sought license from relevant statutory body to comply with requirements under EPR.
Leadership Indicators
1. 
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for 
manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the 
following format?
	
No, we will be conducting the life cycle assessment of our products in FY 2025-26 
2. 
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or 
disposal of your products/services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or 
through any other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same.
	
Not applicable, as we have not conducted the life cycle assessment of our products.
3. 
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for 
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for service industry).
	
Given the nature of our pharmaceutical and specialty chemical products, we do not use recycled or reused 
input materials in the manufacturing process. However, we are recovering more than 90% of process 
solvents and reusing them in the manufacturing process of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products.
4. 
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) 
reused, recycled, and safely disposed, as per the following format:
	
We are a B2B supplier, providing our products to leading manufacturers who convert intermediates into 
final products for consumers. Therefore, the responsibility for reclaiming end-use products and packaging 
material does not apply to us. However, we provide instructions and guidelines to our customers for handling 
and disposal of our products.
	
We ensure that waste generated in our manufacturing process, raw material packaging and e-waste, is sent 
to authorised recyclers wherever possible in accordance with the statutory requirements.

Permanent workers
Yes
A well-defined grievance redressal mechanism is in place to ensure that concerns 
and complaints are addressed in a structured and timely manner. The grievance 
redressal policy clearly outlines the procedures, responsibilities, and timelines 
for resolution. It is applicable to all employees and workers, including third-party 
personnel deployed at company premises. Individuals are encouraged to report 
any unethical conduct, with the assurance of protection under the non-retaliation 
principle outlined in the Code of Conduct. All grievances and their resolutions are 
documented in accordance with the policy.
Additionally, at unionised manufacturing facilities, a Works Committee has been 
constituted to address matters related to working conditions and employee welfare. 
This committee meets periodically to discuss relevant issues, with each meeting 
resulting in documented action points and clearly defined roles and responsibilities 
for follow-up.

Hazard Identification and Risk assessment (HIRA) process is implemented for both routine and non-
routine activities, while Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies are conducted for process related risks 
at all our facilities. Additionally, we developed a guidance document where all identified hazards and 
risks associated with our operations are outlined to standardise implementation of safety measures. 
Permit to work (PTW), process hazard analysis (PHA), and job safety analysis (JSA) assessments are also 
regularly carried out.
	
	
At all our facilities, we have a dedicated EHS team to identify, assess and mitigate risks, monitor the 
implementation of safety measures, conduct a weekly safety inspection, and provide regular training 
on safety-aspects to employees and workers. There are periodic internal and external audits conducted 
to assess the effectiveness of occupational health and safety processes implemented at our facilities.

the MY SETU software platform (available at all sites), employees can digitally at all the any work-related 
hazards/risks such as near misses, unsafe conditions, injuries, and other serious incidents. Each report/
incident is followed by a detailed root cause analysis, development and implementation of corrective 
action plans, and monitoring of the effectiveness of safety measures. All the reported issues can be 
tracked by employees online till its closure using their individual login credentials.
	
	
In addition, daily safety briefing sessions/toolbox talks are conducted at all sites. These sessions 
encourage active participation from workers to share suggestions for strengthening the safety 
measures at the sites and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and shared responsibility.
 
d.

Crop Protection Business
	
The following energy saving initiatives have been implemented at Taloja, Mahad and Panoli site of 
Crop Business:
•	 To maintain the power factor, the HT capacitor capacity was enhanced from 450 KVAR to 600 KVAR, 
resulting in more efficient power usage, reduced energy costs, improved voltage stability, and increased 
electrical infrastructure capability. – Taloja
•	 Reducing the transformer voltage from 415 V to 405 V enhanced safety, promoted energy conservation, 
and improved power quality. – Taloja
•	 We invested in a turbine for cogeneration of electricity from our briquette-fed boiler using high-pressure 
steam. This has strengthened our in-house clean energy generation. Previously, this operation was 
managed by an external agency on a contract basis. – Taloja
•	 We replaced our old pump (P-525) with a high-efficiency pump to reduce power consumption in the 
utilities section. – Taloja
•	 We automated our streetlights to reduce power usage. Manual switching was causing excess consumption 
due to early or delayed switching. – Taloja
•	 We provided a cooling water supply line to the pilot plants, eliminating the need for a separate cooling 
tower. This resulted in power savings by stopping Pump P-2910 of the pilot plant cooling tower. – Taloja
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25

•	 A flash jet pump was installed in the MEE section to recover flash steam and route it to the boiler feedwater 
tank, improving the steam-to-fuel ratio (SFR) of both the briquette and LSHS boilers. – Mahad
•	 We began recycling flash steam from the condensate tank of the MPP-1 melter, reducing energy loss in 
the system. – Panoli
•	 We started utilising flash steam from the condensate tank for hot water generation in MPP-1 LLE, 
reducing energy loss from steam condensate. – Panoli
•	 We eliminated the soft water transfer pump by directly feeding makeup water into the 40 KL boiler soft 
water storage tank, resulting in the shutdown of one pump and energy conservation. – Panoli
 
Pharmaceuticals Business
	
The following energy saving initiatives have been implemented at Panoli and Jigani site of Pharma Business:
•	 Energy conservation measures were implemented to improve the boiler’s Steam-to-Fuel Ratio (SFR). 
The SFR was enhanced from 3.85 to 3.95, resulting in a fuel saving of 697 MT. Additionally, improved 
cogeneration boiler efficiency reduced the operating hours of the LSHS boiler, saving 292.39 MT of 
furnace oil (FO). – Jigani 1
•	 Motion sensors were installed in office areas to automatically switch off lights when the space is 
unoccupied. – Jigani 2
•	 Retrofit lighting was carried out in flameproof process areas, converting CFL lighting to energy-efficient 
LED lighting. – Jigani 2
•	 Power consumption was reduced by replacing the MS-FRP impeller with a new PP-FRP impeller for 
VUE-5001 (39,000 CFM). – Jigani 2
	
Hikal has continued its journey toward adopting clean fuel and energy across its operations at the Mahad, 
Taloja, and Panoli plants. The use of solar and wind power has been implemented at the Mahad, Taloja, 
Jigani Unit 1 and Panoli sites.
	
Significant cost savings have been achieved through the adoption of alternative energy sources at our 
Mahad, Taloja, Panoli, and Jigani locations.
	
Total cost saved is as follows.
•	 Panoli – INR 27.03 million
•	 Taloja – INR 53.5 million
•	 Mahad – INR 23.80 million
•	 Jigani 1 – INR 29.65 million

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
As a pharmaceutical and specialty chemical manufacturing company, responsible waste management 
remains a top priority. Our practices are continuously evolving and are closely aligned with our 
circular economy approach. We follow the 3R principle—Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle—and have 
established standard operating procedures for the handling of hazardous, non-hazardous, e-waste, and 
biomedical waste.
	
Each facility has dedicated teams to ensure proper waste segregation at source, along with safe handling, 
storage, and disposal in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and recognised industry 
practices. Hazardous waste generated from operations is managed in an environmentally responsible 
manner through authorised recyclers, the cement industry, and Common Hazardous Waste Treatment, 
Storage & Disposal Facilities (CHWTSDF). Similarly, 100% of e-waste is routed through authorised vendors, 
and plastic waste is recycled via authorised recyclers.
	
The other non-hazardous waste such as scrap metal, wood waste, glass, cardboard, paper, etc. was disposed 
of via recyclers.
	
In terms of process improvements, we are using recovered solvents in the process to reduce fresh solvent 
consumption. We have a dedicated lab working exclusively on waste treatability studies and have converted 
by-products into desired intermediates by using a simple process, which in turn reduced the hazardous 
organic waste to a great extent. Also, we are enhancing our effluent treatment plants to enhance wastewater/
effluent recycling capabilities.
	
Regular inspections are conducted to assess waste handling infrastructure, with improvements 
implemented to enhance efficiency and environmental performance. Additionally, the “Wealth from 
Waste” programme has been introduced to identify opportunities for recycling, reduction, and reuse of 
waste materials.

Note: In the FY 2024-25, there is a 38% increase in total scope 3 emissions as compared to previous financial year, i.e., 
FY 2023-24. This rise is primarily attributable to Scope 3 Category 1 – Purchased Goods and Services. This year, we have 
followed a more granular approach for calculating emissions associated with the raw materials procured.
	
However, when comparing emissions for the current and previous reporting years using a consistent 
calculation methodology for Purchased Goods and Services (PG&S), there is a 14% reduction in overall 
Scope 3 emissions.
	
Moving forward, Hikal will designate FY 2025 as the baseline year for monitoring progress against the 
emissions reduction targets established under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) framework.

Our Jigani Unit, located near the Bannerghatta National Park, is the only facility situated close to an 
ecologically sensitive zone. Recognizing the ecological significance of this area, we have undertaken 
targeted initiatives to preserve and enhance local biodiversity.
	
As part of our efforts to conserve the ecology and environment, we undertook the cleaning of Konasandra 
Lake and Yallammanadoddi Lake in 2025. This involved removing unwanted vegetation and planting 
approximately 250 saplings, contributing to the restoration of water bodies and surrounding green cover.
	
In addition, in May 2024, we developed a Miyawaki forest near Harapanahalli Temple, Jigani, in collaboration 
with M/s Twin Glacier Foundation. This initiative included the plantation of 4,000 trees, 1,000 shrub saplings, 
and 350 bamboo grasses, significantly enhancing biodiversity and supporting the regeneration of native 
flora and fauna in the region.
	
These initiatives reflect our commitment to minimising indirect ecological impacts and actively 
contributing to biodiversity conservation in and around ecologically sensitive areas.
