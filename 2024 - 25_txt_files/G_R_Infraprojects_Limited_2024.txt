(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies 
disclosing information about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. 
It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a 
company's non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming 
to promote transparency and accountability.)

gives 
rise 
to 
various 
health 
hazards, 
particularly 
impacting 
on-
site employees and workers. 
These individuals are exposed 
to potential physical injuries 
due to the dynamic and 
challenging nature of their 
work. They are also exposed 
to 
risks 
associated 
with 
handling hazardous materials 
intrinsic to construction and 
manufacturing processes.

compliance, 
potential 
carbon 
taxes 
and physical risk such as 
disruption on construction site 
due to flash floods and water 
scarcity due to uneven rainfalls
Adopting 
sustainable 
practices 
and reducing emissions enhances 
the organization's reputation and 
demonstrates a commitment to 
positive 
environmental 
impact. 
Ongoing initiatives, such as Green 
Construction practices, solar power 
utilization and the use of electric 
vehicles, underscore the company's

infrastructure constructed by 
the company. This increases 
the risk of public and worker 
injuries and may result in law 
suits, fines / penalties and 
reputational damage.
To mitigate the risk of not adhering 
to construction quality and safety 
standards, The Company enforce 
stringent quality control measures, 
implement robust safety protocols, 
and invest in high-quality materials 
and technologies. Regular audits,

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets, and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
FY 2024–25 marked a year of focused transformation for G R Infraprojects Limited, aligned with our theme: “Reimagining Growth, 
Redefining Possibilities.” Operating across 79 project sites in 23 states, we continued to deliver critical infrastructure solutions 
including roads, railways, metros, tunnels, power transmission, ropeways, and multimodal logistics parks while reinforcing our 
commitment to sustainability, inclusiveness, and governance excellence at every level of our operations.
This year, we made significant strides in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance. Our approach has been holistic 
balancing operational efficiency with environmental responsibility, prioritizing employee well-being and community engagement, 
and strengthening internal governance to drive long-term value creation. ESG monitoring mechanisms were reinforced internally, 
and stakeholder engagement was elevated through greater transparency and alignment with long-term objectives. These efforts 
were guided by our Board-level ESG Committee and Working Group, ensuring cross-functional alignment and accountability.
On the environmental front, we achieved notable reductions in our carbon and energy footprint. Operational enhancements led 
to a measurable decline in Scope 1 emissions, while phased electrification and adoption of cleaner fuel technologies boosted 
energy efficiency across tunneling and power transmission projects. Water conservation and waste management protocols, such 
as rainwater harvesting and enhanced segregation practices were scaled up. A key milestone was the commissioning of our Glass 
Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) facility, which supports material innovation and emission reduction across project lifecycles.
Socially, we remained focused on creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for our workforce. Safety and 
Environment training was further intensified, especially for high-risk functions like tunneling and overhead transmission. Our 
project site camps continued to uphold high standards of welfare, offering hygienic living spaces, nutritious meals, accessible 
healthcare, and routine health screenings backed by long-standing partnerships with local healthcare providers. These efforts 
reflect our deep-rooted commitment to dignity, care, and a safe working environment.
At GRIL, good governance and transparency are deeply embedded in our way of doing business. We remain steadfast in upholding 
the highest standards of ethics, accountability and fairness in all our engagement with stakeholders.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to delivering infrastructure that is not only technically sound but also environmentally 
responsible, socially inclusive, and governed with integrity. This report is both a reflection of our progress and our resolve to 
continue shaping a future that is sustainable, scalable and stakeholder driven.
Thank you.

*The Company has included asphalt waste in the waste calculation for FY 2024-25. The same has been recycled and reused in new construction. 
**Food waste figures for FY 2023–24 have been revised due to data reconciliation following internal software migration. The updated figures reflect more 
accurate and standardized reporting enabled by the new system. As a result, total waste figures, waste intensity metrics, and other consolidated waste-related 
data have also been updated.
10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
As a construction company operating across diverse sites in India, we have adopted systematic waste management practices 
to minimize environmental impact and ensure regulatory compliance. Our waste management approach includes segregation of 
waste at source into categories such as inert construction debris, recyclables (metal, wood, plastic), and hazardous waste. Non-
hazardous construction and demolition (C&D) waste is either reused on-site (e.g., backfilling, road base) or responsibly disposed of 
through authorized vendors. We also promote the reuse and recycling of materials such as concrete, asphalt, and steel wherever 
feasible.
	
To reduce the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our processes, we actively seek safer alternatives and environmentally 
friendly construction materials. The use of low-VOC paints, non-toxic curing compounds, and eco-labelled products is encouraged 
across projects. For activities involving hazardous substancessuch as waterproofing, fuel storage, or equipment maintenance,we 
ensure proper handling, storage, and disposal in compliance with the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and 
Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. All hazardous waste is stored in secure containment zones and disposed of through 
authorized treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs).
	
Training is regularly provided to site personnel on safe handling and emergency response, and our Environment, Health and Safety 
(EHS) teams monitor waste and chemical management practices through audits and inspections.

The company follows a comprehensive approach to promote safety and responsible usage across its diverse infrastructure
projects, including highways, bridges, metro systems, tunneling, power transmission & distribution (PT&D) networks, and O&M
services. For road infrastructure, a three-tier signage systemcomprising warning, cautionary, and informative signsis installed to
guide and alert users effectively. Tactile markers are used to assist navigation, especially for visually impaired users, and reflective 
paints ensure visibility of road markings and signage during low-light conditions. Barricades and safety barriers are strategically
deployed in both active construction and O&M zones to safeguard workers and commuters.
In metro and tunneling projects, safety communication includes clear wayfinding signage, emergency exit indicators, and public
announcements to guide passengers and site workers. For PT&D projects, the company places safety boards and hazard markers 
near high-voltage equipment and conducts awareness drives for nearby communities regarding electrical safety. Across all
verticals, user awareness and safety education are embedded through signage, physical infrastructure, and operational protocols, 
ensuring end-users, contractors, and communities are well-informed and protected.
