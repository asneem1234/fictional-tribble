Business Responsibility & 
Sustainability Report
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information 
about their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to 
provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a Company's non-financial impacts and contributions 
to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and 
governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

2.
Emissions 
and 
Pollutants
R
Chemical production produces direct 
(Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from fossil fuel burning 
in manufacturing and cogeneration 
processes 
and 
process 
emissions 
from feedstock trans-formation. In 
addition to greenhouse gases (GHGs). 
Chemical manufacturing may also 
emit air emissions such as sulphur 
dioxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
and hazardous air pollutants during 
manufacturing. For chemical firms, 
emissions might result in operating 
risks, fines, or expenditures associated 
with regulatory compliance.
We recognize the importance of 
reducing our carbon footprint 
and taking our environmental 
responsibilities 
seriously. 
Our 
organization 
is 
committed 
to 
adopting sustainable practices 
and 
continuously 
works 
to 
lower 
energy 
consumption 
by 
leveraging 
innovative 
technologies. 
Additionally, 
we 
are actively exploring renewable 
energy sources to reduce our 
reliance 
on 
non-renewable 
options. As part of our clean 
energy initiative, 18.34 MW wind-
solar hybrid project has been 
set-up. We are also adopting 
advanced technologies such as 
ECH-Glycerol, which require less 
energy and water while producing 
minimal waste.
Negative
3.
Circular 
Economy
0
The 
Circular 
Economy 
model 
of 
production 
and 
consumption 
emphasizes 
and 
promotes 
the 
reuse, refurbishment, and recycling 
of materials and products already 
in existence. Transition to circular 
economy can reduce the material 
consumption during the production.
Positive
4.
Water 
Management
R
Water is a critical input in chemical 
production. Companies with water 
intensive operations face a greater 
risk of operational disruption due to 
water scarcity, which can also increase 
water procurement prices and capital 
expenditures. 
Similarly, 
chemical 
manufacturing 
generates 
process 
wastewater that must be treated 
before disposal. Non-compliance with 
water quality regulations may result in 
regulatory compliance and mitigation 
costs.
As 
a 
responsible 
chemical 
manufacturer, we place strong 
emphasis on managing our water 
usage effectively. By leveraging 
advanced wastewater treatment 
technologies, 
we 
significantly 
reduce 
our 
environmental 
footprint through lower water 
and energy consumption. Our 
efforts 
go 
beyond 
treatment, 
incorporating 
various 
water 
conservation 
measures. 
For 
example, rinse water from specific 
units is treated and reused in 
cooling towers, while a condensate 
recovery system captures water 
for boiler makeup. Additionally, 
our 
sewage 
treatment 
plants 
supply 
water 
for 
irrigation, 
reducing our dependence on 
freshwater for landscaping. These 
actions reflect our dedication to 
sustainable water management.

Handling 
Hazardous 
Chemicals
R
Chemical company is responsible 
for managing all risks related to the 
storage and handling of hazardous 
chemicals. The improper handling of 
chemicals and spills can cause harm to 
the environment or humans and also 
imposes a heavy fine and reputational 
risk on the company.
The company prioritizes the safe 
and responsible management of 
hazardous materials to protect 
the environment, employees, and 
nearby communities. To maintain 
high health and safety standards, 
regular internal and external audits 
are 
conducted. 
Environmental 
and social aspects related to our 
products are transparently shared 
with 
customers. 
Furthermore, 
the company strictly follows all 
hazardous waste management 
regulations 
to 
ensure 
proper 
disposal 
and 
reduce 
environmental impact.
Negative
6.
Waste 
Management
R
Typically, waste is generated as part of 
a company’s operations, captive power 
plant, maintenance of machinery and 
office administrative work. Improper 
waste handling may contribute to air 
pollution, climate change, and various 
direct and indirect impacts on the 
ecosystem. It may also cause health 
and safety risks to personnel exposed 
to waste. Non-compliance with waste 
management regulations may lead to 
the imposing of heavy fines.
The company has introduced 
various 
new 
technologies 
to 
replace 
outdated 
processes, 
leading to a reduction in waste 
production. This strategic shift 
has not only reduced the use 
of natural resources but also 
minimized 
waste 
generation 
and the reliance on landfills 
for disposal. Furthermore, the 
company has taken a proactive 
approach 
by 
registering 
for 
Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR), underscoring its dedication 
to managing the plastic waste 
from its products and packaging.
Negative
7.
Community 
Relation and 
Engagement
O
Chemical 
firms 
are 
significant 
economic 
contributors, 
offering 
employment 
opportunities 
and 
fostering community development 
through taxes and capital generation. 
Environmental 
policy, 
community 
health, 
and 
process 
safety 
have 
significant 
regulatory, 
operational, 
financial, 
and 
reputational 
ramifications for companies. Building 
strong relationships with communities 
can 
help 
chemicals 
companies 
mitigate 
potential 
operational 
disruption, reduce regulatory risk, 
retain top employees, lower the risk 
of litigation expenses in the event of 
process safety incidents, 
and ensure a strong social license 
to operate. Process safety incidents 
jeopardies 
community 
health 
and safety, resulting in regulatory 
penalties, legal action, and mitigating 
expenses.

Product 
Innovation
R
The 
chemical 
industry 
has 
the 
potential to impact human health 
and the environment. So, the industry 
can reduce regulatory risk and grow 
its market share by coming up with 
innovative approaches to manage 
the potential impact of the product 
by developing an alternate product or 
reducing toxicity.
To maintain our leadership in the 
chemical industry, our company 
is committed to driving product 
innovation. We’re not only focused 
on developing new products but 
also on enhancing our processes 
to ensure sustainable production. 
As part of this effort, we have 
established 
an 
R&D 
Center 
dedicated to improving process 
and entering in new products.

Diversity 
and Equal 
Opportunity
R
A 
company’s 
high 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
rate 
reflect 
employees’ 
sense of belonging and fairness within 
the company. Improving diversity 
and inclusion helps companies to 
support vulnerable groups resulting in 
community brand image creation for 
the company.
We focus on creating a diverse 
and 
inclusive 
workplace 
to 
enhance 
productivity 
and 
creativity among our employees. 
Our dedication to being an equal 
opportunity employer is evident 
in our policies, which cover all 
aspects of employment, including 
recruitment, hiring, promotions, 
transfers, compensation, benefits, 
and termination.
Negative
10.
Product 
Safety & 
Quality
R
Product safety and quality is a critical 
issue for companies in the chemicals 
industry. Chemicals’ potential to have 
negative effects on human health 
or the environment throughout the 
usage phase can affect consumer 
demand for the product and regulatory 
risk, which can then damage sales 
and lead to higher operational costs, 
regulatory 
compliance 
costs, 
and 
mitigation.
To ensure the safety of our products, 
we 
incorporate 
environmental 
and social parameters relevant to 
the product, such as guidelines 
for safe and responsible usage, 
recycling instructions, and safe 
disposal details on the packaging. 
Our 
facility 
is 
also 
equipped 
with quality control laboratories 
to 
maintain 
product 
quality. 
We have invested in various 
standard operating procedures 
and certifications, including ISO 
9001 and ISO 14001, which 
demonstrate our commitment 
to Quality Management Systems, 
Good Manufacturing Practices, 
and 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedures. These efforts enhance 
the company’s alignment with 
industry 
standards 
and 
best 
practices.
Negative

Compliance 
and Business 
Ethics
R
The key issues relevant to business 
ethics and management of business 
ethics issues such as fraud, executive 
misconduct, 
corrupt 
practices, 
money 
laundering, 
or 
anti-trust 
violations. Ethics violations can lead 
to police investigations, hefty fines, 
settlement costs, and damage to 
reputation.
Our objective is to implement 
risk mitigation in a structured 
manner across different risk 
categories within a strong risk 
management framework. This 
includes 
policy 
development, 
procedural 
guidelines, 
and 
thorough assessment methods. 
This 
strategic 
approach 
has 
greatly 
improved 
process

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
At Epigral, we recognize that ESG is no longer an optional commitment—it is an essential responsibility and a strategic 
imperative. As the Director responsible for our Business Responsibility Report, I am pleased to share the progress we’ve 
made in integrating ESG principles into our operations, as well as the challenges we continue to address.
Over the past year, we have taken deliberate steps to strengthen our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) systems. 
We implemented enhanced reporting templates to improve the accuracy of our EHS data, enabling more informed 
decision-making and better compliance oversight. We also prioritized workforce well-being through ergonomic and 
health programs, including regular medical screenings and psychological safety initiatives. A Safety Perception Survey 
was launched to capture employee feedback and shape future safety interventions. These initiatives not only improved 
employee engagement but also contributed to measurable gains in productivity and reduction in incident rates.
Our commitment to safety and innovation has been acknowledged through prestigious industry recognitions, including 
the Special Jury Commendation Award in the HSE Innovation Category (Pro MFG Media) and the FAME National Award 
2024 (Platinum) for Occupational Health & Safety. Looking ahead, Epigral remains focused on expanding green cover, 
reducing specific energy and water consumption, adopting advanced digital safety systems, and continuously upskilling 
our workforce. We are unwavering in our goal of achieving a zero-incident workplace and aligning our performance 
with global sustainability benchmarks.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts continued to reflect our deep commitment to inclusive development 
and community well-being. During the year, we advanced key initiatives focused on education, skill development, 
and support for vulnerable groups. Land was secured for a future Education and Skill Development Centre, aimed

If Yes, provide details in brief
At Epigral, we uphold a strict zero-tolerance policy toward corruption in all areas of our operations. Corruption—
particularly in the form of bribery—is defined as offering or giving anything of value, such as money, gifts, meals, 
travel, or entertainment, with the intent to gain an unfair advantage. We firmly prohibit both the offering and 
acceptance of bribes, whether involving public officials or private individuals.
The anti-bribery policy applies not only to our employees but also to all third parties representing us, including 
suppliers, subcontractors, and other business partners. The same ethical standards apply uniformly across all our 
business relationships. If the Company is restricted from engaging in a certain activity, those same restrictions 
extend to our partners and representatives.
Our strong stance against bribery and corruption reflects our unwavering commitment to maintaining the highest 
standards of ethics and integrity in every aspect of our business operations.

10. Health and safety management system
a. 	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented 
by the entity? (Yes/ No)
Yes
If Yes, the Coverage such systems?
The company prioritizes the safety and well-being of its employees as a core aspect of its operations. This 
dedication is evident through the implementation of a strong Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System (OHSMS), which is fully integrated into all business processes.
Our OHSMS goes beyond basic compliance, utilizing a comprehensive framework built on industry best 
practices, including standards such as ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 
for environmental management. It also incorporates elements of process safety and responsible care 
management systems.
This all-encompassing approach ensures that safety remains a key focus throughout the entire supply chain, 
involving every department and technical system. The company also promotes a strong safety culture through 
a range of proactive initiatives.
The company keeps safety at the forefront of employees’ minds through engaging awareness campaigns. 
Extensive safety and health training provides employees with the knowledge and skills needed for safe work 
practices. Regular safety meetings create an open forum for discussing and addressing safety concerns. 
Safety competitions foster healthy competition and reinforce important safety principles. Inter-plant training 
encourages the exchange of knowledge and best practices across different locations, enhancing the company’s 
overall safety culture. Additionally, employees are encouraged to report near misses, unsafe behaviors, and 
hazardous conditions, allowing for the early identification and prevention of potential risks.
Clear and visible health and safety signs are displayed at all company sites as a constant reminder of safety 
protocols, ensuring that procedures are consistently followed. These efforts highlight the company’s strong 
commitment to creating a workplace where safety is not only a priority but a fundamental value embedded in 
every part of its operations.
b. 	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
Ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees remains a core priority at Epigral. We adopt a proactive, 
systematic approach to identifying and mitigating workplace hazards and risks. Our safety framework 
integrates multiple best-in-class processes, complemented by strong employee engagement and awareness-
building initiatives. HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Analysis) is regularly conducted at plant sites, involving 
both internal teams and external experts. This rigorous evaluation identifies operational risks and drives 
strategic mitigation measures. Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is carried out for specific work procedures, ensuring 
employees receive task-specific safety training. By equipping individuals with the knowledge to recognize and 
manage risks, we continue to strengthen our organizational safety culture.
In line with our commitment to inclusive and practical safety design, we actively captured worker inputs while 
designing safety procedures, ensuring relevance and effectiveness at the ground level. We also conducted 
monthly thematic safety campaigns, helping to raise awareness and reduce site-level hazards through 
continuous learning and communication.
STATUTORY REPORT
109
For new facilities, we implement Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) to ensure that all critical safety measures are 
in place prior to commissioning. This thorough pre-operational review helps prevent issues before operations 
begin, significantly reducing start-up risks.
Additionally, our Permit to Work (PTW) Management System ensures no task begins without prior safety 
clearance. This protocol guarantees that all precautions and protective measures are confirmed before any 
work is undertaken.
Together, these layered safety systems—combined with active employee participation and continuous 
improvement—form the backbone of our EHS strategy. By embedding a culture of safety, we are not only 
reducing risk but also fostering a healthy, empowered, and resilient workforce.
c. 	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to 
remove themselves from such risks? (Yes/ No)
Yes
Epigral Ltd. places a strong emphasis on employee safety through a comprehensive and well-structured safety 
program. Employees at all sites are encouraged and empowered to report potential hazards using multiple 
reporting channels. Regular audits and inspections are conducted to proactively identify risks. At Epigral, 
employee safety is a core value supported by a structured, multi-layered safety management system. All 
employees are encouraged to report potential hazards through various channels, with a new incentive-backed 
hazard reporting system introduced to promote early risk identification.
To strengthen employee engagement, regular Safety Perception Surveys are conducted to gather insights 
and inform safety improvements. Additionally, monthly thematic safety campaigns are organized to raise 
awareness on specific safety topics and reinforce safe behaviours across all sites.
Standardized processes such as Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) 
guide routine operations and maintenance activities. These are supported by regular training and reviews of 
past incidents to continuously enhance procedures and practices.
Regular audits, inspections, and structured reviews of lessons learned from past incidents help drive continuous 
improvement. This integrated safety framework not only reduces risk but also cultivates a safe, secure, and 
health-focused work environment for all employees. Through active employee participation, structured 
protocols, and a culture of continuous learning, the Company reinforces its vision of achieving operational 
excellence with zero harm.
To manage routine and maintenance-related tasks, the company employs standardized methodologies such 
as Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and Job Safety Analysis (JSA), supported by periodic 
training sessions. Lessons learned from past incidents are systematically reviewed to improve procedures and 
enhance safety practices.
For chemical operations, Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies are carried out to identify and mitigate 
potential risks. Additionally, all new facilities undergo a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) to ensure safety 
measures are in place before operations begin.
This multi-tiered safety framework ensures a secure and healthy working environment for all employees.

Leadership Indicators
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on 
economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is 
feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
To ensure effective consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics, the company has established a clear and structured process. The company actively gathers 
ESG-related input from stakeholders during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and other relevant forums, 
where stakeholders can voice their concerns and provide feedback. Additionally, regular quarterly meetings 
are held where the Board reviews various environmental and social topics, ensuring ongoing dialogue and 
alignment with the company’s sustainability goals.
Furthermore, the company conducts a materiality assessment, during which feedback from internal 
stakeholders is incorporated into decision-making processes. This ensures that relevant ESG concerns are 
prioritized. Management gathers this feedback and communicates it to the appropriate Board committees 
or, where necessary, directly to the Board. This collaborative process allows the Board to stay informed about 
stakeholder perspectives and to formulate appropriate action plans to address key concerns, aligning with 
the company’s ESG objectives and overall corporate responsibility.
This approach ensures the Board receives timely and comprehensive feedback, allowing for informed 
decision-making on economic, environmental, and social topics.

2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and 
management of environmental, and social topics (Yes/No).
Yes
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
In collaboration with internal stakeholders, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation to identify and prioritize 
the most significant Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues relevant to our business. Based on 
these findings, we have launched targeted initiatives to effectively address the identified priority areas.
Additionally, we maintain continuous engagement with our suppliers to ensure alignment with our ESG 
goals. Inputs received through these interactions—such as the need for Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) 
assessments and supplier audits—have been incorporated into our practices. These efforts reflect our 
commitment to responsible sourcing and fostering sustainability throughout our value chain.
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the 
concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.
As part of our commitment to supporting marginalized communities, we engaged with Janaki Ashram 
in Devpada to better understand the challenges faced by tribal students in remote areas. Based on these 
discussions, and recognizing the transportation barriers that hinder access to education, we distributed 
30 bicycles to tribal girl students. This initiative aims to facilitate easier and safer travel to school, thereby 
promoting continued education and empowerment for these young learners.
Similarly, through our CSR initiatives, we actively connect with various vulnerable and marginalized groups 
to understand their needs and provide meaningful support.

A major milestone in this effort is the establishment of a Joint Venture Agreement for a wind-solar hybrid 
project, with a combined capacity of 18.34 MW. This initiative contributes significantly to reducing de-
pendency on fossil fuels by generating clean, renewable electricity and mitigating the company’s overall 
carbon footprint.
In alignment with sustainable production practices, the company utilizes glycerin — a 100% renewable 
raw material—within its manufacturing processes. This strategic choice not only decreases reliance on non-
renewable resources but also supports a circular economy approach.
The company also places emphasis on carbon sequestration through its Green Belt Development Pro-gram, 
under which approximately 31,000 trees have been planted. This initiative contributes to im-proved air 
quality and reinforces efforts to combat climate change.
To further enhance environmental sustainability, the company continually invests in technological 
advancements and process optimization aimed at minimizing waste and increasing efficiency. Key exam-
ples include:
	
MSRU Technology: This innovation significantly reduces sludge generation in Caustic Soda production, 
thereby lowering the environmental burden.
	
	Sulphate Removal System: Optimizes brine purification processes, resulting in decreased waste output.
	
	ECH Glycerol Process: Replacing the conventional propylene route, this method substantially re-duces 
energy consumption and GHG emissions.
	
	Zero Gap Membrane Installation: Introduced as a sustainable solution in Caustic Soda manufac-turing, 
this process enhances energy efficiency and environmental performance.
The Comapny remains committed to continuous improvement and innovation in environmental stewardship. 
The organization acknowledges the critical importance of minimizing its carbon emissions and continues to 
pursue forward-looking strategies that align with its sustainability objectives.

Sustainability Report
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemi-cals 
in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Epigral is committed to responsible waste management across its manufacturing operations, ensuring 
both hazardous and non-hazardous waste is handled in a safe and environmentally compliant manner. The 
company adopts a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to ensure the proper collection, transportation, 
and disposal of waste in line with applicable environmental regulations.
All waste materials are transported to an authorized Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF). To 
ensure transparency and regulatory compliance, waste manifests are generated and uploaded on the Gu-
jarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) online portal. Epigral Ltd. also maintains detailed records of all waste 
disposal activities to uphold accountability and traceability.
Waste minimization remains a central component of the company’s broader sustainability strategy. To this 
end, the Company has implemented Best Available Technologies (BAT), including the adoption of a zero 
gap membrane system and a high carbon ash recycling process. These advanced systems contribute to 
enhanced operational efficiency while significantly reducing waste generation.
In addition, process optimization has played a pivotal role in reducing the company's environmental 
footprint. For instance, the company transitioned from using barium carbonate to alternative methods for 
brine purification in Caustic Soda lye production. This strategic change not only reduced the reliance on 
a natural resource but also minimized the volume of waste generated and eliminated the need for open 
land disposal.
Further, the introduction of MSRU technology led to a significant decrease in sludge generation—from 
62 Kg/MT to 23 Kg/MT of Caustic Soda—while also phasing out the use of barium carbonate, contributing 
to both operational sustainability and environmental preservation.
Through the implementation of these robust waste management systems and continual investment in 
innovative, sustainable technologies, the Company reinforces its long-term commitment to environmental 
stewardship and sustainable development.

reasons, it will be formally recorded only after a mutual agreement is reached between the heads of the 
Marketing and Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) departments.
	
	Step 3: The QA/QC department maintains a digital “Complaints Register” in which all validated complaints 
are systematically documented.

	Step 4: Each complaint is assigned a unique serial number based on the calendar year to facilitate 
efficient tracking and management.
