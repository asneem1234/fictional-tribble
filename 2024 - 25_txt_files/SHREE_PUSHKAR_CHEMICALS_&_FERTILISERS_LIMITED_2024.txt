Responsible 
supply chain 
management
Risk
Risk: Strong dependency 
on the supply chain for the 
entire product life cycle 
poses a requirement of a 
strong contingency plan to 
deal with unprecedented 
situations 
which 
may 
lead to disruption in the 
supply 
chain. 
Further, 
the 
Company 
extends 
its responsible business 
principles 
across 
the 
value chain, expecting its 
suppliers to adhere with the 
required principles. Non- 
adherence of the principles 
from the supplier end may 
affect 
the 
Company’s 
partnership 
with 
them, 
further 
impacting 
the 
business continuity plan.
1. 
Establish 
a 
robust 
a s s e s s m e n t 
mechanism to assess 
the 
implication 
of 
 
unprecedented 
disruption on the supply 
chain 
and 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
contingency 
plan 
to 
avoid major impact on 
the business.
2.	 Undertake a supplier 
assessment	 i
n 
alignment 
with 
the 
standard practices and 
requirements as per 
the guidance outlined 
by 
sector 
specific 
responsible 
supply 
chain initiatives.
Positive: 
Responsible 
supply 
chain 
practices 
enables the Company to 
have a strong mechanism 
to 
deal 
with 
supply 
chain disruptions due to 
unprecedented situations, 
moreover the compliance 
with 
the 
Company’s 
responsible 
business 
practices and principles, 
amplify 
the 
Company’s 
social and environment 
performance across the 
supply chain.
Negative: Non-compliance 
of the vital requirements 
from responsible business 
perspective 
such 
as 
human rights may affect 
the Company’s business 
partnerships in a long 
run. Further, it may lead 
to adverse impact on the 
brand image from the 
perspective of association 
with 
a 
non-compliant 
supplier in the long run.

products and 
technologies
