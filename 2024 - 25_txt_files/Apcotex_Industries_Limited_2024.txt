Climate 
Change 
and Energy 
Management
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Climate change poses 
physical and transitional 
risks 
in 
business. 
Furthermore, 
due 
to 
resource scarcity the cost 
of fossil fuel is expected 
to increase. Pursuit of 
clean 
energy- 
based 
manufacturing has direct 
impact on cost savings 
and lesser dependency 
on fossil fuel purchases.
The company has a strong 
commitment 
for 
sustainable 
development and has adopted 
several process improvements 
& energy efficiency initiatives. 
The 
company 
has 
also 
conducted LCA for 5 major 
products and, as recommended 
in LCA, is focusing on increasing 
the share of renewables. 
Negative 
impact 
in short run due to 
capex involved. 
Positive 
impact 
in 
long-run 
due 
to 
energy 
security 
and 
lower 
operating 
expenditure.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
The 
company’s 
operations and activities 
include 
working 
with 
machinery 
and 
chemicals. There is a 
need to manage these 
conditions 
towards 
health and safety of the 
employees and workers.
The company has adopted a 
structured 
integrated 
safety 
management 
program 
to 
achieve the goal of no-harm 
workplace. The focus of this 
program is on behaviour-based 
safety, 
asset 
integrity, 
and 
automation. 
The company has defined a 
health &  safety management 
system 
and 
all 
operations 
are 
ISO 
45001:2018- 
and 
Responsible Care-certified.
Negative 
impact 
due 
to 
short-
term 
and 
long 
term disruption of 
services due to 
accidents, training 
cost and capex 
on 
automation 
and 
asset 
management.
Water 
Stewardship
Risk/ 
Opportunity
The 
company 
understands 
the 
importance of water as a 
precious natural resource 
and the future risk being 
in 
chemical 
industry. 
Therefore, water scarcity 
is a risk for business.
The 
company 
has 
worked 
towards 
achieving 
water 
efficiency in all operations and 
has established a zero-liquid 
discharge system. The company 
is committed to installation of 
rainwater harvesting.
Negative 
impact 
due 
to 
cost 
expenditure 
on 
building zero-liquid 
discharge system. 
Positive 
impact 
due 
to 
reduced 
dependency 
on 
water 
withdrawal 
from 
municipal 
sources.
Ethical 
Business 
Conduct
Risk
Due to multi-stakeholder 
and 
multi-geography 
operations, 
exporting 
chemical 
companies 
are exposed to risks 
of 
corruption, 
conflict 
of interest, and other 
unethical 
practices. 
Any 
such 
event 
can 
substantially 
harm 
reputation.
All the company’s directors, 
KMPs, 
and 
employees 
are 
trained 
in 
ethical 
business 
practices. The company has 
instituted 
robust 
systems 
and processes to conduct its 
business in an ethical and fair 
manner. The company also 
takes 
annual 
independence 
declarations from directors and 
KMPs to ensure non-conflict of 
interest.
Negative 
impact 
due to potential 
bad 
reputation 
with 
customers 
and 
outside 
community.
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
External 
regulatory 
environment is dynamic. 
Due to multi-geographical 
operations, 
a 
variety 
of 
regulations 
are 
applicable to operations. 
Any violations can result 
in a substantial impact on 
the business.
The company has adopted a 
compliance tool which tracks 
all applicable compliances and 
helps in ensuring adherence 
with the same.
Negative 
impact 
due to disruption 
of services due to 
non-compliance, 
cost 
incurred 
on 
tracking 
and 
managing 
c o m p l i a n c e s 
through 
the 
software tool.

Local 
Community 
Engagement
Risk/ 
Opportunity
The 
nature 
of 
the 
chemical 
business 
creates a major impact 
on 
the 
surrounding 
environment and the local 
communities, making it 
one of the crucial topics 
for the company. Local 
community engagement 
helps 
the 
company 
to build trust in the 
community 
and 
avoid 
conflicts.
The company engages with 
local communities near areas 
of operation in Gujarat and 
Maharashtra on a regular basis 
to understand expectations and 
concerns. The company also 
contributes through CSR in local 
communities.
Negative 
impact 
due 
to 
CSR 
expenditure 
and 
bad 
potential 
reputation in the 
community. 
Positive 
impact 
due to community 
engagement 
and 
social work.
Materials
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Bulk 
and 
specialty 
chemical business’ major 
raw materials are sourced 
from the crude oil value 
chain. Risk to oil & gas 
sector due to climate 
change can affect supply 
chain 
and 
business. 
Customer demand for 
biomaterials and market 
for biomaterials is slowly 
picking up ground.
The 
company 
focuses 
on 
increasing yield and achieving 
material 
efficiency. 
The 
company is also partnering with 
other 
organizations 
conduct 
research on bio-materials to 
create long terms options away 
from fossil fuels.
Negative 
Impact 
due 
to 
high 
dependence on oil 
& gas industry and 
capital expenditure 
on R&D.
Positive 
impact 
due 
to 
higher 
yield in the short 
run and positive 
in 
the 
long-run 
if 
the 
company 
is successful in 
derisking 
from 
crude oil.
Product 
Stewardship
Risk/ 
Opportunity
With 
technological 
advances 
product 
quality and safety can 
be enhanced. It helps 
in 
minimizing 
lifecycle 
impact of products.
The company have implemented 
TPM at operating sites and has 
adhered with the standards 
prescribed 
by 
Responsible 
Care.
N e g a t i v e 
impact 
due 
to 
increased 
capital 
expenditure. 
Positive impact is 
due to better plant 
m a n a g e m e n t , 
better 
customer 
service 
and 
e n h a n c i n g 
s t r a t e g i c 
relationships. 
Human 
Capital 
Management
Risk/ 
Opportunity 
Maintaining a talent pool 
equipped with relevant 
skillsets is critical for 
operations. Due to the 
demographic 
dividend, 
India’s 
large 
pool 
of 
talented 
workforce 
provides an opportunity 
for businesses to scale-
up and expand.
The company engages with 
employees 
through 
several 
initiatives 
to 
keep 
them 
motivated 
and 
focuses 
on 
building a great place to work 
with an inclusive culture. The 
company 
has 
planned 
to 
conduct employee engagement 
surveys on a periodic basis and 
support employees by upskilling 
on a regular basis.
Negative 
impact 
due to disruption 
of services owing 
to 
ill-managed 
human capital and 
expenditure 
to 
maintain and add 
initiatives. 
Positive 
impact 
due 
to 
higher 
productivity.
Value Chain 
Management
Risk
Any form of disruption 
in the value chain can 
directly affect the bottom 
line 
overall. 
Supplier 
stability 
is 
key 
for 
operations. Compliance 
by suppliers is necessary 
for 
sustainable 
business 
operations. 
Diversification of value 
chain partners can help 
reduce overall risk.
The company regularly interacts 
with 
suppliers 
regarding 
expectations 
and 
support 
whenever 
required. 
The 
company regularly assesses 
suppliers 
including 
product 
quality and ESG aspects and 
conducts various awareness 
and capacity building programs. 
Negative 
impact 
due to potential 
disruption 
of 
operations owing 
to 
disruption 
in 
supply chain.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements:
Apcotex’s ESG journey is defined on its three strategic pillars: Product Stewardship, Stakeholders’ Delight and 
Responsible Business which reflect our five core values, i.e. Respect & Care, Transparency & Openness, Proactivity 
& Response, Innovation towards Excellence and Collaborative Ownership. Based on materiality, we have set short, 
medium- and long-term commitments for all our internal and external stakeholders. Our strong belief in driving 
sustainable practices and environmentally conscious innovations is reflective of our core values. Our strong commitment 
for sustainable development is reflecting in our achievements like increasing renewable energy, reducing GHG, water 
& waste footprints and zero accidents in the last four years. Our TPM and business excellence journey is helping us 
achieve optimum operational efficiency while minimizing waste. Overall, this is enabling us to move towards India’s 
long-term commitment to achieve Net Zero by 2070. We also have implemented impactful initiatives in the fields of 
healthcare, education & skill development and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), focusing on communities near 
our operations. In addition, continuous plantation to increase the green cover at our plants and creating a Miyawaki 
forest at our Taloja plant are unique case studies. Overall, these efforts are reflected in Apcotex being named twice in 
Forbes Asia ‘Best Under a Billion’ List in the past few years.

inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
The Company has adopted sustainable procurement practices which include the Supplier code of conduct and screening 
and assessment of new and existing suppliers on ESG criteria. The company encourages its suppliers pursuing REACH 
certification and ISO IMS (14001) certification.
	
b.	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the

Considering our nature of business and usage of products, reclamation of products from customers and consumers after 
useful life is not material and feasible. Furthermore, reclaiming packaging materials from customers has operational 
challenges due to diverse industries. We encourage our customers to recycle packaging materials. Our customers may 
choose to pursue post-consumer recycling of our materials independently for use in their own products, such as tyres or 
textiles.
 
 
The Company does dispose e-waste to authorized vendors and continues to work to find useful applications for the 
hazardous waste and other waste products that are either co-processed or incinerated or used in landfills.

Instead of raw material sourced and stored via drums, raw materials with bulk supply 
are received in tankers, resulting in the reduction of plastic drums’ usage. For chemicals 
with lesser consumption in process, plastic drums are used as containers which are 
disposed to the authorised agency after decontamination. The plastic waste generated 
from other sources of packaging is recycled to authorised agency.

The hazardous waste generated is treated at Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). The 
hazardous waste generated out of Wastewater treatment is partly disposed-off to 
Mumbai Waste Management Limited, Taloja and partly to authorised vendor for co-
processing. Furthermore, the contaminated clothes, hand gloves, etc are sent to 
Mumbai Waste Management Ltd for disposal.
d. Other Waste
ETP Sludge, Process Waste is partially being sent to a third party for co-processing 
(waste as raw material), and oil waste is being sent for co-incineration (incineration 
with energy recovery).
