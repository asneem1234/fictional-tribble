risks.
Positive: The Company’s 
focus will strengthen

and enable the Company 
to respond effectively 
to rising stakeholders 
expectations.

Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
It is my privilege to present the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) for FY2024–25, which reflects our 
continued journey of integrating sustainability and responsible 
business practices into every aspect of our operations.
Over the past year, we have navigated both opportunities 
and challenges in advancing our environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) agenda. Climate responsibility remains a central 
focus. We strengthened our Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system, 
expanded rainwater harvesting, and continued our program of 
energy efficiency through process improvements and adoption 
of advanced technologies. As a result, we have made measurable 
progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to 
natural gas and agro-waste fuels, and improving air emission 
parameters.
Waste management has been identified as a material risk and 
opportunity for our sector. We have reinforced our governance and 
compliance systems to ensure that hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste is processed only through GPCB-approved facilities. At the 
same time, our Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Department 
continues to drive improvements in chemical management, waste 
minimisation, and occupational safety.
We recognise that our people are our greatest strength. This 
year, we delivered comprehensive training programs across ESG, 
governance, and health and safety, ensuring 100% coverage of 
our Board of Directors, senior management, and employees. We 
further strengthened our inclusive workplace culture, reflected in 
policies that support diversity, equal opportunity, and the rights of 
differently abled employees.
Governance remains a cornerstone of our ESG approach. We 
maintain robust structures to oversee compliance with national 
and international regulatory frameworks, ensuring transparency, 
accountability, and integrity across all operations. Cybersecurity 
and data protection continue to receive enhanced attention, 
recognising the evolving risk landscape.
Looking ahead, we are at an advanced stage of defining ESG 
targets with clear timelines across energy, water, waste, and social 
responsibility. These commitments will ensure that our growth 
is sustainable, stakeholder expectations are met, and long-term 
value is created for our shareholders and society at large.
Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication of our 
employees, the trust of our partners, and the guidance of our 
Board. We remain steadfast in our vision of being a responsible, 
sustainable, and globally competitive organisation, delivering value 
while upholding the highest standards of corporate citizenship.

Grievance redressal forms an integral part of the Company’s Code of Business Ethics 
and Conduct, which is applicable to all employees, suppliers, business partners, 
contractual workers, and other stakeholders. In the event of a grievance, individuals 
are required to submit a written application to the local Human Resources team, 
following which the matter is duly investigated and addressed in accordance with 
the established escalation matrix.
In addition, the Company has instituted a robust Whistle Blower Policy/Vigil 
Mechanism, providing employees, workers, and stakeholders with a secure and 
confidential channel to raise concerns, thereby ensuring effective redressal. 
Complementing this framework, the Company has established various specialised 
committees—such as the Canteen Committee, POSH Committee, Safety 
Committee, and Health Committee—dedicated to addressing specific categories 
of grievances.
The Company also maintains an open-door policy, reinforcing its commitment 
to transparency and accessibility in grievance resolution. Contract workers are 
encouraged to initially raise concerns with their respective contract agency 
supervisors; should grievances remain unresolved, they may escalate the matter to 
the HR Operations team for appropriate action.
The Company has also introduced a new concept viz. “coffee with COO & CFO” 
where employees directly interact and discuss with COO and CFO on any topic 
including any grievances, suggestions, etc.
