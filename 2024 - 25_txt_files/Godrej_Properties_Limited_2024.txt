1.
GHG 
Management
Risk
Real estate assets contribute substantially 
to global emissions through energy 
consumption and waste production. 
Failure to effectively manage these 
emissions exposes the company 
to regulatory risks, as governments 
worldwide implement stricter climate-
related regulations and carbon pricing 
mechanisms
1.	 Employ renewable energy systems, 
achieving IGBC Health and Well-being 
certifications, and prioritize sustainable 
procurement of materials.
2.	 Implementing internal carbon pricing and 
enhancing energy efficiency through LED 
lighting, smart technologies, and efficient 
HVAC systems are crucial steps, along 
with adopting water-saving measures like 
low-flow fixtures and rainwater harvesting.

(indicate

2.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste management poses a significant 
risk to real estate sectors due to 
the significant waste generated by 
construction, operation, and demolition of 
properties. As environmental regulations 
become stricter and stakeholders demand 
more sustainable practices, effective 
waste management is crucial to ensure 
compliance, reduce landfill use, and lower 
environmental impact.
1.	 We have implemented comprehensive 
strategies focused on waste diversion, 
recycling, and reuse. By prioritizing 
the minimization of construction and 
operational waste sent to landfills, we 
actively reduce our environmental impact.
2.	 Our initiatives include robust recycling 
programs and onsite material reuse 
practice.
3.	 Additionally, through our corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) projects, we 
offset additional waste from landfills, 
further enhancing our commitment to 
sustainability
Negative
3.
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
For real estate companies, it is essential 
to inherent risks associated with 
property management, construction, 
and maintenance activities. Providing a 
safe work environment and preventing 
accidents are paramount to protecting 
employees, contractors, and tenants from 
potential hazards.
Compliance with safety regulations is not 
only a legal obligation but also a critical 
factor in mitigating financial risks related 
to workplace injuries, liability claims, and 
potential fines
1.	 Our OH&S Management system is 
aligned with ISO 45001: 2018, conducting 
thorough audits and risk assessments.
2.	 Comprehensive training programs ensure 
staff are versed in safety protocols. 
Robust incident reporting and transparent 
communication foster a safety culture, 
while regular monitoring and reviews 
enhance effectiveness.
Negative
4.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
Sustainable supply chain management 
imposes inherent risks for a real estate 
business in today's interconnected global 
economy. As the real estate industry relies 
heavily on suppliers for construction 
materials, maintenance services, and 
operational necessities, disruptions or 
unethical practices within the supply chain 
can significantly impact project timelines, 
costs, and reputation.
1.	 Our approach encompasses thorough 
supplier screening procedures, designed 
to assess potential partners based on 
sustainability criteria and compliance with 
environmental and social standards.
2.	 Our vendor screening processes 
ensure that all partners align with our 
sustainability objectives, promoting 
transparency, accountability, and 
responsible business practices 
throughout our operations.
Negative
5.

& Service 
Quality
Opportunity
At GPL, Our main priority is to create 
customer joy through best-in-class 
delivery with a focus on quality by 
ensuring high-quality products and 
services. By consistently delivering

−Job-specific trainings to equip employees with the necessary skills for safe task execution.
	
−Motivational programs and safety campaigns to instill a positive safety culture.
	
−Regular review meetings, including Contractor Site Safety Committee, Joint Site Safety Committee, and 
Management review meetings, to address safety concerns and drive improvements.
	
−Health check-ups and toolbox talks to monitor employee well-being and reinforce safety practices.
•	 Continual Improvement: Our internal audit mechanism monitors safety performance and identifies areas for 
ongoing enhancement, ensuring compliance with safety standards and regulations.
	
	
These initiatives underscore our unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of our employees and 
stakeholders, as well as our dedication to continually improving safety standards across all our operations.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
Response: As part of our Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Management System, SOP GPL P HS 02 has been 
developed to provide a structured approach for hazard identification, risk assessment, control implementation, 
and improvement of occupational health and safety (OH&S) within our organization.
	
	
This SOP systematically guides the process for hazard identification for all activities, following the hierarchy of 
controls framework. This framework includes the following steps:
•	 Elimination: Identifying opportunities to remove hazards entirely from the workplace.
•	 Substitution: Identifying safer alternatives to hazardous materials, equipment, or processes.
•	 Engineering Controls: Implementing physical changes to the work environment to isolate or minimize exposure 
to hazards.
•	 Administrative Controls: Implementing policies, procedures, and training programs to reduce exposure 
to hazards.
•	 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Providing appropriate PPE to workers as a final line of defence against 
identified hazards.
	
	
The goal of this SOP is to prioritize risk control measures that effectively mitigate or eliminate identified hazards. 
By following this systematic approach, we aim to ensure the safety and well-being of all personnel involved in 
our operations.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Response: The GPL Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Management System, as outlined in the Safety 
Manual, comprehensively delineates the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder, including workmen. 
The manual serves as a guiding document that ensures clear understanding and adherence to safety protocols 
throughout project execution.
	
	
Key elements of the Safety Manual include:
	
	
Roles and Responsibilities: The manual explicitly outlines the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved 
in the project, including management, supervisors, contractors, consultants, and workmen. Each stakeholder is 
provided with clear guidance on their specific duties regarding safety compliance and incident prevention.
	
	
Worker Roles: It is emphasized within the Safety Manual that workers possess full rights to refuse work if they 
identify any unsafe conditions during project execution. This right empowers workers to prioritize their safety and 
well-being, ensuring that potential hazards are promptly addressed to prevent accidents or injuries
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
Response: GPL’s contract safety rules and regulations encompass a robust procedure for establishing and 
operating Health Management and Medical Facilities at all our locations. As part of this initiative, a medical officer 
regularly visits each site at least once a week, with designated timings prominently displayed for easy access. 
We strongly encourage all workers to utilize this facility for addressing any non-occupational medical issues they 
may encounter.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Response: To effectively reduce GHG emissions, GPL has adopted a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. 
Firstly, we are increasing the adoption of alternative clean energy options to minimize our reliance on fossil fuels. By 
transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar power, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. 
Additionally, we are actively supporting energy efficiency measures, use of green grid electricity wherever available 
switching to fuel efficient and low carbon equipment across our operations. To offset any remaining emissions, GPL is 
undertaking proactive afforestation and land use focused projects. By investing in these initiatives, we contribute to the 
restoration and preservation of ecosystems, which serve as natural carbon sinks. Through this multi-pronged approach, 
which encompasses clean energy adoption, energy efficiency measures, and carbon offset projects, GPL is committed 
to achieving substantial reductions in GHG emissions. By aligning our actions with sustainability goals, we aim to play a 
significant role in mitigating climate change and creating a more environmentally responsible future.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Response: Appropriate management of waste is of utmost importance to us and hence, we are committed to strictly 
adhering to waste management regulations. However, we go beyond mere compliance by adopting a proactive approach 
to minimize the environmental impact of the waste we generate. In line with regulations, we ensure that hazardous 
waste is disposed of through authorized third-party recyclers. For non-hazardous waste, including metal scraps and 
construction debris, we also work with authorized recyclers to ensure proper disposal and recycling. This enables us 
to divert these materials from landfills and promote a circular economy. In the case of non-hazardous organic waste, 
we have implemented composting methods. By composting organic waste, we can produce high quality manure that 
is then utilized for project landscaping and in our plant nursery. To further enhance our waste management efforts, 
GPL has established integrated decentralized solid waste management programs in Konark, Bhubaneshwar, Batala, and 
Agra. These programs aim to minimize waste sent to landfills by implementing effective waste reduction and recycling 
strategies. We believe that collective action is crucial for achieving meaningful results. Therefore, we actively partner 
with various organizations and engage in clean-up drives and campaign rallies. By collaborating with these entities, we 
can translate innovative waste management practices into tangible on-ground results. Through our comprehensive 
waste management initiatives and collaborative partnerships, we are committed to minimizing waste to landfill and 
making a positive environmental impact.
