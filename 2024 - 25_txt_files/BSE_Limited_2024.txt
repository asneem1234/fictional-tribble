Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
ABOUT BRSR
The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) is a reporting framework introduced by SEBI to encourage transparency and accountability in the 
sustainability practices of listed companies. It is applicable to the top 1000 listed entities in India by market capitalization and is aimed at helping stakeholders 
assess a company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance alongside its ﬁnancial performance. 
Executive Summary: The BRSR is divided into three sections. Section A includes general disclosures about the company’s operations, workforce, products 
and services. Section B focuses on management and process disclosures that outline how ESG principles are embedded within governance and decision-
making. Section C captures disclosures aligned with the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC), covering areas 
such as ethical governance, sustainable product lifecycle, employee well-being, stakeholder relationships, human rights, environmental responsibility, public 
policy advocacy, inclusive growth, and customer value.
BRSR Assurance: The BRSR Core is a subset of the BRSR, comprising a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) under nine Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) attributes. For the ﬁnancial year 2024–25, SEBI has mandated that the top 250 listed entities obtain reasonable assurance or assessment on 
their BRSR Core disclosures. This is part of a phased implementation, which began with the top 150 companies in 2023–24 and will expand to the top 500 
companies by 2025–26 and to the top 1000 listed companies by 2026–27. 
In line with this requirement, BSE Limited has obtained reasonable assurance for its BRSR Core KPIs through CNK & Associates LLP, an independent assurance 
provider.

BSE has demonstrated a strong and consistent commitment to environmental sustainability through its structured and ongoing waste management initiatives.

an early age, this initiative supports SDG 4: Quality Education by promoting 
relevant skills for sustainable development and supports SDG 1: No Poverty,

Data Privacy 
& Data 
Security
Risk
Data privacy is the fundamental right of individuals to control how 
their personal information is collected, used, and shared. It 
encompasses the duties and responsibilities of both individuals 
and organizations regarding the handling of personally 
identiﬁable information (PII) from its collection and use to its 
disclosure and retention.
With the rise of digitalization, protecting sensitive corporate data 
has become more critical than ever. Organizations must ensure 
that classiﬁed information is safeguarded from unauthorized 
access, use, alteration, deletion, destruction, disruption, transfer 
via removable or other media, and from unauthorized disclosure, 
inspection, or recording. The digital age has brought a surge in 
cyber threats, including sophisticated ransomware attacks and 
deliberate sabotage of IT systems. Incidents such as the Maze 
attack highlight the reputational damage caused by hacktivism. 
Additionally, the expanding use of cyberspace increases 
exposure to unforeseen risks, emphasizing the need for robust 
cybersecurity measures.
Security and commodity exchanges, in particular, face 
heightened risks and opportunities due to their reliance on 
information technology. Their vital role in ensuring the smooth 
functioning of ﬁnancial markets demands strict management of 
security breaches and system failures to prevent market 
disruptions. With rising trading volumes—especially in the 
clearing and execution of derivative trades—and the increasing 
frequency of cyber-attacks, these exchanges are more exposed 
than ever to operational and reputational risks. 
To proactively address the risks associated with cybersecurity 
and data privacy, BSE Ltd. has implemented a robust framework 
comprising the following key measures:
1.  Comprehensive Data Privacy Policy
 
BSE Ltd. has established a formal Data Privacy Policy to 
safeguard personal information that is collected, received, 
processed, stored, or handled by the organization or on its 
behalf. This policy outlines structured processes and controls 
to ensure compliance with data privacy requirements and the 
secure handling of personally identiﬁable information (PII).
2.  24x7 Next-Generation Cyber Security Operations Center 
(SOC)
 
BSE operates a dedicated, next-generation Cyber Security 
Operations Center (SOC) that functions round-the-clock, 365 
days a year. The SOC continuously monitors for cyber threats 
and alerts. Upon detection of any suspicious activity, the SOC 
team promptly investigates and takes appropriate remedial 
actions to mitigate potential risks.
3.  Regular Audits of Systems and Networks
 
To ensure the ongoing integrity and resilience of its regulatory 
systems and IT infrastructure, BSE conducts regular 
cybersecurity and network audits. These audits help identify 
vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to security best 
practices and regulatory standards.
4.  Training and Awareness Programs
 
Periodic training sessions and awareness programs are 
organized by the IT Security team to educate employees and 
contractual staﬀ on key aspects of cybersecurity. These 
sessions enhance their understanding of potential threats and

5.  Ongoing Awareness Initiatives
 
As part of general awareness eﬀorts, informative content 
related to cyber vigilance—such as screen savers 
emphasizing the importance of not sharing conﬁdential 
information and adhering to cybersecurity protocols—is 
regularly shared with staﬀ to reinforce a culture of security 
consciousness.
2
Business 
Continuity 
Risk
For security and commodity exchanges, business continuity risk 
is a critical concern, as any delay in meeting the deﬁned Recovery 
Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) can 
result in severe ﬁnancial losses, reputational damage, and 
regulatory non-compliance. A failure to restore operations 
promptly may disrupt trading activities, aﬀect settlement 
processes, and lead to signiﬁcant revenue loss from unexecuted 
trades and halted services. Such interruptions can erode 
customer trust, reduce trading volumes, and damage the 
exchange’s credibility in the eyes of market participants, 
potentially driving them to more reliable platforms. Moreover, 
prolonged downtime may attract regulatory scrutiny, penalties, or 
legal consequences due to non-compliance with mandated 
recovery standards. The inability to maintain trading continuity 
not only undermines market conﬁdence but also poses 
operational and legal risks.
 
To ensure uninterrupted operations and resilience against 
potential disruptions, BSE Ltd. has implemented a 
comprehensive set of Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery (BCDR) measures, including: 
1. Change Replication Process
 
A structured process is in place to ensure that any changes 
implemented at the Primary Data Centre (PDC) are 
immediately replicated at the Disaster Recovery Site (DRS), 
maintaining synchronization and readiness for failover.
2.  Automated Monitoring of DR Availability
 
Monthly automated checks are conducted to verify the 
availability and functionality of disaster recovery services, 
enabling proactive identiﬁcation of potential issues.
3. Quarterly Mock Drills
 
Simulated DR drills are performed on a quarterly basis to 
validate the eﬀectiveness of recovery procedures and ensure 
all DR functionalities operate as intended.
4. Redundant Network Connectivity
 
Dual network connectivity from two independent service 
providers ensures continuous access and mitigates the risk of 
communication failures due to network outages.

5. Built-in Redundancy Across Systems
 
All critical applications, servers, network, and security 
devices are designed with built-in redundancy. In the event of 
a hardware failure, systems can seamlessly switch to the 
backup setup—either automatically or manually, as per 
design.
6. Mirrored Disaster Recovery Infrastructure
 
Every application and system has a corresponding setup at 
the DRS with performance and capacity equivalent to that of 
the PDC, ensuring a smooth switchover without degradation 
in service quality.
7. Automation of Daily Operations
 
Beginning-of-Day (BOD) and End-of-Day (EOD) operations are 
fully automated at both PDC and DRS. The invocation, 
switchover, and fallback between the two sites are also 
completely automated, reducing manual intervention and 
error.
8. Scheduled Data Backups
 
Regular backups of critical databases are performed to 
secure data integrity and enable swift restoration in case of 
data loss or system failure.
9. Release and Version Management
 
A robust Release and Version Management System ensures 
timely deployment of updates and maintains code 
synchronization between PDC and DRS. All changes undergo 
testing through mock runs in the live environment post-
deployment.
10. Multi-location Accessibility
 
BSE’s applications and systems can be accessed and 
operated from multiple geographic locations, supported by 
secure remote connectivity, thereby enabling uninterrupted 
operations during localized disruptions.

Hardware/ 
Software 
Malfunction
Risk
Any malfunctioning of critical hardware or software with 
prolonged downtime can signiﬁcantly disrupt the core operations 
of a security and commodity exchange. As these systems support 
essential trading, clearing, and settlement activities, their failure 
can lead to delayed transactions, halted market operations, and 
interruptions in price discovery. Such disruptions may result in 
ﬁnancial losses, reduced investor conﬁdence, and potential 
regulatory non-compliance. To maintain seamless operations and 
market integrity, it is essential to ensure system availability 
through timely maintenance and infrastructure redundancy.
Measures to Mitigate Hardware Risks: 
1.  Hardware Redundancy: Critical systems are equipped with 
redundant hardware components to ensure continued 
operations in case of hardware failure.
2.  Periodic Upgradation: Hardware resources essential to 
business operations are regularly reviewed and upgraded to 
meet evolving performance and compatibility requirements.
3.  Warranty and AMC Tracking: All hardware assets are 
monitored for warranty validity and Annual Maintenance 
Contracts (AMCs) to ensure timely support and 
replacements.
4.  System Support Environment: Adequate environmental 
controls, including power supply, cooling, and physical 
security, are maintained to support critical hardware 
infrastructure.
5.  Inventory of Critical Components: An additional stock of 
essential hardware components is maintained to enable 
quick replacements during unexpected failures.

IT Vendor 
Management
Risk
Inadequate oversight or ineﬀective management of critical third-
party IT vendors and suppliers can pose signiﬁcant risks to the 
organization’s ability to meet its strategic and operational 
objectives. For a security and commodity exchange like BSE, such 
gaps could lead to service disruptions, system failures, delays in 
critical deliverables, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational 
damage especially if the third parties play a role in maintaining or 
supporting trading platforms, infrastructure, or cybersecurity 
operations.
BSE has implemented eﬀective control procedures to manage 
third-party personnel and vendors throughout the selection, 
service, and separation stages. Vendor selection criteria include 
reputation, service history, ability to respond during exigencies, 
and compliance with regulatory requirements all of which are 
clearly deﬁned in the RFP and monitored during service delivery.
A process of periodic vendor evaluation is in place to proactively 
identify and address issues that may aﬀect operations. To avoid 
overdependence, adequate vendor redundancy is maintained, 
ensuring there is no reliance on a single service provider.
Additionally, essential IT assets such as desktops and laptops are 
kept in spare to meet immediate operational needs. IT equipment 
is generally procured with 4 to 5 years of warranty directly from 
the OEM to ensure timely support and replacements.
Negative
5
Outsourced 
Vendor 
Service & 
Compliance 
Risk
Failure or delay in service delivery by outsourced partners or 
vendors, coupled with high attrition of vendor-deputed staﬀ, can 
lead to operational bottlenecks. Such disruptions may result in 
delayed execution of time-bound activities or non-compliance 
with regulatory requirements, which could impact the 
organization’s reputation and operational eﬃciency.
BSE has deﬁned Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with vendors 
that include regulatory compliance requirements and ensure 
suﬃcient reserve resources to meet urgent needs. Vendor staﬀ 
are stationed on-site and supervised by the BSE IT 
Management Team. Vendor performance is regularly monitored 
through SLA tracking, performance reviews, and periodic 
meetings.
Negative
6
Non-
compliance 
with 
applicable 
laws and 
regulations
Risk
Any instance of non-compliance with regulatory requirements or 
receipt of notices from regulatory or statutory authorities such as 
SEBI, tax departments, or labor authorities can lead to monetary 
penalties and signiﬁcant reputational damage to the company. 
For a regulated entity like a stock exchange, such lapses can also 
aﬀect stakeholder conﬁdence and raise concerns around 
governance.
BSE has established a dedicated department responsible for 
overseeing compliance with various regulatory domains 
including SEBI regulations, corporate laws, labor laws, and tax 
laws. Compliance is periodically reviewed by SEBI-prescribed 
committees such as the Regulatory Oversight Committee. To 
ensure comprehensive tracking, Legatrix compliance software 
has been implemented, enabling real-time monitoring of 
compliance across all applicable laws.
Internal controls are further strengthened through periodic 
reviews conducted by the Internal Audit department and ongoing 
consultation with external legal and compliance experts. In 
addition, regular Secretarial, Internal, and External audits are 
conducted to validate compliance levels. All key ﬁndings and 
compliance updates are reported to the Audit Committee, 
ensuring oversight at the highest level.

Physical 
building 
security
Risk
As one of India’s oldest and most prominent public ﬁnancial 
institutions, BSE holds a position of national importance and is 
deeply linked to the development of capital markets in the 
country. Due to its symbolic and economic signiﬁcance, BSE has 
been considered a high-value target for potential terror attacks. 
This was tragically demonstrated during the 1993 serial bomb 
blasts, where the BSE building was among the ﬁrst targets, 
resulting in 84 casualties and hundreds of injuries. Since then, 
based on ongoing intelligence inputs, BSE continues to operate 
under heightened threat perception.
To safeguard against such threats, BSE has implemented 
stringent physical security measures. Bollards and crash barriers 
have been installed at ﬁve approach points to prevent 
unauthorized vehicular access to the premises. Entry of vehicles 
is strictly prohibited, except for essential services such as police, 
cash vans, and ambulances.
The BSE building is protected by a four-layered security system 
comprising BSE’s internal security personnel and Mumbai Police. 
To ensure preparedness and coordination, joint mock drills are 
periodically conducted with Mumbai Police, Special Commandos, 
& the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), alongside BSE’s own 
security team. Additionally, Mumbai Police conducts decoy 
intrusion attempts to assess & enhance the alertness & response 
time security personnel stationed at BSE.

Investor 
Grievance 
Redressal
Opportunity
BSE recognizes that investor education, protection, and 
conﬁdence are critical for the sustained growth of capital 
markets. With rising investor participation, especially from retail 
investors, providing accessible and transparent grievance 
redressal mechanisms is an opportunity to further strengthen 
trust in the securities market.
The launch of SEBI’s common Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) 
Portal (as per Master Circular SEBI/HO/OIAE/OIAE_IAD-
3/P/CIR/2023/195 dated July 31, 2023) enables a streamlined, 
digital-ﬁrst approach to resolving disputes through online 
conciliation and arbitration under the supervision of Market 
Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs).
BSE, in partnership with other MIIs, has implemented the Smart 
ODR platform an innovative solution that empowers investors to 
raise and track grievances digitally against brokers, mutual 
funds, portfolio managers, and other intermediaries. This 
platform enhances transparency, reduces resolution timelines 
and signiﬁcantly lowers the cost and eﬀort involved in traditional 
legal proceedings.
By embracing digital grievance redressal, BSE not only supports 
regulatory goals but also enhances investor conﬁdence, 
strengthens market integrity, and reinforces its position as a 
forward-looking and investor-friendly institution.

reﬂects its commitment to inclusive growth and nation-building.
By actively engaging in CSR initiatives, BSE strengthens its 
connection with the communities it serves, enhances its brand 
reputation, and fosters long-term trust among stakeholders. 
Initiatives focused on education, ﬁnancial literacy, health, and 
empowerment of underprivileged groups allow BSE to create 
lasting social value while aligning with its broader ESG 
(Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals.
This opportunity to invest in societal development also reinforces 
BSE’s identity as a responsible corporate citizen, enhances 
stakeholder goodwill, and helps shape a more equitable and 
resilient society thereby contributing to the long-term success 
and sustainability of both the business and the community.

Timely availability of skilled resources and eﬀective retention of 
talent are critical for sustaining productivity and ensuring 
consistent organizational performance. Any gaps in acquiring or 
retaining the right talent can adversely impact business 
continuity, eﬃciency, and long-term strategic goals. Additionally, 
the absence of a robust succession plan could lead to leadership 
vacuums, aﬀecting decision-making and stability at key 
junctures.
BSE has established a structured and eﬃcient talent acquisition 
process through strong empanelment of reputed headhunting 
and recruitment agencies, along with access to leading job 
portals. This enables quick hiring to address dynamic skill 
requirements. For entry-level positions, BSE conducts campus 
recruitment drives in collaboration with reputed business 
schools.
To enhance internal capabilities, BSE regularly organizes in-
house and external training programs aimed at skill development 
and upskilling of the existing workforce.
A succession policy is in place to ensure preparedness for 
leadership transitions. Details related to attrition and key 
resource stability are reviewed by the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC) on a quarterly basis.
Additionally, BSE implements robust retention strategies to 
secure key managerial personnel and employees in senior roles, 
thereby ensuring continuity and preserving institutional 
knowledge.

PRINCIPLE 4: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF AND BE RESPONSIVE TO ALL ITS STAKEHOLDERS
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1. Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity:
 
Identifying key stakeholder groups is a critical aspect of eﬀective stakeholder management for any entity. The process involves several steps for 
comprehensively identifying and understanding the various parties with a vested interest in the organization's activities, decisions, and outcomes 
 
a. Stakeholder Mapping: The initial phase involves stakeholder mapping, where individuals or groups with an interest in the organization are identiﬁed 
according to their level of inﬂuence and interest. This step includes categorizing stakeholders based on various criteria such as their connection to the 
entity, the inﬂuence they possess, and the extent to which they can aﬀect the achievement of organizational objectives. 
 
b. Stakeholder Analysis: Following identiﬁcation, a detailed stakeholder analysis is undertaken to gain a comprehensive understanding of each 
stakeholder's expectations, concerns, and requirements. This is achieved by collecting data through consultations, surveys, interviews, and other 
engagement methods, oﬀering valuable insight into stakeholders' viewpoints and priorities. 
 
c. Prioritization: Subsequently, stakeholders are ranked based on their signiﬁcance to the organization and the potential consequences of their 
involvement. Factors considered during prioritization include their inﬂuence, level of reliance on the organization, and the potential risks or 
opportunities associated with their interests. 
 
d. Engagement Planning: After key stakeholders are identiﬁed and prioritized, an engagement plan is formulated to guide interactions with each group. 
This plan speciﬁes the intended outcomes of engagement activities, outlines suitable communication methods, and establishes frameworks for 
ongoing dialogue and feedback mechanisms. 
 
e. Continuous Monitoring and Review: Recognizing that stakeholder identiﬁcation is a dynamic process, continuous monitoring and periodic review are 
necessary. As the organization and its environment evolve, new stakeholders may appear, and the priorities of existing ones may shift. Regular 
reassessment of stakeholder identiﬁcation activities supports their continued relevance and eﬀectiveness.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board:
 
BSE has instituted processes to ensure stakeholder consultation on economic, environmental, and social (EES) topics. We provide a dedicated feedback 
form speciﬁcally for investors to share their inputs on a range of matters, including ESG-related concerns. In addition, a newly implemented ESG feedback 
mechanism is available on our website for all stakeholders to submit their views exclusively on ESG topics. This process ensures that the Board stays 
informed about stakeholder expectations and concerns and can consider them in its oversight and strategic planning. 
 
Link to the form:
  
 https://www.bseindia.com/Register/stakeholderfeedback.aspx
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, 
provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of 
the entity:
 
Yes. BSE has introduced a dedicated ESG feedback mechanism on its website to enable all stakeholders to share inputs on environmental and social 
topics. This feedback channel is intended to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental and social topics. Since the mechanism is newly 
launched and feedback is yet to be received, there have been no such instances in the reporting year. However, responses will be reviewed and shared with 
the Board in the future to support the identiﬁcation and management of these topics. 
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups:
 
The company does not have any vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder group. However, BSE IPF conducts various Investor Awareness Programs for 
general investors. Around 14,000 programs were conducted by BSE IPF during the ﬁscal year 2025. These programs cover various types of investors 
ranging from college students, women groups, general investors, personnel from defence and police etc. Additionally, investor education is also carried 
out through various social media posts and TV advertisements.

8. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
Preventing adverse outcomes for individuals who report incidents of discrimination and harassment is critical to cultivating a secure and inclusive 
workplace culture. To protect those who raise concerns, various safeguards are implemented to shield them from retaliation and harm. These protection 
mechanisms include: 
 
a. Conﬁdential Reporting Channels: Oﬀering secure and discreet methods for submitting reports of discrimination and harassment empowers individuals 
to speak up without apprehension of retaliation. Conﬁdential reporting structures promote trust in the reporting process and safeguard the identity of 
complainants. 
 
b. Non-Retaliation Policies: Establishing comprehensive non-retaliation policies is fundamental to protecting complainants from negative consequences 
following the submission of a complaint. These policies explicitly prohibit retaliatory behavior and outline disciplinary measures for those who engage
in such conduct.
124

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
 
c. Whistle-blower Protections: Applying whistle-blower policies and relevant legal provisions aﬃrms the rights of complainants and guards them against 
retaliatory actions. These protections may include anonymity, legal recourse, and formal procedures for reporting any retaliatory behavior.
 
d. Supportive Environment: Fostering a work environment that supports complainants contributes to their emotional and psychological well-being and 
enhances conﬁdence in the reporting process. Support services may involve access to counselling, legal support, or employee assistance programs 
tailored to their needs. 
 
e. Prompt Investigation and Resolution: Carrying out prompt and comprehensive investigations into allegations of discrimination or harassment is 
essential to prevent ongoing harm. Timely resolution of cases reﬂects organizational accountability and a commitment to addressing concerns 
eﬃciently and justly. 
 
f. Training and Awareness Program: Delivering educational initiatives focused on discrimination, harassment, and retaliation increases awareness of 
employee rights and organizational expectations. These programs play a vital role in fostering a respectful and inclusive workplace culture. 
 
g. Regular Monitoring and Review: Conducting periodic evaluations of the eﬀectiveness of protective measures allows the organization to respond to 
emerging challenges and workforce needs. Continuous review processes help detect shortcomings and support proactive eﬀorts to strengthen 
complainant protections.

10. Brieﬂy describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes:
 
Our waste stream primarily consists of e-waste, used paper, single-use plastic water bottles, and leftover food waste. To promote environmental 
responsibility, we ensure the proper disposal of e-waste, plastic bottles, and paper waste by sending them to authorized recycling facilities. Employees are 
regularly sensitized to minimize food waste through awareness initiatives such as posters, email communications, and WhatsApp messages. Periodic 
campaigns are also conducted to encourage the responsible use of water and paper. To further minimize our environmental footprint, BSE Ltd. has 
undertaken signiﬁcant digitization initiatives aimed at reducing paper consumption. One key example is the implementation of the Corporate 
Announcement Filing System (CAFS) for equity-listed companies, which facilitates paperless submission of regulatory documents. Additionally, we have 
rolled out digital ﬁling and document submission processes across various departments and operational areas, reinforcing our eﬀorts to transition towards 
a more sustainable, paper-light work environment. As an additional step toward reducing paper use and supporting environmental sustainability, the 
company has replaced tissue paper with electronic hand dryers. Moreover, the use of single-use plastic water bottles is restricted to speciﬁc events only.

Outcome of the initiative 
Sr. No.
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, 
may be provided along-with summary) 
The initiative ensures the eﬀective 
utilization of rainwater, reducing 
dependence on municipal water 
supply.
A rainwater harvesting system has been installed at the BSE 
buildings in Mumbai. The collected rainwater will be treated and 
utilized for the chiller plant. Furthermore, it will also contribute to 
recharging the existing ring wells within the premises.
Initiative 
undertaken. 
1
Rainwater Harvesting
By combining the use of energy-
eﬃcient LED technology with motion 
sensors, we are able to optimize 
lighting usage, reduce energy 
wastage, and contribute to overall 
electricity savings. This initiative not 
only supports sustainability goals but 
also lowers operational costs.
As part of our ongoing eﬀorts to enhance energy eﬃciency, we 
have installed motion sensors in our premises. These motion 
sensors automatically switch lights upon detecting movement 
and turn oﬀ when the area is unoccupied, signiﬁcantly reducing 
unnecessary electricity consumption.
2
Installation of Motion Sensors
This initiative signiﬁcantly minimizes 
plastic consumption, lowers our 
environmental footprint, and supports 
our commitment to sustainable 
resource management & responsible 
waste reduction.
In an eﬀort to reduce single-use plastic waste and promote 
sustainable practices, we have replaced plastic water bottles with 
reusable glass jars across our premises. These glass jars are 
reﬁlled regularly, providing a hygienic and environmentally 
friendly alternative to disposable plastic bottles.
3
Replacement of Plastic Water 
Bottles with Glass Jars
The initiative ensures the elimination 
of unnecessary paper waste in 
washrooms, promoting sustainable 
resource use and reducing the 
organization's reliance on disposable 
paper products. It also contributes to 
cost savings and supports a cleaner, 
more hygienic environment.
As part of BSE's sustainability eﬀorts, the use of tissue papers in 
all washrooms across the building has been discontinued. In 
place of tissue papers, energy-eﬃcient electronic hand dryers 
have been installed on every ﬂoor to promote a more sustainable 
and hygienic drying solution. This move is aimed at reducing 
paper waste, lowering procurement and disposal costs, and 
minimizing the organization's environmental footprint.
4
Discontinuation of Tissue Paper 
Usage in Washrooms
Using its DC Sustainability Tool and 
NetZero Simulators, BSE monitors 
these metrics, identiﬁes energy-
saving opportunities, and simulates 
carbon reduction strategies.  
Additionally, IoT-based inlet air 
temperature control enhances cooling 
e ﬃc i e n c y , r e d u c e s  e n e r g y 
consumption, & integrates with water 
recycling to cut waste—bringing BSE 
data centres closer to carbon 
neutrality.  
By combining these eﬀorts with 
advanced optimization tools, BSE 
aims to reduce its carbon footprint 
while improving operational eﬃciency 
and sustainability.
The Company is committed to carbon neutrality and minimizing 
the environmental impact of its large data centres. To achieve this, 
it employs a multifaceted approach, optimizing energy eﬃciency, 
water conservation, climate risk assessment, infrastructure 
optimization and improved operational practices.
