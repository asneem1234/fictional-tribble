Financial Impacts 
(Negative or Positive)
1.	 Human 
Rights
Risk
Human 
rights 
exert 
a 
substantial 
influence 
on 
the entire supply chain and 
can 
significantly 
damage 
a 
Company’s 
reputation 
and 
public 
relations 
if 
violated. Consequently, this 
underscores the importance 
of this topic for the Company.
The Company has shifted 
its focus towards creating 
an 
enabling, 
supportive, 
and safe environment for 
its employees. Additionally, 
it 
has 
implemented 
a 
policy 
to 
prevent 
sexual 
harassment and established 
a robust grievance redressal 
mechanism 
to 
address 
violations of human rights.
Costs 
incurred 
in 
implementing 
systems 
to 
ensure adherence to human 
rights principles may pose 
negative 
implications, 
including financial burdens 
and operational disruptions. 
However, investing in these 
systems can yield positive 
outcomes such as enhanced 
reputation, 
increased 
consumer trust, and improved 
employee 
morale 
and 
productivity.
2.	 Product 
Quality and 
Safety
Risk
With heightened regulatory 
constraints on product quality 
to safeguard consumer safety, 
it is imperative to comply with 
them rigorously to prioritize 
consumer-centricity.
The 
Company 
prioritizes 
its 
quality 
commitments, 
fostering 
an 
environment 
where everyone embraces a 
culture of quality to produce 
responsible work. Alembic 
has consistently invested in 
initiatives to enhance quality 
across its plants, ensuring 
compliance with international 
standards and regulations.
This 
dedication 
leads 
to 
positive implications such as 
increased customer loyalty 
and acceptance.

3.	 R&D and 
Innovation
Opportunity
In today’s market, there are 
numerous opportunities to 
create innovative solutions 
and cater to customer needs. 
By proactively engaging in 
research and development 
(R&D), 
companies 
can 
enhance 
operational 
efficiency, productivity, and 
accuracy.
Alembic’s 
R&D 
teams 
remain 
updated 
on 
the 
latest product development 
tools and technologies to 
gain a competitive edge 
in the market. Additionally, 
the 
Company 
has 
made 
substantial investments to 
strengthen R&D capabilities 
in various high-growth and 
high-value therapy areas.
This results in a positive 
impact, including increased 
productivity 
and 
the 
development 
of 
new 
products.
4.	 Digital 
Business 
model and 
digitization
Opportunity
With the rapid advancement 
of technology and innovation, 
the pharmaceutical industry 
is witnessing a significant 
shift towards digitization. This 
transformation is expected to 
revolutionize various aspects 
of the industry, including the 
emergence of e-pharmacies, 
digital clinical trials, digital 
pills, 
artificial 
intelligence 
tools, and the production of 
precise medicines.
Alembic is actively embracing 
this 
digital 
evolution 
by 
focusing on digitizing its 
operations. To achieve this 
goal, 
the 
Company 
has 
developed a detailed digital 
blueprint, 
which 
will 
be 
implemented in a phased 
manner.
The 
adoption 
of 
digital 
technologies is anticipated 
to 
yield 
several 
positive 
outcomes, 
including 
enhanced precision, increased 
efficiency, improved quality, 
and enhanced productivity 
throughout the organization.
5.	 Pharmacov-
igilance
Risk
Pharmacovigilance 
is 
intrinsically 
linked 
with 
pharmaceutical 
products’ 
hazards, necessitating diligent 
monitoring of their effects 
to identify adverse reactions. 
This monitoring is paramount 
for ensuring patient safety.
To this end, the Company has 
established a dedicated portal 
for reporting side effects 
of its products, facilitating 
the 
systematic 
recording 
of Pharmacovigilance risks 
post 
drug 
administration. 
Additionally, 
a 
customer 
care number is provided 
on the portal for individuals 
to 
report 
Adverse 
Drug 
Reactions (ADR) promptly. 
Furthermore, 
Corrective 
Action and Preventive Actions 
(CAPA) protocols are enforced 
for 
each 
ADR 
incident, 
incorporating measures such 
as change control and impact 
analysis.
Despite the imperative nature 
of these measures, there may 
be 
negative 
implications, 
primarily stemming from the 
additional costs associated 
with monitoring and tracking 
procedures.

6.	 Clinical Trial 
Conduct
Risk
Clinical 
trials 
are 
pivotal 
in 
advancing 
medical 
science, 
developing 
novel 
treatments, and safeguarding 
patient welfare. Compliance 
with 
stringent 
regulatory 
frameworks is imperative to 
uphold integrity and mitigate 
risks that could adversely 
impact 
the 
Company’s 
reputation.
The 
Company 
diligently 
ensures adherence to all 
regulatory 
stipulations 
throughout the clinical trial 
lifecycle, 
encompassing 
comprehensive 
protocols, 
informed 
consent 
acquisition from participants, 
prioritization of patient safety, 
preservation of data integrity, 
and protection of participant 
confidentiality.
While 
implementing 
these measures may entail 
additional 
expenditures, 
they are indispensable for 
upholding ethical standards 
and ensuring the reliability 
and success of clinical trials as 
negative implications.
7.	 Resilient 
Business 
Perfor-
mance
Risk
Disruptions 
to 
business 
operations can stem from 
various sources such as shifts 
in the business landscape, 
evolving 
regulatory 
requirements, 
and 
natural 
or 
man-made 
disasters. 
Therefore, it is crucial for 
a Company to establish a 
robust business continuity 
and resilience mechanism 
to 
ensure 
uninterrupted 
business performance.
To address these challenges, 
we 
have 
implemented 
a 
comprehensive 
risk 
management 
mechanism 
aimed at effectively identifying 
and 
managing 
emerging 
risks. 
This 
includes 
the 
development of mitigating 
strategies to address potential 
threats. Additionally, we have 
formulated and implemented 
a Business Continuity Plan 
(BCP) for organisation. This 
plan 
delineates 
specific 
emergency 
scenarios 
and outlines a structured 
approach 
for 
response, 
rescue, and recovery efforts.
Despite the importance of 
these preparedness measures, 
there 
may 
be 
negative 
implications associated with 
the expenditure required for 
their implementation.
8.	 Human 
Resource 
Develop-
ment
Opportunity
In today’s rapidly changing 
technological landscape and 
with the availability of highly 
skilled and knowledgeable 
workers, it has become crucial 
for organizations to focus on 
developing and retaining the 
right talent to ensure effective 
and profitable operations.
Alembic 
recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
talent 
development 
and 
has 
implemented 
a 
comprehensive 
learning 
management system (LMS) 
designed to provide essential 
training 
modules 
to 
all 
employees.
Moreover, 
the 
Company 
emphasizes 
the 
nurturing 
of 
internal 
talent 
for 
leadership roles through skill 
enhancement programs.
By investing in the professional 
growth of our workforce, we 
anticipate an improvement 
in productivity and efficiency, 
which 
will 
ultimately 
contribute to the overall 
success of the organization as 
positive implications.

9.	 Sustainable 
Supply 
Chain
Risk
A 
sustainable 
supply 
chain is essential for long-
term 
business 
success, 
environmental 
stewardship, 
and social well-being. By 
integrating 
sustainability 
into supply chain strategies, 
companies 
can 
realize 
numerous benefits, including 
cost savings, risk mitigation, 
enhanced brand value, and 
competitive 
advantage. 
However, any violation of 
environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) principles 
within the supply chain can 
result in the loss of business 
from reputable customers and 
damage to the Company’s 
reputation.
To address these challenges, 
our 
Company 
has 
implemented 
sustainable 
procurement policy, supplier 
code 
of 
conduct 
and 
comprehensive 
procedures 
known 
as 
‘sustainability 
assurance across the value 
chain.’ This involves assessing 
critical 
suppliers 
on 
ESG 
parameters using two primary 
methods:
1. 	 Audit Method: Through 
on-site audits, we evaluate 
our major suppliers on 
sustainability parameters 
and 
assign 
ratings. 
These ratings inform to 
procurement team for 
further action.
2.	 Checklist 
Method: 
Sustainability 
data 
is 
collected from suppliers 
through 
a 
checklist, 
allowing us to rate them 
based on their adherence 
to sustainability criteria.
While 
these 
measures 
ensure sustainability across 
our supply chain, there are 
associated 
costs 
involved. 
However, we believe that 
these 
investments 
are 
necessary to uphold our 
commitment to sustainability 
and maintain the trust of our 
stakeholders, thus adhering 
positive implications.
10.	Community 
Engage-
ment
Opportunity
Community 
engagement 
is vital for fostering trust 
and 
minimizing 
conflicts 
within the community. It is 
imperative for a Company to 
align with community needs 
and provide comprehensive 
support.
Alembic actively collaborates 
with 
various 
communities 
based on their expressed 
requirements. The Alembic 
Group 
has 
established, 
nurtured, 
and 
promoted 
several 
non-profit 
organizations 
focusing 
on 
three key areas: education, 
healthcare, 
and 
rural 
development, 
aimed 
at 
enhancing the well-being of 
rural populations.
Consequently, 
positive 
implications arise, including 
an enhanced reputation and 
increased goodwill within the 
community.

11.	Business 
Ethics & 
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Ethical 
conduct 
in 
both 
internal 
operations 
and 
external engagements is a 
cornerstone of sustainable 
business practices.
The Company has instituted 
a robust policy framework 
addressing 
ethics, 
bribery, 
and 
corruption, 
ensuring 
adherence to high standards 
of integrity and transparency 
across 
all 
facets 
of 
its 
operations. Our organizational 
ethos underscores the values 
of patience and perseverance, 
motivating our team and 
partners to pursue excellence 
while 
upholding 
ethical 
principles and fostering a 
culture of good governance.
These 
concerted 
efforts 
contribute 
to 
maintaining 
our 
reputation 
and 
trustworthiness 
in 
the 
business landscape without 
significant positive financial 
implications.
12.	Availability 
and 
affordability 
of medicine
Risk
The pricing and availability of 
medicines entail a complex 
process influenced by various 
factors. Balancing the need to 
make medicines affordable for 
customers with maintaining 
a competitive edge in the 
market presents a significant 
challenge.
In response to this challenge, 
Alembic 
is 
dedicated 
to 
enhancing global health by 
providing affordable, high-
quality generic medicines. 
Through 
consistent 
efforts, Alembic strives to 
improve access to essential 
medications while upholding 
stringent quality standards.
Furthermore, 
Alembic 
is 
committed to strengthening 
its Intellectual Capital by 
prioritizing 
innovation. 
By developing a portfolio 
of high-quality and cost-

13.	Biodiversity
Risk
Being 
recognized 
as 
a 
responsible corporate citizen 
entails aligning with the 
preservation and sustainability 
of 
biodiversity. 
The 
Company acknowledges the 
significance of maintaining 
harmony with its surrounding 
biodiversity.
To uphold this commitment, 
the 
Company 
prioritizes 
efforts aimed at nurturing 
and preserving biodiversity. 
Through various initiatives, the 
Company seeks to minimize 
the impact of its operations on 
the surrounding environment, 
thereby 
safeguarding 
biodiversity.
While these initiatives require 
investments and resources, 
they are essential for the 
protection and preservation 
of biodiversity. Thus, while 
there may be associated 
costs, the Company remains 
dedicated to fulfilling its 
environmental responsibilities 
and contributing positively 
to biodiversity conservation 
efforts.

14.	Waste  
Manage-
ment
Risk
Given the nature of the 
industry, waste generation 
is an inevitable aspect of 
the Company’s operations. 
However, irresponsible waste 
management 
practices, 
such as improper disposal 
or incineration of hazardous 
waste, can have detrimental 
effects on the environment.
To address this issue, the 
Company has implemented 
several measures aimed at 
ensuring responsible waste 
management:
The Company has established 
a 
robust 
mechanism 
for 
diverting high-calorific waste 
to the cement industry for 
co-processing. This approach 
helps minimize environmental 
impact by utilizing waste as 
an alternative fuel source in 
cement kilns.
Additionally, the Company 
has implemented recycling 
initiatives for both products 
and waste materials. A special 
drive has been launched to 
collect plastic waste from 
neighbouring villages.
Moreover, 
the 
Company 
is committed to adopting 
sustainable 
practices 
in 
its 
packaging 
materials. 
Approximately 50% of the 
cardboard boxes used in 
packaging are made from 
recycled materials, reducing 
the 
reliance 
on 
virgin 
resources 
and 
minimizing 
environmental footprint.
While 
these 
initiatives 
contribute 
positively 
to 
environmental sustainability, 
it’s important to acknowledge 
that there are associated 
costs incurred in handling 
and safely disposing of waste. 
Despite the potential negative 
implications 
in 
terms 
of 
costs, the Company remains 
committed to its responsible 
waste management practices 
as 
part 
of 
its 
broader 
environmental 
stewardship 
efforts.

15.	Climate 
Change 
and GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Given the increasing focus 
on 
climate 
change 
and 
sustainable practices, it is 
crucial to acknowledge the 
significance of greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions and their 
impact on the environment.
Managing 
GHG 
emissions 
involves navigating through 
a complex and scattered 
process, which can pose 
critical risks if not properly 
addressed.
To tackle this challenge, the 
Company 
has 
developed 
extensive plans aimed at 
reducing its GHG emissions. 
These initiatives include:
	 Internal utilization of solar 
power to reduce reliance 
on conventional energy 
sources.
	 Installation of windmills to 
harness renewable energy.
	 Procurement of renewable 
power for its operations, 
further reducing carbon 
footprint.
	 Implementation 
of 
efficiency 
measures 
across its manufacturing 
sites to optimize energy 
consumption.
Moreover, the Company has 
established corporate policies 
focused on identifying and 
addressing 
climate-related 
risks and global climate issues. 
These policies serve as a 
framework for implementing 
control 
measures 
and 
mitigating risks associated 
with GHG emissions.
By 
implementing 
these 
initiatives and adhering to 
its corporate policies, the 
Company anticipates several 
positive outcomes, including 
process 
improvements, 
enhanced 
energy 
efficiency, 
and 
improved 
stakeholder 
outcomes. 
These efforts align with the 
Company’s commitment to 
environmental sustainability 
and 
responsible 
business 
practices.

16.	Employee 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Employees and workers within 
the Company are routinely 
exposed 
to 
hazardous 
chemicals and substances, 
which may pose health risks if 
not properly managed.
To address these challenges, 
the 
Company 
has 
implemented comprehensive 
measures 
aimed 
at 
safeguarding the health and 
well-being of its workforce. 
These initiatives include:
Implementation 
of 
an 
Environmental Health and 
Safety (EHS) policy, providing a 
comprehensive framework for 
various environmental-related 
systems and processes.
Establishment of dedicated 
EHS personnel at all sites to 
oversee the implementation 
of 
safety 
policies 
and 
programs.
Provision 
of 
physical 
classroom 
training 
to 
all 
employees on relevant EHS 
topics.
Conducting periodic medical 
checkups for both employees 
and contractual workers to 
monitor their health status.
Regular conduct of robust 
risk assessment exercises to 
identify and mitigate EHS risks 
effectively.
Provision 
of 
appropriate 
Personal 
Protective 
Equipment 
(PPE) 
to 
employees based on their job 
roles.
Adherence to strict Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
for chemical handling to 
minimize risks.
Continuous efforts to identify 
and address unsafe acts and 
conditions in the workplace.
While these initiatives are 
essential for ensuring the 
safety of employees and 
mitigating EHS risks, they may 
lead to increased operational 
costs associated with safety 
training programs and the 
provision of protective gear. 
However, these investments 
are necessary to uphold the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
workplace 
safety 
and 
regulatory 
compliance 
thus adhering to positive 
implications.

17.	Energy Man-
agement
Risk
Efficient 
utilization 
of 
energy resources is essential 
for 
managing 
costs 
and 
alleviating 
environmental 
burdens, 
particularly 
amid 
increasing concerns about 
climate change.
Recognizing this imperative, 
Alembic has made significant 
investments 
in 
renewable 
energy initiatives, including:
Expansion of solar energy 
capacity 
through 
the 
installation of rooftop solar 
panels and commissioned 
24 MW Solar Park at Bhatpur, 
Vadodara in two phases. 
1st Phase 12MW Solar Park 
commissioned in the FY 2023-
24 for Panelav campus and 
2nd phase 12MW Solar Park 
commissioned in the FY 2024-
25 for Karakhadi campus.
Deployment 
of 
windmills 
to bolster the proportion of 
renewable energy sources in 
its energy mix.
Moreover, 
the 
Company 
is 
actively 
engaged 
in 
the development of flow 
chemistry techniques for its 
production processes, aiming 
to enhance yield and reduce 
energy consumption.
While 
these 
endeavours 
may entail increased costs 
associated with fuel and 
capital 
expenditure 
on 
energy-efficient 
equipment 
in the short term, they are 
anticipated to yield positive 
financial outcomes in the long 
run through reduced energy 
expenses.
18.	Water Man-
agement
Risk
The 
mismanagement 
of 
water resources can result in 
adverse outcomes such as 
excessive consumption and 
the discharge of toxins, which 
not only pose regulatory risks 
but also invite stakeholder 
activism and the potential 
shutdown 
of 
operations. 
Given the indispensability of 
water across various activities 
like heating, cooling, and 
manufacturing 
processes, 
ensuring a consistent water 
supply is paramount.
Alembic 
is 
committed 
to 
responsible 
water 
management through several 
initiatives:
Conversion to Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) at all API 
sites 
and 
utilization 
of 
treated effluents in industrial 
processes and gardening at 
formulation units.
Implementation 
of 
groundwater 
restoration 
measures, 
including 
the 
construction 
of 
charging 
wells with ongoing efforts to 
expand this infrastructure.
Efficient 
utilization 
of 
wastewater by repurposing 
domestic treated water for 
gardening 
and 
industrial 
treated water for boilers and 
chillers.
Construction 
of 
artificial 
ponds at select sites to 
enhance rainwater harvesting 
capabilities.
While these efforts incur costs 
associated with handling and 
safe disposal, the Company 
remains 
dedicated 
to 
mitigating 
environmental 
risks 
and 
promoting 
positive 
sustainable 
water 
stewardship.

recovery of spent solvents, which are then sold for reuse, minimizing waste generation. Additionally, high-calorific value waste is 
directed to cement industries for co-processing, while boiler ash is sent to brick manufacturing units in accordance with waste 
management regulations. Used oil is responsibly sent for recycling to further reduce environmental impact. Furthermore, we 
collaborate with third-party agencies to collect plastic waste from end consumers, ensuring its proper disposal or recycling. 
This comprehensive approach underscores our commitment to reducing the usage of hazardous chemicals and effectively 
managing associated waste.
