chips and servers, which deliver higher performance while 
consuming significantly less power.
This shift has led to a substantial reduction in our CO₂ 
emissions, from 286.4 MTCO₂e in FY2024 to 110.2 MTCO₂e in 
FY2025, representing a 61.5% year-on-year reduction, despite 
an expansion in our operational scale.
Affle has established qualitative ESG standards and policies 
for FY2024-25 and is currently in the process of engaging with 
external technical consultants to help establish quantitative 
targets of the Company. The Company’s progress towards 
achieving these qualitative targets may be reported in the 
next fiscal year.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7	 Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
At Affle, we recognize the importance of integrating 
sustainability across our organization. We continue to 
benchmark our governance, ESG practices and financial 
reporting with industry leading standards. Our proactive 
adoption of ESG in FY2020-21 and perpetual initiatives 
towards enabling a sustainable well-governed ecosystem 
reinforces our commitment towards inclusive value creation 
for the stakeholders and the society at large.
Affle being in the mobile advertising technology business, is 
significantly less resource intensive in terms of environmental 
impact or related material inputs. However, as a responsible 
Company, we resolve to accelerate the evolution of ESG 
to make a positive impact on people and the planet. We 
are committed to make conscious efforts towards managing 
energy, water and waste more efficiently. Recently, we revised 
our e-waste strategy as part of our waste management 
approach, with the aim of minimizing waste and its 
environmental impact. Our revised policy will reduce e-waste 
through donating used laptops/hardware to charitable 
organizations in working condition, aligned to the 3R (Reduce, 
Recycle and Reuse) principle of waste management. This shall 
also contribute to the digital inclusiveness and academic well-
being of the communities around us. 
During the year FY2024-25, we continued our efforts of 
implementing 
sustainable 
business 
practices 
across 
organization, focused on: 1. reducing our CO2 emissions 
through modernisation of our cloud infrastructure 2. 
enhancing cyber security and data protection capabilities 
to ensure the security and privacy for our customers and 
3. creating an inclusive workplace free from all forms of 
discrimination and harassment. 
On the governance front, our ESG committee conducts 
regular evaluations of the Company’s ESG practices. We assess 
all critical policies to ensure that they align with our values & 
objectives and integrate sustainability considerations into all 
our business processes, corporate decisions and strategic goals.
With the aim of positive impact towards a better tomorrow, 
Affle is broadening its sustainability initiatives and working 
more closely to address previously identified major material 
topics which have high relevance to its business.
8	 Details of the highest authority 
responsible for implementation 
and oversight of the business 
responsibility policy (ies):
The Board oversees recommendations of the ESG Committee 
related to business responsibility. ESG Committee ensures
