Corporate Overview
At Rossari, sustainability isn’t just a component of our strategy-it’s the heart of everything we do. Guided by the principles of environmental 
stewardship, social responsibility, and strong governance, we are committed to creating value that extends beyond business performance. 
In a world where challenges are shared and interconnected, we see sustainability not as a trend, but as a strategic lever for long-term success.
Our ESG journey is anchored in three key pillars:-
	  Environmental Stewardship: We are actively reducing our ecological footprint through energy-efficient operations, adoption of 
renewable energy, water recycling, and responsible waste management-driving meaningful progress in resource conservation.
	   Social Commitment: By nurturing a diverse and inclusive workplace, prioritising employee well-being, investing in community 
development, and upholding ethical labor practices, we aim to create positive social impact at every level of our operations.
	   Governance Excellence: With a strong foundation of ethics, transparency, compliance, and risk management, we ensure every decision 
reflects integrity and accountability.
For us, sustainability is more than a responsibility-it’s a catalyst for innovation, efficiency, and stakeholder trust. Our ESG initiatives not only 
enhance our brand equity but also forge stronger partnerships and unlock new opportunities for sustainable leadership.
As we move forward in an evolving global environment, we remain steadfast in our belief: sustainability is a collective responsibility and the 
most powerful path toward a resilient, inclusive, and prosperous future.

1.
Energy 
management 
and GHG 
emissions
 
 
Risk: 
At Rossari, we acknowledge that energy 
consumption is a significant driver of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 
recognise climate change as a growing 
concern among regulators and external 
stakeholders. The global community is 
united in addressing the challenges posed by 
climate change, which is increasingly evident 
through rising physical and transition risks. If 
not managed effectively, these risks have the 
potential to disrupt business operations.
The transition to a low-carbon economy 
also brings a range of regulatory and 
market-related challenges-including shifting 
consumer preferences and an evolving policy 
landscape. In response, we are committed to 
adopting responsible and forward-thinking 
practices that not only mitigate these risks 
but also ensure long-term value creation for 
our stakeholders and the environment.
Opportunity: 
At Rossari, we believe that developing and 
offering sustainable products and services 
allows us to meet the growing demand for 
environmentally responsible solutions while 
unlocking new revenue opportunities. By 
harnessing renewable energy sources and 
implementing energy-efficient practices, 
we aim to achieve meaningful cost savings, 
enhance operational efficiency, and reduce 
our reliance on non-renewable energy.
This proactive approach not only contributes 
to lowering our greenhouse gas emissions 
but also improves overall resource efficiency. 
By embedding sustainability into our core 
operations, we are positioning ourselves 
as a forward-thinking industry leader-
strengthening our brand reputation and 
sharpening our competitive advantage in an 
evolving global market.
(a)	
We 
have 
implemented 
the 
following practices to tackle the risks 
associated with GHG Emissions:
	
1. 	
Adoption of green initiatives 
to reduce carbon footprints.
	
2. 	
To 
reduce 
dependency 
on non-renewable energy 
sources, we have adopted 
the use of renewable energy-
primarily solar power-in our 
manufacturing facilities. Solar 
panels have been installed at 
our manufacturing facilities 
as part of this initiative.
	
3. 	
Active participation in tree 
plantation 
programmes 
around the vicinity of our 
Plant Locations.
	
4. 	
Replacement of conventional 
lighting with LED lights across 
all our plants.
	
5. 	
Additionally, we introduced 
automated cooling towers 
and variable frequency drive 
panels, leading to a reduction 
of electrical consumption.
	
6.	
Motion sensors have also 
been 
implemented 
in 
unmanned areas, such as 
the canteen and corridors, to 
minimise energy wastage.
(b) 	 Integrate 
climate 
change 
considerations into our long-term 
strategies 
and 
decision-making 
processes.
(c) 	
We prioritise energy conservation, 
aim to expand our renewable 
energy footprint, explore alternative 
water 
sources, 
work 
towards 
achieving water neutrality, and 
strive to reduce emissions across our 
operations and logistics.

Water 
Stewardship
Opportunity:
At Rossari, we are committed to strengthening 
our water management practices by focusing 
on water efficiency through recycling, 
reuse, and process optimisation. We are 
also investing in advanced water treatment 
technologies that ensure responsible water 
stewardship.
Our approach includes active collaboration 
with local authorities and industry groups 
to enhance water stewardship and drive 
meaningful impact. We place strong emphasis 
on corporate responsibility by pursuing 
relevant certifications, developing eco-friendly 
products, and proactively managing water-
related risks. Through water conservation 
initiatives, we aim to realise significant cost 
savings. Additionally, our focus on wastewater 
innovation, and leadership in sustainable 
water practices positions us as a responsible 
and future-ready organisation.
Positive
3.
Waste 
management
 
Risks: 
At Rossari, we recognise that waste 
management 
presents 
several 
critical 
risks, 
including 
environmental 
damage 
from improper disposal, health and safety 
concerns, and potential legal and financial 
repercussions arising from regulatory non-
compliance. Inadequate waste handling 
not only threatens the environment but can 
also harm our reputation and disrupt our 
operations.
We 
also 
acknowledge 
the 
broader 
challenges posed by insufficient waste 
disposal infrastructure and the contribution 
of waste to climate change. As a responsible 
organisation, we are committed to adopting 
effective waste management practices that 
align with regulatory standards, minimise 
our environmental footprint, and support 
long-term operational sustainability.
(a)	
To mitigate waste management 
risks, we focus on regulatory 
compliance, waste minimisation, 
and proper waste segregation.
(b)	
We have developed strict protocols 
for hazardous waste, promote 
recycling and reuse, and invest 
in advanced waste treatment 
technologies.
(c)	
Our 
Company 
opts 
for 
pre-
processing 
or 
co-processing 
methods for the disposal of 
hazardous 
waste 
instead 
of 
incineration, 
ensuring 
that 
hazardous and toxic waste is treated 
and disposed of responsibly and 
in a way that promotes circularity. 
Additionally, 
we 
consistently 
strive to use primarily sustainable 
packaging materials that can be 
regularly reused or recycled.

waste management as a key pillar of our 
sustainability strategy. By reducing waste 
generation, recovering valuable resources,

practices also help us ensure compliance 
with environmental regulations, mitigating 
legal and reputational risks, and strengthen 
our commitment to responsible operations.
Our 
approach 
not 
only 
minimises 
environmental impact but also supports the 
transition to a circular economy by reducing 
pollution and enhancing resource efficiency. 
In doing so, we strengthen our reputation as 
a sustainable and trustworthy organisation, 
building lasting confidence among our 
stakeholders.

Chemistry 
(Product 
Innovation)
Opportunity: 
At Rossari, we are well-positioned to 
meet the growing demand for green and 
sustainable products, backed by our state-
of-the-art research and development center. 
We strongly believe in the transformative 
potential of green chemistry to deliver 
environmental, social, and economic benefits. 
Our approach emphasises the use of bio-
based raw materials, reducing reliance on 
petroleum-derived inputs, lowering carbon 
emissions, and supporting the principles of a 
circular economy.
Green Chemistry also plays a crucial role in 
conserving energy and natural resources 
while enhancing the efficiency, safety, 
and quality of our chemical products and 
processes. Through this commitment, we 
continue to foster innovation and drive 
sustainable progress across our operations.

7.	
Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements
Mr. Edward Menezes, Executive Chairman of the Company, oversees the 
sustainability initiatives.
At Rossari, sustainability is not a peripheral concern-it is central to our business 
strategy and long-term vision. We see Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
principles as key enablers of value creation, operational resilience, and stakeholder 
confidence. Our efforts go beyond compliance; they reflect our belief that responsible 
business is essential to sustainable growth.
We are advancing this vision by investing in environmentally responsible 
technologies, including the fermentation-based production of biosurfactants-part 
of our transition towards low-impact, high-performance green chemistry solutions. 
A major milestone in our journey has been the initiation of a product footprint 
study, allowing us to evaluate and reduce the environmental impact of our products 
throughout their lifecycle. These insights are shaping the science-aligned, data-
driven ESG targets that will guide our innovation agenda in the years ahead.
To ensure our priorities reflect both stakeholder expectations and global standards, 
we conducted a comprehensive materiality and gap assessment. This has informed 
the development of a structured ESG roadmap, offering a clear path toward short-, 
medium-, and long-term sustainability objectives.

Environmental stewardship is demonstrated through tangible actions-from GHG 
emissions management and energy efficiency to water conservation and circular 
waste practices. A flagship initiative is the creation of a 10-acre green belt adjacent 
to our manufacturing site developed in partnership with GIDC-which reflects our 
commitment to going beyond compliance and contributing to ecological restoration.
Equally important is our social commitment. We are expanding opportunities for 
economic inclusion by training and integrating underrepresented groups into our 
workforce, while strengthening our CSR programmes focused on education, healthcare 
access, and essential community services. Within the organisation, we continue to 
invest in employee wellbeing, safety, and professional growth, fostering a culture of 
innovation and inclusion.
We also recognise the evolving landscape of ESG risks-be it climate-related disruptions, 
supply chain vulnerabilities, digital security, or regulatory dynamics. Our response 
is proactive: strengthening governance systems, promoting transparency, and 
embedding ESG principles across all levels of decision-making.
Looking ahead, our focus is clear: to build a sustainable, inclusive, and future-ready 
enterprise, where business excellence and environmental responsibility go hand in 
hand. With a strong ESG foundation and an adaptive mindset, Rossari is poised to 
lead with purpose in the green transformation of the specialty chemicals sector.

a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing: (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes.
	
b. 	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably:
	
	
Approximately 14% of the entity’s inputs were sourced sustainably during the reporting period. As part of our ongoing 
commitment to sustainability, we actively seek to collaborate with suppliers who share our environmental and social responsibility 
values. This includes sourcing materials certified by recognised sustainability standards, engaging with suppliers that demonstrate 
verified environmental practices, and prioritising inputs from local or ethically responsible sources.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics 
(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
	
While end-of-life reclamation is not a standard practice, our Company has established a structured and compliant process to manage 
the reclamation of products under specific circumstances, including broken, damaged, expired, or returned goods, as well as reference 
and stability samples from Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC). The process begins with the receipt and meticulous 
documentation of returned products from warehouses, channel partners, and QA/QC departments, ensuring accurate records of each 
item. These materials undergo thorough verification to confirm batch numbers and quantities before being segregated based on 
predefined parameters such as quantity and packaging.
	
Printed materials, including literature, pack inserts, and carton boxes, are systematically defaced and handled as paper waste, either 
dispatched for co-processing/pre-processing as non-hazardous material or securely shredded for disposal. All disposal and dispatch 
activities require prior approval from authorised personnel, ensuring compliance with regulatory and environmental standards. 
Transportation is coordinated through authorised vendors to approved facilities, with weighment checks conducted before and after 
loading to maintain accountability. The process concludes with comprehensive documentation, including manifest forms and non-
returnable gate passes, to ensure full traceability of consignments.
	
This rigorous approach underscores our commitment to environmental responsibility and regulatory compliance, ensuring that 
returned and expired materials are managed sustainably and ethically.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection 
plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken 
to address the same:
	
The Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) is applicable to the entity’s activities. The waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan 
submitted to Central Pollution Control Board and all requirements have been met.

PRINCIPLE 4 - STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity:
	
The Company follows a structured and dynamic approach to identify and engage with its key stakeholder groups. This process involves 
recognising individuals, communities, organisations, or entities that have a direct or indirect influence on, or are impacted by, the 
Company’s operations, products, or decisions.
	
Stakeholder identification is not a one-time activity but an ongoing effort aligned with our strategic priorities and sustainability 
agenda. We continuously refine this process to ensure it reflects the evolving nature of our business and external environment.
	
To effectively identify and prioritise stakeholders, we evaluate them based on the following core attributes:
	
•	
Dependency: Stakeholders who are directly reliant on the Company’s operations, products, or services, or those on whom the 
Company depends to function efficiently.
	
•	
Responsibility: Stakeholders to whom the Company holds legal, ethical, commercial, or operational obligations.
	
We prioritise engagement with stakeholders based on their level of influence and the significance of their interest in our operations. 
This enables us to understand their expectations, address material concerns, and incorporate their feedback into strategic and 
operational decisions.
	
Regular interactions across formal and informal channels-such as meetings, surveys, consultations, feedback mechanisms, and 
collaborative initiatives-help us foster strong relationships and create long-term, shared value. Each stakeholder group plays a critical 
role in shaping our sustainability journey and business resilience.
	
The Company remains committed to building transparent, responsive, and mutually beneficial relationships with all stakeholder 
groups through continuous dialogue and collaboration.

address their specific needs. These needs are carefully assessed, and based on this evaluation, the Company undertakes a series of 
structured CSR projects. Our initiatives are designed to drive social transformation, particularly benefiting disadvantaged, vulnerable, 
and marginalised groups within the community.

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
At Rossari, we strongly believe that establishing effective mechanisms to receive and address consumer complaints and feedback is 
essential for maintaining customer satisfaction, building trust, and enhancing our products and services. Our consumers are of great 
value to us, and their feedback plays a crucial role in our continuous improvement efforts.
	
The mechanism for handling consumer complaints is as follows:
	
(a) 	 Upon receiving a complaint via email - accompanied by quality forms, documents, or photos - a technical manager is immediately 
assigned to investigate the matter. This includes conducting an onsite visit to assess the issue firsthand and take appropriate 
action.
	
(b) 	 The technical manager collects samples for laboratory analysis, ensuring a thorough examination of the problem and facilitating 
informed decision-making for an effective resolution.
	
(c) 	 The complaint email is also forwarded to the quality control (QC) Department to enable a collaborative approach to problem-
solving, ensuring that all relevant expertise is applied in resolving the issue.
	
(d) 	 Following a detailed analysis and examination, the issue is addressed, and necessary corrective actions are implemented if 
required.
	
By maintaining this structured approach and demonstrating a commitment to listening and responding to customer concerns, Rossari 
aims to strengthen customer relationships and drive continuous improvement in its products and services.
