Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)
PREFACE
Scarcity of natural resources, drastic climate change and societal imbalances are deep concerns knocking at the door of 
humanity. In the recent past at the time of COVID 19 we experienced how important it is for our human race to use available 
resources judiciously without disturbing the ecological balance. 
At Bharat Wire Ropes we see sustainability not as a goal to achieve but as a walk of life where we fulfil our present needs 
without compromising the needs of our future generation. We believe in contributing back to the society with utmost 
sincerity and governance. We aim to grow our business in a responsible manner, as we continue to respect the environment 
and strengthen our sustainability efforts. The world continues to change rapidly across multiple dimensions, leading to 
rapid evolution in the principles assessing businesses. The commitment of an entity to environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) principles with internal and external stakeholders has taken prominence. 
The new Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) paves the way for companies in India towards greater 
ESG disclosures, while generating a positive impact on the established ways for doing business. Its prime focus is on social 
empowerment, environment conservation, reduced inequality, sustainable processes and ethical business practices being 
the key factors of BRSR.
This report highlights our ESG approach, strategy, and disclosure on the basis of the BRSR template and guidelines. 
However, we believe ESG compliance and reporting is a small of-shoot of this sustainability journey, where we aim to 
rope-in all our stakeholders and value chain partners to contribute.

Water is a critical resource that's also 
scarce. Poor water management shall 
lead to misutilization of resource and 
adverse impact on environment.  
We are committed to effective and thorough 
management and oversight to conserve and 
recycle water whenever possible. Our company 
is dedicated to maximizing the efficient use of 
water resources. We adhere to a policy of 'zero 
liquid discharge' from our facilities, and all

Opportunity
We believe that a strong and fully embedded 
commitment to undertaking business ethically brings 
considerable benefits, including improved consumer 
perception (leading to increased loyalty), greater 
investment, reduced costs, and enhanced employee 
motivation involvement and interaction.
Our employees are the cornerstone of our business 
and operational success. Their dedication and 
performance are crucial to achieving our 
organizational goals and maintaining operational 
efficiency. As such, it is imperative that we 
recognize and address their needs and concerns 
proactively.
Our company is dedicated to supporting the well-
being and comfort of our employees by providing 
a range of comprehensive facilities such as 
Transportation Services, Canteen Services, Water 
Purification, Medical Facilities, Health and 
Wellness Programs and Funded Marathons etc. We 
believe that a supportive work environment 
enhances employee satisfaction and productivity, 
and as such, we have implemented several 
initiatives to meet the diverse needs of our 
workforce.
We acknowledge that technology plays a 
pivotal role in the de-carbonization of the 
steel industry. We are also convinced that 
achieving this goal will necessitate 
nurturing innovation from the early stages.
The disposal and management of solid waste present 
considerable challenges. Inadequate treatment of 
waste leads to a range of issues, including the 
decomposition of organic matter, which contributes 
to greenhouse gas emissions, and the persistence of 
single-use plastics that obstruct natural ecosystems.
Circularity is a plausible solution departing from the 
traditionally linear use-and-dispose paradigm. 
Hazardous and non-hazardous waste is formed in the 
steelmaking process are managed using an integrated 
strategy for efficient waste management, which 
considers environmental impact, social effects and 
commercial viability. We follow a widely accepted 
'waste management hierarchy which follows a 
'prevent reuse-recycle-dispose' value chain. 
We are cognizant of the fact that every individual 
brings a different and unique set of perspectives
and capabilities to our team. We strongly advocate 
against all kinds of discrimination and stand with 
our team in the event of any violation.
Customers are vital stakeholders in our 
organization. Ensuring their satisfaction 
drives market growth, expands our reach, 
and delivers value, ultimately benefiting the 
company. Customer satisfaction is crucial for 
enhancing our brand's reputation.

Our goal is to attain zero harm in all our

We are committed to providing a healthy and safe

premises and above all communities impacted by 
our operations. We have stringent safety systems 
in place to achieve our zero-harm vision.
