Supply Chain 
Management
Risk 
Dependency on specific 
suppliers or disruptions in the 
supply chain — whether arising 
from geopolitical tensions, 
natural disasters, fluctuations in 
commodity prices, transportation 
bottlenecks, vendor insolvency, 
or regulatory changes — can 
significantly impact operations. 
Hariom Pipe has implemented an 
integrated manufacturing approach, 
commencing from iron ore extraction 
and culminating in the production of 
MS Pipes and Scaffolding. This self-
sustained process not only strengthens 
supply chain resilience by minimizing 
external dependencies but also ensures 
streamlined efficiency in terms of cost and 
time.
Positive
2
Business Ethics and 
Transparency
Opportunity
Ethical governance reduces 
legal and reputational risks, 
strengthens stakeholder trust, and 
enhances operational efficiency. 
Our commitment to transparency 
builds investor confidence, 
ensures regulatory compliance, 
and deepens stakeholder 
relationships. Embedding these 
principles supports effective 
risk management and unlocks 
strategic opportunities, positioning 
us for long-term resilience.
Positive
3
Employee Retention and 
Talent Development
Opportunity
At Hariom Pipes, we cultivate a 
culture where continuous learning, 
growth, and mutual appreciation 
are at the heart of everything we 
do. Our unwavering commitment 
to skill-building and leadership 
development empowers our team 
to excel and is reflected in their  
loyalty and the strong sense of 
belonging they share.
Positive
4
Community Development Opportunity
We actively engage with local 
communities through our CSR 
initiatives, creating impact 
through education, health, and 
inclusivity. In doing so, we foster 
trust, goodwill, and enduring 
relationships that strengthen both 
our social footprint and our long-
term business success.
Positive
5
Climate Change
Risk
 Climate change presents a 
material risk to our operations, 
with increasingly frequent extreme 
weather events disrupting supply 
chains, damaging infrastructure, 
and driving up operational costs. 
Anticipated shifts in environmental 
regulations further heighten our 
exposure to non-compliance risks, 
while unchecked carbon emissions 
may result in penalties and 
reputational damage.
By adopting energy-efficient technologies, 
embracing cleaner production methods, 
and investing in carbon capture and 
storage solutions, we are actively shaping 
a more sustainable future while driving 
innovation and operational excellence.

Economic Performance
Opportunity
Strong economic performance 
enables us to reinvest in 
innovation, expand operations, and 
strengthen market presence. It 
enhances stakeholder confidence, 
attracts investment, and supports 
sustainable growth. Consistent 
financial stability also allows us to 
pursue long-term strategic goals, 
build resilience against market 
volatility, and deliver greater value 
to all stakeholders.
Positive
7
Regulatory Compliance
Risk
Evolving regulatory frameworks 
across environmental, labour, 
and governance domains pose 
compliance risks for Hariom Pipes. 
Non-adherence can lead to legal 
penalties, operational disruptions, 
reputational damage, and financial 
loss. 
We take a proactive approach to 
compliance by implementing robust 
management systems, conducting regular 
audits, and maintaining active engagement 
with regulatory authorities. These 
measures not only ensure adherence to 
evolving standards but also cultivate a 
culture of accountability and risk resilience 
across our operations.
Positive
8
Energy Management
Risk
Emissions from our operations 
pose a significant risk, especially 
as regulatory standards related to 
air pollution and carbon emissions 
continue to evolve. Our reliance 
on conventional energy sources 
heightens this challenge, making 
compliance with increasingly 
stringent norms more complex.
Our energy management strategy focuses 
on increasing energy efficiency and 
expanding the use of renewable energy. 
A key milestone is our Mahbubnagar GP 
Plant, which now operates entirely on 
solar power. We continue to streamline 
operations to reduce our carbon footprint 
and strengthen resilience to climate 
change.
Positive
9
Water & Effluent 
Management
Risk
A reliable and high-quality water 
supply is vital for ensuring smooth 
and uninterrupted operations. 
Water scarcity poses significant 
risks, including potential 
disruptions to production, 
increased operational costs, and 
health and safety concerns for 
both employees and surrounding 
communities.
Rainwater harvesting pits are used to 
capture and recharge groundwater, while 
our Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system 
promotes circular water use and minimizes 
wastage. Additionally, we have deployed 
a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant to treat and 
repurpose industrial wastewater for both 
domestic and operational needs, thereby 
significantly reducing dependence on 
groundwater sources.

Waste Management
Opportunity
Effective waste management 
offers Hariom the opportunity 
to reduce raw material costs, 
enhance resource efficiency, 
and strengthen compliance with 
environmental regulations. It also 
supports sustainable branding and 
aligns with the growing market 
demand for eco-friendly steel 
products, creating potential for 
long-term value creation.
Positive
11
Health & Safety
Risk
Given the nature of our operations, 
workplace safety is a critical risk 
area for Hariom. Exposure to heavy 
machinery, high temperatures, 
and industrial processes can 
lead to accidents, health issues, 
and operational disruptions if not 
managed properly.
We have implemented a comprehensive 
safety framework that includes specialised 
training, strict adherence to safety 
protocols, provision of appropriate 
PPE, and routine safety inspections. 
Ergonomically designed workstations, 
regular health surveillance, and clear 
communication of safety procedures 
further ensure employee well-being.
Positive
12
Training & Education
Opportunity
We invest significantly in training 
and education as a strategic 
opportunity to build a skilled, 
future-ready workforce. Through 
focused learning and development 
initiatives, we empower employees 
with leadership capabilities 
and technical expertise. This 
investment in talent development 
enhances productivity, fosters 
innovation, and creates a 
workplace where individuals feel 
valued.

industrial goods consumed in infrastructure and manufacturing. However, steel products have a high inherent recyclability, and post-use 
scrap eventually re-enters the steel recycling chain.

10	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
As part of our comprehensive waste management strategy, we leverage advanced technologies to minimize environmental impact 
and uphold circular economy principles. We actively contribute to the circular economy by prioritising the use of recycled materials, 
particularly scrap, in our steel production processes. This approach helps minimize our environmental footprint and reduces energy 
consumption across the value chain, enabling the production of steel in an environmentally responsible manner. While we generate 
minimal plastic and e-waste, all hazardous waste is managed responsibly and disposed of through Authorized vendors in compliance 
with regulatory standards.

and periodic safety drills ensure preparedness at all levels. Provisions for IT/data security, asset protection, and backup utilities strengthen 
resilience. The plan is aligned with statutory requirements and reviewed regularly to incorporate best practices. This proactive approach 
minimizes downtime, protects employees and assets, and secures reliable delivery of products to customers.
