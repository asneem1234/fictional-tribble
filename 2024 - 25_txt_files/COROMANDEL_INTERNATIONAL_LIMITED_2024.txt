There are forums for raising grievances including Works Committee, Welfare Committees, Safety 
Committees etc in Plant locations. Townhall meetings are held at a Company level (Chronicle) and

employee can directly call the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer at a specified number and 
time to raise any grievances.

management system has various aspects, including:

To address inherent hazards, Coromandel has implemented a comprehensive Process Safety Management System (PSMS) across 
all its manufacturing facilities. This system proactively identifies, assesses, and mitigates workplace risks to prevent incidents that 
could impact employees, communities, or the environment. Integrated into overall plant operations, PSMS encompasses the safe 
handling of hazardous chemicals and energy systems, including ammonia, sulphuric acid, high-pressure steam, instrument air, 
and vacuum. Safety Walks and Routine inspections are conducted on a weekly basis using checklists. This helps identify physical, 
chemical, mechanical, and ergonomic hazards. Safety Committee Meetings / Employee Feedback involves participation from shop-
floor workers to management so that the insights on routine tasks can be provided by workers.

Yes, we have introduced a new system called ‘’concern reporting’’, wherein the employees and workers can report unsafe condition 
and acts. Factory Medical Officers (FMO) help in monitoring the health status of workers exposed to hazardous substances. They 
help in identifying the trends in health issues (e.g., respiratory complaints) can indicate airborne contaminants etc. They help in 
evaluating fitness for work before assigning workers to high-risk or one-time tasks. Hazard related periodical checkups are carried 
out and accordingly job rotations are carried out as required.
d. 	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No) 
Coromandel provides employees with a well-rounded healthcare ecosystem—encompassing prevention, treatment of work-related 
health issues, and support for general medical needs—backed by insurance coverage. Employees have access to non‑occupational 
medical and healthcare services, in addition to comprehensive occupational health provision. The company maintains on-site 
occupational health centres staffed with paramedics and medical officers which is made available for employees and spouse for 
non-occupational medical and health care. The Company also maintains Medical Outreach centres which provides subsidised 
medical diagnosis and treatment.  Employees can also access mobile medical vans, and special camps etc across locations for 
non-occupational medical and healthcare services. BLOOM also enables as easy access for all employees to reach out for medical 
experts. In addition to the coverage, employees can top up their insurance policies. Over and above, Coromandel also supports 
employees with additional support through Corporate buffer where the Insurance coverage is exhausted.

Manufacturing of Sulphuric acid is exothermic in nature and 
generates excess heat. Coromandel utilizes the waste heat and 
converts it into a power
Power generation through waste 
heat recovery
2.
Desalination Plant
In 2023, Coromandel’s fertilizer plant at Vizag completed 
commissioning of 6 million litre per day desalination plant. It 
utilizes sea water for running its operations through removal 
of salt /TDS through semi permeable membrane under high 
pressure, making it an environment friendly alternative to raw 
water
Vizag unit has significantly 
reduced its water needs from 
conventional sources and 
improved water security for its 
plant operation
3.
Drone spraying 
operations
During the year, Coromandel has started drone spraying 
services and covered 2.2 lakh acres. With around 10l per acre 
water requirement, it can reduce the water usage in inputs
