1.
Customer Experience 
and Satisfaction
Risk
Customer 
satisfaction 
is essential for a theme 
park and hotel as it 
drives the reputation on 
a base level and hence 
it is a great opportunity 
for the Company. An 
unsatisfactory consumer 
experience may pose a 
risk to business continuity, 
while a positive customer 
experience can ensure 
enhanced 
profits 
and 
brand 
reputation. 
Also, 
positive 
guest 
experiences 
result 
in 
Revisit as well as a strong 
word of mouth opinion 
which is a powerful tool 
in drawing more guests 
as 
well 
as 
reducing 
marketing costs.
Imagicaa places a strong emphasis on customer satisfaction, 
beginning from the ticket booking stage and continuing 
throughout the guest journey. To maintain a high standard 
of guest experience, the Company implements the following 
practices:
-	
Trained call center staff are available to assist guests and 
encourage visits to the park.
-	
A dedicated team of Guest Relations Executives (GREs) 
is stationed at the park entrance to provide personalized

-	
A central safety committee, established in 2014, 
addresses and mitigates identified hazards to ensure a 
safe environment.
-	
Annual audits and certification of Health, Safety, and 
Environment (HSE) practices are carried out by BIS in 
accordance with ISO 45001:2018 standards.
-	
Further details on safety practices can be found at

2.
Product Quality and 
Safety
Risk
Significant 
efforts 
are 
required to keep the rides 
of the theme park safe, 
including 
maintenance, 
safety 
checks, 
repair 
work, and other on-site 
tasks. Proper precautions 
shall be taken to ensure 
health and safety is on 
track as it avoids the risk 
of several mishaps, fall 
accidents, fatality and 
injuries. 
Additionally, 
temporary 
employees 
can be at risk due to a 
lack of training or work 
experience. If health and 
safety are not protected, 
there may be fines and 
penalties; major events 
may result in acute injury 
and potential liabilities 
due to legal or regulatory 
actions.
Imagicaa maintains a strong commitment to safety through 
a robust and structured safety regimen, complemented by 
the achievement of significant milestones. The following 
practices reflect this dedication:
-

and attractions to ensure operational integrity.
-

Management System (OHSMS) certification under ISO 
45001:2018 standards.
-

throughout the premises.
-	
The Permit to Work (PTW) system has been effectively

3.
Energy Management
Risk
The 
hospitality 
and 
entertainment 
parks 
industry 
(especially 
theme parks) is typically 
energy-intensive, 
as 
energy 
is 
required 
to operate the rides, 
lighting, fireworks and 
other facilities. Decisions 
made by a firm regarding 
the energy intensity of 
its operations and the 
sources from which it 
obtains its energy may 
vary over time, impact 
the 
organization’s 
operating efficiency and 
risk profile.
Imagicaa continues to advance its commitment to 
sustainability through a range of in-house green initiatives 
aimed at optimizing operations and reducing environmental 
impact:
-	
The Company has introduced energy efficient measures 
across its rides and attractions to minimize overall 
energy consumption.
-	
An open access power agreement has been established 
for the procurement of 8 MW of renewable energy from 
solar and wind sources, currently meeting over 60% of 
the park’s total energy requirements.
-	
As part of its broader energy management strategy, 
the company has installed electric vehicle (EV) charging 
stations and motion-sensor lighting systems to promote 
energy efficiency and support green mobility.
 Negative
4.
Water and Waste 
Management
Risk
Typically, waste is 
generated as part of a 
company’s operations, 
maintenance of 
machinery, office 
administrative work 
and food discard. 
Improper waste handling 
may contribute to air 
pollution, climate change 
and various direct and 
indirect impacts on 
the ecosystem. It may 
also cause health and 
safety risks to personnel 
exposed to the waste. 
Non-compliance with 
waste management 
regulations may lead to 
the imposing of heavy 
fines.
In response to the accelerating impacts of climate change, 
Imagicaa has adopted proactive environmental practices to 
minimize its ecological footprint. These initiatives focus on 
efficient solid waste management, water conservation, and 
promoting recycling wherever feasible:
-	
Waste is segregated at the source using color-coded 
biodegradable bags and bins, categorized into dry, wet, 
and horticultural waste streams.
-	
Clearly marked and strategically placed waste bins are 
available throughout the park to encourage responsible 
waste disposal by guests and staff.
-	
Collected waste is systematically transported to 
a designated waste segregation yard for further 
processing.
-	
Wet waste is treated in an Organic Waste Converter 
(OWC) to generate nutrient-rich organic compost used 
for horticultural purposes.
-	
Environmentally harmful disposal methods such as open 
dumping, animal feeding, and landfilling are strictly 
avoided, aligning with sustainable waste management 
principles.
 Negative
5.
Innovation
Opportunity
The entertainment 
industry has the potential 
for unleashing innovation 
amongst various talents. 
Product design and 
innovation can assist 
theme parks to stay 
competitive and relevant 
in an everchanging 
market. By embracing 
new designs paired 
with technologies, 
theme parks can tap 
advantage of new market 
opportunities and boost 
customer experience.
Imagicaa’s 
management 
and 
promoters 
actively 
participate in trade fairs and industry events to engage 
with manufacturers, innovators, and technology providers, 
staying abreast of the latest trends and advancements.
Additionally, the leadership conducts regular ‘think tank’ 
sessions with senior team members and department 
heads (HODs) to collaboratively generate ideas and 
explore innovative concepts for implementation across all 
operational sites.
Positive
6.
Employee well-
being, training and 
Retention
Risk
Higher employee 
retention rates convey 
good company policies 
and practices. However, 
a high attrition rate 
indicates low employee 
satisfaction to investors. 
Ensuring employee 
well-being can boost 
employee morale and 
reduce hiring and 
onboarding costs.
Imagicaa places strong emphasis on employee well-being 
and is committed to implementing policies that support 
and empower its workforce:
-	
Group mediclaim insurance coverage is provided to all 
employees, ensuring access to quality healthcare.
-	
Regular skill development and training programs are 
conducted to enhance employee capabilities and foster 
career growth.
-	
Long-term service and loyalty are formally recognized 
and rewarded as a mark of appreciation.
-	
Flexible working hours and remote work options are 
offered, depending on the nature of the employee’s role 
and responsibilities.
-	
A structured internal transfer program is available for 
employees seeking to explore new roles or shift their 
professional focus within the organization.
