Financial Implications 
of the risk or the 
opportunity (Negative/ 
Positive) 
1.
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk Perspective: SMIL 
faces cost volatility due to 
fluctuating energy prices 
and reliance on non-
renewable sources. Global 
supply chain disruptions, 
geopolitical tensions, and 
natural disasters may further 
impact energy availability 
and production. Additionally, 
stricter international energy 
regulations increase the risk 
and legal liabilities in cases of 
non-compliance.
Opportunity Perspective: 
Early adoption energy-
efficient technologies, 
optimizing processes, and 
integrating renewable 
energy solutions can deliver 
substantial long-term cost 
savings. Improved energy 
management enhances 
production efficiency, reduces 
downtime, and boosts overall 
productivity. This shift aligns 
with SMIL’s sustainability 
commitment, strengthening 
its reputation with 
environmentally conscious 
customers, investors, and 
stakeholders.
Energy management means 
careful planning, monitoring, 
and control of energy use 
across the Company’s 
operations. The Company 
uses renewable energy 
sources such as solar and 
wind power. It has also added 
automatic systems to turn 
off power to large machines 
when they are not running. 
In addition, of financial 
penalties energy-saving 
equipment has been installed 
to help lower overall energy 
use.
These steps show the 
Company’s strong focus on 
improving environmental 
performance by using cleaner 
and more efficient methods.
Negative Financial 
Implications:
Ignoring energy 
inefficiencies increases 
operating costs and 
reduces profitability. 
Non-compliance with 
energy regulations risks 
fines, penalties, and 
reputational damage to 
SMIL.
Positive Financial 
Implications:
Implementing energy-
efficient technologies 
reduces utility bills 
and energy expenses, 
improving SMIL’s 
profitability. As energy 
costs rise, efficient 
energy management 
offers a competitive 
advantage and attracts 
environmentally 
conscious consumers 
and investors, enhancing 
brand value and market 
position.
2.
Physical 
impacts 
of climate 
change
Risk
Risk Perspective:
Climate change poses 
significant risks to Sharda 
Motor Industries Limited 
(SMIL) and the automotive 
sector. Its physical impacts—
such as extreme weather, 
resource shortages, 
rising energy costs, and 
infrastructure vulnerability—
threaten SMIL’s operations, 
supply chains, and business 
continuity. Additionally, 
shifting consumer preferences 
and potential liability issues 
increase these risks.
The Company addresses 
climate-related risks by 
identifying and evaluating 
weak points across its 
operations, facilities, and 
supply chains. It invests 
in infrastructure that can 
withstand climate impacts 
and reduces the risk of 
disruption by using a diverse 
network of suppliers and 
transport routes. Water 
conservation is also a priority, 
with recycling and reuse 
strategies in place. SMIL has 
adopted alternative energy 
sources such as solar and 
wind power to reduce its 
environmental footprint. 
In addition, the Company 
promotes sustainable 
practices across its value 
chain and uses water-saving 
technologies, including 
recycling and treatment 
systems, to achieve zero 
liquid discharge from
Negative Financial 
Implications:
Extreme weather and 
rising sea levels can cause 
costly damage to SMIL’s 
facilities. Climate-related 
supply chain disruptions 
may delay raw material 
delivery, slow production, 
and increase alternative 
sourcing costs. Insurance 
premiums are likely to rise 
due to heightened climate 
risks, raising operating 
expenses. Additionally, 
expenses for contingency 
planning and resilience 
measures to ensure 
business continuity will 
increase.

3.
Waste and 
Hazardous 
material 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk Perspective:
Improper waste handling can 
cause environmental harm, 
leading to regulatory fines 
and reputational damage. 
Waste management can 
be costly, especially when 
new systems are needed to 
meet standards. Mishandling 
hazardous materials risks 
workplace accidents, 
employee health issues, 
and increased liability and 
compensation costs.
Accidental releases may 
contaminate ecosystems 
and communities, resulting 
in legal and financial 
consequences. Compliance 
with strict hazardous material 
regulations is critical to avoid 
penalties.
Opportunity Perspective:
Effective waste management 
reduces disposal costs and 
optimizes resource use, 
leading to cost savings. 
Recycling can improve 
industrial efficiency and 
showcase environmental 
responsibility. Additionally, 
proper waste management 
helps meet environmental 
standards and strengthens 
community relations.
The Company ensures 
responsible waste disposal 
and recycling in line with 
environmental regulations. 
It promotes sustainable 
resource use by focusing 
on reduction, reuse, and 
recycling, supported by 
efficient waste management 
practices. Regular 
evaluations of waste and 
hazardous material handling 
help identify areas for 
improvement. The Company 
follows best practices for 
the safe handling, storage, 
and disposal of hazardous 
materials to protect both 
employee health and the 
environment.
Negative Financial 
Implications:
Poor waste management 
can result in higher 
costs, fines, and legal 
penalties. Implementing 
new systems to 
meet environmental 
regulations may increase 
capital expenditures in 
the short term. Hazardous 
material accidents can 
lead to medical costs, 
worker downtime, and 
legal claims, raising 
operational expenses. 
Environmental 
contamination from 
hazardous materials may 
also incur significant 
remediation and 
restoration costs for SMIL.
4.
Water 
Resilience
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective:
Focusing on water resilience 
enhances resource efficiency, 
conservation, and access 
to shared resources while 
preventing supply chain 
disruptions. Effective water 
management reduces 
exposure to risks like scarcity 
and regulatory limits, leading 
to lower operational costs 
and improved business 
sustainability.
The Company has adopted 
water-saving technologies 
and practices, including 
recycling plants and 
treatment systems, to 
use water more efficiently 
and ensure zero discharge 
outside its plant premises. 
Water risk assessments are 
carried out to identify weak 
points in operations and 
supply chains. The company 
uses a variety of water 
sources, such as rainwater 
harvesting, recycling, and 
local water initiatives. Strong 
monitoring and reporting 
systems are in place to 
track water use, improve 
efficiency, and provide 
transparency to stakeholders 
about the Company’s water 
management efforts.
Negative Financial 
Implications:
Water shortages or supply 
interruptions can disrupt 
production and increase 
costs for alternative 
sourcing or process 
adjustments. Rising 
water prices in scarce 
regions elevate operating 
expenses. Compliance 
with water regulations 
may require costly 
investments in water-
saving and treatment 
technologies.
Positive Financial 
Implications:
Efficient water use 
reduces operational costs 
and enhances business 
sustainability.

5.
Product 
design and 
safety
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective:
Effective product design and 
safety practices enhance 
customer satisfaction, brand 
reputation, and market 
competitiveness. Prioritizing 
safety and quality leads to 
reliable products that meet 
customer expectations and 
differentiate SMIL from 
competitors. Investing in 
robust design reduces recalls 
and safety incidents, saving 
costs related to liabilities and 
reputational damage.
The Company ensures 
environmentally responsible 
manufacturing and supply 
of all products, including 
Complete Exhaust Systems 
and Catalytic Converter 
Assemblies. Committed 
to product safety, it 
continuously invests in new 
technologies for innovation 
and enhancement. Industry 
shifts driven by climate 
change present opportunities 
to further invest in R&D, 
improving designs and 
creating more efficient, 
sustainable products.
Positive Financial 
Implications:
A reputation for safe 
products boosts customer 
loyalty, repeat purchases, 
and positive word-
of-mouth, increasing 
sales and market share. 
Avoiding recalls and 
safety incidents prevents 
costly expenses and 
legal fees. Emphasizing 
product safety and quality 
enhances SMIL’s brand 
value and distinguishes it 
as a trusted, responsible 
automotive manufacturer.

Risk Perspective:
Unethical supply chain 
practices, such as forced 
or child labor, can cause 
reputational damage and 
legal issues. Overreliance on 
single suppliers or sourcing 
from high-risk regions may 
disrupt operations due to 
geopolitical or natural events. 
Unsustainable sourcing 
increases environmental 
impact and SMIL’s carbon 
footprint.
Opportunity Perspective:
Building strong relationships 
with responsible suppliers 
improves collaboration, 
reliability, and long-term 
partnerships. Partnering 
with sustainability-focused 
suppliers fosters innovation 
in eco-friendly materials 
and processes, giving SMIL 
a competitive edge. A 
responsible supply chain 
enhances SMIL’s reputation 
with customers, investors, 
and stakeholders who 
prioritize sustainability.
The Company has established 
comprehensive sustainability 
and environmental, health, 
and safety policies to 
promote responsible sourcing 
across its value chain. 
These policies emphasize 
environmental sustainability 
and aim to minimize adverse 
impacts. By adhering to its 
Environment & Sustainability 
Policy, the Company fosters 
environmental awareness 
among partners and commits 
to procuring materials 
responsibly to reduce 
environmental harm.
Negative Financial 
Implications:
Shifting to responsible 
sourcing may increase 
complexity and 
administrative costs 
due to identifying 
and integrating new 
suppliers. Dependence 
on responsible suppliers 
could risk supply chain 
disruptions, causing 
production delays and 
revenue losses.
Positive Financial 
Implications:
Efficient supply chain 
management and 
responsible sourcing can 
reduce costs through 
optimized procurement, 
less waste, and better 
resource use. It lowers 
risks of non-compliance, 
legal issues, and 
disruptions, preventing 
financial losses. 
Responsible practices 
also enhance SMIL’s 
appeal to environmentally 
and socially conscious 
customers and investors.

Protection of 
Human Rights
Risk
Risk Perspective:
Human rights violations 
within SMIL or its supply 
chain can severely damage 
reputation, customer trust, 
and brand loyalty. Non-
compliance with labor 
laws or unethical practices, 
such as forced or child 
labor, may result in legal 
liabilities, reputational harm, 
and boycotts. Insufficient 
monitoring increases 
exposure to supply chain 
human rights risks. Lack 
of diversity and inclusion 
can lead to employee 
dissatisfaction, internal 
conflict, and higher turnover.
The Company has formulated 
a human rights policy that 
applies to all stakeholders, 
ensuring protection and 
respect for human rights 
through non-discrimination, 
zero tolerance for child labor, 
and equal opportunities for 
all. 
SMIL has implemented an 
effective grievance redressal 
mechanism, enabling 
employees and stakeholders 
to raise concerns related 
to human rights violations. 
The Company also provides 
training and awareness 
programs to promote a 
culture of respect for human 
rights and ethical behavior.
Additionally, SMIL enforces a 
supplier code of conduct that 
clearly sets expectations for 
suppliers on human rights, 
labor practices, and ethical 
standards.
Negative Financial 
Implications:
Human rights violations 
can lead to substantial 
regulatory and legal costs, 
loss of goodwill, increased 
employee turnover 
expenses, and reduced 
investments.
8.
Employee 
engagement 
and well being
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective:
Engaged and well-supported 
employees are more 
motivated and productive, 
enhancing organizational 
efficiency. A positive work 
environment reduces 
turnover, cutting recruitment 
and training costs, while 
attracting top talent seeking 
growth and well-being. 
Additionally, engaged 
employees foster innovation 
and creativity, driving 
continuous improvement 
and contributing to SMIL’s 
success.
The Company fosters a 
motivated workforce through 
employee engagement 
initiatives, recognizing that 
supporting individual growth 
directly contributes to its 
overall goals.
Positive Financial 
Implications:
Enhanced employee 
engagement fosters 
a positive workplace 
culture, leading to higher 
retention, reduced hiring 
costs, and lower training 
expenses. Promoting 
employee rights further 
boosts productivity and 
profitability.
9.
Labour 
Practices
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective:
Labour practices that ensure 
fair treatment, respect, and 
support foster a positive and 
inclusive work environment. 
This promotes employee 
satisfaction, productivity, 
and well-being. Emphasizing 
responsible labour 
practices aligns with SMIL’s 
commitment to corporate 
responsibility and enhances 
its reputation as an employer 
of choice.
Positive Financial 
Implication:
Efficient labour 
management boosts 
productivity and reduces 
absenteeism. Higher 
employee morale directly 
supports company growth 
and increases revenue 
streams.

Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Risk Perspective:
Poor health and safety 
practices can cause employee 
dissatisfaction, low morale, 
reduced productivity, and 
high turnover, increasing 
recruitment and training 
costs. Workplace accidents 
lead to higher compensation 
claims and financial strain. 
Non-compliance with health 
and safety regulations risks 
legal liabilities, penalties, 
and reputational damage. 
Ensuring employee health 
and safety is crucial to 
mitigating these risks and 
maintaining a positive work 
environment.
The Company provides 
regular, targeted safety 
training on protocols and 
equipment use. It enforces 
clear safety policies and 
procedures to ensure a safe 
work environment. Routine 
maintenance of machinery 
minimizes accident risks from 
equipment failure. Employee 
involvement is encouraged 
through safety initiatives, 
hazard reporting, and 
suggestions for improvement.
Positive Financial 
Implications:
A safe workplace reduces 
accidents and illnesses, 
lowering claims and 
insurance costs while 
boosting efficiency. 
This fosters employee 
satisfaction, reduces 
turnover, and results in 
cost savings and higher 
profitability.
Negative Financial 
Implications:
Occupational health and 
safety issues can lead to 
legal liabilities, increased 
insurance premiums, 
compensation claims, 
and lost productivity, all 
of which may significantly 
impact SMIL’s profitability 
and reputation.

We regularly conduct risk assessments, evaluations, and inspections

of fresh air. Our dedicated safety officers conduct daily inspections to 
promptly identify and address unsafe practices or conditions, enabling 
immediate corrective actions. Furthermore, we maintain a rigorous 
safety review process that continuously evaluates and improves our

employees.

encouraged to promptly communicate concerns to their respective 
plant heads, who then collaborate with department heads to 
implement timely and appropriate corrective measures. These actions 
aim to eliminate or reduce health and safety risks, demonstrating the 
Company’s commitment to maintaining a secure work environment. 
Furthermore, the Company fosters an open culture by encouraging 
hazard reporting and safety discussions during central department

b). promoting recycling and reuse to maximize resource efficiency; and 
c). ensuring conscientious disposal methods. 
The Company emphasizes source reduction by refining manufacturing processes to minimize material 
waste and limit the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous substances. Wherever possible, 
recyclable materials are segregated and sent to specialized recycling facilities. Scrap and waste 
raw materials from our operations are transported offsite to these plants rather than being recycled 
onsite. In addition to this, the Company has implemented a comprehensive approach to minimize the 
use of hazardous and toxic chemicals, including stringent hazardous waste management, controlled 
use of chemicals, and ongoing employee training. 
The Company encourages its suppliers and vendors to adopt sustainable procurement practices, 
such as reducing packaging and enhancing recycling capabilities, to minimize waste generation and 
waste to landfill at the end, as part of its sustainable procurement journey.
