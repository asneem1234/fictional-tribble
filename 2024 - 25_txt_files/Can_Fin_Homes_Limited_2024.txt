Safeguarding customer

severe consequences, 
such as identity theft 
and financial loss for 
customers. Neglecting 
this issue could lead 
to reputational harm, 
financial risks, and

breaches can lead to significant 
costs, including investigation 
expenses, customer notifications, 
legal fees, and regulatory fines. 
Operational disruptions may 
result in productivity loss and 
potential customer departure.

and investigations. Enhanced 
cybersecurity measures may 
require additional investments.

The Company operates primarily from leased office premises across various locations. Thus, it does not have operational control over the water 
infrastructure, including discharge and treatment systems, which are managed by the respective property owners or facility managers. Furthermore, 
the business activities of the Company are limited to providing financial services. Consequently, specific data on water discharge (including quantity 
and quality) is not available at this time.
	
The Company remains committed to sustainability and will continue to engage with property managers to explore feasible ways to monitor and 
report environmental metrics relevant to its operations in the future and conserve water.

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.	
	
The Company is a service-centric entity, prioritizes customer service and satisfaction. To this end, measures have been 
implemented to enable customers to easily share feedback and complaints.

Ministries. The Grievance Redressal Department, situated at the Registered Office, is tasked with managing these 
grievances.
	
Grievance Redressal Mechanism - Key Highlights
	
Escalation Matrix:
	
If the customers have any grievances, they can contact their home branch for quick resolution of grievance. If the branches 
fail to resolve the grievance or the customer is dissatisfied with the resolution offered, they can update their grievance into 
the Grievance Redressal Portal (`Portal’) at the official website of the Company viz., www.canfinhomes.com - a state-of-
the-art web-based system. The Portal will record and categorize grievances into different types and maintain turnaround 
times (TAT) for specific category(ies)/sub-category(ies). The customers can file their complaints in the following ways:
	
A)	
The grievance can be lodged in CFHL online web-portal https://www.canfinhomes.com/ Grievance.aspx or

Verification of customer credentials, and customer information security: Customers posting complaints from 
the website need to authenticate their customer credentials via the details submitted by the customers on the portal, 
like loan number, e-mail ID and mobile number. Thereafter, the complaints of verified customers are automatically 
uploaded to the Online Web-Portal. Responses to customer complaints are sent to the registered e-mail ID’s to 
ensure customer information security. 
B)  	 Complaint ID acknowledgement mail and advisory to customers:  Soon after uploading the complaint to the 
Company’s Centralized Online web-portal, instant acknowledgement E-mail / SMS is sent to the complainant’s 
registered E-mail ID & Mobile Number with a unique Grievances Reference Number.

to the customer. The Company has a four-tier escalation mechanism/matrix for customer grievances as follows:
