(R/O)
Risk - High capital costs for 
upgrading to energy-efficient 
systems pose a key challenge. 
Shifting regulations may affect 
the effectiveness of current 
efficiency measures. Ageing 
water infrastructure risks include 
leaks, poor distribution, and 
increased operational costs. 
Non-compliance could lead to 
legal penalties and restricted 
operations.
Opportunity: Investing in 
energy-efficient technologies can 
yield long-term cost savings by 
reducing utility expenses and 
often recovering initial 
investments. Similarly, efficient 
water management helps 
conserve scarce resources, 
particularly in water-stressed or 
highly regulated regions. 
Adoption of water-saving 
technologies can lower water 
and wastewater costs, improving 
overall operational efficiency.
Risk: Raw material costs can 
fluctuate significantly due to 
various factors, including supply 
and demand dynamics, 
geopolitical developments, 
weather conditions impacting 
agriculture, and fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates. Supply 
chain disruptions are more likely 
when raw material sources are 
limited by specific suppliers or 
geographic regions.
Risk: Risk to product quality can 
arise from poor manufacturing 
processes, equipment failures, or 
human errors. Inadequate 
maintenance, insufficient 
process controls, or lack of 
training can lead to defects, non-
compliance with specifications, 
or safety incidents. Substandard 
product design or inadequate 
testing of new raw material 
variants may result in product 
failures or recalls.
Opportunity: Customers tend to 
trust and remain loyal when 
products consistently meet safety 
The Company has implemented 
energy-saving systems, including 
Variable Frequency Drives 
(VFDs), to optimise power usage. 
It utilises renewable energy by 
repurposing sugarcane bagasse 
as boiler fuel for cogeneration, 
converting waste into electricity. 
Effluent water is treated using 
aerobic digesters to achieve zero 
liquid discharge. Notably, the 
Company has maintained strict 
environmental compliance, with 
no incidents of groundwater or 
surface water contamination.
The sugar unit sources 100% of 
its sugarcane from farmers, while 
the distillery obtains its entire raw 
material, molasses, from sugar 
mills.
The Company ensures that all 
product information displayed, 
including food safety instructions 
on labels, is reviewed for 
accuracy in accordance with 
applicable regulations. The 
Company also implements 
process quality checks, employee 
training, and routine audits to 
ensure product quality and safety 
compliance.
Positive: Energy-saving 
initiatives often yield rapid 
returns on investment, with 
many delivering a short 
p a y b a c k  p e r i o d .  T h i s  
contributes to enhanced cash 
flow and greater financial 
stability for both businesses and 
individuals. Proactively 
managing water resources also 
helps mitigate the risk of 
penalties and fines arising from 
regulatory non-compliance.
Negative: Upgrading to 
energy-efficient technologies or 
enhancing energy efficiency in 
buildings and operations often 
requires a significant initial 
investment.
Negative: Weather patterns, 
supply-demand dynamics, 
geopolitical events, and global 
economic conditions can lead 
to significant fluctuations in raw 
material costs. Unforeseen 
price increases may impact 
competitiveness by driving up 
production costs, reducing 
profit margins, or forcing 
businesses to pass on costs to 
customers.
Positive: Improving product 
quality and safety helps reduce 
costs associated with defects, 
rework, returns, and claims. By 
minimizing these expenses, 
b u s i n e s s e s  c a n  b o o s t  
profitability and optimize 
r e s o u r c e  m a n a g e m e n t .
Negative: Implementing 
stringent quality control and 
safety procedures requires 
significant investment in 
infrastructure, skilled labor, 
and testing equipment. These 
upfront costs can strain 
budgets.

Risk: Inadequate training and the 
lack of proper safety regulation 
implementation can lead to 
workplace accidents and 
injuries. Prolonged exposure to 
hazardous substances, poor 
ergonomics, or repetitive tasks 
can result in long-term health 
issues, including respiratory 
ailments, musculoskeletal 
disorders, and other occu-
pational health problems.
Risk: Employee burnout can 
occur when high levels of 
engagement and development 
activities are not balanced with 
sufficient downtime and 
recovery. Burnout negatively 
affects retention, morale, and 
productivity. Employees may 
become resistant to new projects 
or organizational changes, 
particularly if they perceive these 
changes as threatening job 
security or disrupting their 
routines.
O p p o r t u n i t y :  E n g a g e d  
employees who feel valued and 
have opportunities for growth 
are more likely to remain with the 
company. Reduced turnover 
leads to savings in hiring, 
onboarding, and training costs. 
Employee engagement drives 
higher productivity and 
improved job performance, as 
motivated and committed 
workers tend to be more 
successful.
The company provides training 
programs in Health and Safety. It 
is certified under OHSMS - ISO 
45001:2018 (Occupational 
Health and Safety management 
system) and has implemented 
c o m p r e h e n s i v e  s a f e t y  
management systems in the 
workplace. Additionally, the 
company has an On-Site 
Emergency Plan and a Major 
Emergency Control Plan, both 
approved by regulatory 
authorities.
The Company conducts regular 
employee surveys to assess 
engagement and well-being and 
uses the results to inform policies. 
Training and development 
programs are structured with 
periodic evaluations and 
f e e d b a c k  m e c h a n i s m s .  
Managers are trained to identify 
burnout risks and promote work-
life balance through flexible 
scheduling and workload 
planning.
N e g a t i v e :  W o r k e r s '  
compensation claims, covering 
m e d i c a l  e x p e n s e s ,  
rehabilitation costs, and wage 
replacement benefits, arise 
from job-related injuries or 
illnesses. Noncompliance with 
occupational health and safety 
regulations can lead to fines, 
penalties, and legal expenses. 
Violations may result in 
sanctions from regulatory 
bodies, and legal costs may 
escalate if injured workers or 
their families pursue lawsuits.
Positive: Motivated and 
engaged employees generally 
deliver higher productivity in 
their roles. When employees 
have growth opportunities and 
feel valued, their dedication 
and productivity are likely to 
rise. Increased output per 
worker enhances overall 
p r o d u c t i v i t y ,  d r i v i n g  
operational efficiency and 
reducing costs per unit of 
output.
Negative: Engaged employees 
who are provided with growth 
opportunities become more 
valuable to employers. 
Employee turnover costs, 
including hiring, onboarding, 
and lost productivity during 
transitions, arise when 
employees leave the company 
after completing training or 
development programs.

(R/O)
Risk: Businesses dependent on 
suppliers for components, 
finished goods, or raw materials 
face risks such as supplier 
bankruptcy, poor quality, 
d e l a y e d  d e l i v e r i e s ,  o r  
unexpected price changes. 
Subpar supplier performance 
c a n  d i s r u p t  p r o d u c t i o n  
schedules, leading to inventory 
shortages and dissatisfied 
customers. External factors like 
trade disputes, natural disasters, 
geopolitical events, or public 
health crises, such as pandemics, 
can further disrupt global or 
regional supply chains.
Risk: Fraud, corruption, and 
environmental violations are 
ethical breaches that can 
severely damage a company's 
reputation. Violating ethical 
standards may lead to fines, 
penalties, and regulatory 
consequences. Breaching laws 
related to consumer rights, 
environmental protection, 
bribery, or discrimination can 
result in costly legal actions and 
reputational harm.
100% of the suppliers have been 
assessed by the audit for health & 
safety conditions.
Robust policies and mechanisms 
must be established to foster a 
culture of integrity and ethical 
conduct, while addressing 
emerging risks and challenges. 
The organization remains 
committed to conducting all 
operations with the highest 
standards of honesty, integrity, 
governance, ethics, and 
transparency, ensuring full 
compliance with all relevant laws 
and regulations.
Negative: Ineffective inventory 
m a n a g e m e n t ,  s u c h  a s  
overstocking and stockouts, can 
tie up working capital and 
increase storage costs. 
Stockouts result in missed sales 
opportunities and reduced 
revenue, while excess inventory 
consumes capital that could be 
better allocated elsewhere.
Negative: Legal and regulatory 
violations often go hand in 
hand with breaches of ethical 
standards. Businesses involved 
in investigations, litigation, or 
settlements may incur fines, 
penalties, and legal costs.

The company adopts a sustainable approach to waste management and energy efficiency by repurposing 
by-products and optimizing processes:
1.
Spent wash is treated using an anaerobic digestion process in a biogas plant, generating biogas that 
is utilized as boiler fuel, reducing reliance on conventional energy sources.
2.
The introduction of Falling Film Evaporators has significantly enhanced operational efficiency by 
minimizing steam usage. This has led to lower bagasse consumption and a measurable reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to better resource utilization and environmental 
sustainability.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in 
your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes
During the sugar and distillery operations, various residues and by-
products are generated, which the company effectively repurposes to 
support sustainable practices:
1.
Bagasse and spent wash are primarily utilized as fuel in co-
generation plants and incinerators, contributing to in-house energy 
generation.
2.
A portion of bagasse is also deployed in vacuum filters as part of the 
production process.
3.
Industrial effluent (spent wash) undergoes anaerobic biological 
treatment in bioreactors. The biogas produced through this process is 
used as an alternative fuel in boilers, significantly reducing 
dependence on fossil fuels like furnace oil for steam generation.
4.
All waste generated remains within the permissible discharge limits 
prescribed by the Central and State Pollution Control Boards 
(CPCB/SPCB), ensuring regulatory compliance and environmental 
responsibility.

Essential Indicators
Describe the mechanisms 
in place to receive and 
respond to consumer 
complaints and feedback. 
The Company has a comprehensive customer complaint management process in place to 
ensure timely redressal and continuous improvement.
Customer complaints-whether verbal or written-can be submitted via phone, email, or in 
person. Once received, the Sales Department at the Head Office logs the complaint and 
notifies the relevant Unit Head, Process Head, and Quality Assurance (QA) Head. All 
complaints are recorded in the complaint register and categorized based on severity-
Critical, Major, or Minor. Root cause analysis is conducted, and corrective action is initiated 
based on the complaint type.
The QA Head is responsible for determining the need for a formal investigation and 
assigning it to a designated investigator. The assigned investigator must complete and 
document the investigation promptly. The QA Head monitors the progress of the 
investigation and the implementation of corrective measures.
Customer Feedback Analysis:
Annually, customer feedback forms are circulated and collected within a month. Feedback is 
analyzed based on specific attributes and scored as follows: 1 (Poor), 2 (Fair), 3 (Good), 
and 4 (Excellent). A score of 3 identifies areas needing improvement, while scores below 2 
trigger corrective action. Feedback with poor ratings is escalated to senior management for 
appropriate action and resolution.
In addition, the Company regularly designs, updates, and communicates Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) to meet food safety and quality standards across all units.
