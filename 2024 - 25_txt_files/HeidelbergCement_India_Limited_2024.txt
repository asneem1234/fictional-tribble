Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues 
 
 
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to 
adapt or mitigate the risk along with its nancial implications, as per the following format:
Emissions management is a material risk for any 
manufacturing enterprise due to its potential impacts on 
regulatory compliance, reputation, nancial performance, 
and operational continuity. Inadequate management can 
lead to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, 
increased costs, and disruptions, making it a critical 
concern in an environmentally conscious and regulated 
landscape.
Limestone constitutes a primary raw material in cement 
production and necessitates fossil fuel for its combustion 
during the manufacturing process. As a result of this 
process, CO2 emissions are generated through both the 
calcination of limestone and the fuel combustion. Such 
emissions potentially contribute to global warming, 
thereby exerting the potential to inuence business 
continuity and even precipitate disruptions.
The Company is meticulously 
planning and implementing 
various measures, including 
transitioning to renewable 
energy sources, increasing 
power generation from waste 
heat recovery generation 
system, and investing in 
alternative fuels handling & 
storage facility to increase 
Thermal Substitution Rate 
(TSR). The above measures

Non-compliance with health and safety regulations can

liabilities. Moreover, such incidents can adversely affect 
employee morale, impact the company's culture, and 
make it challenging to retain skilled staff and attract new 
talent. The Company may also face reputational risk.
The Company is committed to 
conducting its operations with 
a "Zero Harm" approach, 
prioritizing the well-being of all 
stakeholders and maintaining 
a safe working environment. 
This commitment involves 
stringent safety measures,

Heidelberg Materials Group has formulated Anti-Corruption Guidelines, and the Company has adopted the same. One of 
the goals of the Heidelberg Materials Group’s compliance program is to prevent corrupt behavior by Group companies 
and employees. Sections 2.3-2.5 of the Code of Business Conduct (“Anticorruption”, “Gifts, hospitality and benefits”, 
“Conflicts of interest”) set forth general anticorruption principles. This Guideline is part of the Group compliance program 
and gives guidance to employees by providing additional details. The Guidelines apply to all companies of Heidelberg 
Materials Group. This Guideline not only prohibits corrupt practices punishable under relevant penal laws but also 
addresses conflict of interest issues and prohibits unethical behavior, even if such conduct is not a punishable criminal 
offence. This approach is based on the principle that it is important to avoid even the suggestion that a business or 
governmental decision might have been influenced by the acceptance or granting of an advantage, be it personal or for 
any third party. The Company has also implemented a Code of Conduct that requires the employees to act with high 
standards of personal and professional ethics, integrity and ensure strict compliance with the applicable laws. You can

SAFE
Essential Indicators
1. Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity, 
respectively.
2. a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? Yes
 
 
The Company has systems in place for sustainable sourcing of materials and their transportation. Limestone is the 
primary raw material for manufacturing of cement. The Company uses latest mining techniques to stay cost effective 
in its operations and avoid wastage. The transportation of limestone from Patheria mines to Narsingarh Clinkerisation 
plant is done in a sustainable manner via 21 km long Overland Belt Conveyor (OLBC). Despite being capital intensive, 
OLBC has proven advantage over conventional road transportation when it comes to reducing carbon footprint and 
at the same time it reduces logistics cost. In order to optimize and thereby conserve Limestone, the Company has 
been producing mainly blended cement, i.e. producing more cement from every ton of clinker it produces. 
Consequently, the life of the mines is also getting extended. With a belief that sustainable transportation is attained 
through less polluting and fuel-efficient transportation mix, most of the inward transported bulk material are by rail 
and fuel-efficient transportation mix, most of the inward transported bulk material are by rail.
 
 
The Company has long term agreements with thermal power plants to ensure uninterrupted supply of fly ash. The 
Company ensures maximum consumption of fly ash including wet fly ash, to the extent possible within the 
permissible norms laid down by Bureau of Indian Standards. 
 
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 
 
100% of inputs were sourced Sustainably. Further for all the major purchases such as coal, petcoke, gypsum, fly ash, 
sweetener, and equipment spares and services are sourced sustainably. The company utilizes the SAP-Ariba 
platform as the guided buying, sourcing, and contracting tool, enabling stakeholders to conduct their sourcing 
activities digitally. Additionally, the company has implemented SAP ERP to ensure a robust procure-to-pay process 
for all purchases.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. 
 
The Company maintains an unwavering commitment to workforce safety, actively encouraging employees to adhere 
to established health and safety programs and protocols. Each plant is supported by a designated Plant Safety 
Officer who oversees compliance and promotes a proactive safety culture.
 
Although rare, process-related hazards may occur during operational periods—most often resulting from 
inadvertent unsafe actions. To mitigate these risks and uphold safety standards, all manufacturing plants are ISO 
45001:2018 certified for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems, endorsed by TUV SUD South Asia 
Private Limited.
 
External safety audits are conducted annually by TUV auditors, complemented by semi-annual internal audits. 
Additionally, top management—including the Managing Director (MD), Director of Technical (DT), and Technical 
Cluster Head (TCH)—conducts safety observation rounds during their plant visits, accompanied by the respective 
Plant Managers &HoDs. These visits provide an opportunity for direct engagement with the workforce and reinforce 
leadership’s commitment to a strong safety culture.
 
The Head of Safety conducts quarterly safety inspections across all facilities and submits detailed inspection reports 
to the respective Plant Managers to ensure timely compliance and corrective action.
 
For any maintenance work, authorized employees are required to obtain a Permit to Work. It is imperative that all 
equipment guards and protective measures are properly reinstated before the permit is closed, as overlooking this 
step may lead to potential hazards.
 
To sustain safety awareness and momentum throughout the year, the Company has implemented the following 
Health and Safety initiatives:
 
• Monthly safety gate meetings
 
• Monthly safety themes and communications
 
• Plant Safety Star Award programme conducted once every four months
 
• Strict adherence to Safety Cardinal Rules
 
• Safety zone system with hazard identification and risk assessment controls
 
• Defined work permit procedures
 
• Routine safety inspections and audits
 
• Fire prevention and protection systems
 
• Reporting of accidents and near-miss incidents
17
Annual Report 2024-25
 
• Investigation to identify root causes and implement safety measures
 
To further strengthen transparency and encourage proactive reporting, the Company has launched the SafetyAssure 
app. This digital platform enables employees to report near misses-including unsafe behaviors and hazardous 
conditions-in real time, thereby facilitating timely corrective actions and reinforcing the safety culture across all 
plants.
 
When a near miss or safety-related event is reported, the incident learnings are promptly disseminated across all 
locations to ensure similar risks are assessed and mitigated. This cross-plant knowledge-sharing promotes 
collective responsibility and continuous improvement.
 
In cases where Safety Cardinal Rules are violated, a formal warning letter is issued to the responsible engineer or 
manager. This action reinforces behavioral accountability and helps prevent recurrence of such incidents.
 
Workers and contractors are required to strictly follow the Company's Safety Cardinal Rules and wear appropriate 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The following rules are mandatory across all plants:
 
• All PPE required for a specific task must be used correctly and consistently.
 
• Prior to performing any task, equipment must be isolated from all energy sources and verified to prevent
 
accidental activation.
 
• Necessary safeguards must be implemented before equipment is re-started or returned to service.
 
• Only competent personnel, with a valid work permit signed by the designated superior, are permitted to enter
 
confined spaces.
 
• All workplace issues must be reported, investigated for root causes, and addressed through corrective actions
 
and lessons learned.
 
• All drivers must follow traffic safety norms in strict compliance with local laws and Company regulations.
 
Further Health & Safety requirements are defined in the Company’s Group guidelines and detailed in plant-specific 
documents, which are periodically reviewed and updated. Non-compliance with these rules is taken seriously across 
all plants.
 
The Company is committed to conducting its business in a manner that causes no harm to individuals, and 
continually strives to establish a healthy and safe working environment. With these systems in place, senior 
leadership engagement and active involvement ensure a culture of safety and wellbeing across all operations

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases 
 
In order to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases, the company 
has established mechanisms aimed at ensuring a fair and unbiased resolution process. One such mechanism is the 
inclusion of external members in the decision-making committee. These external members bring an objective 
unbiased perspective and help maintain the integrity of the proceedings. Any complaint received is investigated 
promptly and thoroughly.
 
In matters related to POSH where the complaint remains unresolved by the internal POSH committee, the option of 
litigation is available. This serves as an additional safeguard to protect the rights and well-being of the complainant. 
Litigation provides a formal avenue for seeking legal remedies and addressing any adverse consequences that may 
have resulted from the discrimination or harassment.
 
By incorporating external members, the company demonstrates its commitment to address discrimination and 
harassment cases thoroughly and transparently. These measures are designed to ensure that the complainant is duly 
supported and protected against victimisation. 
 
To deal with issues other than Sexual Harassment incidents, Heidelberg Materials Group has  established a 
compliance hotline known as “Speak Up” which can be used by any employee/ vendor of any of the subsidiaries of 
Heidelberg Materials group to anonymously report compliance incidents. In line with the group policy, HCIL has also 
extended this facility to its employees/ vendors for reporting compliance incidents.  This platform ensures that all 
complaints are heard, recorded and registered with the compliance officer for appropriate action and simultaneously

ensuring fariness and confidentiality are maintained. It helps in improving confidence of concerned stakeholders in 
the organisation and also has as a deterrent effect.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
 
Yes.
 
The Company is committed to reducing its reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy sources. This 
commitment is central to minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting environmentally responsible 
practices. The Company aims to reduce air pollutants to levels below industry averages for the cement sector.
 
To mitigate the impacts of climate change on its operations, the Company has launched several initiatives focused on 
emission reduction and renewable energy adoption. It has significantly expanded its renewable energy footprint by 
incorporating solar power and biomass-based fuels into its operations. A key development is the commissioning of a 
5.5 MW solar power plant in the mining area at Damoh, Madhya Pradesh. This plant ensures a reliable electricity 
supply for mining operations and the clinker plant, reducing dependence on grid and short-term open access power 
sources.
 
The Company also utilizes a Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) to recover and reuse a substantial portion of 
energy demand. Plant teams continuously monitor energy usage and emissions, implementing strategic 
interventions such as installing conveyor belts, Ropeway system in the supply chain and retrofitting existing 
equipment to improve efficiency. To further lower its carbon footprint, the Company has replaced fossil fuels with 
alternative fuels (AFs) in clinker production. At the Narsingarh, Afs - initially biomass from nearby areas—have been 
introduced, with the system now handling up to 20 tonnes per hour of biomass, Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), and 
combustible components of Municipal Solid Waste. These initiatives highlight the Company’s dedication to 
sustainable practices and innovative energy sourcing.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy  
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
 
The Company is aligned with the concept of the circular economy and prioritizes waste management by embedding 
circularity throughout its production processes, including storage, usage, reuse, recycling, and disposal of waste 
generated at its facilities.
 
The Company utilizes waste materials from other industries, such as blast furnace slag and fly ash, as input materials 
for cement manufacturing, effectively reducing the reliance on naturally extracted resources and promoting material 
circularity.
 
Various types of hazardous and non-hazardous waste are generated at the company's different plants, including 
used oil, used Grease, biomedical waste, E-waste, and battery waste. The company has implemented appropriate 
infrastructure at each site to safely handle, collect, and store the different types of waste until they are sold to 
registered Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) / State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) authorized recyclers.
 
At the plant level, waste generated on-site is systematically managed through a color-coded collection bin system. 
However, instead of dealing with the waste disposal internally, the company has opted for selling waste to external 
vendors who take charge of the entire waste management process, from collection to final disposal. This helps the 
Company to safely dispose hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
