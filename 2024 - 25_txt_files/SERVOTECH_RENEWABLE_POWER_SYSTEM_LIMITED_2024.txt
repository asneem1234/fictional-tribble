Statement by Director, responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
At Servotech Renewable Power System Ltd., integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles 
into our business fabric isn’t just an obligation—it’s our guiding compass for sustainable growth. As a leading 
manufacturer of solar solutions, EV chargers, and energy-efficient products, we remain deeply committed 
to ushering in a cleaner, greener energy future. Our rebranding to Servotech Renewable Power System Ltd. 
underscores this ethos and our long-term vision for sustainable innovation. 
Environmental Stewardship: We’re actively reducing carbon footprints by delivering green infrastructure solutions 
from deploying high-efficiency solar rooftop systems to pioneering ultra-fast DC EV charging stations across 
India. Our projects span from airport airside EV operations to solar installations for public utilities reflecting both 
scale and impact.
Social Responsibility & Inclusion: Diversity and community upliftment are cornerstones of our operations. With 
women comprising approximately 45% of our workforce, we foster inclusive leadership that delivers balanced 
perspectives and enhanced organisational resilience. Meanwhile, our CSR initiatives actively support education, 
livelihoods, and sustainable community development, aligning business goals with societal welfare.
Governance & Integrity: Underpinned by a framework of ethics, transparency, and stakeholder engagement, 
our governance approach ensures accountability and long-term value creation. We continue to refine our 
processes, reinforce risk mitigation, and align with ESG best practices.
Targets & Achievements: We are proud to have delivered significant performance results achieving a robust fiscal 
outlook with Q1 FY26 showing marked growth in revenue, EBITDA, and profit across standalone and consolidated 
figures. Looking forward, we are focused on further enhancing margins (targeting up to 10%), expanding our solar 
and EV infrastructure footprint, and optimizing our ESG-driven innovation pipeline.
Moving forward, our focus will be on deepening our low-carbon impact, scaling inclusive practices, and 
strengthening governance frameworks all while delivering value to stakeholders and society at large. With ESG 
embedded at every level, Servotech is on a steadfast march toward a resilient, sustainable future.
