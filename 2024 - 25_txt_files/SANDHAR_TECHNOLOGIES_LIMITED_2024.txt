change presents opportunities 
through increased demand for 
sustainable mobility solutions, 
including electric vehicles 
(EVs) and low-emission 
technologies. 
The Company  has integrated 
climate-related considerations 
into its enterprise risk 
management framework. Key 
mitigation strategies include:

and reduction of carbon 
footprint across operations 
and supply chain.

technologies and energy-
practices.

compliant systems have 
been implemented in four 
major manufacturing units, 
utilizing Rotary Evaporators 
and Solar Evaporators to 
discharge.
-  Other facilities are equipped 
Plants (ETPs) and Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs) to 
ensure proper treatment

wastewater.
-  Treated water is reused for 
non-potable applications 
such as gardening, thereby 
reducing the Company’s 
dependence on freshwater 
sources.

evaluates new technologies 
and practices to improve 
water recycling and 
conservation.

Risk & 
Opportunity
The Company acknowledges 
that its supply chain plays 
a critical role in its overall 
sustainability performance 
and reputation. Risks such 
as supply disruptions, non-
compliance with labour and 
environmental standards, and 
unethical sourcing practices

opportunities to enhance 
resilience, ensure compliance, 
drive innovation, and create

Innovation 
Risk
In a highly dynamic and 
technology-driven industry, 
there is a continuous need to 
innovate to stay competitive. 
The risk arises when existing or 
new solutions fail to keep pace 
with evolving market trends, 
customer expectations, 
regulatory requirements, or 
technological advancements. 
In such cases, companies may 
experience delays in product 
development, reduced 
competitiveness, or missed 
market opportunities.
The Company recognizes 
that without sustained 
innovation, it may not be able 
to meet emerging demands, 
particularly in the areas of 
electric mobility, automation, 
sustainability, and smart 
manufacturing.
To address this risk, the 
Company has implemented 
the following measures:
nurturing of new focus 
areas through cross-
functional collaboration and 
benchmarking global best 
practices.
-  Continuous upskilling of 
internal teams to foster a 
culture of innovation and 
adaptability.
Negative

Disaster 
Recovery
Risk
Natural disasters such as 
threats to business continuity, 
employee safety, and 
events can cause unforeseen 
disruptions in production, 
supply chain, logistics, and 
resource availability, leading 
losses.
Given the Company’s 
geographically spread 
manufacturing operations, 
disaster recovery and 
preparedness are critical to 
minimize impact and ensure 
quick restoration of normal 
operations.
-  The Company 
has established a 
comprehensive Business 
Continuity Plan (BCP) that 
outlines protocols for 
disaster preparedness, 
emergency response, and 
recovery.

coverage is maintained to 
safeguard against material 
from such events.

Human Rights Risk & 
Opportunity
Upholding human rights is a 
fundamental aspect of ethical 
and responsible business 
conduct. Risks such as 
discrimination, forced labor, 
unsafe working conditions, or 
violation of individual rights can 
lead to regulatory penalties, 
reputational damage, and 
stakeholder distrust. On the 
other hand, respecting and 
promoting human rights 
presents an opportunity to 
strengthen employee relations, 
supply chain accountability, 
The Company recognizes 
its responsibility to respect 
and protect the rights of 
all individuals impacted by 
its operations, including 
employees, contract workers, 
suppliers, and community 
members.

Training & 
Education
Opportunity
A skilled and well-trained 
workforce is a strategic asset 
to the Company. Employees 
who are equipped with the 
right knowledge, tools, and 
competencies are more 
less prone to workplace 
injuries. Investment in training 
and development enhances 
employee satisfaction, 
retention, and performance.
The Company provides a 
need-based and innovative 
range of training programs 
aimed at building both 
technical and behavioural 
capabilities across all levels. 
These initiatives are designed 
not only to meet current 
operational needs but also 
to support long-term career 
growth and adaptability in a 
rapidly evolving industry.

Governance, leadership, and oversight
 7.  Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG   related challenges, targets, and 
achievements 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
We are pleased to present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
At STL, we view sustainability not just as a compliance requirement but as a 
strategic priority embedded in our values and operations. Our commitment 
to ESG principles continues to shape the way we create long-term value for 
all stakeholders.
During the reporting year, we made meaningful progress across key areas:
• 
We achieved a 30% increase in renewable energy consumption, 
advancing our transition toward cleaner energy sources.
• 
• 
We strengthened waste management practices, including the use of 
recycled input materials like aluminium alloy and ensured safe disposal 
through authorized channels.
• 
We ensured 100% insurance coverage for our employees and workers 
and conducted regular training programs on safety, ethics, and human 
rights.
• 
We deepened stakeholder engagement through robust grievance 
within our value chain.
While these are encouraging steps, we acknowledge that several ESG-
related challenges persist. These include the need for better integration of 
ESG data systems, improved monitoring of performance indicators across 
the supply chain, and further clarity on interim milestones for our long-term 
goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
Looking forward, we remain focused on continuously improving our 
sustainability performance, strengthening accountability, and aligning with 
evolving national and global ESG standards. We understand that responsible 
business conduct is a dynamic and ongoing journey one we are committed 
to pursuing with integrity, purpose, and collaboration.
