throughout its operations. This involves the use 
of a thorough EHS management system and 
compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements, including those related to E-
waste management and EHS policy.

and procurement difficulties if a vendor 
stops supplying, especially as it relies 
on single-source key raw materials.

commodities directly from farmers and 
APMC, ensuring that it doesn't depend 
on a single supplier for palm oil and 
other raw materials.
The procurement team is actively identifying 
new vendors and keeping a record of approved 
alternatives for certain raw materials. The 
Company is also seeking more vendor sources 
to lessen the risk linked to dependency on a 
single source.

susceptibility to cyber-attacks, which 
could lead to data loss or compromise 
of confidential information.

Operating Procedure (SOP) that encompasses a 
comprehensive disaster recovery and business 
continuity plan. This plan outlining procedures 
for backup, archival and restoration processes.
