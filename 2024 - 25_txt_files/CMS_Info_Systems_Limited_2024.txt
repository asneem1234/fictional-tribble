Filter (DPF) and the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) which will now 
enable monitoring the emission levels (not present in the earlier BS-VI 
vehicles).

b)	 E-Waste
The Company has tied -up with a registered e-waste recycler for collection of all the e-waste 
across PAN India and the e-waste recycler disposes the same at their plant. Customers are 
explained about the process of disposal and awareness is provided about the nearest drop 
point available to drop the e-waste and also about the incentives, if any, that are being offered 
to them against their end-of-life product.
If any customer wants to handover the material from their doorsteps, the Company either uses 
its logistics team or the e-waste recycler is instructed to collect items and channelize the same 
to his e-waste plant for final processing.
The Company has set up the following SoP for recycling/disposal of e-waste generated within 
the organisation:
•	
Users submit non-working/non-repairable IT/electronic items to IT/Admin department at 
branch locations.
•	
The IT team inspects the IT related items and Admin team inspects non-IT electronic items 
for confirmation of non-repairability/non-usability of material.
•	
Post inspection, the team prepares a list of disposable items and gets necessary approvals 
from IT Manager/Admin Head for initiating the disposal process.
•	
Post approvals, the list is shared with the E-Waste partner for inviting proposal.
•	
The proposal received is shared with the Finance Head for commercial approval.
•	
Post the approval, the disposable material is handed over to the e-waste recycler and 
E-Waste Disposal certificate is received.
Further details about e-waste management are detailed in the Company’s E-Waste Management 
Guidelines: https://www.cms.com/index and E-Waste Disposal Policy (available on the intranet 
portal).

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a)	 Whether an occupational

CMS Health & Safety initiatives cover the nature of work environment and the impact 
it has on the health, including ergonomic health impact, communicable diseases, fire 
safety and commute/business travel safety. CMS encourages a participative approach 
to mitigate occupational health, safety and environment risks. Standard operating 
norms have been put in place to ensure all our offices and cash vans operate under 
safe working conditions.
b)	 What are the processes 
used 
to 
identify 
work-
related hazards and assess 
risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
Through its Health and Safety initiatives, the Company strives to identify work- related 
hazards, assesses risks and implements appropriate mitigation measures. Assessment 
of work-related hazards and risks is the key dimension of CMS’ Health & Safety 
Initiatives and is a part of its Standard Operating Processes. Development in external 
and internal processes such as socio-political disturbances, natural disasters, resource 
disruptions and health issues are monitored and evaluated regularly to strengthen 
the existing Health and Safety mechanism. Office infrastructures are designed and 
undergoes periodic maintenance to minimize ergonomic and communicable health 
issues.
Being in a service industry, the workplaces are deemed to be non-hazardous and 
safe in nature. However, due to the inherent nature of the business, CMS’ Cash Vaults 
and Cash Vans are constantly under special security arrangement against potential 
external threats and embezzlements.
Through its Fire Safety Policy, the Company conducts awareness sessions to identify 
and address work-related hazards with respect to fire safety including common 
workplace fire hazards like flammable liquids, mismanaged stores, smoking buds, 
cords, wires and tripping hazards alongside earthquake safety and preparedness.
