1
Product 
safety
Risk
Since our primary 
customers are from the 
pharmaceutical and 
FMCG sectors, packaging 
material plays a critical 
role in maintaining the 
composition of medicines 
and food quality, shelf 
life, safety during 
shipment and any critical 
shortcoming in product 
safety or quality could 
negatively impact the 
Company’s reputation, 
resulting in an impact on 
sales.
We employ stringent 
quality control methods in 
all our production activities, 
as well as formal testing 
processes for new products 
and materials. Quality 
and hygiene management 
systems, such as ISO 9001 
and BRCGS, providing 
a strong foundation for 
ensuring consistency in 
product safety
We primarily offer our 
packaging solutions to 
B2B clients, where any 
decline in sales owing 
to a loss of reputation 
can result in significant 
revenue losses as the 
business coming from 
them is mostly bulk and 
recurring purchases. Also, 
the Company will have to 
incur additional expenses 
to replace and resolve 
client complaints
2
Materials 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Material management is 
an important aspect of 
the packaging industry 
since it can lead to a 
high chance of product 
damage during shipping 
and distribution, resulting 
in significant financial 
and reputation loss. 
Furthermore, if the 
proper packing material 
is not used, it might 
compromise the quality of 
the customer’s products 
in addition to resulting in 
result in the accumulation 
of hazardous waste in the 
environment.
As part of our innovation 
process, we are focused 
on sustainable packaging 
solutions that provide 
functionality in terms of 
protecting the packaged 
product. This functionality 
enables the distribution 
of products across 
wide geographies while 
maintaining the life of the 
packaged product. A strong 
capability on research, 
established manufacturing 
and quality processes 
help us mitigate any risks 
arising. The partnerships 
with customers in terms 
of feedback in case of any 
issues and implementing 
corrective and preventive 
actions as applicable is 
critical to ensure resolution 
of any identified concerns 
as well. 
The right packaging 
solution not only 
extends the shelf life of 
the product and keeps 
the products safe for 
consumption but also 
helps to develop brand 
image for the Company 
and reduce environmental 
impact for the society
3
Energy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Improving energy 
efficiency throughout 
our activities is a key 
component of our 
Energy Strategy. This is 
extremely critical given 
our high growth goals; 
we must always develop 
methods to produce 
more effectively in order 
to offset the emissions 
caused by increased 
output. Increasing the 
percentage of renewable 
power is another 
important tool for 
combatting our emissions.
The Company's 
environmental strategy and 
activities toward energy 
efficiency are driving the 
tremendous improvement 
in energy reduction. The 
policy's objective is to 
ensure that everyone in the 
organisation understands 
our environmental 
obligations, designing and 
implementing a global 
energy plan to enhance 
energy efficiency, transition 
to low-carbon fuels, and 
raise the global proportion 
of renewable power
Shifting more towards 
renewable energy 
in manufacturing of 
packaging solutions can 
lower maintenance cost 
and requirements. It 
also helps in cleaner and 
greener environment thus 
contributing to sustainable 
ecosystem

Climate and 
emissions
Risk
Extreme environmental 
changes can harm any 
organisation by disrupting 
the procurement of raw 
materials, the production 
process, and the supply 
chain. Government 
regulations and norms on 
climate and emissions can 
also have a huge impact 
on business.
We have started identifying 
and evaluating climate 
change risks to the 
Company as part of our due 
diligence procedures and 
take necessary mitigating 
and adapting action. Our 
climate goals are ratified by 
the Science based targets 
initiative. This will also 
aid in the transition to a 
carbon-neutral society. Our 
goal is to reach carbon-
neutral production by 
2030.
Climate change can have 
both direct and indirect 
impact on our Company. 
Direct impact may include 
physical damage, loss 
of essential resources 
and indirect impact may 
include supply chain 
disruption, rising costs 
in different phases of 
production and other 
adverse impacts.
5
Transition 
to a circular 
economy
Both as 
Risk and 
Opportunity
Currently in India, Most 
flexible packaging is 
intended for single-use 
and is discarded rather 
than reused or recycled. 
Packaging consumes a 
lot of resources, including 
energy, water, chemicals, 
petroleum, minerals, 
wood, and textiles. Its 
production frequently 
produces air pollutants 
such as greenhouse 
gases, heavy metals, and 
particulates, as well as 
hazardous wastewater 
and/or sludge.
We are ensuring our 
products are recyclable, 
compostable, or reusable 
and minimising our 
environmental footprint
across the value chain by 
focusing on designing for 
circularity and promoting 
sustainable end-of-use for 
packaging. 
Our blueloop programme 
was initiated with this 
objective of ensuring that 
all our packaging solutions 
are recyclable, reusable or 
compostable by 2030. Our 
innovation and research 
efforts are strongly focused 
on delivering packaging 
solutions that adhere to 
this design philosophy. 
We are also compliant 
on the plastic waste 
management rules in India 
and are ensuring that 
we meet our Extended 
Producers’ Responsibility 
(EPR) targets
Packaging waste accounts 
for a large portion of 
landfill waste, which 
contributes to climate 
change and air pollution 
and can endanger 
ecosystems and species 
adversely. There is no 
quantifiable financial 
implication, however, 
it does have an impact 
on our overall business 
operation.

Waste and 
recycling
7
Water
Risk
We value water as a 
precious natural resource 
that is essential for 
food, people, and the 
environment and in 
Huhtamaki, water is 
essential as it is utilised 
in manufacturing 
activities. Recognising 
the human right to 
water and sanitation, 
we concentrate on 
controlling and reducing 
our effect on water 
resources.
In our water management 
strategies, we emphasise 
controlling and reducing 
our impacts on water 
resources. We safeguard 
water ecosystems 
especially in water stress 
areas.
Water scarcity can disrupt 
manufacturing activities 
and water storage and 
transfer infrastructure can 
incur substantial amounts 
of costs to the Company.

The plans include alignment

water risk assessments, 
targets connected with 
performance indicators, 
and control and monitoring 
metrics that permit follow-
up and detection of issues.
The global sustainability 
unit is driving this strategic 
endeavour by assisting 
local stakeholders in 
undertaking water resource 
analysis and management.
We have initiated our 
focus to achieve zero liquid 
discharge status for our 
factories. Four of our sites 
have already achieved ZLD 
status.
8
Human rights
Opportunity
Businesses that respect 
human rights exhibit their 
dedication to developing 
long-term, mutually 
beneficial relationships 
with people who affect 
or are influenced by 
their activities, such as 
consumers, communities, 
workers, and investors.
We reviewed our existing 
policies and processes, 
as well as conducted a 
worldwide evaluation of 
our possible human rights 
risks and implications.
Huhtamaki India conforms 
to the Programme on 
Responsible Sourcing 
under the AIM- 
PROGRESS consortium. 
Under this programme, 
the process of verification 
/ audit of compliance 
is called SEDEX 
(SUPPLIERS ETHICAL 
DATA EXCHANGE) and 
the Model Responsible 
Sourcing Audit is call 
SMETA (SEDEX Members 
Ethical Trade Audit).
The scope of SMETA audit 
is (a) Business Integrity 
(b) Health & Safety (c) 
Labour (d) Environment. 
There is a prescribed audit 
checklist for the audit, 
where in the auditors will 
look for compliance to 
applicable local law and /
or the customer specific 
requirement, whichever is 
stricter.

This certification can be 
done using the services 
of approved certifying 
agencies. There are few 
customers who have 
their own model, which 
is similar to SMETA. 
For those customers, 
applicable conversion 
of report is done by 
the certification body 
engaged. 
SMETA audit doesn’t lead 
to any certification and 
Individual customers are 
expected to review the 
audit report of the site 
and provide a compliance 
validity.  Minimum 
Compliance is for 1 year, 
and maximum can be 3 
years. As a good practice, 
Huhtamaki India ensures 
that all its packaging and 
label manufacturing sites 
undergo SMETA audit at 
least once a year. Except 
Ambernath unit, which 
got commissioned very 
recently, all plants have 
gone through the requisite 
audit in last one year and 
put in due diligence for 
closure of the findings.  
At a global level, as a pilot 
project, Huhtamaki has 
conducted its first human 
rights impact assessment 
at one of our sites. The 
findings of both the global 
review and the local level 
evaluation will help us 
increase our human rights 
due diligence and expand 
other aspects of social 
sustainability throughout 
the organisation.

Diversity 
and equal 
opportunity
Opportunity
We seek to foster an 
inclusive and diverse 
workplace, and to 
achieve that we aim 
to attract, develop, 
and retain the finest 
talent in a conducive 
work environment, by 
imparting appropriate 
training programmes, 
by modifying polices 
and by embracing the 
differences.
We celebrate diversity and 
promote equality by being 
inclusive of all.
We believe that diverse 
teams, in terms of 
gender, ethnicity, and 
characteristics, bring fresh 
views, greater creativity 
and innovation to the 
table. Diversity in teams 
increases performance, 
efficient decision 
making, and effective 
collaboration.

Opportunity
When it comes to talent, 
hiring the right people

behind putting our plan 
into action.
We strive to provide 
employment experience 
in which employees feel 
protected, appreciated,

of our 2030 Strategy 
and it is the key to our 
future success. Talent 
development is the 
process through which 
we improve our workers’ 
talents and capacities so 
that they may thrive in 
their positions.

Employee 
training
Opportunity
At Huhtamaki, we 
believe that learning 
is the foundation of 
superior performance 
and employees should 
carve their own path 
by determining where 
they want to go in their 
careers.
We help them by offering 
organised learning, 
on-the-job training, 
opportunities to learn 
from others and various 
training and development 
programmes.
We provide continuous 
skill development and 
learning opportunities

Opportunity
We believe that labour 
relations are essential in 
manufacturing focused 
business. We have 
followed principles set 
out by International 
Labour Organisation
Good Labour relations 
translate in overall 
productivity and leads to 
higher work satisfaction 
levels\.
Our various Projects 
focuses on improving 
efficiency of 
manufacturing network, 
labour productivity and

Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
It is vital to provide a safe 
working environment 
in order to minimise 
absenteeism and boost 
employee morale. Risks 
related to incidents that 
potentially compromise 
health and safety can 
impose various threats to 
human lives associated 
with the Company.
Huhtamaki places a high 
priority on occupational 
health and safety (OHS).
We are developing a safe 
work culture to integrate 
safety across the Company. 
Huhtamaki’s objective is to 
create a mindset along with 
training targeted towards 
the aim that no one is 
affected, and everyone 
returns home safely at the 
end of the day. Machine 
safety has always been a 
top priority for Huhtamaki
Working days are lost 
owing to work-related 
illness and injury, which 
impedes our product 
production and supply.

Supply 
chain and 
responsible 
sourcing
Risk
The supply chain is 
extremely important in 
the packaging sector, and 
any interruption in this 
may expose the Company 
to different types of risks. 
Since most of our clients 
manufacture and use 
our packaging material 
for their products and 
commodities that are fast 
moving and essential, 
the stock must be 
replenished and supplied 
to retailers within the 
stipulated time to meet 
the growing demands of 
customers.
Huhtamaki's enhanced 
supply chain due 
diligence methodology is 
designed to detect supply 
chain risks and covers 
all ethical, social, and 
environmental standards. 
All-important suppliers, 
accounting for the top 
80% of procurement 
expenditure, are now 
systematically screened 
in the Group's supplier 
monitoring tool against 
sanctions lists, watch lists, 
and unfavourable media, 
assisting Huhtamaki in 
identifying and addressing 
issues in the supply chain.
Supply chain interruptions 
caused by the pandemic 
and other unprecedented 
challenges can result 
in unusual input cost 
inflation in raw resources, 
freight, energy, and labour.
15
Customer 
satisfaction
Opportunity
We customise our 
packaging solutions 
to the client's product 
specifications and 
requirements, and we 
feel that this allows us 
to better understand 
their demands and offer 
our products to them, 
lowering the primary 
expense of major 
modifications or wasteful 
manufacturing.
We commit to and offer 
solutions to our customers 
with honesty and as a 
team. and are ambitious for 
going above and beyond in 
terms of performance for 
customer satisfaction
Customer satisfaction 
leads to increased 
customer retention, higher 
lifetime value, and a more 
positive brand reputation.

Anticorruption 
and ethics
Opportunity
The Huhtamaki Ethics 
and Compliance 
programme focuses 
on Huhtamaki's 
commitment to ethics 
and legal compliance. 
The programme is a 
toolbox that assists 
Huhtamaki in operating 
its business in accordance 
with laws, rules, and 
ethical principles, as 
well as ensuring that the 
Company has proper 
processes in place to 
prevent Huhtamaki from 
engaging in unethical 
business practices.
At Huhtamaki, we believe 
that strong ethics make 
excellent business 
sense, and our business 
operations reflect this 
commitment to upholding 
the highest ethical 
standards.
The significant advantage 
of an ethical code is that it 
will build an environment 
of trust, ethical behaviour, 
integrity, and excellence 
amongst the Company, 
its employees and all the 
stakeholders

Our supplier network comprises global key suppliers and a broad network of local partners near our manufacturing units. 
Responsible sourcing is built on close collaboration, incorporating new supplier screening tools, processes, and third-party 
verifications to ensure compliance with established standards. As a responsible company, we are committed to ensuring

The Code of Conduct for Huhtamaki Suppliers serves as the foundation of our supply chain due diligence, setting clear 
compliance expectations. It covers business ethics, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability.
A key component of responsible procurement is the NAVEX RiskRate tool, which screens all critical suppliers against 
sanction lists, watchlists, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists, and negative media. This screening remains active for all 
strategic suppliers, ensuring continuous risk assessment. If a match is detected on any of these lists, RiskRate immediately 
notifies us with detailed case information.

[UN SDG: 3.6,8.8,16.1]
Our business has a comprehensive health and safety policy that is implemented at all levels of the organisation. We are 
committed to enforcing strict controls over all relevant health and safety concerns while continuously working to minimise 
risks. As part of the induction process, all new employees undergo site- and job-specific health and safety training, which 
is regularly reinforced.
Each unit head and their leadership team are responsible for managing the health and safety programme at their respective 
locations, while performance is evaluated at the national level by the Managing Director and Head of Operations. 
Assessments include reviewing leading and lagging indicators and implementing lessons learned from accidents across 
all sites. Proactive safety measures such as reporting and closing near-miss incidents, identifying opportunities for 
improvement, conducting audits, and leadership walks are actively implemented. To enhance employee involvement, 
monthly awareness campaigns cover key topics such as hand safety, fire safety, working at heights, and process safety.

Additionally, line management ensures the daily implementation of health and safety protocols through regular checks, 
toolbox discussions, and standard operating procedures.
We also place strong emphasis on ensuring that contract workers are fully integrated into our health and safety 
programmes. Safe working procedures are clearly defined, and risk assessments are conducted for all processes, with 
necessary control measures put in place. The Behavioural Safety Programme has been introduced to encourage safe 
behaviours, while periodic mock drills, internal inspections, and audits are carried out to identify gaps and implement 
necessary corrective actions.

preventative actions are implemented in the affected area, and then they are deployed in all other relevant units. 
Investigations are conducted into all incidents that have taken place inside the group globally, and any lessons learned 
are put into practice. For instance, the implementation of a gap analysis and mitigation programme that covered work at 
height at each site was spurred by the Company’s global sites. Action plans are developed in these circumstances, and

Details on assessment of value chain partners:
	
[UN SDG: 5.2,8.8,16.1]
A key component of Huhtamaki’s due diligence process is the NAVEX RiskRate tool, which is used to screen all key suppliers 
against sanction lists, watchlists, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists, and adverse media. This screening remains active 
throughout the supplier’s engagement with Huhtamaki. If a match is identified in any of these lists, RiskRate automatically 
alerts us with detailed case information, enabling swift assessment and necessary action.
6. 	
Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address significant risks / concerns arising from 
assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions of value chain partners.
	
[UN SDG: 3.6,8.8,16.1]
Based on the supplier’s initial profile risk level, they are required to complete a questionnaire as part of the due diligence 
process. All suppliers must acknowledge compliance with the updated Code of Conduct for Huhtamaki Suppliers. Medium-
risk suppliers are assessed with questions that help evaluate corruption risks and legal compliance, while potential high-risk 
suppliers must respond to additional questions on sanctions, ethics, and compliance.
We have established risk scoring criteria for the questionnaire responses, and if necessary, each answer is individually 
reviewed to determine whether further actions or explanations are required from the supplier. The final risk rating combines 
the results of both the supplier screening and the questionnaire assessment and follows a three-level classification system: 
low, medium, or high risk.
Internal review and approval processes are in place to evaluate the final risk rating, with varying levels of scrutiny depending 
on the assigned risk category.
Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
  
  
  
For Huhtamaki, primary stakeholders include the government, shareholders, consumers, suppliers, investors, and communities, all 
of whom seek insights into our sustainability performance across various areas. To ensure transparency and clear communication, 
we recognise the importance of continuously recording and disclosing both quantitative and qualitative indicators. This allows 
us to address key sustainability issues that impact business performance effectively.
Collaboration and co-creation with stakeholders are fundamental to achieving our sustainability goals. Engaging in stakeholder 
dialogue not only helps align our objectives and initiatives with the expectations of diverse groups but also provides valuable 
insights into potential risks and opportunities associated with our operations.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
[UN SDG: 16.6]
Huhtamaki strictly prohibits all forms of workplace violence, including threats and intimidation. Employees are not 
permitted to carry or use firearms or other weapons while on Huhtamaki property or when conducting business on behalf 
of the Company, ensuring a safe work environment for all. The Company maintains a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, 
including sexual, racial, or any other form of hostile, abusive, or undignified behaviour.
In compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 
and the applicable rules, we have implemented an Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy and established an Internal Complaints 
Committee (ICC). Awareness campaigns are conducted across all divisions to educate employees on treating female 
colleagues with dignity and respect.
To facilitate the reporting of fraudulent activities or violations of the Company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy, 
employees can utilise multiple reporting channels under the Whistleblower Policy. This policy outlines a structured 
procedure for reporting, processing, and investigating unethical practices, while ensuring protection for whistleblowers. 
Employees may report any suspected violations to the India Investigation Lead via email at IndiaInvestigationLead@
huhtamaki.com or send a confidential letter to the registered office. The Company ensures that no employee is prevented 
from raising concerns before the Audit Committee.
To reinforce the importance of ethics and compliance, Huhtamaki India launched an awareness campaign titled #DoRight 
– The Huhtamaki Way! The initiative educates employees on the Whistleblower Policy, the effective use of the Speak 
Up platform, and the importance of maintaining ethical conduct. The campaign features CoCo, the mascot, who delivers 
key messages throughout the initiative.
Our Code of Ethics Policy, applicable to all employees, mandates complete protection for whistleblowers against retaliation, 
threats, intimidation, termination, suspension, disciplinary action, demotion, refusal of promotion, discrimination, or any 
other form of harassment or biased behaviour. The policy strictly prohibits any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct 
a whistleblower’s right to perform their duties or make further disclosures. Additionally, retaliation against employees 
reporting any form of harassment is strictly prohibited.

Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers outlines compliance expectations related to business 
ethics, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability. A key component of 
Huhtamaki’s due diligence process is the use of the NAVEX RiskRate tool, which screens 
key suppliers against sanction lists, watchlists, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists, 
and adverse media. This screening remains active throughout the supplier’s engagement 
with Huhtamaki. If a match is detected, RiskRate automatically alerts us with detailed 
case information.
Based on the supplier’s initial risk profile, they are required to complete a questionnaire. 
All suppliers must acknowledge compliance with the updated Code of Conduct for 
Huhtamaki Suppliers. Medium-risk suppliers are assessed for corruption risks and legal 
compliance, while high-risk suppliers must respond to additional questions related to 
sanctions, ethics, and compliance.
We have established risk-scoring criteria for questionnaire responses. If necessary, each 
answer is reviewed individually to determine whether further actions or explanations are 
required from the supplier. The final risk rating integrates both the screening results and 
questionnaire responses, classifying suppliers into low, medium, or high-risk categories. 
Internal review and approval processes are in place to assess the final risk rating, with 
varying levels of scrutiny depending on the assigned risk level.

With a growing emphasis on environmental sustainability, packaging plays a crucial role in reducing food waste, which remains 
the most significant environmental impact of food systems on climate change. In alignment with our commitment to protecting 
food, people, and the environment, we have updated the Huhtamaki Group Environmental Policy to reinforce our focus on 
sustainable packaging solutions.
The policy aims to ensure that everyone within the organisation understands our environmental responsibilities. It covers 
key areas such as climate and energy, water and effluent management, sustainable forestry and biodiversity, waste reduction, 
circular design, and chemical management.
Through innovation, we strive to raise awareness and develop the infrastructure necessary for recycling and eliminating 
packaging waste. This initiative not only benefits all stakeholders but also contributes to the well-being of the ecosystem at large.

In our 2030 ambitions, we have committed to carbon neutral production (Scope 1 and 2). While on one end, we are 
working to switch to renewable energy, on the other hand, we are also taking actions to optimise and reduce our energy 
consumption, thus mitigating GHG emissions at source. When it comes to energy conservation, even small initiatives taken 
across the operations together bring in a lot of benefits. All our manufacturing units are undertaking various projects for 
both fuel and electricity consumption reduction. A few examples: Use of Variable frequency drives on motors, optimisation 
of compressed air, optimising insulation of heat carrying piping, LED lighting and maximising natural lighting etc. Huhtamaki 
India achieved a 14% improvement in its energy usage intensity in 2024, as compared to 2023.

Principle 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
  
  
  
  
  
 
At Huhtamaki, we recognise that client satisfaction is the clearest path to success. To meet the growing demand for sustainable 
packaging solutions, we have launched various transformational initiatives globally, aligning with the needs of our customers 
and their consumers.
We are committed to excellence and collaboration across our business divisions and functions, ensuring we deliver the best 
possible solutions. By aligning our values with those of our customers, we foster stronger partnerships and drive greater 
achievements in sustainability.
Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
[UN SDG: 16.6]
We bifurcate the customer complaints we receive into two categories - (a) Online Rejection, which is a small quantity 
of defect typically at the end or beginning of the coil (b) Complaint, which is a deviation from Specification and or 
stated/implied condition (including packing condition, documentation requirement etc). Huhtamaki India has NCMS (non-
conformance management System) portal where the complaints are logged in. As a first point of contact, the Sales team 
receives the information from the customer. Based on the details received, the sales team decides whether to record the 
same under Online Rejection or Complaint.
1)	
Online Rejection - typically this is registered for a period of time over many invoices. There may be multiple reasons 
for these rejections. Once the same is registered into NCMS portal, the same reaches to the Quality Control (QC) 
head. On verification, the QC head decides on the next course of action. 
2)	
Customer Complaint - Typically this is registered against a specific invoice. At times, there may be few consecutive 
invoices. Once the sales representative registers the same, the same is delivered to QC head, who checks it for 
its genuineness. Where appropriate, the plant representative visits the customer’s site to understand the issue. 
Based on the initial interaction, the QC head decides the next course of action. Once accepted, the response to 
customer, through sales representative, is done within 15 working days. The response includes a thorough Root Cause 
Analysis, Corrective Action(s), and Preventive actions(a). The QC head of the plant is responsible for assigning the 
identified Corrective Action(s), and Preventive Action(s) to various colleagues. Closure of these actions are confirmed 
to QC head. Then, upon verification of the supplies (post closure of all actions), the Quality Assurance head closes 
the complaint.
