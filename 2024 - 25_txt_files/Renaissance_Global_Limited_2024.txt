Materials 
Sourcing 
&Efficiency
Risk
Material 
sourcing 
and 
efficiency is a key risk under 
material 
assessment 
due 
to its impact on resource 
availability, 
cost 
volatility, 
and 
supply 
chain 
stability. 
Unsustainable 
or 
unethical 
sourcing can lead to regulatory, 
reputational, and operational 
challenges. Inefficient use of 
materials increases waste and 
environmental footprint. This 
risk affects long-term business 
viability and stakeholder trust. 
Renaissance Global Limited 
is committed to sustainable 
and 
responsible 
business 
practices across its value chain. 
The Company incorporates 
recycled materials, such as gold 
and silver, into its products 
to reduce dependence on 
finite natural resources and 
lower environmental impact. 
Manufacturing 
processes 
are designed to maximize 
resource efficiency, minimize 
waste, and optimize overall 
resource utilization.
RGL ensures that all materials 
are ethically and responsibly 
sourced. 
The 
Company

(Responsible 
Jewellery 
Council)

we prioritize stringent product 
testing and quality assurance 
to

quality 
and 
customer

Company has implemented 
several key measures:

Environmental 
Impacts in 
the Supply 
Chain
Risk
The 
jewellery 
and 
lifestyle 
products industry heavily relies 
on raw materials such as metals 
and gemstones, which are often 
extracted through processes 
that 
can 
have 
significant 
environmental 
impacts, 
including habitat destruction, 
water pollution, and carbon 
emissions. Any disruption or 
depletion 
of 
these 
natural 
resources can directly affect 
Renaissance Global Limited’s 
ability 
to 
source 
materials, 
leading 
to 
supply 
chain 
disruptions and increased costs.
Additionally, 
the 
use 
of 
hazardous chemicals in the 
manufacturing 
process 
can 
contribute to pollution and 
environmental 
degradation, 
posing 
potential 
risks 
for 
regulatory 
non-compliance 
and reputational damage. The 
Company 
is 
committed 
to 
adopting sustainable practices 
that minimize environmental 
harm and ensure compliance 
with 
regulatory 
standards, 
thereby 
safeguarding 
its 
reputation 
and 
long-term 
business viability
Renaissance 
Global 
Limited 
is 
committed 
to 
maintaining compliance with 
Environmental, 
Social, 
and 
Governance (ESG) standards 
and promoting responsible 
product 
development 
to 
foster 
sustainable 
growth 
within 
communities. 
The 
Company’s 
management 
efforts 
include 
screening, 
selecting, 
monitoring, 
and 
engaging with suppliers to 
assess 
and 
mitigate 
their 
environmental impacts.
RGL continuously collaborates 
with 
suppliers 
to 
identify 
emerging threats and explore 
better options to address risks. 
The Company closely monitors 
key environmental indicators, 
including 
emissions, 
water 
consumption, 
and 
waste 
generation, and proactively 
works 
on 
implementing 
strategies 
to 
reduce 
its 
environmental footprint.
In 
addition, 
RGL 
remains 
vigilant in tracking emerging 
regulations,

Legal and 
Regulatory 
changes
Risk
Legal and regulatory changes in 
the regions where Renaissance 
Global 
Limited 
operates 
can 
significantly 
affect 
its 
operations 
and 
financial 
performance. 
Such 
changes 
may lead to higher operating 
costs, 
increased 
taxation, 
restrictions on activities, or even 
bans on certain operations. 
It is crucial for the Company 
to continuously monitor and 
adapt to evolving regulatory 
environments to mitigate any 
potential negative impacts on 
its business operations and 
financial outcomes.
RGL operates across various 
territories and markets, each 
with 
its 
own 
regulatory 
frameworks that are subject 
to 
frequent 
changes 
and 
heightened 
scrutiny 
from 
regulators. 
Non-compliance 
with 
these 
regulations 
or 
failure to navigate regulatory 
changes 
effectively 
could 
harm the Company’s financial 
standing and reputation
Regulatory risks at Renaissance 
Global Limited are managed 
through a strong governance 
framework grounded in the 
philosophy of ‘zero tolerance 
to non-compliance.’ This is 
implemented 
through 
the 
following measures:
• 
Monitoring of legal and 
regulatory compliance by senior 
management and the Board to 
ensure adherence to applicable 
laws and regulations.
• 
Regular 
assessment 
of 
regulatory 
and 
compliance 
requirements to identify any 
potential 
risks 
and 
ensure 
proactive adaptation to changes.
• 
Robust 
compliance 
management 
systems 
with 
continuous monitoring to track 
adherence to standards and 
promptly address any non-
compliance issues.
• 
Independent assessments 
and audits to ensure that the 
Company is operating within 
legal and regulatory boundaries.
• 
Implementation of strong 
internal controls to safeguard 
against non-compliance and 
enhance operational integrity.

Labour 
Conditions in 
the Supply Chain
Risk
There are several challenges 
related to ensuring employee 
health and safety, providing fair 
compensation, and addressing 
child and forced labour risks 
within the supply chain. Given 
the tendency to contract with 
suppliers in countries with lower 
Labour costs, manufacturing 
often occurs in regions where 
worker protections may be 
limited. This poses reputational 
risks for companies, particularly 
in light of increasing regulations 
and 
enforcement 
measures 
aimed at improving labour 
rights and conditions. 
The 
Company 
addresses 
labour-related 
risks 
through 
the Renaissance Jewellery Code 
of Practices, which upholds 
compliance with labour laws, 
safe 
working 
conditions, 
and the prohibition of child/
forced labour. The Know Your 
Supplier 
(KYS) 
assessment 
process ensures onboarding 
due diligence, covering legal, 
ethical, and labour standards. 
It conducts regular audits and 
assessments, 
and 
engages 
suppliers 
through 
training 
and awareness to strengthen 
responsible labour practices 
across the supply chain.

The Company has not yet implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system; however, it is actively evaluating alternative 
water treatment solutions to enhance water sustainability. At present, a dedicated Hand Wash Water Treatment Plant (ETP) 
is operational within the premises, primarily designed to recover suspended solid particles containing precious metals from 
production wastewater. Effluent generated from various departments passes through a series of three interconnected settling 
tanks. In the first tank, alum and polyelectrolyte are continuously dosed to facilitate the settling of particles. The water then 
flows sequentially through the second and third tanks. A level controller in the third tank activates a pump that directs the water 
through a charcoal column and a series of multi-stage filter cartridges (30, 15, and 1 microns). To manage COD and BOD levels, 
sodium hypochlorite is added at the final outlet. The tanks are drained every quarter, and the collected slurry is safely handled 
and managed. The entire process is closely monitored, with systematic documentation of chemical usage to ensure operational 
efficiency and environmental compliance.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
Use of Renewable energy
The Company actively procures renewable energy from 
third-party sources, including solar and wind, as part of its 
carbon reduction strategy. This initiative supports clean 
energy adoption and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.
A total of 1,50,64,097.40 MJ of 
renewable energy was used 
during the reporting period, 
significantly increasing reliance 
on clean energy sources.
2.
Wastewater Treatment
The Company has implemented an Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP) as part of its water management efforts. 
The treated water is monitored regularly, including 
pH levels, before being discharged into the municipal 
drainage system. This ensures compliance with 
regulatory norms and promotes environmentally 
responsible wastewater management.
Approximately 45% of the 
total water withdrawal is 
successfully treated through 
the ETP. The treated water 
consistently meets regulatory 
standards prior to discharge.
3.
Noise Pollution control 
through acoustic panels 
To reduce noise pollution, acoustic panels were 
installed on generator sets. These panels help suppress 
noise levels and contribute to a quieter and more 
environmentally friendly operation.
The installation has resulted 
in a noticeable reduction in 
noise levels, supporting a 
safer and more compliant 
working environment.
4.
Stack scrubbers  
Maintenance
To ensure our emission levels remain within 
prescribed limits, we conduct regular monitoring of 
our stack scrubbers. In addition, we carry out routine 
maintenance to uphold their efficiency and ensure 
consistent, optimal performance.
Quarterly 
monitoring 
of scrubbers has helped 
reduce 
emissions 
and 
ensured 
adherence 
to 
environmental standards.
5.
Installation of Solar 
Power in Rural Areas
A 20 kW solar power system has been installed in 
rural village schools to promote clean energy usage 
in underserved areas and reduce dependence on 
conventional energy sources.
The initiative has contributed 
to clean energy generation 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
demonstrates the Company’s 
commitment to promoting 
sustainable practices.
6.
Annual Tree 
Plantation Drive
The Company undertakes a tree plantation drive every 
year, planting 500 trees annually. An additional 500 
trees were planted during the reporting period to 
strengthen green cover and support biodiversity.

contacts. To ensure operational readiness, mock drills are conducted twice a year, and regular training sessions are organized 
for both employees and contract personnel. This proactive and structured approach enhances the Company’s ability to respond 
effectively to emergencies, ensuring the safety of its workforce and continuity of business operations.
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation 
or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
