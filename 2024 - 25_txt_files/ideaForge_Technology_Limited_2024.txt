We use an automatic rivet pressing machine powered by pneumatic force rather than electricity during its strokes. This 
system relies on compressed air to deliver strong, consistent riveting, boosting efficiency while minimizing electrical energy 
usage
	
•	
Reduced non-essential electricity use by manually switching off electronic devices and equipment after working hours.
	
•	
Conducted regular maintenance checks to avoid voltage imbalances, motor failures, and equipment overexposure, 
ensuring optimal performance.
	
•	
Ensured that machinery and equipment are turned off when not in use during working hours to minimize unnecessary 
energy usage.
	
•	
We have installed tube light battens in the factory’s key areas, serving as standard lighting during normal operations. 
Each batten is fitted with an integrated rechargeable backup system that, while illuminating, continuously charges and can 
subsequently offer up to 4 hours of emergency lighting following a full 8-hour charge cycle. This strategic installation not 
only improves energy efficiency but also provides reliable, uninterrupted lighting in the event of a power outage
	
•	
Implemented routine facility walkthroughs by security staff after working hours to identify and switch off any equipment 
left running unnecessarily consumption.
