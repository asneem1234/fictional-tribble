Workforce 
Health & Safety
Risk
The presence of heavy 
machinery and electrical 
hazards 
exposes 
employees to significant 
injury risks. Inadequate 
safety measures can lead 
to 
accidents, 
resulting 
in litigation, operational 
disruptions, and increased 
healthcare and insurance 
costs, thereby affecting 
financial and reputational 
stability.
To ensure employee safety 
and minimise risks from 
machinery 
and 
electrical 
hazards, 
the 
Company 
has adopted a proactive 
approach. It has implemented 
the 
ISO 
45001:2018 
Occupational 
Health 
and 
Safety Management System 
at its Guwahati and Nalagarh 
plants. 
Clear 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedures 
(SOPs) are in place for 
identifying and managing 
workplace hazards. Regular 
training sessions and mock 
drills — including fire safety, 
first aid, and emergency 
response — are conducted 
to keep employees well-
prepared. 
These 
efforts 
aim to build a strong safety 
culture 
and 
reduce 
the 
likelihood 
of 
workplace 
incidents.

Fuel Economy 
& Emissions in 
Use-phase
Opportunity
Increasing 
regulatory 
pressure and customer 
preference for energy-
efficient, 
low-emission 
products create a market 
advantage for companies 
that innovate in this area. 
By designing printers with 
lower power consumption 
and reduced emissions, 
Control 
Print 
can 
enhance 
brand 
value, 
gain market share, and 
reduce exposure to future 
compliance costs.

Materials 
Sourcing
Risk
Dependence on critical 
raw 
materials 
with 
limited 
substitutes 
and 
concentrated geographic 
sourcing exposes Control 
Print 
to 
supply 
chain 
disruptions, 
input 
cost 
volatility, and geopolitical 
risks. 
These 
factors 
can impact production 
timelines, cost structure, 
and 
overall 
business 
continuity.
To mitigate the risk of supply 
chain disruptions and raw 
material 
shortages, 
the 
Company 
places 
weekly 
bulk 
orders 
to 
maintain 
adequate buffer stock. This 
approach ensures continuity 
in production by providing a 
reserve of essential materials, 
reducing 
dependence 
on 
just-in-time 
deliveries. 
By 
stabilising 
material 
availability, the Company is 
better positioned to manage 
input cost fluctuations and 
external supply challenges.

Implementing

Control Print to reduce 
raw material usage, low­
er production costs, and 
generate additional reve­
nue streams by reselling 
refurbished printers. This 
approach supports sus­
tainability goals, reduces 
waste, and can enhance

footprint.
	
We have also made notable progress in advancing employee health and safety through the adoption of ISO 
45001:2018 – the international standard for occupational health and safety management. This milestone reflects 
our unwavering commitment to creating a safe, secure, and supportive workplace environment.
	
While challenges persist in aligning rapid business growth with evolving ESG expectations, we remain resolute in 
our pursuit of ambitious targets such as achieving water neutrality, advancing energy efficiency, and promoting 
inclusive workplace practices. Our initiatives are guided by principles of transparency, ethical conduct, strong 
governance, and a dedication to continuous improvement.
	
Through these collective efforts, we aim not just to meet compliance standards but to become a force for sustainable 
transformation—leading by example and inspiring meaningful change beyond our own operations.

exchange for new products. The Company subsequently collects the returned units, conducts methodical 
dismantling, and categorises the components in accordance with e-waste classification standards. These 
materials are then directed to authorised recycling facilities i.e. Ortech India Corporation to ensure compliance 
with EPR Framework, processing and resource recovery.
iii.	
Hazardous Waste
	
The Company adheres to stringent protocols for the disposal of hazardous waste, including scrap materials 
and consumables classified under hazardous categories. All such waste is exclusively handled by registered and

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The process of stakeholder consultation involves multiple levels of engagement, each tailored to ensure appropriate 
input and collaboration on economic, environmental, and social matters. When consultation is directly handled by 
the relevant departments or teams, the feedback gathered from stakeholders is systematically communicated to the 
Board for further consideration and decision-making. Below is a breakdown of the various engagement levels utilised 
in such consultations:
1.	
Inform: At this stage, stakeholders are provided with clear, unbiased information about the project, issue, or 
potential solutions. While stakeholders gain insight into the matters at hand, no opportunity for input or decision-
making is offered.
2.	
Consult: In this phase, feedback is actively sought from stakeholders on the provided information. This can range 
from simple methods such as online surveys to more in-depth feedback sessions. Stakeholder contributions are 
carefully considered as part of the decision-making process.
3.	
Involve: Stakeholders are directly engaged throughout the process to ensure that their concerns, needs, and 
preferences are fully understood and integrated into each stage. While the final decisions rest with the Company, 
stakeholder input plays a critical role in shaping the outcomes.
4.	
Collaborate: At this level, the Company partners with stakeholders in the decision-making process, jointly 
developing alternative solutions and collectively choosing the preferred option. The aim is to reach a consensus 
that reflects the interests and concerns of all parties involved.
5.	
Empower: In rare cases, stakeholders are granted the authority to make final decisions, typically through voting 
or referenda. This level of engagement is generally reserved for specific, highly significant matters, involving a 
small group representing key stakeholder interests.

Through these structured levels of consultation, the Company ensures that feedback from stakeholders is not only 
heard but actively influences the decision-making process, with the Board receiving comprehensive reports on the 
outcomes of such engagements.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is utilised to support the identification and management of environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) topics. At Control Print, stakeholder engagement is vital for effectively addressing key ESG 
issues, including governance oversight, employee empowerment and well-being, diversity and inclusion, and broader 
stakeholder engagement.
	
The Company places a strong emphasis on identifying and prioritising material issues that have a significant impact 
on both stakeholders and the business. Feedback from stakeholders is actively sought and integrated into the 
development of policies and strategic plans. This consultation ensures that stakeholder perspectives directly inform 
the Company’s approach to addressing ESG challenges and shaping its objectives in these areas. As a result, the 
inputs received from stakeholders are crucial in refining and enhancing the Company’s ESG initiatives, policies, and 
activities. However, no such instances were recorded during the reporting year.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalised stakeholder groups.
	
The Company is committed to sustainable growth that prioritises environmental protection and community welfare. It 
recognises the importance of building strong relationships with all stakeholders—including vulnerable and marginalised 
groups—within a multi-stakeholder framework designed to ensure equitable and sustainable progress.
	
Engagement with stakeholders, particularly vulnerable and marginalised groups, is managed through dedicated 
departments in consultation with leadership and is overseen by the ESG Committee. The Company ensures that 
interactions are governed by its Code of Business Principles (CoBP) and Code Policies, which emphasise transparency, 
honesty, integrity, and openness. Concerns raised by vulnerable or marginalised groups, especially those related to 
environmental, social, or economic matters, are systematically gathered and shared with the Board’s ESG Committee 
for review. This process ensures that the Company’s strategies and actions are responsive to the needs of these 
groups.
	
Furthermore, the Company’s CSR Committee plays a pivotal role in reviewing and providing strategic guidance 
on corporate social responsibility initiatives. This committee ensures that the concerns of vulnerable stakeholders 
are incorporated into the Company’s CSR practices, aligning them with broader goals of community welfare and 
inclusion. Through these structured channels, the Company addresses the concerns of marginalised groups and 
takes concrete actions to support their well-being and empowerment. However, no such instances were recorded 
during the reporting year.

4.	
Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues 
caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, the Company has defined a framework for addressing human rights concerns that may arise from its operations. 
At the core of this framework is a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism, overseen by the Human Resources 
department, which serves as the first point of contact for any workplace-related issues. Complementing this is an 
open-door policy that allows employees to escalate matters directly to senior management without procedural 
barriers.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues
	
The Company has put in place comprehensive internal systems to address grievances relating to human rights in a 
fair and transparent manner. A dedicated grievance mechanism is available to both employees and workers, offering 
a structured channel to voice concerns without fear of bias or retaliation. To reinforce accountability, the Company 
also operates a Whistleblower Policy, which allows individuals including stakeholders, employees and workers to 
confidentially report unethical conduct, suspected fraud or breaches of its Code of Conduct to a designated officer. 
This policy not only protects the identity of the complainant but also ensures that every report is taken seriously and 
addressed appropriately. These mechanisms collectively reflect the Company’s commitment to fostering a respectful, 
safe and rights-based workplace environment.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
	
The Company has instituted a comprehensive Prohibition of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy aimed at preventing 
and addressing any incidents of workplace harassment or discrimination. To ensure effective handling of such 
issues, an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) has been established. This committee is responsible for investigating 
complaints related to harassment, with a strict policy of maintaining the confidentiality of the complainant throughout 
the process. Additionally, the Company’s Whistleblower Policy offers protection to individuals who report unethical 
behaviour, ensuring a safe and confidential environment for all employees to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.

5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation. 
	
At the Guwahati unit, a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) with a capacity of 7.5 kiloliters per day (KLD) and a 20,000-liter 
Rainwater Harvesting Tank have been installed as part of the Company’s commitment to responsible water 
management. While the unit has not yet achieved Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), the STP follows a structured treatment 
process:
1.	
Raw Sewage Collection:
	
Incoming sewage is first directed into a collection tank designed to trap coarse and floating solids. This 
preliminary stage prevents clogging of pumps and infrastructure, ensuring smooth operation of subsequent 
treatment phases. It also minimises the risk of sludge buildup at disposal sites in cases where only primary 
treatment is performed.
2.	
Biological Treatment:
	
The collected sewage is then processed in a biological tank, where microbial activity forms the core of the 
treatment process. Microorganisms such as bacteria degrade organic matter, while protozoa help maintain 
balance in microbial populations. To sustain microbial efficiency, nutrients such as DAP and urea are introduced 
every three days.
3.	
Clarification:
	
The partially treated wastewater moves into a clarifier tank. This component allows solid impurities to settle, 
forming a sludge layer at the bottom. A mechanical scraper collects the settled sludge, while floating debris 
(scum) is separated from the surface, resulting in clarified water suitable for further treatment.
4.	
Filtration:
	
The clarified water undergoes advanced filtration using an iron filter and a carbon filter. Chlorine dosing is 
performed before filtration to enhance efficiency. The iron filter removes iron content, while the carbon filter, 
using granular activated carbon (GAC), adsorbs organic contaminants and residual chemicals.
	
At the Nalagarh facility, while ZLD is yet to be fully adopted, a functional STP has been set up with the following 
components:
i	
Collection Tank:
	
Wastewater is first gathered in a holding tank, enabling temporary storage and stabilisation.
ii	
Biological Treatment:
	
This stage involves aeration using twin lobe blowers and diffusers that introduce oxygen from the base of 
the tank. The biological degradation process is supported either by synthetic media or complete mixing 
systems, reducing the organic load. The resulting mixture flows into a secondary clarifier, where solids settle 
at the bottom. This sludge is partly recycled to maintain optimal MLSS levels, while the excess is dried and 
repurposed as manure. The clarified effluent is then transferred for tertiary treatment.
iii	
Tertiary Treatment:
	
In the final stage, the treated water passes through a dual media filter system containing sand and carbon. 
This ensures further removal of fine suspended and dissolved impurities. The fully treated effluent is reused 
for landscaping and plantation activities within the premises.

The Company follows a structured and responsible waste management process involving various specialised 
agencies for the collection and disposal of different waste types. All plastic waste is systematically recycled, avoiding 
landfill contribution. E-waste is managed through entities authorised by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), 
while hazardous waste is handled in accordance with guidelines set by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). 
Non-hazardous waste is disposed of through the local Municipal Board. Additionally, the Company has implemented 
in-house composting for canteen waste using a dedicated composting machine, reinforcing its commitment to 
sustainable and eco-friendly practices.
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes
	
At both the Guwahati and Nalagarh facilities, the Company has implemented structured waste management 
practices to ensure responsible disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials. Hazardous waste—including 
used oil, grease, residual ink, paints, ink-contaminated rags, gloves, empty chemical containers, and ink drums—is 
collected and safely stored in designated hazardous waste yards. These materials are clearly labeled and handled 
using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) before being transferred to authorised disposal agencies, in 
full compliance with regulatory norms.
	
For non-hazardous waste such as worn-out PPE, process residues, packaging materials, and discarded mechanical 
parts, the Company utilises a separate scrap yard for temporary storage. These materials are then routed through 
certified scrap dealers for responsible disposal or recycling.
	
To minimise the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals in its operations, the Company continually evaluates and 
refines its processes. The focus remains on adopting safer alternatives and reducing chemical dependence wherever 
feasible, thereby promoting a safer workplace and minimising environmental impact.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Waste Segregation 
and Compliance
Dedicated storage areas have been created 
for different categories of waste, which are 
disposed of through authorised recyclers 
in accordance with Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) and Plastic Waste 
Management (PWM) regulations. Waste 
is primarily classified into Dry and Wet 
categories, and further subdivided into types 
such as Electronic, Plastic, Chemical, and 
Metal.
Improved waste management efficiency 
and environmental compliance have 
been achieved. Different types of waste 
are managed separately, minimising 
environmental risks. Authorised disposal 
ensures 
adherence 
to 
legal 
and 
sustainable recycling practices
2
Waste Minimisation 
Training
Multiple awareness sessions have been 
organised to educate employees on the 
importance of waste reduction at the source, 
segregation practices, and the consequences 
of improper waste handling.
These training sessions have led to better-
informed employees and enhanced 
waste segregation practices. As a result, 
the accuracy and effectiveness of waste 
disposal have significantly improved.
3
Installation of Sewage 
Treatment plant
The Company has implemented a Sewage 
Treatment Plant (STP) designed to recycle 
and reuse wastewater. The system involves 
anaerobic and aerobic treatment processes 
that purify wastewater for non-potable reuse, 
such as in landscaping and industrial cooling.
The STP has yielded environmental and 
operational benefits by reducing the 
demand for freshwater, lowering water 
consumption 
costs, 
and 
promoting 
sustainable water reuse practices.
4
Environmental 
Training and SOPs
Environmental 
awareness 
and 
waste 
management training sessions have been 
regularly conducted. Standard Operating 
Procedures 
(SOPs) 
are 
maintained 
to 
guide employees in their day-to-day waste 
handling responsibilities.
These 
initiatives 
have 
resulted 
in 
enhanced employee awareness, reduced 
training gaps, optimised resource use, 
and minimised waste generation through 
better internal practices.
5
Green Cover 
Enhancement through 
Plantations
On occasions like World Environment Day, 
the 
Company 
promotes 
environmental 
awareness through tree plantation drives 
and green initiatives. These activities are part 
of ongoing efforts to improve the ecological 
balance.
Plantation drives have contributed to a 
greener, healthier work environment and 
have improved the visual and ecological 
quality 
of 
the 
workplace 
through 
increased biodiversity and beautification.
6
Water Conservation 
Measures
Several initiatives have been introduced to 
promote water efficiency, including repairing 
leaks, installing water level sensors, using 
pressmatic taps, implementing rainwater 
harvesting systems, and recycling water 
through STP.
These 
measures 
have 
significantly 
enhanced water conservation. Outcomes 
include 
minimised 
water 
wastage, 
optimised water use, and reduced 
dependence on freshwater sources, 
supporting long-term sustainability.
7
Energy Efficiency 
Improvements
The Company has replaced traditional 
lighting with energy-efficient LED lights and 
installed automated timers for street lighting 
to reduce energy consumption.
These 
actions 
have 
improved 
overall 
energy 
efficiency 
across 
operations and contributed to lower 
electricity consumption and reduced 
environmental impact.
