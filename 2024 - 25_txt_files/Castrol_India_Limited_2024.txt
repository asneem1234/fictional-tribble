Governance
Risk
CIL is part of the bp 
group with its corporate 
governance framework 
and code of ethics.
Key aspects of CIL 
governance
processes are:
Clear statements of 
Board processes and 
Board relationships with 
executive management, 
set of Company’s beliefs 
and purpose embedded in 
the Code of conduct. It lays 
down the expectations for 
safe operations, people, 
working with our business 
partners, government 
and communities and our 
commitment to maintain 
the integrity of assets and 
financial information of the 
Company.
Negative –
CIL is committed 
to responsible 
governance 
that underlines 
its dedication 
to responsible 
business practices, 
ensuring adherence 
to regulatory 
standards, ethical 
principles, and 
stakeholder 
expectations 
with the evolving 
dynamic and 
regulatory 
landscape.

Risk 
Management
Risk
Risk management has 
a significant impact 
on an organization’s 
ability to achieve its 
objectives. Identifying 
and managing risks 
proactively is essential 
to ensure success of the 
Company.
CIL has adopted bp’s Risk 
Management policy, which 
outlines the identification 
and assessment of safety 
and operational risks. These 
primarily include hazards 
that could potentially harm 
people and the environment. 
The policy also emphasizes 
the necessity of maintaining 
a risk register.
CIL has a risk-governance 
structure, which consists 
of the Risk Management 
Committee (RMC) that 
oversees risks and/
or opportunities from 
both business and ESG 
perspectives. This process 
is aptly supported by 
departmental heads.
Negative –
Failure in 
managing risks can 
lead to unexpected 
financial losses, 
compliance fines, 
reputational 
damage, and 
missed growth 
opportunities.

Privacy and 
Data Security
Risk
Cyber threats are a real 
risk for business today 
to conduct business 
with its stakeholders in 
a secure environment 
without compromising 
on digital security of 
information and data 
used in conduct of 
business operations.
CIL’s digital security team 
collaborates with business 
units to assess security 
risks, provide training, and 
disseminate information 
that encourages safe 
behaviors among users and 
safeguards the business 
from data breaches.
The Digital Security team 
has created a series of 
‘cyber moments’ that are 
integrated into meetings 
and other gatherings to 
increase awareness of the 
cyber threats faced by CIL.
Negative - 
Cybersecurity 
breaches could 
put CIL, as well as 
its customers, at 
significant risk and 
cause reputational 
damage.
15.
Technology 
and 
Innovation
Opportunity Leverage technology 
and innovation 
to enhance the 
digital experience 
for customers and 
consumers, and to 
gain operational 
advantages.
As part of its digitalization 
strategy, the Company 
continues to implement 
digital initiatives such as 
FASTSCAN, Castrol SMART, 
Castrol DIGICLAIM, Castrol 
Connect and the new 
Rural DMS (Distributor 
Management System). 
These applications enable 
streamlining of customer 
experiences across 
channels, enhance sales 
conversations and reduce 
manual interventions in 
claim processing, thereby 
reducing time spent on non-
value addition activities and 
releasing working capital 
for customers and channel 
partners.
Positive - 
Technology can 
enhance work 
efficiency, expand a 
business’s customer 
reach and increase 
convenience. 
Additionally, it can 
help with accurate 
time tracking and 
business growth.

abstain from participating in the Board/Committee meetings on matters in which they are interested or deemed to be 
interested. These disclosures help the Company and the Board of Directors in evaluating the possibility of any present 
or potential conflict of interest.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board:
	
At CIL, stakeholder consultation plays a critical role in identifying and addressing economic, environmental, and 
social concerns. The Risk Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for overseeing CIL’s sustainability agenda. 
Stakeholders are engaged to consider and understand the broader environmental, social and governance contexts in 
which the company operates and its associated risks.
	
Each department deals with its respective stakeholders and collects feedback on various issues. These delegated 
departments engage in several forms of stakeholder consultation which may involve surveys, focus groups, public 
consultations, individual meetings, annual general meetings, or online engagements. The purpose is to gather 
thoughts, opinions, and concerns on various topics related to the organization’s operations impacting economy, 
environment, and society. All key points, concerns, and suggestions raised during these consultations are documented 
and analyzed to understand the concerns of stakeholders, their potential impacts, and possible responses. Regular 
reports summarizing the feedback from these consultations and analyses are submitted to various committees of the 
Board for their review. The guidance from these reviews is then passed down to the management for execution.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes/No)? If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity:
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is indeed used to support the identification and management of environmental and 
social topics. Stakeholder consultations play an instrumental role in helping us understand their concerns, expectations 
and the potential impact of our operations on them. This process is critical in evolving our policies and activities for 
inclusive growth and sustainable development.
	
We consistently engage in consultations with stakeholders in a variety of ways. Regular needs study, and impact 
assessments are undertaken as an integral part of our commitment to the community. This includes continuous 
updates to technical modules, based on feedback from local communities and to keep pace with external technological 
advancements.

Moreover, we strive to maintain ongoing dialogue with communities and stakeholders, ensuring our services remain 
relevant and beneficial; example introduction of health and wellbeing programs, EV readiness training to mechanics 
and financial/digital literacy training to truck drivers.
	
In summary, stakeholder consultation significantly influences the shaping of our policies and activities towards social 
and environmental issues, allowing us to balance our business objectives with our commitment to our stakeholders, 
society and the environment.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups:
	
At CIL, we believe that we have a responsibility to bring enduring positive value to communities we work with. In line 
with our core theme to keep India moving, we have and will continue to build enduring and engaging relationships with 
key stakeholders in the mobility sector.
	
	
The Company’s CSR efforts are directed towards mechanics and truck drivers who play a significant role in 
keeping the wheels of this sector moving. Truck drivers carry most freight traffic in the country, while mechanics 
service one of the largest automotive markets in the world. However, their skills, livelihood opportunities and 
socio-economic conditions need more focus. At CIL, we are committed to making a positive impact in the lives of 
these truck drivers and mechanics by preparing them to face today’s reality and leverage tomorrow’s opportunity. 
More than 5,00,000 truck drivers and mechanics have benefited from these programmes. Contributing to the 
overall empowerment and upliftment of this community, enabling them to earn a sustainable livelihood and live 
with pride is the key motto of CIL’s CSR programmes - Sarathi Mitra and Eklavya.
	
	
The Company continues to engage with the communities around its plant and other areas of presence through 
various community development programmes ‘Ujjwal Kal’ focused on upskilling and education. Our employees 
engage with the community to conduct awareness sessions on water, sanitation, health and personal hygiene.

A formal Human Rights Policy was launched in 2013 and has been revised in 2020 which applies to every employee 
and worker at bp / Castrol. There are many ways in which human rights issues might be associated with our activities, 
including impacts on people’s livelihoods, access to water, land and resources, workforce rights – including modern 
slavery, and the actions of the security personnel who protect our sites. Applicable aspects in the Human rights policy 
such as child labor, discrimination, harassment and working conditions are covered as a part of mandatory Code 
of Conduct training for all employees and workers at CIL. Principles on Labour Rights and Modern Slavery (LRMS) 
such as clear employment status, protection of young persons, freedom from forced labour, grievance process, 
work environment, freedom of association training is also provided to all employees and contractors across the 
manufacturing facilities on an annual basis.

Corporate Overview
	
Our actions and operations can also bring about major benefits and improvements to individuals, communities and 
society. bp wants to contribute to sustainable development and is working to do more to support the delivery of the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We also recognize the importance of a just transition as envisaged by the 
Paris Agreement – one which delivers decent work, quality jobs and supports the livelihoods of local communities. We 
aim to actively advocate for policies that support net zero. This includes encouraging the use of finance and revenues 
from carbon pricing to support the just transition. To deliver our purpose we must continue to work to a consistent and 
high set of standards wherever we operate in the world. There will be instances where we won’t get it right, and we will 
need the support and challenge of others to help us make a positive, and sustainable difference to people’s lives. The 
policy document (link below) further details bp’s Commitment, Delivery and Governance which has been put in place.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
	
CIL has been continuously working to reduce freshwater consumption in its manufacturing facilities. Initiatives such 
as sprinkler systems and water-efficient taps have been implemented. Each facility has water balance flow charts to 
monitor freshwater usage and identify conservation measures. Water audits are conducted at one of the plants, and 
the outcomes are shared across plants for implementation.
	
Silvassa: Fresh water is used only for domestic and boiler operations. The boiler blowdown water, which is minimal in 
quantity, is sent to CETP for treatment. The domestic wastewater is treated in an in-house sewage treatment plant, and 
the treated water is used for gardening within the plant premises. This plant operates as a Zero Liquid Discharge facility. 
The plant has also installed rainwater harvesting system which is expected to operate at capacity the following year.
	
The Paharpur and Patalganga plants send their wastewater to CETP for further treatment.

Business Continuity Plan: Failure to address an incident effectively could potentially disrupt our business. A robust Crisis 
Management process enables us to address any incident or issues (safety, environment or product quality) which may 
escalate into an internal or external crisis. We have a detailed Business Continuity Plan (BCP), Incident Management 
Plan, Crisis Communication Plan, Emergency Response Plan and Tactical Management Plan for all sites. Regular 
annual trainings and exercises are conducted for team members in charge of the above plans in case of emergencies. 
A detailed Business Continuity Plan provides guidance on the actions to be taken to remain operational at acceptable 
levels, during and after a disruptive event, and to resume normal operations as quickly and effectively as possible. The 
BCP includes eight possible business disruptions and has detailed contingency strategies and action plans to mitigate 
them.
	
Incident Management Plan: CIL has an Incident Management Plan (IMP) that outlines broadly the guidelines for 
emergency response and incident escalation and management. The IMP is applicable across CIL’s operations 
(manufacturing units and offices). The Incident Management Team (IMT) operates in line with the IMP. The response 
of the IMT is defined through a structured process flowchart aligned to BP 3 Tier Response System. The primary role 
of the IMT is to verify safety of responders, manage incident impacts, direct emergency response to the incident and 
brief the BST (Business Support Team) and/or CST (Country Support Team) on status response activities.
