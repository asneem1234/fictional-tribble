Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate 
positive 
or 
negative implications)
1
Water and 
Effluent 
Management
Risk
Water is required for both industrial 
and domestic functions in the 
Company. Some processes like 
paint booths are water intensive 
and require more quantity of fresh 
water. With the use of water, there 
will be generation of effluents which 
contains 
chemicals, 
dissolved 
and suspended solids. If this 
effluent discharge is untreated and 
disposed directly into waterbodies, 
or on land, it will adversely affect the 
aquatic life and land contamination. 
An overuse of water can deplete the 
nearby ground and surface water 
resources.
1.
	Analysing 
previous 
year's 
consumption 
of 
freshwater 
and setting targets to reduce 
it by adopting water efficient
processes and projects.
2.
	Investing in advanced water 
treatment technologies that 
can increase the utilisation 
of treated wastewater and 
can reduce the fresh water 
consumption.
3.
	Initiating projects for rainwater
harvesting and ground water
recharge 
for 
replenishing
the 
water 
levels 
inside
plant 
premises. 
Rainwater
harvesting with the help of
filtration technology, can be
used for both domestic and
industrial processes.
Negative: In the absence of 
efficient water management, 
additional 
procurement 
of freshwater can lead to 
increased production cost. 
Improper treatment of effluent 
and unmonitored discharge 
can lead to non-compliance 
with 
environmental 
regulations which results in 
hefty fines and legal cost.
2
Greenhouse 
Gas 
Emissions 
and Climate 
Change 
Management
Risk
Manufacturing phase of automotive 
sector is one of the contributors 
of Greenhouse gases (GHG). 
Since this company consumes 
significant number of raw materials 
and is involved in energy intensive 
processes like foundry / painting, 
it is a major source of GHGs and 
contributes 
in 
Global 
climate 
change. Adapting processes with 
lower GHG intensity can lead to 
higher operational cost.
1.
	Initiatives to invest in projects
involving renewable energy like 
solar energy/ wind - captive or
open access.
2.
	Setting goals and commitments 
to reduce the emission such 
as Net zero GHG emission in
operation by 2050.
3.
	Adopting best practices for 
energy 
consumption 
and 
emission 
reduction 
and
complying with environmental
standards.
Negative: 
There 
is 
a 
significant 
need 
for 
capital 
to 
adopt 
new 
technologies and prepare 
for upcoming mandates. Any 
noncompliance with these 
mandates can increase the 
risk of penalties and legal 
expenses, 
damaging 
the 
Company’s reputation and 
financial implication.
Opportunity
Carbon footprint reduction can 
be brought forward by decrease 
of energy and fuel consumption 
thereby reducing overall resource 
intake. Gradual and consistent 
approaches in reducing footprint 
can ultimately help achieve carbon 
neutrality. This further helps to 
mitigate climate change.
Not applicable
Positive: Efforts to reduce 
emission improves resource 
efficiency and helps in cost 
saving. Investing in low 
emission technologies can 
reduce operational cost and 
bring forth profit in the long 
run by reducing resource 
intake. Achieving carbon foot 
print improves the reputation, 
encouraging 
stakeholders 
and consumers to invest 
more.

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Carbon 
emission 
is 
directly 
associated with energy consumption 
of any entity. Processes like 
welding, painting and assembly are 
the core functions in an automobile 
industry 
which 
are 
energy 
consuming. By developing energy 
efficient technologies there will be 
a substantial decrease in emission 
and also lowers operational cost 
related to energy. Transitioning from 
fossil fuels to renewable energy will 
lower energy cost and help to offset 
/ reduce carbon footprint of the 
Company.
Not applicable
Positive: Lowering carbon 
emission 
by 
substituting 
nonrenewable energy with 
renewable energy improves 
sustainability 
credentials 
which 
further 
promotes 
brand 
reputation 
among 
environmentally 
conscious 
consumers and stakeholders. 
Renewable energy projects 
implementation 
attracts 
reduction in overall cost of 
energy which can lead to 
overall profit for the Company.
4
Biodiversity
Risk
Expansion of company causes 
habitat 
destruction 
and 
fragmentation 
subsequently 
manufacturing process can pollute 
the environment creating imbalance 
in eco system. Extraction of raw 
materials 
such 
as 
aluminum, 
iron, lithium for batteries causes 
deforestation, soil degradation and 
pollution leading to a gradual loss of 
bio diversity. This may cause legal 
implications from regulatory bodies 
and can cause loss of reputation.
1.
	Considering bio diversity while
managing supply chain can 
positively impact in reducing 
environmental footprint.
2.
	Planting trees across the 
Company’s 
property 
can 
improve the ecological balance.
3.
	Rejuvenation of natural water 
bodies in water catchment 
areas of operations can support 
to improvement of aquatic bio
diversity.
Negative: 
Building 
a 
sustainable 
supply 
chain 
which 
causes 
minimal 
environmental impact can 
impose a huge financial 
burden on the Company. 
High 
investments 
are 
necessary for bio diversity 
restoration projects, inability 
to resolve issues with respect 
to tampering of eco system 
can lead to legal implications 
and fines. With increasing 
environmental 
awareness 
among stakeholders, failing 
to comply with environmental 
regulations can decrease 
investors due to reputation 
loss.
5
Waste 
Management
Risk
Automotive sector uses diverse 
materials for manufacturing process 
which creates equally diverse waste 
products such as scrap metals, 
solvents, oils, plastic etc. Different 
methods are used for the disposal 
of each category of waste, which 
attracts cost for disposal especially 
hazardous 
waste. 
Improper 
disposal can lead to water and 
land contamination and emission 
of greenhouse gases contributing 
to 
environmental 
degradation. 
Regulations 
regarding 
waste 
disposal are complex to follow and 
extremely costly.
1.
	Proper monitoring, segregation
and 
storage 
of 
waste, 
increasing 
the 
awareness 
on the importance of waste 
management 
among 
employees / workers.
2.
	Implementation of recycling 
programmes
3.
	Adopting 
waste 
reduction 
strategies 
and 
disposal 
methods 
with 
lower 
environmental impact.
Negative: 
Developing 
infrastructure required for 
waste 
management 
and 
recycling 
programmes 
requires 
large 
initial 
investments. 
Improper 
disposal of waste can lead to 
legal implications, hefty fines 
and penalties, and significant 
cost 
associated 
with 
environmental 
remediation 
processes. Failure to adhere 
with 
waste 
management 
regulations can harm the 
brand image and subsequent 
loss in investments.

6
Materials 
and Circular 
Economy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: A significant quantity of 
rare earth and critical minerals 
are required as a raw material 
in the manufacturing process in 
automotive industry. Due to lack of 
viable substitutes any disruption in 
supply chain in the case increase 
in demand or market competition 
can cause a financial burden. 
Scarcity in these materials can 
force the industry to invest in cost 
intensive alternate technologies or 
procurement through higher cost.
Opportunity: 
Recycling 
and 
reusing materials in manufacturing 
reduces the dependency on new 
raw materials, reduce wastage 
and also significantly decreases 
production cost. For materials 
like Lithium used in batteries, 
recycling makes less dependency 
on volatile supply chains. Reduced 
procurement of raw material further 
reduces overall carbon footprint and 
lowers the impact on environment.
1.	
Reusing or recycling these 
materials and introducing them 
back into the process decrease 
the raw material usage and 
reduce material waste.
2.	
Focusing on technologies that 
optimise the use of materials 
throughout production.
3.	
Collaborating with suppliers 
with more transparency and 
ethical sourcing in order to 
avoid shortage in supply due to 
conflicts or legal implications.
Negative: 
Supply 
chain 
disruptions 
can 
increase 
overall cost, primarily in 
production. If critical materials 
are unavailable, operational 
delays may occur, leading to 
a stoppage in production and 
a loss of revenue.
Positive: Recycling materials 
and reusing them instead 
of procuring raw materials 
is cost effective and overall 
reduces 
procurement 
expenses. Expensive waste 
management processes can 
be reduced or avoided by 
recycling materials instead 
of discarding them. Reduced 
supply chain dependencies 
result 
in 
fewer 
financial 
disruption. Material circularity 
can improve the sustainability 
performance 
and 
be 
competitive in market also 
attracting more investors.
7
Employee 
Well-being 
and 
Development
Opportunity
Investing 
in 
the 
well-being, 
continuous 
development, 
personal and professional growth 
of employees helps foster a 
competent work force and increase 
job 
satisfaction. 
Employees 
who receive training and skill 
development feels supported in 
their progress and are more likely to 
stay hence reducing turnover rates. 
well trained and engaged work 
force overall increases productivity 
and business performance.
Not applicable
Positive: 
Reduction 
in 
turnover rates can decrease 
recruitment 
and 
training 
cost. Stable and experienced 
workforce 
translates 
to 
higher level of productivity 
which 
boosts 
overall 
business 
performance. 
Positive employee relation 
encourages 
collaboration, 
innovation and knowledge 
sharing 
which 
helps 
to 
improve 
operational 
efficiency, attracts and retain 
talent.
8
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
By creating an environment where 
people from various backgrounds, 
perspectives, and experiences feel 
welcome and valued, companies 
can attract a broader pool of talent. 
Diversity enriches the workforce 
and enhances the innovation and 
creativity. Inclusivity contributes 
to positive work environment and 
strengthen employee engagement 
and morale. Promoting gender 
equality and implementing fair and 
equitable 
employment 
policies 
further solidifies an organisation’s 
commitment to social responsibility 
and long-term sustainability.
Not applicable
Positive: Diverse workforce 
increases 
the 
overall 
reputation of the Company 
and thereby attracting talent. 
Inclusive work environment 
improves the morale of 
employees and increases 
employee 
engagement, 
ultimately resulting in lower 
turnover rates.

environment, 
coupled with non-compliance to 
safety protocols by employees 
and business partners can risk the 
reputation of company. Neglecting 
safety standards causes employee 
causalities which ultimately affects 
the morale of the employee and dips 
productivity. Work place accidents 
create negative image leading to 
decrease of trust from stakeholders 
like employees.
1.
	Adapting 
various 
practices 
for 
risk 
reduction 
like 
elimination, 
substitution 
engineering / administrative

functions in the process of
proactive 
engagement 
for
safety 
and 
identifications
of 
hazards 
and 
mitigate
associated risk.
Negative: 
Work 
place 
hazards 
and 
accidents 
give rise to significant legal 
liabilities 
and 
substantial 
fines. 
Unsafe 
working 
conditions affects the morale 
of 
employees 
thereby 
reducing 
productivity, 
impacts business. Subpar 
safety records fails to attract 
new talent and reduces the 
chance of organisation at 
securing affordable insurance 
coverage.
10
Training and 
Development
Opportunity
Providing 
trainings 
for 
skill 
development 
and 
professional 
growth 
can 
enhance 
the 
competency of the workforce and 
is crucial for overall progress. 
Furthermore, turnover rates reduce 
with more opportunities for the 
employees to develop skills.
Not applicable
Positive: Employees being 
continuously 
trained 
are 
content with the organisation 
which leads to lower turnover 
rate and the costs related 
to it. This stability ensures 
satisfied employees to be 
productive 
and 
enhance 
business 
performance. 
Well 
trained 
employees 
play key role in driving 
innovation and increasing 
operational efficiency which 
boosts profitability. Training 
programmes 
minimise 
operational errors and in turn 
benefit company.
11
Customer 
Centricity
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Failure to meet customer 
expectation by not catering to 
changing preference create a situation 
risk of losing customer loyalty and 
market share.
Poor customer service can lead to 
legal action, negative publicity and 
diminished reputation. Unresolves 
customer 
complaints 
regarding 
issues related to vehicle can cause 
dissatisfaction and unattended vehicle 
safety issue leads to accidents leading 
to injuries, fatalities and costly recalls.
Opportunity: 
Understanding 
preferences 
and 
providing 
personalised 
solution 
leads 
to 
customer 
retention 
and 
loyalty. 
Aligning customer feedbacks with 
product development can lead to 
innovative technologies that helps 
stand out in market. Customer centric 
culture helps enhance customer 
satisfaction 
and 
improve 
brand 
perception and revenue growth.
1.
	Implementation of customer 
feedback channels, providing 
efficient customer service, both
pre- and post-sale will help in
an increased customer repeat
/ referral rate.
2.
	Engagements with customers 
through 
different 
channels, 
feedback analysis for product 
improvement shows that the 
Company is for the masses.
Negative: Failing to meet 
customer needs leads to 
losing of customers which 
directly impacts the revenue. 
Losing customer necessitates 
higher spending on marketing 
campaigns to acquire new 
customers. Poor customer 
service or product issues 
that lead to legal claims could 
result in costly settlements or 
legal fees.
Positive: 
Increased 
customer loyalty can lead to 
repeat purchases and stable 
revenue. Positive customer 
reviews can bring in new 
customers thereby reducing 
marketing expenses.

Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Effective corporate governance 
can help build trust with investors, 
employees, customers, and the 
public, improving the Company's 
overall reputation. Clear governance 
structures and processes enable 
better oversight and decision-
making to identify and mitigate risks 
more effectively. By maintaining 
ethical standards and transparency, 
corporate governance helps to 
prevent legal implications that could 
harm the Company’s reputation.
Not applicable
Positive: Strong corporate 
governance improves access 
to 
capital 
by 
attracting 
investors. Effective corporate 
governance structures lead 
to more informed, strategic 
decision-making. This helps 
to 
optimise 
operations, 
reduce 
inefficiencies, 
and 
identify 
profitable 
opportunities, 
ultimately 
improving 
profitability. 
Adhering 
to 
governance 
best practices ensures that 
the Company is compliant 
with all relevant laws and 
regulations, reducing the risk 
of legal penalties, fines, and 
litigation costs.
13
Business 
Ethics
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: A failure to adhere to 
ethical standards can lead to 
negative publicity, tarnishing the 
Company’s reputation. Corruption 
and 
unethical 
behavior 
can 
lead to resource misallocation, 
environmental damage, and human 
rights 
abuses, 
damaging 
the 
Company’s reputation. If perceived 
as unethical, customers may lose 
trust in the brand, which can lead to 
a decline in customer loyalty.
Opportunity: 
Ethical 
behavior 
fosters trust and credibility with 
customers, employees, and the 
broader 
community. 
Operating 
ethically helps to build long-term 
relationships 
with 
customers. 
Clear and transparent disclosures 
enable rating agencies to evaluate 
organisations effectively. By openly 
sharing 
organisational 
details, 
companies can enhance their ESG 
scores.
1.
	Ethics training within different 
employee 
teams, 
creation 
of ethics code within the 
organisation and conducting 
regular 
ethics 
audits 
will 
ensure business ethics being 
seriously followed within the 
organisation.
2.
	Promoting 
a 
culture 
of 
accountability 
within 
the 
organisation, 
serious 
consequences for violations 
and encouragement of ethical
decision making at all levels of
the firm.
Negative: Implementing and 
maintaining business ethics 
standards 
often 
involves 
significant 
investments 
in 
training, 
audits, 
and 
legal 
consultations. 
Non-
compliance 
with 
ethical 
standards, 
especially 
in 
areas like labor practices, 
environmental 
regulations, 
or anti-corruption laws, can 
result in legal consequences, 
including fines, penalties, and 
lawsuits.
Positive: Ethical business 
practices can attract socially 
responsible 
investors 
and 
those 
focused 
on 
environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) criteria. 
Ethical business tends to 
retain their customers leading 
to repeat business and higher 
lifetime 
customer 
value. 
Ethical practices often align 
with operational efficiencies, 
such as reducing waste, 
improving energy efficiency, 
and 
sourcing 
sustainable 
materials, which can lower 
costs over time.

Opportunity
Offering differentiated products, 
businesses 
can 
attract 
new 
customers, create new revenue 
streams, and gain a competitive 
edge. A successful R&D strategy 
enables businesses to capture 
market share, both in their current 
industry and in new sectors. 
Developing new technology can 
boost efficiency in process, reduce 
cost in production and lower 
emissions.
Not applicable
Positive: 
By 
investing 
in R&D, businesses can 
unlock long-term financial 
rewards. Successful R&D 
efforts lead to products that 
generate significant revenue 
over 
extended 
periods. 
Streamlining 
operations 
and 
improving 
product 
development cycles can lead 
to cost savings, reduced 
time-to-market, and improved 
profitability. A strong brand 
reputation built on R&D can 
attract customers, investors, 
and partners, contributing 
to increased sales, better 
investor relations, and more 
strategic 
collaboration. 
Proactive engagement of 
R&D will ensure the product

15
Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Unsustainable 
practices, 
such as over-reliance on natural 
resources or unethical sourcing, can 
make the supply chain vulnerable 
to external disruptions such as 
natural 
disasters, 
geopolitical 
tensions, or climate change. An 
unsustainable supply chain can 
raise concerns about a company's 
long-term viability and governance. 
Non-compliance with regulations 
related to sustainable supply chain 
management can lead to legal 
issues, fines and negative impact 
on the goodwill of the company.
Opportunity: 
By 
adopting 
sustainable 
supply 
chain 
practices, companies are better 
prepared to comply with evolving 
environmental 
regulations 
and 
international 
sustainability 
standards. A sustainable supply 
chain is more resilient to disruptions 
such 
as 
resource 
shortages, 
climate change, or social unrest. 
Incorporating ESG factors into the 
supply chain directly minimises 
operational risks, reduces costs, 
and helps lower the environmental 
impact.
1.
	Drafting strong supplier code 
of conduct and strictly adhering
to it can minimise the risk 
associated with it.
2.
	Screening and assessment 
of suppliers based on various
ESG parameters.
Negative: 
Ensuring 
compliance and implementing 
sustainable 
practices 
throughout the supply chain 
increases costs. Disruptions 
and environmental violations 
can lead to fines, production 
delays, and operational costs.
Positive: 
Sustainable 
supply 
chain 
practices, 
such as reducing energy 
consumption, 
cutting 
waste, 
and 
optimizing 
transportation, can lead to 
substantial 
cost 
savings. 
By 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
environmental 
and 
sustainability 
standards 
which helps to avoid costly 
legal challenges and fines. 
Companies that incorporate 
sustainability into their supply 
chain are often seen as lower-
risk investments by socially 
responsible investors.

Data 
Privacy and 
cybersecurity
Risk
The 
increase 
in 
data 
and 
cybersecurity 
breaches 
poses 
significant risks, especially with 
online transactions and cloud 
computing. Protecting stakeholders’ 
data including customer data is 
essential to avoid operational 
disruptions 
and 
reputational 
damage. Failure to secure sensitive 
information can lead to financial 
losses, regulatory penalties, and 
erosion of customer trust, all 
of which can severely impact a 
company’s long-term success.
1.
	Implementation of advanced 
threat detection, security audits
on a regular basis, having a 
dedicated IT team working 
towards protecting customer 
information and data should be
stationed.
Negative: 
Data 
breach 
involving sensitive customer 
or business information can 
result in significant financial 
losses through fines, legal 
fees and compensation and 
business loss. Organisations 
that fail to comply with data 
privacy 
regulations 
and 
regional laws may be subject 
to hefty fines. Investment 
in cybersecurity measures, 
including upgraded security 
software, employee training, 
and the implementation of 
more secure systems can be 
a financial burden.
