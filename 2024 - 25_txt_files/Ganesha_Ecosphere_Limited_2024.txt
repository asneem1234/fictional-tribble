positive or negative 
implications)
1
Energy 
Consumption
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
The 
Company›s 
PET-to-polyester 
fibre 
conversion 
processes 
are inherently energy-
intensive, 
requiring 
substantial 
thermal 
and electrical inputs for 
melting, extruding, and 
spinning 
operations. 
Rising 
energy 
costs 
pose direct threats to 
operational margins in 
the recycling sector.
Opportunity: 
The 
predictable, continuous 
nature of the Company’s 
m a n u f a c t u r i n g 
operations 
creates 
favourable 
conditions 
for 
renewable 
energy 
integration, particularly 
solar installations, which 
can provide stable, long-
term cost advantages 
while 
enhancing 
the 
sustainability 
profile 
of 
recycled 
products 
demanded 
by 
eco-
conscious brands.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented a multi-
pronged 
energy 
optimization 
strategy 
e n c o m p a s s i n g : 
(i) 
deployment 
of 
solar 
photovoltaic 
systems 
to 
reduce 
grid 
dependency, 
(ii) 
installation of energy-
efficient machinery and 
heat recovery systems to 
minimize thermal losses, 
(iii) use of biomass in 
boiler and Thermopack 
applications, 
and 
(iv) 
exploration 
of 
power 
purchase 
agreements 
for 
renewable 
energy 
procurement to hedge 
against fossil fuel price 
volatility.
Negative: Energy cost 
inflation directly impacts 
per-unit 
production 
costs, with increases in 
energy prices potentially 
reducing gross margins 
moderately 
given 
energy’s 
significant 
share of total production 
costs.
Positive: 
Solar 
energy 
adoption 
can 
significantly 
reduce 
electricity costs over the 
long 
term, 
translating 
to considerable annual 
savings while creating 
carbon credit revenue 
opportunities.
2
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
The 
Company 
operates 
within 
a 
circular 
economy 
framework where post-
consumer 
PET 
waste 
represents both primary 
raw 
material 
and 
environmental solution. 
India’s 
Extended 
Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) regulations and 
corporate sustainability 
commitments 
create 
expanding 
demand 
for verified PET waste 
processing capabilities.
-
Positive: 
Waste 
processing 
margins 
improve 
significantly 
with scale, generating 
healthy gross margins 
on waste management 
services. 
Additional 
revenue streams from 
EPR credits and waste 
diversion 
certificates 
can contribute to overall 
profitability.

(R/O)
Rationale for identifying 
the risk / opportunity
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate
Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
The 
Company’s 
“Go 
Rewise” 
initiative 
positions it to capture 
value 
from 
the 
entire 
plastic 
waste 
ecosystem, 
from 
collection through end-
product manufacturing, 
addressing the critical 
gap between substantial 
waste 
generation 
and 
limited 
recycling 
capacity in India.
3
Materials 
Sourcing & 
Efficiency
Risk
The 
Company’s 
dependence on post-
consumer 
PET 
waste 
as 
primary 
feedstock 
creates 
supply 
chain 
vulnerabilities 
inherent 
to the informal waste 
economy. 
Competition 
from 
other 
recyclers, 
seasonal 
variations 
in 
waste 
generation, 
quality 
inconsistencies, 
and 
potential 
policy 
changes affecting waste 
export/import.
The Company mitigates 
sourcing risks through: 
(i)	
an 
extensive 
PET 
waste 
collection network, 
ensuring 
cost-
effective 
material 
acquisition; 
(ii)	 establishment 
of 
strategic inventory 
buffers to manage 
supply volatility.
Negative: 
Supply 
disruptions or substantial 
price increases in PET 
waste could moderately 
reduce gross margins. 
Raw 
material 
costs 
represent a significant 
majority 
of 
total 
production 
costs, 
making the Company 
highly sensitive to input 
price volatility.
4
Business Model 
Resilience
Opportunity
The 
Company’s 
integrated 
waste-to-
yarn 
model 
provides 
strategic 
flexibility 
in 
responding to evolving 
regulatory 
frameworks, 
including India’s Plastic 
Waste 
Management 
Rules, 
circular 
economy 
mandates, 
and 
international 
sustainability standards. 
The textile industry’s shift 
towards use of recycled 
content creates stable 
demand 
visibility 
as 
brands 
increasingly 
commit to substantial 
recycled 
polyester 
adoption.
-
Positive: 
Diversified 
product 
portfolio 
and 
market 
presence 
can 
generate 
consistent 
revenue 
growth 
annually 
while 
significantly 
reducing 
earnings 
volatility. 
Premium positioning in 
sustainable textiles can 
command 
meaningful 
price 
premiums 
over 
conventional 
recycled 
fibres, 
potentially 
increasing 
EBITDA 
margins.

The

Growing 
Demand for 
Sustainable 
Products
Opportunity
Global textile brands are 
increasingly mandating 
recycled 
content 
in 
their 
supply 
chains, 
driven 
by 
consumer 
preferences, regulatory 
requirements, 
and 
corporate sustainability 
commitments. 
The 
Company’s established 
position 
in 
high-
quality 
recycled 
polyester 
staple 
fibre 
production, 
combined 
with 
certifications 
and 
traceability 
capabilities, 
enables 
it to capture premium 
market 
segments 
where 
sustainability 
credentials 
translate 
directly 
into 
pricing 
power 
and 
volume 
growth opportunities.
-
Positive: 
Access 
to 
premium 
sustainable 
textile 
markets 
can 
generate 
higher 
realizations 
compared 
to commodity recycled 
fibres, 
potentially 
increasing 
annual

significantly. 
Brand partnerships and 
long-term 
contracts 
provide revenue visibility 
and 
reduce

Statement 
by 
director 
responsible 
for 
the 
business 
responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements
As the Director responsible for business responsibility, I am delighted to 
share our organization’s strides in tackling significant environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) challenges. Being a plastic waste 
recycler, we recognise our accountability towards the environment, 
society and the communities we serve.
At Ganesha Ecosphere (Company as well as Group level), our 
commitment to circularity is inseparable from our commitment to 
strong ESG performance. Over the past year, we have embedded 
resource 
efficiency, 
product 
stewardship, 
and 
responsible 
governance deeper into our operating model, treating ESG not as a 
compliance checkbox, but as the engine that powers reliable quality, 
resilient growth and long-term value creation. These strides are 
visible across how we source, process and deliver recycled PET, and 
how we engage our people and communities. 
Ganesha Ecosphere advanced its circular-packaging mission 
with meaningful, on-ground execution. We commissioned an 
additional rPET chips line at Warangal expanding bottle-to-bottle 
capacity, materially improving the availability of food-grade rPET 
for brands in India and abroad. This strengthens supply reliability, 
reduces dependence on virgin plastics, and deepens our product 
stewardship—translating 
sustainability 
intent 
into 
everyday 
manufacturing discipline.
Our progress earned external validation. A credit rating upgrade from 
CARE Ratings reflects stronger governance, risk management, and 
financial resilience—critical for funding circular growth responsibly. 
Recognition for “Go Rewise by Ganesha Ecosphere” at a leading 
plastics-recycling 
awards 
platform 
further 
underscores 
our 
innovation in bottle-to-bottle systems and our focus on verifiable 
quality for food-grade applications.
Taken 
together, 
these 
milestones 
position 
Ganesha

with a strong emphasis on engaging vendors and service providers who 
follow generally accepted Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) standards. 
Continuous efforts are made to enhance safety during transportation, 
improve logistics efficiency to further minimize climate impact.

The Company identifies and assesses work-related 
hazards on both routine and non-routine bases through 
periodic HIRA workshops at site/department level, 
which include SOP hazard reviews to validate steps, 
hazards, and controls. These are complemented by 
electrical safety audits and random load inspections 
with sampling audits to verify control effectiveness 
and surface emerging risks. For non-routine activities, 
a formal Permit-to-Work system is applied with pre-
job risk screens for hot work, confined space entry and 
work at height; Work-in-Progress boards are used 
to display active permits, key hazards, and required 
controls for real-time visibility and supervision.

Mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge:
Has the entity implemented 
a mechanism for Zero Liquid 
Discharge? If yes, provide 
details of its coverage and 
implementation.
The Company is endeavouring towards the implementation of a Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) framework within its water management systems. 
In alignment with its commitment to water stewardship and resource 
efficiency, proactive measures have been adopted to prevent potential 
contamination of water bodies and ensure sustainable water use across 
operations. Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STPs) are installed at each facility, employing multi-stage treatment 
processes to manage both process effluents and domestic wastewater. 
Treated water is subsequently recirculated for industrial applications, 
leading to a significant reduction in freshwater withdrawal. Each unit is 
equipped with advanced treatment infrastructure and integrated pollution 
control systems. Through these initiatives, the Company continues to 
demonstrate leadership in industrial water conservation and strengthen 
resilience towards long-term water risks in the regions where it operates.

energy sources, including solar power installations, was expanded. These 
initiatives contribute to lowering the Company’s GHG emission intensity, 
mitigating environmental risks linked to energy consumption and achieving 
cost efficiencies over the long term.

by 
your company to reduce

The Company adopts a circular approach to waste management, 
with PET plastic recycling at the core of its operations. Processes are 
designed to ensure that PET waste handled is 100% recyclable, resulting 
in negligible residual waste. All incoming materials undergo screening to 
confirm recyclability and any by-products generated during processing 
are systematically reprocessed.
No hazardous or toxic chemicals are used in PET plastic processing, 
reflecting both the inherent nature of operations and the Company’s 
commitment to safe and environmentally responsible manufacturing 
practices.
