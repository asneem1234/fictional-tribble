1.
Climate 
Change
Risk
Physical climate hazards such as 
floods and extreme weather can 
severely disrupt BPCL’s refining 
and marketing operations, logistics, 
and supporting infrastructure. At the 
same time, as the company moves 
forward with its decarbonization goals, 
transition risks driven by evolving 
regulations, shifting markets, and 
emerging technologies are becoming 
increasingly significant, potentially 
affecting the valuation of existing 
assets and requiring accelerated 
investment in energy transition 
alternatives.
As part of our strategic response 
to climate change risks, BPCL 
has adopted a comprehensive 
decarbonization pathway aimed 
at achieving Net-Zero Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions by 2040. 
Recognizing the inherent climate-
related risks associated with the oil 
and gas sector, we are implementing 
a robust mitigation framework 
focused on reducing operational 
carbon intensity, enhancing energy
Physical risks, such 
as climate-related 
disruptions, could 
lead to asset damage, 
increased maintenance 
costs, and unplanned 
operational downtime, 
potentially impacting 
revenue streams.

efficiency, and integrating low-
carbon and renewable energy 
solutions across our value chain. 
Our approach combines targeted 
emission reduction initiatives, 
deployment of clean technologies, 
and process innovation to ensure 
long-term business resilience and 
alignment with global climate goals.
Diesel Oil (LDO) and 
Furnace Oil (FO) could 
lead to a decline in 
petroleum product sales 
and underutilization of 
existing refining and 
distribution assets. High 
capital investments 
in traditional energy 
infrastructure may 
deliver reduced returns 
in a low-carbon future, 
while simultaneously, 
significant additional 
expenditure will be 
required to fund climate 
mitigation measures, 
including green 
hydrogen, renewable 
energy sourcing, 
and decarbonization 
technologies.
2.
GHG and 
other 
emissions
Opportunity
BPCL has been proactively managing 
its emissions by deploying multiple 
decarbonization levers. Through robust 
energy efficiency upgrades, including 
Energy Conservation (ENCON) 
schemes along with renewable energy 
installations now providing several 
hundred megawatts of captive power, 
alternate fuel solutions like bio-
CNG, biodiesel, and green hydrogen 
contributing to lowering carbon 
intensity across operations. Scaling 
these measures has already driven 
significant emissions reductions and 
sets the stage for resilience against 
future carbon pricing and asset 
stranding risks.
We aim to achieve Net-Zero 
for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions by 2040, aligning with the 
national goal of Net-Zero emissions 
by 2070. Our climate roadmap 
prioritizes scaling renewable energy, 
improving operational efficiency, 
accelerating technology adoption, 
and investing in green fuels. 
Positive Implications 
include reduction in 
emissions owing to the 
lower energy usage and 
increased operational 
efficiency.
3.
Energy use 
and transition
Opportunity
BPCL's efforts to transition to 
sustainable energy sources and 
optimize energy use are critical for 
reducing emissions and ensuring long-
term resilience. The evolving energy 
landscape presents opportunities 
through regulatory changes, market 
and technological disruptions, and 
emerging sources of energy. However, 
failure to adapt to changing energy 
landscapes could result in increased 
costs, penalties, and stranded assets.
Our ENCON schemes have played 
a pivotal role in reducing energy 
consumption across our refineries. 
Complementing this, initiatives 
aligned with the Biofuel Policy, Green 
Hydrogen development under the 
SIGHT program, battery storage 
solutions, and the expansion of EV 
charging infrastructure are actively 
supporting our energy transition 
journey. We have ongoing renewable 
energy projects with a capital outlay 
of I1,569.58 crore currently at 
various stages of implementation 
in FY 2024-25. Additionally, we 
have secured an incentive for green 
hydrogen production under the 
National Green Hydrogen Mission, 
further reinforcing our commitment to 
a low-carbon future.
Positive Implications 
include aligning 
with global energy 
transition trends, 
enhancing BPCL's 
competitiveness, 
mitigating climate 
related risks, 
adopting low-carbon 
technologies, and 
contributing to a 
sustainable energy 
future.
4.
Water 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical resource in various 
aspects of BPCL's operations, 
including refining processes and 
cooling systems. Effective water 
management is essential for ensuring 
sustainable operations, particularly in 
regions experiencing water scarcity.
Through effective water management 
strategies our total water withdrawal 
has reduced from 61,080 TKL in 
FY2023-24 to 57,003 TKL this year. 
We ensure constant investment 
in water saving initiatives and 
technologies.
Negative implications 
include risks such 
as water shortages, 
pollution incidents, 
and regulatory non-
compliance, which can 
impact operational 
continuity and 
stakeholder perception.

Recover, and Repurpose—to 
drive efficient waste management 
across our operations. Compliance 
with regulatory guidelines set by 
MoEF&CC, CPCB, and SPCB is 
central to our approach. Hazardous 
waste, including spent clay and 
oil-containing residues, is safely 
managed through approved 
Treatment, Storage, and Disposal 
Facilities (TSDF), ensuring 
environmentally responsible 
disposal.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
	
It gives me great pleasure to present Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the financial year 2024-25, prepared in line with SEBI’s requirements. This report is 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (Contd.)
210          Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited
a reflection of our unwavering commitment to responsible 
corporate citizenship and sustainable development.
	
The global energy ecosystem is undergoing a seismic 
transformation driven by the urgency of climate action, 
the imperative to foster equitable social progress, and 
the growing need for energy that is clean, accessible, 
and affordable. At BPCL, we see this transition not as 
a challenge, but as an opportunity to build a future-
ready organization that delivers clean, innovative, and 
inclusive energy solutions.
	
Guided by India’s climate commitments under the 
Panchamrit Action Plan, we have pledged to achieve 
Net-Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, well ahead 
of the national target of 2070. This ambition is backed 
by a wide spectrum of clean energy initiatives spanning 
renewable energy, green hydrogen, biofuels, carbon 
capture, energy efficiency, and circular economy 
solutions In line with our commitment to achieving net 
zero, we executed 45 energy conservation (ENCON) 
initiatives across our refineries during the reporting 
year, leading to a cumulative savings of over 40,000 
Metric Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (MTOE) and a reduction 
of 1,31,396 MTCO2e GHG emissions.
	
In the near term, our strategy is shaped by five key 
sustainability priorities: accelerating the transition 
to cleaner fuels, strengthening operational safety, 
advancing 
digitalization 
across 
HSSE 
systems, 
scaling renewable energy capacity, and decarbonizing 
refinery operations. FY 2024-25 was marked by 
meaningful progress across environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) dimensions. 
	
BPCL was ranked 10th globally in the Oil & Gas sector 
on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and received 
recognitions from CDP   (formerly Carbon Disclosure 
Project) and other leading industry platforms. In our 
continued push for renewable energy adoption, BPCL 
has installed capacity of 154.86 MW of renewable 
energy, including 143.06 MW from solar and 11.8 
MW from wind while an additional 171 MW is under 
development. Addition of another 150 MW through 
NTPC’s solar utility tender, marks a significant milestone 
in the ongoing expansion of our green energy portfolio. 
	
In our downstream operations, 12,244 out of 23,642 
Retail Outlets (ROs) have been solarized. Our 
ethanol blending program achieved its highest-ever 
rate at 16.35%. BPCL has planned for setting up  26 
Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants across the country 
for further strengthening our clean energy offerings 
We are also establishing 1G and 2G bio-refineries at 
Bargarh, Odisha, to process agricultural waste and 
surplus food grains into ethanol. The plant is under 
commissioning and ethanol production is expected to 
commence in September 2025.
	
In the electric mobility space, we established 3,428 new 
EV charging stations at ROs during the year, taking the 
cumulative total to 6,563. Strategic collaborations with 
OEMs such as Ola, Ather, and Hero were also forged 
to deploy fast-charging infrastructure for two-wheelers, 
accelerating our vision of a greener future.	
	
On circularity front, we achieved Zero Waste to Landfill 
(ZWL) certification across all operational sites. Our 
green cover expanded with the plantation of over 1.78 
Lakh trees during the year leading to total green cover 
of 12.18 Lakh trees. Our focused water- conservation- 
efforts led to a reduction in water withdrawal by over 
4,114 TKL   during the year. 
	
Occupational safety continues to be a core priority for 
BPCL. All our refineries collectively surpassed 125 
million   man-hours without any Lost Time Accident 
(LTA), a testament to our strong safety culture. This was 
supported by over 93,000 hours of extensive training 
covering functional & behavioral aspects across our 
refineries and the adoption of advanced technologies 
including drones, AI, robotics, and AR/VR-enabled 
modules to foster a proactive safety environment.
	
Year after year, we continue to strengthen our 
commitment to nation-building in alignment with India’s 
broader development agenda. In FY 2024-25, BPCL 
invested I179.37 crore in impactful CSR initiatives on 
Health & Sanitation, Education, Skill Development, 
Community 
Development, 
and 
Environmental 
Sustainability. Over the past 11 years, we have spent 
I1,658.95 crore to diverse CSR and community 
development programs, consistently creating long-term 
value and meaningful impact across society.
	
While our achievements are significant, we remain 
cognizant of the roads ahead. Navigating evolving 
regulatory landscapes, scaling emerging technologies, 
and ensuring a just transition across our value chain 
will require resilience and innovation. Backed by over I1 
Lakh crore investment roadmap through 2040, BPCL 
is poised to drive India’s energy transition in a more 
meaningful way.
	
Our focus remains on pioneering solutions in 
renewables, green hydrogen, biofuels, waste-to-energy, 
and digital HSSE systems. Continuous improvement 
is embedded in our operations through ISO-certified 
Integrated Management Systems (IMS) and lifecycle 
assessments. Guided by our mission of nation-building 
and our vision of "Energizing Lives," BPCL is evolving 
into a dynamic hub of innovation where diverse teams 
harness digital technologies, process intelligence, and 
new ideas to build a low-carbon future for India.
	
As we continue this journey, our aspiration remains 
firm: to be the most admired global energy company, 
delivering service excellence, advancing ecological 
stewardship, and shaping a resilient and inclusive 
future beyond energy.

2.  Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? 
(Yes/No) If yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes, the company has established well-defined process to avoid conflict of interests, wherein directors are required 
to disclose their interests through Form MBP-1 at Board meetings in line with the Companies Act, 2013. The Board is 
apprised of any transactions involving a director’s interest, following which the concerned director does not participate 
in the discussions on the matter. Additionally, BPCL has adopted a Code of Conduct for Board Members and Senior 
Management Personnel which mandates a declaration from directors to refrain from participating in any situation that 
directly or indirectly conflicts with the Company’s interests. The Code explicitly prohibits directors from making decisions 
on matters where a personal conflict of interest exists or is perceived. The Code of Conduct is available at: https://www.

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
	
	
Yes, BPCL has established several procedures and 
initiatives that reflect its commitment to sustainable 
sourcing, with a strong focus on inclusivity, safety, 
and responsible procurement practices.
	
	
BPCL adheres to the Public Procurement Policy 
for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE) Order, 2012 
and its subsequent amendments. During FY 2024-
25, the company’s total procurement of goods and 
services,  excluding items, which are beyond the 
scope of MSEs which inter alia include Crude Oil, 
Petroleum Products, logistics cost through shipping, 
Railways & Pipelines, LNG/Natural Gas, API Line 
pipes, OEM spares & services, proprietary items 
and services, Technology Licenses and Licensor 
mandated items, Plant & Machinery, where MSEs 
were eligible to participate stood at I10,136.27 
crore. Of this, procurement from MSEs amounted to 
I3,222.99 crore, achieving 31.80%, well above the 
mandated target of 25%. BPCL also facilitates early 
payments to its MSME vendors through the Trades 
Receivable Discounting System (TReDS).
	
	
The Organization, in its bid to enhance procurement 
from 
MSEs, 
participated 
in 
various 
Vendor 
Development Programs for MSEs organized by 
MSME Development and Facilitation Offices (DFOs), 
wherein over 1,800 vendors participated. The 
Company also organized two online Special Vendor 
Development Programs for MSE SC/ST and MSE 
Women BPCL vendors, who benefited from detailed 
presentations by the officials of MSME and National 
SC/ST Hub Office (NSSHO). In all these programs, 
vendors were invited and apprised of current and 
future business requirements of the Company as 
well as emerging trends/ technologies.
	
	
BPCL engages contractors for a wide range 
of services and recognizes its responsibility to 
ensure a safe and healthy work environment for 
all service providers. As part of the contractor 
selection and pre-qualification process, past safety 
performance and safety capability assessments 
are key evaluation criteria. Feedback on contractor 
performance is collected from all sites and routed 
through the Regional Environment Head (REH) to 
the Central Procurement Organization (CPO) for 
record maintenance and future reference.
	
	
The company is also working toward integrating 
broader environmental and social criteria into its 
procurement processes. Plans are underway to 
develop a supplier sustainability framework and 
conduct value chain assessments in the coming year.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced 
sustainably?
	
	
31.80% inputs were sourced sustainably.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim 
your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including 
packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) 
other waste.
	
BPCL ensures responsible management of waste 
materials to minimize environmental impact and 
maximize resource recovery. 
	
BPCL has developed a Waste Plastic Road (WPR) 
Process to enable sustainable for effective utilization of 
plastic waste. This initiative is a significant step towards 
reducing adverse environmental impacts of plastic 
waste and curbing its entry into the food. Integrating 
plastic waste into road construction enhances durability 
of the roads and prevents road damage due to seepage 
of rainwater The initiative supports the objectives of 
the “Swachh Bharat Mission”. BPCL envisions that 
the adoption of this initiative for road construction 
throughout the country can help address the issue 
of plastic waste management, reduce up to 3 times 
for every ton of plastic used and thus incorporating 
principles of circular economy into waste management. 
	
The Plastic Waste Management Rules mandate 
Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) for managing 
plastic waste packaging. As a registered Brand Owner 
under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
framework for plastic packaging used in lubricants, 
BPCL successfully met its EPR obligations  in 
FY 2024-25 by reclaiming plastic waste equivalent to 
approximately 5,551 MT. 
	
E-Waste is being disposed as per E-waste Management 
Rules 2022 requirements. BPCL is guided by an internal 
waste management manual, with the IS Department 
centrally overseeing disposal across locations.
	
Hazardous waste primarily consists of spent catalysts, 
oily sludge, and other refinery by-products. Spent 
catalysts containing valuable metals are sent to certified 
recyclers for recovery, co-processing, or incineration. 
Oily sludge from storage tanks and Effluent Treatment 
Plants (ETPs) is processed with recovered oil, blended 
into finished products, while residual sludge is treated 
through bioremediation or incineration as required. 
	
Kitchen waste generated in refinery townships 
and canteens is processed in waste management 
plants to produce biogas and compost. Biomedical 
waste is handled according to the Biomedical Waste 
Management Rules, 2016, and batteries are disposed 
off by with registered recyclers through a buyback policy.
	
Non-hazardous wastes are managed through the 
reduction, reuse, and recycling process. 
	
Waste Management System at BPCL:
	
BPCL’s 
waste 
management 
system 
distinctly 
categorizes waste into hazardous and non-hazardous 
types, each managed through tailored disposal and 
recycling approaches. Hazardous materials like spent 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (Contd.)
216          Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited
catalysts and slop oil are recycled either by authorized processors or through in-house systems for reuse. Non-
hazardous waste, including plastics, lightweight packaging, and canteen waste, is internally repurposed or sold to 
approved vendors, supporting outputs like bio-manure. Additionally, hazardous waste streams such as spent clay or 
oily residues are securely landfilled at TSDFs. Biomedical waste is predominantly incinerated, often handled through 
partnerships with government healthcare facilities.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, 
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted 
to Pollution Control Boards?
	
The Plastic Waste Management Rules require Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for managing plastic 
packaging waste. 
	
Yes, BPCL is a registered Brand Owner under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for the plastic 
packaging used in the lubricants sold. BPCL has successfully fulfilled its EPR obligations in FY 2024-25 by reclaiming 
plastic waste equivalent to 5,551 MT.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
 
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been  implemented 
by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage 
such system?
	
	
Yes, BPCL has implemented a comprehensive 
Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Policy 
aligned with globally recognized ISO 45001 
– Occupational Health & Safety Management 
System across all its refineries. The HSE policy 
serves as guidance note for maintaining a 
safe, healthy, and productive workplace. Each 
operating location has a dedicated HSSE manager 
accountable for ensuring compliance with the 
Regulatory and statutory requirements without 
compromising on HSE Policy and implementation 
of safety practices.
	
	
To minimize risk of incidents, injuries, and 
occupational hazards, BPCL has developed 
comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) and safety protocols that are reviewed and 
updated regularly. In line with BPCL’s commitment 
to safety standardization, the company has 
adopted Corporate Safety Management System 
(CSMS) and 12 Life Saving Rules (LSRs) 
across all business units. In addition, BPCL 
conducts detailed Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) and Aspect-Impact (AI) 
analysis at all operational sites. These proactive 
measures ensure that potential risks are identified, 
evaluated and mitigated through appropriate 
control measures. 
 
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
BPCL has instituted a robust Corporate Safety 
Management System (CSMS) aimed at managing 
health and safety risks to a level that is As Low 
as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The CSMS 
drives continuous safety improvement across all 
operations and prescribes minimum compliance 
requirements for safety management systems. 
It is applicable enterprise wide encompassing 
all 
operations, 
assets, 
facilities, 
employees, 
contractors, and relevant stakeholders.
	
	
To facilitate proactive safety management, BPCL 
has developed a dedicated safety portal for Incident 
reporting, capturing leading and lagging indicators, 
promoting organizational learning from incidents 
and Ensuring effective corrective and preventive 
actions (CAPA)
	
	
Comprehensive Hazard Identification and Risk 
Analysis (HIRA) studies have been conducted 
across all operating locations. Additionally, Threat 
Vulnerability & Risk Assessments (TVRA) and 
Security Audits are carried out to address evolving 
risks. Each site has documented Aspect-Impact

Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) guidelines.
	
	
BPCL has also implemented Process Safety 
Management (PSM) principles across its refinery 
operations to establish inherently safe workplaces 
and prevent catastrophic events. In line with global 
best practices, BPCL has adopted the American 
Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice 
754 for identifying and measuring Process Safety 
Events (PSEs). This ensures that such events are 
systematically monitored, recorded, analyzed, and 
used to strengthen preventive systems.
	
	
BPCL conducts regular internal safety audits to 
identify risks, verify compliance with standard 
operating 
procedures, 
and 
evaluate 
the 
effectiveness of safety performance measures. 
In addition, External Safety Audits (ESAs) are 
conducted by regulatory authorities such as OISD, 
PNGRB, and the Petroleum & Explosives Safety 
Organization (PESO). The Surprise Dip Stick Audit 
(SDSA) mechanism has been enhanced to ensure 
strict adherence to BPCL’s 12 Life Saving Rules 
(LSRs) at all locations.
	
	
Through these integrated systems and audits, BPCL 
reinforces its commitment to a zero-incident culture, 
operational integrity, and stakeholder safety.
 
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to 
report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes. BPCL actively encourages employees to 
report potential risks, hazardous situations, 
and near misses. All incidents recorded in the 
company’s portal are thoroughly investigated 
through Root Cause Analysis, with findings 
transparently shared across the organization to 
foster collective learning and safer operations. 
Dedicated awareness initiatives reinforce the 
importance of reporting near misses among both 
employees and contractors.
	
	
Safety Committee meetings and Monthly Safety 
Theme activities play a crucial role in raising 
awareness, addressing safety issues, and driving 
continuous improvement. These committees, 
comprising equal representation from workers 
and management, are formed in line with statutory 
requirements to review safety concerns and 
implement audit recommendations.
Annual Report 2024-25          221
Statutory Reports
	
	
BPCL urges all functional leaders, supervisors, employees, and contract personnel to embed safe practices into 
daily operations, planning, and development activities. The workforce is encouraged to actively report safety 
concerns and propose suggestions to strengthen the overall safety framework. Comprehensive safety policies 
and SOPs are in place to prevent incidents, injuries, and exposure to risks, protecting employees, contractors, 
customers, tank truck drivers, and the communities where BPCL operates.
	
	
In addition, BPCL places strong emphasis on fire safety, first aid, emergency preparedness, and the safe handling 
of hazardous materials. Periodic safety campaigns are conducted to spotlight specific areas such as safe driving, 
use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and workplace ergonomics, further enhancing the safety culture 
across all locations.
 
d. 
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes, BPCL is deeply committed to safeguarding the health and safety of its workforce, extending this commitment 
beyond standard workplace requirements to include broader health and well-being initiatives. In line with provisions 
under the Factories Act, the company organizes comprehensive medical examinations twice a year for employees 
and contract workers at its operating sites and refineries.
	
	
BPCL ensures that first-aid kits are readily available at all locations and equips 20% of its workforce with first-aid 
skills through dedicated training and refresher programs, enhancing their ability to respond to health emergencies. 
The company also maintains Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) centers at its sites, offering employees and 
workers convenient access to healthcare support.
	
	
These measures, coupled with a focus on building health awareness and fostering a culture of safety, demonstrate 
BPCL’s holistic approach to promoting the physical well-being of its people, going beyond purely occupational needs.

Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
BPCL upholds a corporate governance philosophy centered on transparency, robust disclosures, employee 
empowerment, collective decision-making, and social responsibility. This philosophy aims to protect stakeholder 
interests and integrate their perspectives into the company’s growth and sustainability journey. BPCL identifies 
key stakeholders as those who are significantly impacted by its operations or who hold the capacity to influence its 
business activities. The company recognizes that maintaining open lines of communication and building synchronistic 
relationships with stakeholders are essential for fostering trust, collaboration, and long-term value creation. Regular 
engagement helps BPCL understand stakeholder expectations on environmental, social, and governance matters, 
allowing the company to proactively address emerging sustainability challenges. As part of its structured approach, 
BPCL classifies stakeholders into internal and external categories, based on their level of influence and impact on the 
company’s sustainability performance.
	
The process begins by identifying and prioritizing stakeholders considering the extent of their influence on the company 
and their potential to be affected by BPCL’s activities. This is followed by setting parameters for assessing material 
topics through three dimensions: importance, impact, and influence. BPCL undertakes a broad review to compile a 
preliminary list of key issues relevant to stakeholders.
	
To deepen this understanding, BPCL engages stakeholders through multiple channels including formal surveys, direct 
consultations, workshops, and regular interactive sessions. Notably, BPCL conducted a formal stakeholder survey 
during the year to gather direct feedback, further enriching its insights. Discussions with key internal and external 
stakeholders help prioritize the importance of various issues, ensuring that the perspectives gathered are robust 
and representative.

to inform its sustainability initiatives.
	
At the governance level, BPCL has constituted a Board-level Sustainable Development Committee (SDC), comprising 
two whole-time Directors, one Government Nominee Director and one Independent Director (Chairperson). This 
committee is tasked with steering the company’s sustainability strategy and closely monitoring the implementation 
of key initiatives. The SDC meets twice a year to review BPCL’s sustainability performance, evaluate material topics, 
oversee stakeholder engagement activities, and assess ESG indicators managed by the Corporate HSSE department.

seeks input and feedback from communities, regulatory 
authorities, and other relevant stakeholders.

MSME, Women, SC, and ST communities. To support 
these stakeholder groups, appropriate communication 
channels have been established to address their 
concerns, and they are engaged through capacity-
building initiatives and other collaborative mechanisms.
	
BPCL also engages directly with communities through 
its CSR department and project partners, identifying 
and prioritizing issues raised during these interactions 
for management’s consideration. Based on these 
insights, the company implements initiatives aimed 
at empowering, uplifting, and fostering the holistic 
development of communities.
	
Driven by our vision of 'Energizing Lives', BPCL 
remains committed to creating a positive impact beyond 
business. With a strong focus on nation-building, our 
CSR efforts are centered around five key areas: Health 
& Sanitation, Education, Skill Development, Community

Do you have a focal point (Individual/Committee) 
responsible for addressing human  rights impacts 
or issues caused or contributed to by the business? 
(Yes/No)
	
Yes, BPCL has a Human Rights Policy duly approved 
by its Board, which is aligned with the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, the 
principles of the United Nations Global Compact, core 
conventions of the International Labor Organization, 
and the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Heavy 
Industries and Public Enterprises. The Company firmly 
believes in equal opportunity and ensures there is no 
discrimination based on caste, creed, religion, language, 
ethnicity, disability, age, gender, sexual orientation, 
race, color, marital status or union organization or 
any other status protected by appropriate laws. Our 
philosophy of an energized workplace has resulted in 
best-in-class HR practices that incorporate state-of-
the-art facilities, fostering rightful working and joyful 
living. All employees are treated with dignity, and BPCL 
has built a strong, mutually beneficial association with 
its workforce.
	
BPCL has established a multi-tiered structure involving 
dedicated 
departments, 
Board-level 
oversight, 
specialized committees, and comprehensive grievance 
mechanisms to proactively address and effectively 
manage human rights impacts and issues across its 
value chain. A key initiative in this regard is the Employee 
Satisfaction Enhancement (ESE) department, which 
plays a unique and proactive role in making BPCL ‘A 
Great Place to Work’. ESE strives to protect human 
rights by actively, reaching out to maximum employees, 
listening to their concerns, and resolving all grievances 
anonymously. In addition, ‘Samadhan’ portal is available 
for employees to address HR-related queries online.
	
As a responsible corporate citizen, BPCL ensures that 
its contractors fully comply with statutory obligations 
under laws such as the Minimum Wages Act, 
Payment of Wages Act, Employee Provident Funds 
Act, Employee State Insurance Act, and the Contract 
Labor (Regulation & Abolition) Act. Provisions of 
welfare amenities including clean drinking water, toilet 
facilities, and rest rooms are extended to all contract 
labor working within BPCL premises. The Company 
also organizes annual and half-yearly on-site health 
check up camps, continuous first-aid training, and 
several awareness programs such as Health Talks 
and Swachhta Pakhwada to educate contract labor on 
social and personal development aspects.
	
Moreover, all vendor contracts incorporate explicit 
human rights provisions under the General Conditions of 
Contract (GCC), emphasizing the prohibition of child and 
forced labor, gender equality, and non-discrimination. 
BPCL actively engages with communities, civil society 
organizations, and other stakeholders to understand 
and address human rights concerns. A public grievance 
redressal system is in place, accessible through the 
BPCL website under Chapter 14 of the Citizen Charter, 
ensuring transparent and time-bound resolution of 
issues raised by the public.
	
Through this robust framework, encompassing policy 
oversight by the Board, dedicated departments 
like ESE, specialized committees such as Internal 
Committees under POSH and Safety Committees, 
and multiple grievance redressal channels including 
the Whistle-blower Policy and public grievance 
systems, BPCL ensures that human rights impacts 
and issues caused or contributed to by its business 
are systematically identified, addressed, and managed 
across all operations.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to 
redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
BPCL 
is 
committed 
to 
preventing 
unlawful 
discrimination and harassment across its workforce 
and value chain partners. The Company has a robust 
Human Rights Policy and conducts regular reviews and 
impact assessments to uphold these commitments. A 
structured Grievance Redressal Procedure is in place to 
record and resolve all human rights-related grievances 
confidentially. The Employee Satisfaction Enhancement 
(ESE) department serves as a dedicated focal point for 
addressing employee concerns. Employees can reach 
out to ESE through face-to-face meetings, phone calls, 
letters, or emails. Unresolved issues are escalated to 
the respective SBU or Entity Head, with employees

committees to oversee workplace health and safety, and a Whistle-blower Policy to enable transparent and timely 
reporting of concerns. The Company also requires contractors and suppliers to adhere to all mandatory human 
rights regulations under contract, emphasizing the prohibition of child and forced labor, gender equality, and non-
discrimination. Grievance mechanism can be accessed online as given in Chapter 14 of Citizen Charter through weblink:

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
In line with the requirements of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) 
Act, 2013, BPCL has constituted an Internal Committee (IC) at each of its Regions and Refineries, with overall 
oversight provided by a Central Internal Committee. These committees ensure strict confidentiality of the identities of 
complainants, respondents, witnesses, and any evidence or recommendations arising from investigations. Any breach 
of this confidentiality is subject to disciplinary measures under the provisions of the Act. 
	
BPCL places strong emphasis on awareness and prevention, regularly conducting workshops to sensitize employees 
on issues related to sexual harassment. Additionally, sessions on the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at the 
Workplace (POSH) are an integral part of the induction program for all new employees, reinforcing the Company’s 
commitment to a safe and respectful work environment.  In FY 2024-25, BPCL conducted nine training programs for 
POSH awareness and sensitization for different role-holders across Regions and Refineries, reinforcing BPCL’s zero-
tolerance stance and commitment to a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace. The initiative enhanced awareness of 
roles and responsibilities, while assuring employees of sensitive and confidential handling of concerns.

BPCL vs  Shri Sant Dasganu Maharaj Shetkari Sangh 
(SLP- 2127/2015)-  July, 1997, BPCL commissioned 
Depot at Akolner, District Ahmednagar for storage 
and supply of petroleum products. The Depot was 
closed from June 2006 to March 2011 for operation 
purposes during which storage tanks were empty. On 
receipt of complaint, local Thalati made a panchnama 
on 27-03-2012 with regard to contamination by 
seepage of petroleum products. GSDA published 
survey report disclosing that there was no leakage of 
petroleum products from BPCL storage tanks. Shri 
Sant Dasganu Maharaj Shetkari Sangh has filed a 
complaint in April 2014 before NGT, Pune alleging 
contamination of water in the well of Shri Bapu 
Taboji Gaikwad due to leakage/ spillage of petroleum 
products from BPCL / IOCL Depot. NGT constituted a 
Committee comprising MPCB, OISD and Dy.Collector, 
Ahmednagar for investigation of allegations. The 
Committee submitted its report on 31-05-2014 in 
which they submitted that no evidence with regard 
to leakage of petroleum product was found and 
also observed that there are very remote chances 
of oil spillage in the subject well. After considering 
the report, Reply filed by BPCL, IOC, MPCB & Ors. 
NGT vide its Order 10-11-2014 held that both BPCL 
& IOCL are liable to pay cost and damages caused 
due to ground water pollution as well as to restore 
the environment and to ensure that there shall be 
no further pollution of ground water due to industrial 
activities and further, directed to deposit a tentative 
amount of I 5 lakh towards restitution and restoration 
of ground water quality of the disputed wells and to 
pay I 5 lakh to Shri Bapu Taboji Gaikwad whose well 
was found to be contaminated. Hence, SLP filed 
by BPCL before the Supreme court challenging the 
aforesaid NGT order.
BPCL was directed to deposit a 
tentative amount of I 5 lakh towards 
restitution and restoration of ground 
water quality and to pay I 5 lakh to 
Shri Bapu Taboji Gaikwad (whose 
well was found to be contaminated)
Case is pending

storage facility by Rajasthan State Pollution Control 
Board. Due to a fire accident in Sanganer terminal 
of IOCL, BPCL's operations were suspended due to 
proximity to IOCL Depot. Therefore, the operations 
were shifted from Sanganer to Kota. Kota had limited 
storage supply and thus BPCL decided to seek 
permission from PESO to construct 2 more tanks to 
accommodate the supplies. On Inspection, they were 
told to get permission to increase capacity and soon 
they were issued a Show Cause Notice for installing 
tanks without prior approval. Despite of providing with

Note: Scope 3 Emissions Calculation Methodology is aligned with the GHG Protocol Standard. The organization currently reports emissions 
under four relevant and material Scope 3 categories, using BRSR accepted emission factors and standardized methodologies.
	
Category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution -This category includes emissions from the import of crude oil and LPG by ship, and 
LPG by rail. Distances between ports were calculated using the Sea routes platform, and emissions from marine transport were estimated 
using DEFRA 2024 emission factors. For rail transport, distance data was collected and multiplied by the quantity transported, with emissions 
calculated using the India GHG Program (2015) emission factors for rail freight.
	
Category 6: Business Travel - Emissions from air travel were calculated by determining the great-circle distance between airports using the 
Haversine formula. For domestic flights, emission factors were sourced from the India GHG Program, while international flights used DEFRA 
2024 emission factors. These were applied to the total kilometers traveled to estimate business travel-related emissions.
	
Category 9: Downstream Transportation and Distribution -This includes emissions from the transport of products by rail and road. For rail, 
emissions were estimated by multiplying the material quantity transported with the distance covered and applying India GHG Program 2014–
15 emission factors. For road freight (lorries), the same approach was used—multiplying transported quantity and distance by lorry-specific 
emission factors from the India GHG Program.
	
Category 11: Use of Sold Products - This category covers emissions from the use-phase combustion of fuels sold, excluding CBG and petrol, 
for which emission factors were taken from IPCC guidelines with GWP values from IPCC AR6. For petrol and CBG, DEFRA 2024 emission 
factors were applied. A blending ratio of 16.35% bioethanol and 83.65% petrol was considered, using DEFRA’s latest factors for both fuels.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 11 of Essential Indicators above, provide 
details of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention 
and remediation activities.
	
BPCL regards to ecological and environmental protection as the focal point of conservation programs.  Large-scale of 
tree plantation activities are carried out at all the refineries and marketing business units. In FY 2024–25, we planted over 
1.78 Lakh trees using techniques such as Miyawaki afforestation, seed bombing, and conventional plantation methods. 
This expanded our cumulative green cover to 12,17,784 trees, contributing to the sequestration of approximately 25,571 
metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MTCO2e).
	
There is no notable impact on the surrounding ecology and biodiversity from BPCL’s refinery operations, as each site 
is equipped with well-designed Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and adheres to all necessary controls to consistently 
meet the treated effluent standards under the Minimum National Standards (MINAS). BPCL is adhering with all 
environmental regulations applicable to the refineries and business units. We obtain environmental clearance for all the 
applicable projects and continue to comply with its stipulated conditions.
	
Further, to safeguard Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) areas, BPCL ensures:
	
No discharge of process water into nearby creeks.
	
Sea discharge of cooling and storm water strictly complies with CRZ stipulations.
	
Proper corrosion protection, painting, and robust operation & maintenance practices for pipelines are maintained.
	
Additionally, effective spill response systems—including containment and recovery measures—are in place to manage 
any unlikely leaks.

and continues to make families happy through 
improved and efficient stoves and reduced CO2 
emissions.
Highly energy-efficient LPG stove: The Bharat 
Hi-star, sold 2.87 Lakh units and generated net 
revenue of  I 70 crore via sales and  I 5.78 crore 
through royalty.
High-Efficiency PNG Stove: The achieved 
thermal efficiency is higher than commercial 
burners available in the market. Technology 
licensing agreements were signed for commercial 
production, and the burner was rolled out at a 
BPCL housing complex in Noida.
LPG Stove: Adoption of Bharat Hi-Star 
stoves across all Indian households 
could save 1.7 MMT of LPG annually, 
worth I7 crore, and potentially reduce 
GHG emissions by approximately 5 
MMTCO2e per year.
PNG stove: An average household 
consumes 180-200 SCM of NG 
annually, and a 15% efficiency increase 
can save approximately 30 SCM of 
gas annually which is equivalent to a 
potential reduction of 50-55 kgCO2e per 
household annually.

Outcome of the Initiative
3
Scale up of indigenous alkaline 
electrolyzer technology jointly with 
BARC.
Currently, electrolyzer technology for Green 
hydrogen production is available with only few 
foreign suppliers. BPCL has taken up a very 
ambitious initiative of scaling up India’s first and 
most efficient alkaline electrolyzer technology for 
Green Hydrogen production in collaboration with 
Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC). BPCL 
has led the initiative by entering into technology 
licensing with BARC, scaling up the electrolyzer 
components through third parties.
BPCL, in collaboration with its 
Renewable Energy Business Unit (RE 
BU), is actively involved in setting up 
a Green Hydrogen Dispensing Station 
at Cochin International Airport Limited 
(CIAL), Kochi. The BPCL Corporate 
R&D Centre (CRDC) has partnered 
with BARC to install an indigenously 
developed 500 kW Green Hydrogen 
production plant at the site. The project 
installation and commissioning activities 
are currently underway.

Setting up EV charging stations
BPCL is primarily focused on developing Highway 
Fast Charging Corridors to accelerate EV 
infrastructure along major routes. The Company 
has established 270 such corridors, spanning 
over 42,000 kilometers. The Retail Business Unit 
has set an ambitious target of installing 7,000 
EV charging stations and developing 200 fast-
charging highway corridors. In FY 2024–25 alone, 
BPCL commissioned 3,428 EV charging stations 
at its retail outlets, bringing the total to 6,563 
stations nationwide.
A robust charging network spread 
across the country would address 
discovery and decrease the anxiety of 
the EV customers and thus would lead 
to faster adoption of EVs. It will further 
lead to reduction in tailpipe emissions 
from the vehicles.
5
Setting up MSW based 
Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) plant 
BPCL has initiated several key projects to produce 
Compressed Biogas (CBG) from biomass and 
organic waste such as agricultural residues, 
municipal solid waste, and sugarcane press 
mud. Over the next 2–3 years, BPCL aims to 
establish 26 additional CBG plants, with a total 
capacity of approximately 50 TMTPA, through 
direct investments or collaborations with private 
partners. 
CBG serves as a cleaner alternative to 
fossil fuels and supports energy self-
reliance by reducing dependence on 
imported natural gas and petroleum.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
BPCL has established a robust Emergency Response Disaster Management Plan (ERDMP) in line with the PNGRB ERDMP 
Regulation 2010 (as updated in September 2020), certified by a PNGRB-accredited third-party agency. This comprehensive 
plan encompasses Preparedness, Mitigation, Planning, and Restoration (PMPR), reflecting the Board of Directors’ formal 
approval and BPCL’s strong commitment to regulatory compliance.
	
The ERDMP extends beyond refineries, pipelines, and marketing sites to also cover road transportation, the retail outlet 
network, and city gas distribution, providing a holistic framework for emergency preparedness.
	
As part of its detailed pre-emergency strategy, BPCL undertakes hazard identification, risk assessments, and consequence 
analyzes before finalizing the ERDMPs. Additionally, in compliance with PNGRB norms, mutual aid agreements are in place 
with nearby industries to facilitate coordinated disaster response efforts.
	
A key element of BPCL’s readiness approach is its structured three-tier mock drill program, which is conducted routinely and 
reviewed periodically to refine response actions based on learnings and feedback. Facilities are equipped with both fixed and 
mobile firefighting systems, supported by trained teams capable of managing emergencies effectively.
	
Moreover, BPCL has rolled out a Pandemic Emergency Response Plan (PERP) across multiple locations to maintain 
business continuity and manage crises efficiently during health-related events.
6. 
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
Nil
BPCL does not conduct formal environmental due diligence across its value chain. Recognizing the growing importance 
of responsible value chain management, BPCL is planning to initiate comprehensive value chain assessments in the 
coming year. These assessments will help identify environmental and social risks, opportunities for improvement, and 
areas where collaborative action with partners can be undertaken to address risks associated with value chain. To that 
end, we have implemented following initiatives during the reporting period:
 
Promoting Pipline Transpor8tation
	
BPCL operates large Cross Country Pipelines network with total Pipelines lengths of approx. 3537km. Cumulative 
throughput of petroleum products as per this financial year was 27.21 MMT. Pipeline reduced the stress on overworked rail 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (Contd.)
246          Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited
and road infrastructure besides reducing environmental consequences associated with rail and vehicle transportation. 
Presently, pipelines are the most sustainable mode of transportation and helps in reduction of approx. 75% of emissions 
as compared to rail transportation.
 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)
	
BPCL’s R&D centers are working on producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from captured CO2 and green hydrogen, 
aiming to meet the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) mandate. In line with 
this, BPCL and CARBONEGEV Ltd, a joint venture between B.G. Negev Technologies and Applications Ltd. and the 
Ralco Group, an Israeli company, have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) on September 16, 2024 initiating 
collaboration in the field of converting CO2 to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). BPCL’s R&D centers, Net-Zero teams of 
BPCL’s refineries are taking the initiative further in collaboration with CARBONEGEV Ltd.
 
Ethanol Blending
	
As part of its efforts to reduce fossil fuel consumption and promote cleaner energy alternatives, BPCL has actively 
advanced its ethanol blending program. In alignment with the Government’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) initiative, 
BPCL blends ethanol—sourced from sugarcane, agricultural residues, and other feedstocks—with petrol to offer a 
more sustainable fuel option. In FY 2024–25, the Company achieved a record ethanol blending rate of 16.35%, utilizing 
approximately 247 crore litres of ethanol, up from 11.7% in the previous year. BPCL is targeting over 19% blending in 
FY 2025–26 and is currently retailing 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20) across the country.
	
The ethanol blending initiative by BPCL has multiple positive outcomes. 1. It contributes to the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions and air pollution, thereby supporting environmental sustainability. 2. It decreases the reliance on 
imported crude oil, enhancing the country’s energy security. 3. It benefits the agricultural sector by providing farmers 
with an additional revenue stream and promoting rural development. 4. The use of ethanol-blended petrol results in 
lower vehicular emissions.
 
Solarization of RO
	
Out of 23,642 Retail Outlets (ROs), a total of 12,244 have been solarized. Additionally, solar lighting has been installed 
at 7,563 ROs. To encourage wider adoption, dealers have been offered subsidies as an incentive for solarization. 
The solarization of BPCL’s retail outlets reduces greenhouse gas emissions and operational costs, enhancing BPCL’s 
reputation in sustainable practices. Solarizing depots, installations, LPG plants, and COCO outlets further integrates 
renewable energy into BPCL’s operations, setting a strong example for the industry.
 
EV charging station
	
BPCL has developed 270 EV corridors spanning over 42,000 kilometers along national highways. The Retail Business 
Unit has set a target of establishing 7,000 EV charging stations and developing 200 fast-charging highway corridors. 
As of FY 2024-25, BPCL has commissioned 3,428 new EV charging stations at its retail outlets, bringing the cumulative 
total to 6,563 stations. Additionally, BPCL has partnered with leading OEMs such as Ola, Ather, and Hero to deploy fast 
chargers for two-wheelers.
	
The installation of EV charging stations by BPCL reduces greenhouse gas emissions and promotes contribution to a 
sustainable future. The development of fast-charging highway corridors ensures that EV users can travel long distances 
with ease, promoting greater EV adoption and enhancing BPCL’s reputation as a leader in sustainable energy solutions.

Brief of the case
Corrective action taken
Competition Commission of India
In 2013, the Competition Commission of 
India (CCI) initiated Suo Motu Case No. 
3/2013 against Public Sector Undertaking 
(PSU) Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs). 
The case was based on observations 
from PPAC data indicating that the retail 
price of petrol in Delhi, as charged by 
PSU OMCs on 25.07.2012, was identical 
across companies, with a uniform price 
build-up. The CCI noted that under the 
prevailing pricing regime, prices were 
linked to international benchmarks and the 
Administrative Price Mechanism (APM), 
rather than being market-driven. This 
formula-based pricing left little room for 
competition, and efficiencies at various 
stages of the supply chain were not 
reflected in the final retail price, potentially 
resulting in consumer welfare loss. Under 
Section 3(1) of the Competition Act, 2002, 
any agreement, written or otherwise, that 
causes or is likely to cause an appreciable 
adverse effect on competition is prohibited. 
The CCI observed that the simultaneous 
and identical pricing decisions by 
OMCs suggested a prima facie indirect 
understanding, potentially violating Section 
3(3) of the Act. Consequently, the CCI, 
through its order dated 08.03.2013, directed 
the Director General (DG) to conduct a 
detailed investigation under Section 26(1) 
within 60 days.
The PSU OMCs challenged this directive 
before the Delhi High Court via Writ Petition 
No. 7303/2013. The Court, through its 
order dated 22.11.2013, granted an ad 
interim stay on the CCI proceedings, which 
remains in effect pending further orders.
