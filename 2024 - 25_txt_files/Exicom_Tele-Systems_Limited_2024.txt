harnessing renewable energy sources.
	
	
•	
Additionally, we have upgraded our solar inverters to more efficient and technologically advanced models. This 
enhancement has resulted in a measurable increase in solar energy generation, yielding an additional 10% energy 
savings. The upgrade optimizes the performance of the solar infrastructure and further reduces reliance on 
grid electricity.

Responsible Waste Management Practices
	
	
•	
Hazardous Waste: All hazardous waste generated is disposed of exclusively through Central Pollution Control Board 
(CPCB)-approved recyclers, ensuring full regulatory compliance and minimizing environmental impact.
	
	
•	
Non-Hazardous Waste: Non-hazardous waste is systematically segregated, recycled, and reused wherever feasible. 
For instance, recycled paper waste is repurposed for internal use in stationery and office supplies, promoting resource 
conservation and reducing landfill contributions.

Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be provided along-

Outcome of the 
initiative
1
Energy optimization 
by installation of lower 
capacity air compressor 
for non- peak production 
hours
Implemented a dual air compressor system, transitioning from a 
22.5 kW unit to a 7.5 kW compressor during roughly 12 hours of 
non-peak production in a 24/7 operation. This strategic downsizing 
during lower demand periods significantly reduces unnecessary 
energy consumption, as the smaller compressor operates more 
efficiently at lighter loads. By minimizing the runtime of the 
larger, less efficient unit when full capacity isn’t required, the 
facility directly lowers its electricity usage and associated costs. 
This decreased energy demand translates to a smaller carbon 
footprint, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally 
responsible operation. This proactive approach demonstrates a 
commitment to resource conservation and embodies a tangible 
step towards a greener industrial practice.
Substantial energy 
optimization and aligns 
with green initiatives.
