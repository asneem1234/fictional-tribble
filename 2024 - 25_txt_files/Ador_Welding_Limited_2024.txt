Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
Basic Information:
Ador Welding Limited (“Ador”), formerly known as Advani-Oerlikon Limited, is a pioneer in the Indian welding 
industry. Since its establishment in the year 1951, Ador has played a vital role in India’s industrial and infrastructure 
development by offering a comprehensive range of high-quality welding consumables, equipment, and 
automation solutions. In addition, the Company has actively contributed to skill development within the sector.
Over the decades, Ador has continually expanded its welding expertise to serve a broad spectrum of industries, 
including high-end specialized applications, both in domestic and international markets. Guided by its vision of 
“Creating the Best Welding Experience”, Ador is committed to responsible and sustainable business practices 
that promote environmental stewardship and social responsibility. The Company embraces a holistic approach 
to growth by embedding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into its core business 
strategy—ensuring long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Ador believes that corporate performance should 
be measured through a balanced lens of economic, environmental, and social outcomes. Its core values are 
deeply rooted in the development of a sustainable business model that is driven from the top leadership and

In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), Ador has identified 09 (nine) 
priority SDGs for focused initiatives. These goals serve as a foundation for achieving its vision and reinforcing its

Ador’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) presents a transparent and comprehensive overview

1
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Product manufacturing is an energy-intensive operation, and 
efficient energy management initiatives help the company 
optimize its energy consumption and thereby significantly aid 
in cost savings, lowering the energy consumption and GHG 
footprint of our organization. To achieve this, we have integrated 
several energy-efficient techniques, such as utilizing more 
efficient machines, and automatic systems in our processing 
units and installing solar panels, etc. These measures help us 
maintain low energy consumption while promoting sustainability.

2
Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions
Risk
Considering the nature of our business operations, a high 
energy requirement and consequent high greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions are inherent to some extent. Furthermore, 
we anticipate more stringent GHG policies, i.e. all-inclusive 
tracking and reporting practices, capping emissions, etc. could 
become mandatory in coming years. While we understand 
the need to manage and reduce this high emissions, we also 
anticipate that failure to align with evolving GHG policies could 
result in substantial penalties and reputational damage.
At Ador, we track and 
publish our Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions.
We also remain 
vigilant regarding 
upcoming policies 
and advancements 
in GHG tracking and 
public disclosure. 
Hence, we are 
strategizing to develop 
a comprehensive 
mitigation plan 
encompassing Scope 
3, along with other 
Scopes, and develop 
targets for GHG 
emission reduction.
Negative
3
Water 
Management
Opportunity
Our production process at Consumable Plants is water 
intensive, hence effective water management is crucial for 
our operations. Water scarcity poses a notable risk, impacting 
business continuity and profitability. However, efficient water 
management gives an opportunity to enhance efficiency 
and cut costs. Through substantial investments in water 
management systems such as ZLD and STP, we’ve improved 
our water utilization, resulting in decreased costs and reduced 
water footprint.
-
Positive
4
Air-pollution
Risk
Air emissions pose a risk, as it can contribute to local and 
regional emission concentrations. Moreover, non-compliance, 
if any, with regulatory requirements set by regional and 
national government boards, could have adverse impacts 
on both health and the environment, potentially resulting in 
compensatory and reputational damage to the Company. 
Additionally, this could pose a risk to our license to operate.
We conduct regular 
monitoring of our 
emissions and maintain 
strict processes 
to ensure that our 
operations adhere 
to industry best 
practices, with a focus 
on minimizing our 
environmental impact. 
Additionally, we hold 
ISO 14001 certification, 
underscoring our 
commitment to 
environmental 
stewardship.

Workforce 
health and 
safety
Risk
Given the nature of our business, it is imperative to establish 
rigorous protocols and procedures for health and safety to 
prevent injuries, accidents, and potential legal or reputational 
ramifications.
We strictly follow the 
prescribed health 
and safety protocols. 
We conduct routine 
training sessions to 
ensure our workforce 
is wellprepared 
to navigate such 
circumstances.
Negative
6
Materials 
Sourcing
Risk
Our supply chain is susceptible to various risks associated 
with critical materials used in the production process. These 
materials are often specialized and, in many instances, have 
limited alternatives. Instances of unavailability, transportation 
challenges, or supply disruptions could lead to price escalation 
and even slow down production processes. Therefore, 
addressing this issue is of paramount importance.
Over the years, we have 
successfully diversified 
our supply chain to 
reduce dependency 
on a single supplier 
and have ensured a 
more resilient supply 
chain. Furthermore, we 
continuously monitor 
market trends and 
product demand and 
pro-actively take the 
procurement decision 
to address potential 
challenges. Lastly as a 
part of our governance 
ethics, we foster 
strong, transparent, 
and effective 
communications with 
our value chain.
Negative
7
Supply chain 
Management
Risk
Ador has a complex supply chain, encompassing numerous 
stakeholders throughout the sourcing, production, and disposal 
phases of our products, making it susceptible to frequent 
disruptions.
Our supply chain 
management 
practices are robust 
and transparent, 
characterized by 
thorough due diligence 
to identify risks and 
vulnerabilities. Moreover, 
we assess the majority 
of our downstream 
supply chain based 
on key environmental, 
social, and governance 
(ESG) parameters, 
ensuring the smooth 
flow of value 
downstream.

EI-10.a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
	
Yes, in line with our Company’s Environment, Health and Safety Policy, an Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System has been implemented across all manufacturing facilities. Each plant operates 
under a system aligned with ISO 45001:2018 standard. Additionally, the Company fosters a strong safety 
culture by regularly conducting health and safety training programs for both employees and workers.
EI-10.b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
The Company has established a comprehensive Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy, which is 
uniformly applicable across all its operational locations. This policy outlines essential health and safety 
parameters that must be consistently followed to ensure a safe and compliant working environment.
	
To effectively manage work-related hazards and assess associated risks, the Company has implemented 
a structured risk management system. This system incorporates both routine and non-routine risk 
assessment processes using the following key tools and methodologies:
 
• Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): Applied to both routine and non-routine activities for 
systematic hazard detection and risk evaluation.
 
• Manual Material Handling Assessment Chart (MAC): Used to identify ergonomic and handling-related 
risks during manual material handling operations.
 
• Fire Risk Assessment: Conducted to manage and mitigate fire-related hazards.
 
• HSEM 4004 – Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis Sheet: Facilitates comprehensive documentation 
and analysis of workplace hazards and their corresponding risks.
 
• The Company’s risk management framework is based on key control measures designed to both 
assess and mitigate identified risks. It also includes clearly defined procedures for:
 
 
• Routine Activities: Regular workplace inspections, incident and near-miss reporting, safety checklists, 
and employee training programs.
 
 
• Non-Routine Activities: Risk assessments for new processes, change management reviews, 
emergency preparedness drills, post-incident investigations, and detailed hazard assessments.
 
• Periodic risk assessments and safety audits are conducted to monitor compliance, evaluate the 
effectiveness of control measures, and ensure continuous improvement in health and safety 
performance across the organization.
EI-10.c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes, the Company has established a structured and proactive system for identifying, reporting, and 
mitigating work-related hazards across both manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations. This 
system is designed to ensure a safe working environment and continuous improvement in occupational 
health and safety practices.
	
At plant locations, all workers are empowered to report work-related hazards through an internal digital 
portal. These reports are actively monitored and addressed by the relevant departments, plant heads, 
or designated core team members. The risk analysis process is reviewed and updated following the 
implementation of new or revised risk control measures to ensure that residual risks remain within 
acceptable levels.
	
Hazard identification, risk assessment, and control measures are conducted proactively, particularly prior 
to the introduction of new activities, equipment, or procedures. This forward-looking approach ensures 
potential risks are addressed before they impact workers.

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
EI-1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Consumer Complaints resolution: A well-established system viz. Customer Care Centre (CCC) is in place for 
dealing with customer feedback and complaints. Customers are provided various options to connect with 
the Company through Zendesk platform, WhatsApp, e-mails, telephone, website, social media, feedback 
forms etc. All complaints are appropriately addressed, and efforts are taken to resolve the same in a timely 
manner. Around 75% of the complaints were related to application issue (lack of knowledge of customer / 
their welder). The application issues were all addressed and resolved within maximum of 48 hours through 
online consultation or physical visits by technical experts from the related plants. All the complaints are 
efficiently attended by our cross functional team (plant Customer Care / plant QC team / plant production 
/ TDC {R&D} team) along with our service team. Further, we conduct regular meetings with customer 
representatives for understanding the nature of difficulties faced by our customers. Based on the feedback 
of representatives, we suggest welding parameters specific to the customer’s job, provide demonstration to 
the welders at customer’s premises as well as replace specific lot, if required, in order to satisfactorily resolve 
the complaints. Corrective & preventive actions are taken and shared with the customers as well.
	
Consumer Feedback: We do have a system in place to get feedback from our customers, which is through 
our Sales and Service team. A feedback sheet is sent to the customers, to give their views / feedback on our 
services, including product quality, cost and timely delivery, amongst other things. 
	
In the said feedback sheet, the customer can rate our services in the scale from “poor to excellent” and 
has to also mention their expectations, if any. In addition to this, we also carry out survey through electronic 
media from time-to- time to get customer feedback. Upon receipt of feedback, the same are analyzed 
and a suitable action plan is formed for improvements. We have not carried out any consumer survey / 
consumer satisfaction survey in the last Financial Year 2024-25.
