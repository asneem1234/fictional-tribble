PRINCIPLE 9  
Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers  
in a responsible manner 
 
Essential Indicators 
1 
Describe the mechanisms in place 
to receive and respond to consumer 
complaints and feedback.  
Mechanisms in Place to Receive and Respond to Consumer Complaints and Feedback 
• 
Our organization has implemented a multi-tiered grievance redressal mechanism to 
ensure that consumer complaints and feedback obtained, tracked, and resolved in a 
timely and transparent manner. The system is structured to handle complaints at both 
the branch level and head office level, across both MFI and MSME businesses.  
• 
To address concerns from customers, each branch has designated a ‘Grievance Redress 
Day' on a specific day of each month. 
1. Complaints Received at the Branches  
• 
Frontline Interaction: Clients can directly lodge complaints or share feedback at their 
respective branches. Each branch is equipped to log client issues either verbally or 
through the complaint register available at the branch. 
• 
Client Registers: Complaint registers are maintained to record all issues raised at the 
branch level. 
• 
Timely Escalation: If the matter is not resolved at the branch, it is escalated to the 
respective departments’ seniors. 
• 
Client Acknowledgment: Clients are informed about the expected resolution time and 
are provided with an acknowledgment of their complaint in the form of SMS on 
registered mobile no. 
 
2. Complaints Received at the Head Office  
• 
Centralized Grievance: A dedicated team at the Head Office handles complaints. 
• 
Channels of Receipt: 
o 
Calls to the Toll-Free Number 
o 
Received via Emails  
o 
Complaints received at branches and forwarded to HO 
o 
Through Website 
o 
Received from RBI/CPGRAMS/MFIN and other channels as well. 
• 
Tracking and Monitoring: Complaints are logged into a centralized system and 
assigned a unique reference ID for tracking. 
• 
Coordination with Concerned Departments: The team coordinates with the 
departments concerned for verification, resolution, and updates. 
• 
Resolution Mechanism: 
o 
Complaints are classified based on category (e.g., loan processing, 
disbursement, repayment, staff behavior). 
o 
Internal TATs (Turnaround Times) are defined based on issue criticality. 
Additional Mechanisms Across All Levels 
• 
Grievance Redressal Policy: A clearly defined policy governs timelines, responsibilities, 
and escalation protocols. 
• 
Periodic Reporting: Complaint data is analyzed for trends and systemic issues, which 
are addressed through training or process enhancements. 
• 
Customer Feedback Mechanisms: Besides complaints, clients are encouraged to 
provide feedback and suggestion boxes at branches.

Steps taken to inform 
and educate consumers 
about safe and 
responsible usage of 
products and/or services. 
Every customer is required to undergo a mandatory training module known as Compulsory Group Training 
(CGT). This program educates customers on all aspects of the loan product they are availing, including terms 
and conditions, product features, and usage guidelines. Additionally, it covers the operational procedures 
under the Joint Liability Group (JLG) lending model, the conduct of centre meetings, and emphasizes the 
importance of credit discipline and financial responsibility. 
3 
Mechanisms in place to 
inform consumers of any 
risk of disruption 
/discontinuation of 
essential services 
Each customer is assigned a dedicated Relationship Officer who serves as their Single Point of Contact 
(SPOC) throughout the loan lifecycle—from sourcing to collections. Furthermore, as all customers are 
required to provide their contact numbers in the Loan Application Form, the Company can effectively 
conduct SMS or WhatsApp campaigns to communicate any important or urgent updates. Additionally, 
customer loan cards include the toll-free helpline number, enabling customers to reach out directly for 
assistance as needed.
