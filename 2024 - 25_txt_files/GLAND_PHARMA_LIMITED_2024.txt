Statement by Director, responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Gland Pharma is firmly committed to sustainability and recognises its responsibility to the environment, society, and 
future generations. In response to community concerns regarding environmental, health, and safety (EHS) matters, 
the company has proactively implemented a range of measures to address these issues within its operations.
To effectively manage Bio-Medical Waste, Gland Pharma has devised and implemented robust strategies for the 
treatment and recycling of wastewater. The company regularly screens and upgrades its effluent and sewage 
treatment plants at their manufacturing facilities, ensuring proper and responsible wastewater management.
Demonstrating a strong dedication to sustainable water usage, the Company has undertaken significant improvements 
to its raw water underground storage tank, resulting in a notable reduction in overall water consumption.
By continually enhancing the water quality sampling process, Gland Pharma has achieved even more significant 
reductions in water usage.
Aligned with their unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability, the Company has successfully 
transitioned to cleaner fuels at their manufacturing facilities. By replacing furnace oil with piped natural gas (PNG) 
as boiler fuel, Gland Pharma has significantly reduced stack emissions and lowered CO2 output. Furthermore, the 
Company has plans to extend this transition to other facilities, solidifying their position as responsible stewards of 
the environment.
These proactive measures exemplify Gland Pharma’s approach to addressing community concerns and their 
persistent dedication to environmental stewardship. By prioritising EHS measures and embracing sustainable 
practices, the company aims to make a positive and lasting contribution to the well-being of the communities in 
which it operates while minimising its ecological impact.

Has the Company implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation.
	
The Company has implemented a comprehensive wastewater management system that includes multiple treatment 
processes. After the chlorination stage, the water undergoes treatment in Reverse Osmosis Plants (RO-I & II). Any 
rejects generated from RO-I & II are further treated in RO-III, followed by the Final Reverse Osmosis (RO-IV) system. 
The final rejects from the RO treatment are then sent to the Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP).
	
In addition to the RO systems, the Company operates a highly effective Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) that utilises a 
Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) system. The treatment process includes several stages, starting with a collection 
tank, followed by an anoxic tank and an aeration tank. The wastewater then undergoes treatment in a Tube Deck 
system before being directed to a clarified tank. The process continues with sand and carbon filtration, concluding 
with Ultra Filtration that incorporates UV disinfection.
	
By incorporating these advanced treatment processes, the Company ensures efficient and environmentally responsible 
wastewater management, aligning with its commitment to sustainability and responsible industrial practices.
