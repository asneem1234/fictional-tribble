1.
Governance, 
Ethics & 
Transparency
Risk
The dredging industry and 
the Indian maritime sector 
are poised for substantial 
growth 
owing 
to 
the 
escalating demand within 
the oil and gas sector. These 
industries are engaged in 
exploration, 
extraction, 
refining, and transportation 
operations. Dredging plays 
an 
indispensable 
role 
in 
maintaining 
navigable 
waterways, 
constructing 
and 
managing 
offshore 
infrastructure, 
and 
facilitating 
the 
efficient 
transportation 
of 
goods. 
The accumulation of waste 
and high tide levels elevate 
the risk of ship movement 
disruptions, 
which 
could 
ultimately adversely affect 
transportation activities.
Product 
innovation 
is 
increasingly 
recognized 
as 
a pivotal trend within the 
dredging industry, with leading 
corporations 
emphasizing 
the advancement of state-of-
the-art solutions. Customized 
options 
are 
meticulously 
designed to meet the specific 
requirements 
of 
individual 
dredging projects. Dredging 
pumps, which are specialized 
for 
extracting 
sediments, 
debris, and materials from 
aquatic 
environments, 
are 
essential 
components 
in 
dredging 
activities 
and 
significantly 
contribute 
to 
mitigating 
environmental 
impacts.
Positive: 
Compliance with 
pertinent regulatory 
requirements 
demonstrates the 
Company’s dedication 
to responsible business 
practices.
Negative: Negative 
Financial Implication.

are 
indispensable components.
Ongoing efforts are being 
undertaken to comprehend 
the cultural and organizational 
structures. 
Learning

Procurement 
processes, 
internal and external logistics 
and transportation, quality 
controls, outsourcing, and 
vendor 
relationships 
are 
integral 
components 
of 
the company’s operational 
activities.
The 
dredging 
pump, 
engineered 
with 
wear-
resistant 
components 
and 
an efficient impeller, enables 
more rapid and convenient 
operations in regions with 
diverse 
water 
depths. 
Fundamental 
infrastructure 
developments such as channel 
deepening, 
mechanisation, 
and the expansion of berth 
facilities 
are 
expected 
to 
generate increased demand 
within the dredging industry. 
Additionally, the establishment 
of new greenfield ports is 
poised to further stimulate 
demand for dredging services 
in the domestic market.

The Sagarmala Project and the 
National Waterways Project 
have 
generated 
substantial 
opportunities for the dredging 
sector.
The Unnati Project, recognized 
as a global benchmark, has 
been adopted to enhance 
the 
key 
performance 
indicators (KPIs) for efficiency 
and productivity in twelve 
major ports. Approximately 
116 
initiatives 
have 
been 
identified across these ports 
to unlock over 100 million 
tonnes per annum (MTPA) 
of capacity solely through 
efficiency improvements. Of 
these, 93 initiatives have been 
successfully 
implemented, 
resulting in the unlocking of 
more than 80 million tonnes 
per annum (MTPA) of capacity. 
Additionally, master plans have 
been finalized for all twelve 
major ports.
Positive: Financial 
Implications
6
Maritime Sector
Opportunity
The Indian dredging industry 
is predominantly propelled 
by the demand for dredging 
services from both major 
and 
minor 
ports. 
The 
enhancement of fundamental 
infrastructure will, in turn, 
stimulate demand within the 
dredging sector.
In pursuit of advancing India 
to a leading position in the 
global maritime sector, the 
Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and 
Waterways 
has 
formulated 
the Maritime India Vision 2030 
(MIV 
2030). This 
strategic 
blueprint 
is 
designed 
to 
facilitate 
the 
coordinated 
and expedited development 
of India’s maritime industry 
over the next decade. MIV 
2030 outlines more than 150 
initiatives organized across 10 
thematic areas, encompassing 
all facets of the Indian maritime 
sector, thereby exemplifying a 
comprehensive endeavor to 
outline and achieve national 
maritime objectives.

Generally, Indian dredging 
firms are limited to the 
maintenance 
dredging 
sector. This market is highly 
congested, 
with 
trailer 
suction dredgers of various 
types, sizes, and origins all 
competing for the same 
share. 
Competition 
is 
extremely fierce, and the 
ensuing price wars are likely 
to result in eventual losers.
The 
dredging 
industry 
is 
expected to be a direct 
beneficiary of recent initiatives 
aimed at enhancing domestic 
manufacturing, 
alongside 
the 
government’s 
focus 
on 
advancing 
the 
Indian 
maritime sector. Indian ports 
are 
preparing 
to 
manage 
increased cargo volumes by 
accommodating larger vessels 
and are striving to meet 
international

Oil spills pose 
a serious 
environmental 
threat in the 
shipping 
industry.
Risk
Oil 
spills 
can 
cause 
serious 
financial 
and 
reputational 
damage 
to shipping companies. 
They can also greatly 
harm marine ecosystems.
Our fleet is managed in 
compliance 
with 
both 
international 
and 
local 
regulations. 
Preventing 
spills constitutes a key focus 
within the Environmental 
Management 
System. 
This particular risk is also 
systematically 
identified 
and 
overseen 
through 
the 
Risk 
Management 
System, in accordance with 
the 
Safety 
Management 
System. 
Additionally, 
the 
Company 
maintains 
insurance 
policies 
to 
mitigate this risk.
Shipping companies 
may be liable for 
cleanup expenses and 
financial damages, 
potentially amounting 
to millions of US 
dollars. This liability 
is predominantly 
mitigated through 
insurance coverage.
12.
Sewage, 
garbage 
and Air 
Pollution pose 
a  serious 
environmental 
threat in the 
shipping 
industry
Risk
Generally, ships produce 
blackwater 
(human 
waste) 
and 
greywater 
(from 
sinks, 
showers, 
etc.) while navigating at 
sea. When discharged 
untreated, this sewage 
introduces 
pathogens, 
nutrients, and chemicals 
into marine ecosystems. It 
results in eutrophication, 
which 
causes 
algal 
blooms 
that 
deplete 
oxygen 
levels 
and 
adversely affect aquatic 
life. Coastal communities 
may 
subsequently 
encounter 
health 
risks 
and 
contaminated 
seafood.
DCI 
has 
installed 
the 
IMO-approved 
Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs): 
These 
systems 
treat 
blackwater to meet effluent 
standards (e.g., ≤100 fecal 
coliforms/100 mL) before 
discharge.
Further, DCI is also using 
the Holding Tanks: For 
ships without STPs, holding 
tanks 
allow 
storage 
of 
sewage until it can be 
safely discharged at port 
reception facilities.
In

STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT, HIGHLIGHTING ESG-
RELATED CHALLENGES, TARGETS, AND ACHIEVEMENTS.
It is with great pleasure that I unveil the Company’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the 
fiscal year 2024-25, prepared under the framework established by SEBI, emphasizing its unwavering commitment to 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles and the progress achieved in addressing sustainability challenges. 
We regard our responsibility to lead in sustainable development not merely as a duty to society but also as an opportunity 
to succeed through ethical and responsible practices.
Over the past year, we’ve faced several ESG challenges that have shaped our commitment to responsible business 
practices. We recognize our responsibility to minimize the environmental impact and social effects of our shipping 
activities. Moreover, prioritizing the safety, well-being, and professional development of our staff, while promoting 
transparency, diversity, and inclusion internally and externally, remains a top focus for our organization.
To tackle these issues, we have introduced ESG initiatives that reinforce our commitment to sustainable shipping and 
foster a culture of diversity and inclusion within our organization.
Environmental Protection: The Company complies with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) MARPOL Convention 
and has implemented appropriate measures concerning emissions, ballast water treatment, domestic discharges, and oil 
pollution prevention. These initiatives enable us to make a meaningful contribution to global efforts in combating climate 
change and promoting cleaner oceans.
Waste Management: Waste produced during routine maritime operations is managed under the vessel’s garbage 
management plan and disposed of at certified facilities. The discharge of oil, solid waste, and sewage from ships is strictly 
prohibited under MARPOL regulations. 
Workforce Development: Numerous training programs, primarily centered on diverse principles including Leadership, Soft 
Skills, health and wellness, Industrial Skills, and Building Infrastructure for a Viksit Bharat, were implemented to facilitate 
the professional development and well-being of the workforce. These initiatives also aimed to promote a diverse and 
inclusive work environment.
At DCI, sustainability is a core part of our corporate culture. We view ESG as the foundation for generating long-term value 
and making a positive impact in the world. Through teamwork and strong dedication, we are committed to developing 
sustainable shipping solutions.

from manufacturers, which are delivered as general stores to ships. The ship handlers, responsible for procuring various 
line items from the market, consolidate these supplies and deliver them onboard. As a result, the Company does not 
acquire any raw materials as inputs for its operational activities.

The company fully complies with MARPOL regulations by prohibiting the discharge of oil, solid waste, sewage, and other 
pollutants from its ships. Old or expired batteries and pyrotechnics are safely disposed of or recycled through authorised 
vendors. Sludge remaining on ships is handed over to Port Authorities for recycling or recrystallisation. Scrap generated 
during dry dock or layup repairs is given to repairers or yards for recycling. For e-waste from shore offices, the company 
partners with an approved local recycler.

Shipping
Emission
In an effort to mitigate emissions, the Company has implemented or 
undertaken the following initiatives: -
1.	 The Company has worked to reduce SOx emissions from its vessels to 
improve air quality and lower its carbon footprint. It has fully complied 
with IMO’s regulation on 0.5% Sulphur fuel, which came into effect in 
January 2020, by supplying all vessels with low-sulfur fuel oil from that 
date. This decrease in SOx emissions will provide significant health and 
environmental benefits worldwide, especially for coastal communities 
and port residents. Although the Company could have chosen to use 
abatement technologies such as Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems or 
scrubbers as alternatives to low-sulfur fuel to meet IMO standards, it 
decided to employ low-sulfur fuel oil on all its vessels.
2.	 For the reduction of NOx emissions, all engines comply with NOx Tier 
I/Tier II requirements under Regulation 13 of MARPOL Annex VI.
3.	 The Company’s list of emission reduction measures includes the 
installation of LED lighting,  regular hull cleaning, propeller cleaning/
polishing, etc.
4.	 The Company is exploring investments in alternative technologies and 
fuel.
5.	 All the Company’s vessels are complying with Regulation 12 of IMO 
MARPOL Annex VI on Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS).
Shipping
Domestic Sewage 
Discharge
The regulations outlined in Annex IV of MARPOL prohibit the discharge 
of sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land, 
unless explicitly permitted otherwise. All vessels operated by the Company 
are equipped with approved Sewage Treatment Plants in accordance with 
the requirements set forth by IMO’s MARPOL Annex IV.
Shipping
Oil Pollution
DCI maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy regarding oil pollution from 
ships. The discharge of oil or oily mixtures into the sea is explicitly 
prohibited for ships in accordance with Annex 1 of MARPOL. All vessels 
are constructed in compliance with MARPOL regulations. Each vessel is 
equipped with approved oil-filtering equipment, and all tankers are fitted 
with approved oil-discharge monitoring and control systems. Additionally, 
the cargo tanks and pump rooms in tankers are constructed with double 
hulls to minimize the risk of oil pollution.

WHETHER STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION IS USED TO SUPPORT THE IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL TOPICS (YES / NO). IF SO, PROVIDE DETAILS OF INSTANCES AS TO HOW THE INPUTS 
RECEIVED FROM STAKEHOLDERS ON THESE TOPICS WERE INCORPORATED INTO POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE 
ENTITY.
	
Yes, the Company actively engages both internal and external stakeholders to ensure their Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) priorities align with the Company’s business policies and strategies. Material environmental and social 
issues are identified by assessing their relevance to the dredging sector, as well as the requirements of relevant standards and 
rating frameworks. The importance of these issues is evaluated through direct one-on-one interactions and focused group 
discussions with external stakeholders, alongside input from internal stakeholders representing various business functions. 
The valuable feedback gained from these consultations is carefully prioritised and incorporated into the development of 
the Company’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and its policies. This process ensures that stakeholder 
perspectives are effectively integrated into the Company’s ESG management approach, promoting responsible business 
practices and sustainable value creation.
	
Yes, stakeholder engagement encompasses key material issues driven by strategic objectives through various modes 
of engagement. Each stakeholder group has a designated internal custodian. For example, employee feedback involves 
specific, informed procedures that contribute to improved communication and collaboration platforms. 
	
For suppliers, this has improved the ease of doing business and the ability to address environmental and social aspects. 
Within the framework of the Community Ecology Initiative, our emphasis is on establishing an ecological equilibrium within 
our proximate communities through the implementation of projects that yield direct and tangible benefits. A principal area 
of focus is the enhancement of our urban primary healthcare system, as vulnerable communities often lack the adequate 
personnel and facilities necessary to address their healthcare needs. 
	
Similarly, for our employees, health, safety, and well-being are of paramount importance. We adopt a holistic approach to 
well-being, integrating mind, body, and community to promote health, happiness, and the pursuit of our life’s purpose. Our 
employee wellness initiatives encompass three domains of well-being: physical, emotional, and financial.

PROVIDE DETAILS OF INSTANCES OF ENGAGEMENT WITH, AND ACTIONS TAKEN TO, ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF 
VULNERABLE/ MARGINALISED STAKEHOLDER GROUPS.
	
Engaging with and addressing the concerns of underprivileged, vulnerable, and marginalized stakeholder groups is central 
to the company's ethical business practices. The company proactively addresses these concerns through various initiatives, 
fostering meaningful conversations. This includes creating safe spaces where stakeholders can openly share their concerns. 
Furthermore, the company ensures active and empathetic listening, demonstrating a genuine willingness to understand their 
perspectives. Cultural awareness and sensitivity to language barriers are incorporated into these interactions. Additionally, 
the company utilizes diverse communication channels to ensure that information is accessible to all members of these 
groups. Details about the composition of the CSR committee, the CSR Policy, and the approved CSR projects are available 
on our website at http://dredge-india.com/files/CSR%20Policy.pdf.

DESCRIBE THE INTERNAL MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.
	
The Company has established a comprehensive and well-organized grievance redressal mechanism designed to effectively 
resolve complaints pertaining to human rights violations. Any individual, whether an employee or not, who experiences 
or observes harassment, discrimination, or other human rights issues, is advised to submit a formal written complaint via 
designated channels.
	
At the core of this system is the Central Grievance Mechanism, which is tasked with receiving, managing, and resolving 
grievances in a fair, confidential, and timely manner. The process includes thorough investigations and ensures that 
appropriate corrective measures are taken to uphold the rights and dignity of all individuals.
	
This mechanism reflects the Company’s unwavering commitment to maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace 
where every grievance is addressed with seriousness and transparency.
	
The Company has implemented a Grievance Mechanism enabling all employees to formally raise concerns related to 
violations of any legal statutes, including human rights and internal corporate policies. Each grievance is subject to a 
thorough and appropriate investigation. Upon concluding the investigation, if it is determined that a violation has taken 
place, corrective measures proportional to the severity of the violation are enacted.

MECHANISMS TO PREVENT ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THE COMPLAINANT IN DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT 
CASES.
	
In order to safeguard complainants from the negative repercussions of discrimination and harassment within our offices in 
India, the Company has instituted proactive measures. These encompass explicit anti-discrimination and anti-harassment 
policies that are effectively communicated to all personnel, thereby fostering a respectful and inclusive organisational 
culture.
	
Our focus lies in raising awareness and preventing such issues through ongoing training that emphasizes unacceptable 
behaviors and mutual respect. An Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), composed of trained members, is responsible for 
addressing grievances with fairness, sensitivity, and confidentiality.
	
To promote reporting without apprehension, the Company provides an anonymous mechanism to securely voice concerns. 
These initiatives exemplify our dedication to protecting employees' rights and dignity throughout the grievance resolution 
process.
