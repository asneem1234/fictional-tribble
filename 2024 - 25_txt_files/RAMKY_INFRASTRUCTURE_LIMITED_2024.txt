Environment
1.
Energy 
Manage­
ment
Opportunity
Through the adoption of effective 
energy management practices, Ramky 
has identified energy management as 
a key opportunity and aims to achieve 
a subsequent reduction in energy 
consumption.
-
Positive
2.
Water 
manage­
ment
Risk
Effective water management is 
essential for infrastructure companies, 
given their substantial dependence on 
a reliable and sufficient water supply 
for construction activities and ongoing 
operations. With rising environmental 
concerns, investors and stakeholders 
are increasingly scrutinizing corporate 
sustainability practices. Inadequate 
management of water-related risks may 
negatively affect Ramky’s reputation 
and diminish its appeal to investors.
Ramky is dedicated to 
addressing water management 
risks through the identification 
and assessment of potential 
challenges, followed by the 
development of a robust water 
risk management plan. This 
initiative aims to ensure 
the plan’s effectiveness 
and foster active support 
and participation from all 
stakeholders.
Negative
Social
3.
Community 
develop­
ment
Risk
Infrastructure projects often 
necessitate large-scale land acquisition, 
which may lead to the displacement 
and resettlement of communities. 
Inadequate management of this process 
can trigger social unrest, community 
protests, and legal disputes.
Ramky actively engages 
with local communities, 
addresses their concerns, 
and adopts sustainable and 
responsible practices, thereby 
strengthening its ability to 
mitigate such risks.
Negative
4.
Workforce 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Infrastructure projects inherently 
involve high-risk activities, including 
construction, excavation, and the 
operation of heavy machinery. In the 
absence of adequate safety measures, 
these activities can significantly 
increase the risk of accidents, injuries, 
and, in severe cases, fatalities among 
the workforce
Ramky is recognized for its 
professional management 
team and robust MIS operating 
within a SAP environment. 
The company places strong 
emphasis on employee well-
being by implementing 
stringent safety measures 
and ensuring adherence to 
health and safety regulations.
Negative
5.
Labour 
Practices
Risk
Given the labour-intensive nature of 
infrastructure projects, non-compliance 
with labour laws, unsafe working 
conditions, or inadequate welfare 
measures can lead to strikes, accidents, 
legal liabilities, and project delays. This 
poses a reputational and operational 
risk.
The company ensures 
compliance with all applicable 
labour laws, offers safety 
training, promotes a grievance 
redressal mechanism, and 
partners with certified 
contractors. Regular audits 
and welfare initiatives are 
conducted to support worker 
well-being and ensure ethical 
workforce management.

Business 
Model 
Resilience
Opportunity
Ramky has established strong Internal 
Financial Controls tailored to its 
business and operational scale, aimed 
at safeguarding assets, ensuring 
financial accuracy, maintaining 
regulatory compliance, and enforcing 
proper approval processes. These 
systems are regularly reviewed and 
strengthened, with a comprehensive 
budgetary control framework in place 
to track revenues and expenses against 
the approved budget.
-
Positive
7.
Data 
Privacy 
and 
Protection
Opportunity
As Ramky’s operations increasingly rely 
on digital platforms and stakeholder 
data (including employees, customers, 
and vendors), robust data privacy 
practices offer a competitive edge. 
Demonstrating responsible data 
handling builds stakeholder confidence, 
supports compliance with evolving data 
protection regulations (like India’s 
DPDP Act), and strengthens eligibility 
for large infrastructure projects—
especially those with stringent IT and 
governance requirements.

Statement by director 
responsible for the business 
responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG
related challenges, targets and 
achievements 
“As the Director presenting our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), I am 
pleased to share our developments during the year. ESG principles continue to anchor our strategy 
and reflect our long-standing commitment to stakeholders.
In the current year, we expanded operations by commissioning a new plant in Tamil Nadu, 
taking our presence and markets served to six. Focused resource management delivered a 2.92% 
reduction in water consumption, while sourcing from MSMEs and small producers rose by 24.10%, 
strengthening inclusive supply chains.
On the social front, diversity improved, with female employees higher by 21.05% compared to 
the previous year. All employees continue to receive wages above statutory requirements, and 
parental leave is available to both men and women, reinforcing equity and care.
In governance, we maintain transparency, accountability, and active engagement with statutory 
and regulatory bodies, aligning practices with the principles of ethical business conduct. Looking 
ahead, we will deepen ESG integration across sites, advance efficiency initiatives, and build 
capabilities through training and stakeholder engagement to create durable value for our people, 
partners and communities.”

commitment towards resource efficiency and circular economy 
practices.
Further all disposable materials from our operations are responsibly

Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Ramky operates exclusively in the construction services sector and is not 
engaged in any manufacturing activities. However, the Company implements 
sustainable waste management practices to ensure the responsible 
segregation, handling, and disposal of construction-related waste, in 
adherence to applicable environmental regulations and sustainability 
commitments.
a)  E-waste, Plastic and Battery waste - The Company ensures responsible 
waste management by facilitating the transportation of plastic waste 
to local authorized vendors for appropriate processing and disposal. In 
line with data security and environmental responsibility, end-of-life 
electronic equipment, including computers and accessories, are handed 
over to certified e-waste disposal agencies. Additionally, a reporting 
and monitoring system has been implemented to track the collection, 
disposal, and recycling of battery waste, ensuring transparency and 
compliance with relevant environmental norms.
b)  Hazardous Waste - As a construction services company, our operations 
do not involve the use of hazardous or toxic chemicals. Consequently, 
the Company does not generate hazardous waste in the course of its 
business activities.
c)  Other waste - Given the nature of the Company’s business, other forms 
of waste are not applicable.
