plants, and offsetting 
usage through sustainable 
initiatives. Medanta

GHG emissions, ensuring

management of its direct 
and indirect emissions.

Sustainability remains integral to Medanta’s growth strategy. In 2024, 
we partnered with Grant Thornton to conduct a materiality assessment 
aligned with global frameworks, helping us prioritise ESG issues 
most relevant to healthcare and our stakeholders. We are advancing 
initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint, including 100% LED 
lighting across all greenfield hospitals, renewable energy integration 
with over 70% of Medanta Lucknow’s power needs met through 
solar (November 2024-March 2025), and the adoption of electric 
vehicles for internal transport. These efforts reflect our commitment 
to building a greener, healthier future while delivering on our mission 
of transforming healthcare.
Communities remain at the heart of our mission, and through our CSR 
initiatives we continue to extend care beyond hospital walls, whether 
through Mission TB Free, which reached over 38,000 beneficiaries 
across five districts, an anaemia screening and awareness drive 
for underprivileged children, or the launch of a new OPD clinic in 
Kurukshetra serving nearly 1,500 patients each month.

Inherent limitations 
 
7. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can 
affect comparability between entities.

8. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (‘IESBA’), 
which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care,

Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  
11. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud 
or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.  
12. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
