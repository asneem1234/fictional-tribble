1
Sustainable 
Forest / 
Plantation 
Management
Opportunity
Given CPIL's dependence on 
timber as a key raw material, 
the company has prioritized 
responsible sourcing practices. 
Procuring timber from 
agroforestry plantations and 
certified sources, e.g. FSC, 
local government-certified, 
helps conserve natural forests, 
mitigate climate change, and 
ensure long-term raw material 
availability.
Initiatives such as afforestation 
through sapling distribution and 
the use of fast-growing, low-
water clonal saplings further 
reduce ecological impact while 
supporting rural livelihoods. 
This approach strengthens 
supply chain resilience and 
aligns with both environmental 
and social responsibility goals.
NA
Positive:  
Regulatory 
compliance, 
improved supply 
chain resilience, 
stronger brand 
reputation.
2.
Climate 
Change, 
Energy, 
and GHG 
Emissions
Risk & 
Opportunity
Climate change and rising 
global temperatures present 
significant physical risks, 
such as floods, droughts, 
and forest fires, which can 
impact the availability of raw 
materials for the industry. 
Implementation of stringent 
regulations on renewable 
energy adoption, along with 
volatile energy costs, may pose 
financial and operational risks 
to the company. Higher costs 
and stricter rules to adopt 
renewable energy could affect 
the company's operations and 
profitability.
1.
Integration of renewable energy
into the energy mix, contributing
19% to the total electricity
consumption in FY 2024-25, with
a year-on-year increase of 52% in
driven by the expansion of solar
capacities of ~3 MW across the
factories.
2.
Enhancing energy efficiency
by implementing advanced
technologies in manufacturing
units. Refer to (P6-L-4) for
detailed measures.
3.
Utilization of biomass for thermic
fluid heaters (TFH) instead of
fossil fuels.
4.
Deployment of electrical forklifts
across the facilities, reducing
reliance on fossil fuel.
Negative:  
Cost of transitioning 
to cleaner 
technologies.
Positive: 
Reduced energy 
costs, regulatory 
incentives, improved 
sustainability 
credentials.
Sr. 
No
Material 
issue 
identified
Indicate

In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
3.
Chemical 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
The use of adhesives, resins, 
and other chemicals in 
plywood manufacturing poses 
environmental and occupational 
health risks. Regulatory non-
compliance can lead to legal 
liabilities. Responsible practices 
during the handling of the 
chemicals enhance safety and 
brand reputation.
1.
Usage of turbo air ventilators
and exhaust fans to enhance air
quality and maintain a healthy
working environment.
2.
Adoption of the closed-loop
pipeline systems for transporting
chemicals to reduce manual
handling and minimize spill risk.
3.
Implementation of formaldehyde
emission-free binder resins,
significantly reducing
the emissions during the
manufacturing processes.
Negative: 
Compliance costs, 
potential regulatory 
fines.
Positive:  
Improved worker 
safety, enhanced 
brand value, and 
access to eco-
conscious markets.
4.
Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Customers are increasingly 
seeking high-quality and 
innovative products, creating 
a significant opportunity for 
the company to expand into 
new markets and strengthen 
its competitive position. CPIL 
has a dedicated R&D cell at 
its Joka factory, focused on 
developing innovative products 
that minimize environmental 
and social impacts. Key 
advancements include fire-
retardant, water-resistant, 
crack-resistant, impact-
resistant, stain-resistant, and 
termite-resistant products. 
These innovations enhance 
durability, reduce maintenance 
requirements, and promote 
safer, longer-lasting use.
NA
Positive:  
Meeting evolving 
customer 
expectations for 
innovative products 
could strengthen the 
market position.
5.
Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk & 
Opportunity
Sourcing from suppliers 
engaged in unethical practices, 
such as child labour, forced 
labour, or non-compliance with 
environmental regulations, 
poses a significant risk to the 
company's values and brand 
reputation. Any association 
with such misconduct could 
lead to operational disruptions, 
and loss of stakeholder trust.
1.
Assessing the potential suppliers
and their compliance with ESG.
2.
The company has established
processes in place for backwards
integration to ensure traceability
and accountability across
the supply chain and thereby
prevent unethical business
practices by suppliers.
3.
98% of the total timber
procurement is sourced from
agroforestry.
Negative:  
Non-compliance 
could lead to a 
penalty.
Positive:  
Improved reliability, 
regulatory 
preparedness and 
enhanced brand 
reputation.
Sr. 
No

(Indicate positive

6.
Waste 
Management 
and Circular 
Economy
Risk & 
Opportunity
Inefficient waste disposal leads 
to environmental pollution and 
regulatory penalties. Circular 
economy principles can reduce 
costs and create revenue 
streams.
1. Implementing waste segregation
and recycling programs.
2.
Responsible disposal of
hazardous and non-hazardous
waste.
3.
Wood waste generated is used
to manufacture particleboard,
while the remaining wood waste
is used as biomass fuel across
the facilities.
4.
A zero-landfill policy for all
chemical waste, in compliance
with applicable regulations
Negative: 
Regulatory – 
penalties.
Positive:  
Cost savings and 
additional revenue 
from byproduct 
utilization.
7.
Water and 
Effluent 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Water-intensive processes pose 
the risk of resource depletion 
and potential regulatory 
challenges. Inefficient water 
use can lead to increased 
operational costs, non-
compliance with environmental 
regulations, and reputational 
damage. On the other hand, 
implementing efficient water 
management practices presents 
an opportunity to reduce 
costs, enhance environmental 
performance, and strengthen 
stakeholder trust.
1.
Maintaining ETPs and STPs
across the facilities to ensure
that effluents are not discharged
outside the premises.
2.
Effluent water from production
is recycled to reduce freshwater
consumption.
3.
All the facilities have
implemented rainwater
harvesting systems.
4.
All plants follow Zero Liquid
Discharge (ZLD) practices.
Negative:  
Initial compliance 
costs.
Positive:  
Reduced water 
costs, and improved 
regulatory 
compliance.
8.
Resources 
efficiency
Opportunity
At CPIL, improving resource 
efficiency is an ongoing process 
across operations, enabling the 
company to reduce operational 
costs, minimize environmental 
impact, and enhance 
productivity. It also supports 
compliance with regulatory 
requirements and helps attract 
sustainability-conscious 
customers.
NA
Positive:  
Improved resource 
efficiency, lowers 
input costs and 
reduces waste, 
driving financial 
savings.

company’s reputation, and 
contributes to long-term socio-
economic development for the 
communities.
NA
Positive: 
Strengthened 
stakeholder trust, 
improved brand 
reputation.
10. Human 
Rights
Risk & 
Opportunity
Failure to uphold human rights 
and ethical labour practices 
poses significant legal and 
reputational risks. A strong 
commitment to human rights 
enhances brand reputation, 
fosters stakeholder confidence 
and contributes to long-term 
business resilience and a 
competitive advantage.
1.
Adoption of zero tolerance
policies regarding sexual
harassment & discrimination.
2.
Fostering a fair and inclusive
work environment.
3.
Providing a respectful workplace.

Opportunity
Effective employee 
management drives 
productivity, retention, and 
overall business success.

being, engagement, and 
development fosters a positive 
work environment and meets 
career growth expectations.
NA
Positive: 
Higher retention 
and improved 
productivity.
12. Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk & 
Opportunity
The company views employee 
health and safety as a 
cornerstone of its business 
operations. Industrial 
manufacturing environments 
expose workers to risks from 
machinery, dust, chemicals, 
and other hazards, potentially 
leading to fatalities or long-term 
health effects.
Ensuring a safe workplace is 
not only a legal and ethical 
responsibility but also crucial 
for maintaining productivity, 
reducing downtime, and 
fostering employee trust.
1.
Regular safety training, safety
audits and mock activities
ensure a safe working
environment.
2.
Real-time hazard monitoring and
emergency and OHS drills.

13. Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Strong corporate governance 
offers an opportunity for the 
company to thrive. It provides 
a framework of rules, controls, 
and policies that guide sound 
decision-making, manage 
risks effectively, and ensure 
compliance. This ensures a 
positive relationship between 
stakeholders and management.
NA
Positive:  
Investor confidence, 
sustainable growth.
14. Customer 
Centricity
Opportunity
Focusing on customer 
requirements and expectations 
presents an opportunity to 
drive business growth and 
build stronger relationships. By 
understanding and adapting to 
evolving customer preferences, 
companies can enhance brand 
loyalty, improve customer 
satisfaction, and expand market 
share.
Further, the company leverages 
tools like the 2D/3D visualizers, 
colour bar, plywood calculators

Performance of the entity against the
specific commitments, goals and targets
along-with reasons in case the same are
not met.
CPIL has undertaken several initiatives that demonstrate its commitment to 
conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner:
Afforestation and Resource Management
Distributed over 26 Lakh saplings to support afforestation and promote 
sustainable sourcing of raw materials as a part of CSR activities.
Promoting the Circular Economy
CPIL recycles its wood waste in the manufacturing of particle boards and uses 
non-recyclable waste as fuel for the energy plant, thereby reducing fossil fuel 
use and supporting resource efficiency.
Innovations by R&D
ViroKill technology, with anti-viral, properties, is integrated into our plywood, 
laminates, and veneers to enhance hygiene and health standards.
FireWall technology is incorporated across relevant product lines to retard fire 
spread, thereby improving safety and adding an extra layer of protection in fire-
prone environments.
Sainik plywood is made termite and borer proof through special glue line 
protection that not only resists infestation but actively eliminates mites for 
long-lasting durability.
We have replaced the existing fungicide in our plywood products with a 
better-performing alternative that has shown encouraging results in real-time 
applications. This change, guided by green chemistry principles. This initiative 
will be progressively extended to other product lines.
Sustainable Manufacturing Practices
Strategically located manufacturing plants near resource and market hubs 
help reduce transportation-related emissions.
These measures also make logistics more cost-effective while conserving the 
environment through lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Energy 
plants  used in all our manufacturing units are now operating on eco-friendly 
fuel.
Human Rights
The Company has integrated relevant Human Rights guidelines into its BRSR 
policy, setting clear expectations for stakeholders, including business channel 
partners, investors, and contractors, to uphold human rights values. For the 
reporting period FY 2024-25, zero cases of human rights violations were 
identified and reported to the management and the Board. CPIL conducts 
vendor assessments as part of its onboarding activity to identify risks such as 
forced labour, child labour, discrimination and unfair wages.
Governance
As part of the company's commitment to strong corporate governance, CPIL 
adheres to best practices. The established Code of Conduct promotes integrity 
and accountability throughout the organization. This code clearly outlines the 
company's dedication to social responsibility, environmental sustainability, 
employee health and safety, fostering an inclusive workplace, transparency 
and legal compliance.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges,
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
At CPIL, we are at a defining phase of the Indian wood panel for the Indian wood panel industry, marked with opportunity yet 
demanding in the pace of transformation. As India undergoes a structural shift in consumption driven by rising aspirations, 
sustainable home-building and lifestyle products are fast becoming essentials. In this evolving landscape, CPIL is future-
ready. To us, modernity means more than product innovation; it reflects our shift to professional leadership, data-driven 
decisions and manufacturing rooted in sustainability. We have evolved from a family-led business to a professionally-
managed organisation focused on long-term value creation. Investments in IT systems and digital tools reinforce our belief 
that technology is key to future competitiveness. We are expanding responsibly; growing capacity, optimising plant design 
and building resource-efficient facilities that improve energy use, material yields and emissions. These are not just industrial 
assets but enablers of cleaner, resilient growth. Currently, approximately 98% of our timber is sourced through plantation-
based agroforestry. Our shift to biomass fuels, increased use of renewables and advances in waste and water management 
reflect our commitment to operational excellence with minimal environmental impact. Socially, we champion an inclusive, 
employee-first culture, fostering transparency through internal tools that keep our workforce engaged. Our flagship initiative, 
Education for All, provides free schooling to children of workers and nearby communities, enabling impact beyond our 
premises. India’s wood panel industry remains under-penetrated; per capita consumption lags global norms while the shift 
from unorganised to branded products gains pace. CPIL is well-positioned to lead this evolution through innovation, integrity 
and sustainability. We thank our stakeholders for their continued support as we build a company that delivers lasting value 
and sets new benchmarks in sustainable industrial growth.
Kind regards,
Sanjay Agarwal

2.
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes, CPIL has established procedures to integrate sustainable sourcing practices into its operations, led by the central 
procurement team. Raw material procurement is based on the forecasted production and sales for the upcoming periods, 
enabled through effective communication amongst our different departments. Before onboarding new vendors, the 
central procurement team encourages vendors to disclose on parameters like emissions, human rights, health and safety 
standards and compliance with ISO certifications and relevant statutory requirements to ensure the vendors are aligned 
with CPIL’s processes.
To minimize environmental impacts associated with raw material sourcing, CPIL practices agroforestry and plantations of 
timber. Wood is procured responsibly from non-forest plantations, adhering to sustainable practices that support ecological 
balance. Further, the company procures its core from FSC-certified sources and local governments-certified sources to 
ensure responsible sourcing.
Over 26 lakh saplings were distributed during FY 2024-25 as part of its community-driven afforestation efforts, supporting 
sustainable plantation of fast-growing, short-rotation species near its manufacturing units. To minimize transportation 
costs and improve delivery timelines, CPIL has strategically expanded its warehouse and inventory management 
capabilities. To reduce freight costs, CIPL has implemented an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to manage its 
distribution strategy. These measures enable CPIL to reduce both cost and time on transportation while also conserving 
the environment through reduced fuel consumption and lower carbon emissions.
b.
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
We continue to strengthen our commitment to sustainable and responsible sourcing.
During the reporting period, ~98% of our raw material input was sourced through agroforestry practices across all business 
divisions. More than 50% of our timber procurement was from FSC-certified sources, ensuring adherence to globally
recognised standards of responsible forest management.
3.
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
The products manufactured at our facilities are mostly not packed using plastic materials as paper is being used for packaging
of the products, which further minimizes the need for reclamation.
Plastics including packaging: Plastic waste generated is disposed of as per the regulations and norms through authorized
vendors. Plastic waste generated from packaging is very minimal since only a fraction of the products are being packed using
plastic, which is disposed of as per the regulations.
E-waste: Obsolete electronic equipment, including office IT hardware and electrical tools from production units, is collected and 
handed over to authorized E-waste recyclers registered with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Proper documentation 
and tracking ensure safe and compliant disposal.
Hazardous Waste: Hazardous waste, such as adhesives, resins, or chemicals used in manufacturing, is handled as per the 
Hazardous Waste Management Rules. The waste is stored, labelled, and disposed of through authorized Treatment, Storage 
and Disposal Facilities (TSDF). We have adopted a zero-landfill policy for all the chemicals as a part of our compliances, 
ensuring their complete utilization and eliminating any risk of landfill pollution.
Other Non-Hazardous Waste: The wood waste is utilized as raw material for producing particleboard. Any remaining volume 
that cannot be used as raw material is used as fuel in energy plant to generate heat.
4.
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
CPIL produces minimal plastic waste since only a small portion of its products (specifically pre-laminates) utilize polythene for
packaging. The company prioritizes using paper packaging for most of its product range, thereby reducing plastic consumption. 
For exported products, CPIL uses pellet packing. Going forward, the Company plans to register under the Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) regulations in accordance with the Plastic Waste Management Rules (PWMR) 2016. Additionally, any
electronic waste generated in the company's offices or facilities is responsibly disposed of through authorized recyclers.

CPIL is committed to sustainable practices through the continuous optimization of its waste management systems. We focus
on minimizing waste generation and maximizing resource efficiency across our operations. During the plywood production
process, wood waste generated from peeling is repurposed as biofuel in our energy plant, reducing our dependence on
conventional energy sources. To further decrease reliance on virgin materials, we utilize advanced technologies that enable
the rejoining of leftover wood veneers into usable raw materials.
In our laminate production, we also incorporated the use of recycled paper, reinforcing our commitment to responsible sourcing 
and waste reduction. While some waste is inherent in the log-to-plywood conversion process, we actively apply operational
controls and cutting-edge process technologies to minimize it wherever possible.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
We have established a robust Risk Management Policy that serves as both a business continuity and disaster management
plan. The primary objective of this policy is to mitigate the adverse effects of risks on our business objectives. Recently updated 
to align with amendments in Listing Regulations, the policy covers various critical areas, including strategic/business,
information technology, financial, cybersecurity and operational risks. Responsibility for implementing and monitoring the Risk 
Management Policy lies with the Risk Management Committee. This committee ensures that key risks are identified, assessed
and systematically addressed through ongoing mitigation strategies. The Board and Audit Committee are regularly briefed on
the outcomes of risk assessments and the procedures in place to minimize these risks.
6.
Disclose any significant adverse impact on the environment arising from the value chain of the entity. What
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
CPIL has not observed any adverse environmental impacts arising from its value chain. However, recognizing the environmental 
risks associated with a timber-based industry, the company has proactively implemented sustainable sourcing, efficient
operations and climate-conscious initiatives to mitigate potential negative impacts.
Sustainable Sourcing & Forest Stewardship

Approximately 98% of wood-based raw materials are sourced from agroforestry plantations. These plantations are
cultivated on non-forest lands and are managed to maintain ecological balance while providing livelihoods to farmers,
significantly reducing the risks of deforestation and biodiversity loss.

CPIL also procures FSC-certified veneer, harvested from short-rotation plantation forests. These forests enable responsible
and sustainable timber harvesting with minimal ecological impact.
Farmer Support & Agroforestry Outreach

CPIL distributed over 26 lakhs’ saplings, along with targeted training to promote sustainable plantation practices. These
initiatives not only strengthen CPIL’s raw material security but also contribute to environmental restoration and rural
economic empowerment.
Import Diversification

CPIL has strategically diversified its sourcing by importing high-quality plywood timber from countries such as Vietnam,
Brazil, and Africa. This approach has helped mitigate risks related to domestic supply constraints and price volatility, while 
ensuring adherence to responsible sourcing standards across its global supply chain.
7.
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for
environmental impacts.
CPIL currently assesses its suppliers using a vendor evaluation form that focuses on social parameters such as forced labour,
child labour, fair wages, and non-discrimination at the workplace.

Essential Indicators
1.
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
At CPIL, consumer satisfaction is one of the key indicators of business growth and long-term sustainability. Through our
efforts and commitment, we have consistently been at the forefront of providing consumers with the level of satisfaction they
expect from us. Since our primary operations are B2B in nature, we regularly engage with empanelled dealers and architects
to identify and address any concerns related to product quality or terms of engagement.
CPIL offers a multi-channel feedback system through which stakeholders can share feedback and register complaints via
a toll-free helpline, WhatsApp-based support, dedicated customer service email, the 'Enquire Now' feature on our website,
and various social media platforms used for public interaction and issue escalation. To record and document all customer
complaints and provide suitable remedies, we have implemented a formal grievance redressal procedure.
Consumers can also reach out to empanelled dealers and distributors to share feedback and complaints related to product
quality. These complaints are handled by the marketing and sales team, and if further escalation is required, the zonal in-
charge designated for each product line (Laminates, Plywood, Particleboard, MDF, Decorative Veneer, and New Age Products)
is contacted.

the results of our work; and (ii) evaluating the effect of any
identified misstatements in the BRSR Core. Moore Singhi
expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for
any decision a person or entity would make based on
this assurance statement and for any damages in case
erroneous data is reported. This assurance engagement
relies on the assumption that all data and information
provided by CPIL is accurate and complete.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(ISAE) 3410: Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas
Statements, “Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR
Core” as per Circular No: SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/
CIR/2024/177 dated December 20th, 2024 as well as the
terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with
CPIL in the engagement letter dated February 27, 2025.
Those standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether, in all material respects, the KPIs presented to 
us are prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria 
chosen by the Company as per the aforementioned 
Circulars.
A reasonable assurance engagement includes performing 
procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence 
assessing the risk of material misstatement of the KPIs 
disclosed in BRSR Core. In this connection, we have 
performed the following procedures:
1.
Evaluated the suitability of the quantification methods 
used for the BRSR Core KPIs.
2.
Engaged in discussions with the personnel at both
corporate and facilities responsible for the information
presented in the report.
3.
On a sample basis, verified the data collected,
recorded, and aggregated to determine the level of
accuracy of the reporting.
4.
Enquired with the senior management of the Company 
and obtained management representation towards all
the stated matters of the report.
Exclusions:

Management controls, including testing internal
controls or verifying the aggregation and calculation
of data within the IT systems.

The Company’s statements that describe expressions
of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or
future intentions or any forward-looking assertions
and/or data.

Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance
indicators’ included in the Report on which KPI
reporting is based. We have been informed by the
company that these are derived from the company’s
audited financial statements.
5. Inherent Limitations
The reliability of assurance on non-financial information
is subject to uncertainties inherent in the assurance
process. The lack of a significant universal body of
established practice for measuring and evaluating non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable,
measures and measurement techniques, potentially
affecting comparability between entities. Specifically,
the uncertainties in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
estimation arise due to incomplete scientific knowledge,
limitations in quantification models, and the assumptions
or conversion factors used to arrive at results. Due to these
inherent limitations, there is a possibility that material
misstatements in the sustainability information of the
BRSR Core KPIs in the Report may remain undetected. The 
application of this assurance statement is limited to the 
aforementioned circulars.
6. Opinion
Based on our procedures performed and evidences
obtained as mentioned in the section 4, information and
explanations given and management representations
provided to us, we are of the opinion that the BRSR Core
KPIs mentioned in Annexure – 1 of our report are reliable,
and prepared in accordance with the criteria chosen by the 
Company based on the requirements of the aforementioned 
Circulars.
7. Restriction on Use
Our work was performed solely to assist management
in meeting their responsibilities in relation to CPIL’s
assurance requirements as per the Circulars. The report
is addressed and provided to the Board of Directors of the
Company, solely for the purpose of enabling it to comply
with the aforementioned requirements of the Circulars,
and should not be used, referred to or distributed for
any other purpose or to any other party without our prior
written consent. Accordingly, we do not accept or assume
any liability or duty of care for any other purpose for which
or to any other person to whom this assurance report is
shown or into whose hands it may come without our prior
consent in writing. Other than as described in paragraph
1, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did
not perform any assurance procedures on the remaining
information. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on
that information.
