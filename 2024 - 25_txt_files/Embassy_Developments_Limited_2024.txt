BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024-25
SEGMENT
RISK
MITIGATION
1.	 Regulatory 
Compliance
Failure to comply with rapidly changing 
regulatory requirements can result in 
adverse impact for the Company and 
erode 
stakeholders’ 
trust. 
Evolving 
environmental and social regulations 
present 
a 
risk 
of 
potential 
non-
compliance which, if not met, can result 
in fines, penalties and adverse impact on 
brand reputation.
EDL is committed to promote a culture 
of 
compliance 
within 
the 
organization 
supported by a zero-tolerance policy and 
has a robust set of environmental, social 
and governance related policies in place. 
At 
EDL, 
compliance 
related 
risks 
are 
reviewed at regular intervals and procedures 
and practices constantly evolve to fulfil 
compliance requirements based on extant 
rulings and changing market conditions.
2.	 Physical Impacts of 
Climate Change
Increased severity of extreme weather 
events including natural disasters, rising 
mean temperatures and sea levels pose 
a risk of damage to real estate portfolio. 
It can result in adverse impacts in future 
in the form of costs to repair and replace 
damaged assets in case of any natural 
disasters 
and 
subsequent 
property 
downtime.
As part of its mitigation strategy, EDL maps 
physical risks for its current portfolio and 
future development projects, followed by 
incorporation of physical adaptation and 
mitigation measures for assets that are 
identified at risk.
All our buildings are designed for a seismic 
zone higher than the zone of the area they 
are built in, to ensure greater resilience 
in an earthquake. Additionally, rainwater 
harvesting wells have been built for water 
conservation and to prevent flooding at site.
3.	 Health and Safety
ED, majorly at Group Level, is engaged 
in 
construction 
of 
buildings 
and 
management of a significant portfolio of 
real estate assets. Owing to the nature 
of the operations, health and safety is 
identified as a potential risk for business. 
As 
productivity 
can 
be 
adversely 
affected or significantly improved based 
on Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) performance, ensuring the safety 
of its employees, contractors and the 
local communities surrounding project 
sites is its top-most priority.
Health and safety are one of the key 
priorities for the Company. The Company 
has mandated to follow all the measures 
to strengthen health and safety systems 
and processes for preventing any safety 
incidents.

work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending 
corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar 
incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to
