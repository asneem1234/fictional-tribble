Climate 
Strategy 
& GHG 
Emissions
R
HPL operates energy-
intensive manufacturing (DG 
sets, furnaces, grid power 
dependency). Increasing 
regulatory scrutiny (carbon 
tax, EPR), supply chain 
pressure, and investor demand 
make this a significant 
transitional risk.
Conducted Scope 1 and 2 
inventory; site-wise hotspot 
mapping; exploring solar rooftop, 
net metering, energy efficiency, 
and decarbonization pathways; 
recommended RE100/SBTi 
alignment.
Negative: Higher 
compliance costs, 
exposure to future 
carbon pricing;
Positive: Efficiency 
savings, long-term 
access to ESG-
aligned capital.

Energy 
Management
O
With rising electricity tariffs 
and grid reliability challenges, 
energy management in 
plants is critical to reducing 
operating cost and Scope 2 
emissions.

(357Q, Karnal); investment 
in LED lighting, VFDs, and 
metering infrastructure; explore 
storage solutions to optimize 
solar usage and reduce peak 
loads.

savings, improved 
margins, enhanced 
ESG scores.
3
Product 
Stewardship
O
Increasing demand for 
smart, energy-efficient, and 
BIS-compliant electrical 
products across B2B and 
B2C segments. Mandatory 
standards and EPR policies 
make eco-design a growth 
lever.
Focus on R&D and BIS-
compliance, IEC standards, RoHS 
compliance; design for energy 
savings and long product life; 
evaluate product take-back, EPR 
readiness.
Positive: Revenue 
growth through 
premium offerings;

leadership; avoids 
regulatory penalties.
4
Human 
Capital 
Development
O

gives HPL an edge.
Internal capability building; 
skill development programs; 
technical partnerships; invest 
in employee engagement, 
appraisals, and rotation across 
locations.
Positive: Enhanced 
productivity, 
innovation, and 
reduced attrition 
costs.
5
Employee 
Health and 
Safety
R
Manufacturing involves 
thermal and electrical hazards, 
especially in panel assembly 
and DG set production. Also, 
compliance with OSH Code 
and ISO 45001 is essential.
Site-level EHS policies; fire 
safety drills; PPE training; 
internal safety audits; explore 
digitized incident tracking and 
behavioral safety training.
Negative: Non-
compliance risks, 
injury liabilities, 
productivity losses;
Positive; Reduce 
LTIFR morale boost 
reputational gains
6
Business 
Ethics & 
Corporate 
Governance
R
As a listed entity, non-
compliance with SEBI 
LODR, Companies Act, or 
data governance lapses can 
impact brand and investor 
confidence. Ethical sourcing is 
also gaining traction.
Strong internal audit 
mechanisms; related party 
monitoring; code of conduct 
trainings; whistleblower 
channels; vendor code of 
conduct to be extended across 
supply chain.
Negative: Penalties, 
reputational damage 
if gaps occur;
Positive; ESG

report, 
highlighting 
ESG 
related 
challenges, targets and achievements
At HPL Electric & Power Limited, we continue to integrate Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our business operations in a 
structured and pragmatic manner. Over the past year, our focus remained 
on strengthening internal processes related to energy efficiency, employee 
well-being, and responsible waste management. We also expanded 
the use of solar energy across select facilities and improved tracking of 
hazardous waste in line with regulatory expectations.
While we have made steady progress in areas like occupational health and 
safety, stakeholder engagement, and resource optimization, we recognize 
that more needs to be done in terms of sustainability reporting, supplier 
sustainability assessments, and third-party assurance. These remain key 
areas of focus in the coming year.
Our ESG journey is evolving, and we are committed to building institutional 
readiness through incremental improvements, guided by transparency, 
compliance, and stakeholder trust. We will continue aligning with 
applicable regulations and frameworks, while maintaining realistic and 
responsible ambitions that reflect our business context.

If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief
Permanent Workers
At HPL Electric & Power Limited, well-defined mechanisms are in place to address 
grievances across all categories of employees and workers. The Company is committed 
to promote a respectful, transparent, and ethical workplace, and has institutionalized 
multiple platforms through which concerns can be raised and resolved.
For permanent workers, grievance mechanisms are designed to ensure accessibility and 
responsiveness. HPL promotes a fair and supportive environment where every concern 
is taken seriously and resolved in a timely and impartial manner.
Non-permanent workers are also supported through structured redressal channels. 
Designated HR contacts are available across facilities, and drop boxes are placed at key 
locations to allow anonymous submission of concerns. This ensures that contractual 
and temporary staff can report issues without hesitation or fear of retaliation.
Permanent employees benefit from a comprehensive grievance handling framework. 
HPL has partnered with an independent third-party ethics organization to manage 
grievance reporting. Employees can register their concerns through various channels 
including phone, email, physical mail, or direct communication, ensuring both 
accessibility and confidentiality. Additionally, a formal whistle-blower mechanism 
allows anonymous reporting of ethical concerns, which are periodically reviewed by the 
Audit Committee to ensure transparency and accountability.
Collectively, these systems reflect HPL’s ongoing commitment to upholding high 
standards of workplace ethics, trust, and employee well-being.

significant risks emerging from workplace assessments. All reported incidents are thoroughly examined, and insights derived from 
such investigations are shared across relevant functions to drive systemic improvements and prevent recurrence. Corrective actions 
are designed and implemented based on the nature and severity of the risks identified. Their effectiveness is reviewed during internal 
safety audits, which also serve to evaluate compliance with established safety protocols and ISO 45001:2018 standards. Any significant 
concerns flagged through health and safety reviews are addressed using a layered risk control approach, prioritizing measures that 
most effectively mitigate potential hazards and ensure a safe working environment.
