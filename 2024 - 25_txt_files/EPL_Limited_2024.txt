To identify and monitor conflicts of interest involving the Directors, the Secretarial Team maintains a database of the Directors and 
the entities where they have a significant interest. This list is shared with the Finance Team, which flags these entities in their system 
to track any transactions entered into by the Company with them. Additionally, at the start of each financial year and whenever 
there are changes in their interests, the Company requests an updated list from each Board member of entities in which they hold a 
substantial interest. The Directors are also required to submit an annual declaration under the Code of Conduct, confirming that they 
will always act in the best interests of the Company and ensure that any personal or business relationships do not create conflicts with 
the Company’s operations.
	
Senior Management personnel also provide an annual affirmation that they have not engaged in any material financial or commercial 
transactions that could potentially conflict with the Company’s interests. During Board meetings, Directors refrain from participating in 
discussions where they may have a potential conflict of interest. Furthermore, a guidance mechanism is in place to help Directors and 
Senior Management personnel address any potential conflicts of interest when recommending or approving investment proposals or 
granting loans.

10.	 Health and safety management system
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No)
Yes
	
If Yes, the coverage of such systems:
EPL has established a robust Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) that is implemented across all its 
global operations. This system is anchored in EPL’s Harmonized Manufacturing Policy (HMP), which incorporates key elements 
of ISO 45001:2018, particularly Sections 4, 5, and 8. The policy outlines a structured approach to managing health and safety, 
aligning with recognized international standards. The concluding section of the HMP clearly outlines the ISO components 
integrated within the policy framework.
All EPL manufacturing sites worldwide are ISO 45001:2018 certified by TUV Nord, underscoring our strong commitment to 
maintaining the highest standards of occupational health and safety.
To facilitate on-ground implementation, EPL has developed a comprehensive Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE) Manual. This 
manual serves as a practical resource for safety procedures, compliance measures, and industry best practices. It complements 
the SHE policy by offering clear and actionable guidelines for maintaining a safe workplace.
We prioritize ongoing employee engagement on safety matters and actively promote safe behaviours through structured 
communication and awareness programs. All employees and plant personnel undergo regular training sessions covering both 
basic and advanced fire safety measures. To ensure preparedness, mock evacuation drills are routinely conducted. EPL also 
collaborates with expert vendors to provide hands-on training in operating fire-fighting equipment.
In line with our culture of continuous improvement, EPL manufacturing units regularly participate in safety award programs 
conducted by the National Safety Council (NSC). This engagement not only acknowledges our safety efforts but also allows us 
to benchmark practices against industry leaders and adopt evolving best practices.
We are pleased to report zero workplace accidents involving employees during the reporting period, highlighting the success 
of our safety systems.
In addition to physical safety, EPL places significant emphasis on employee well-being, including mental health. The company 
has hosted multiple wellness sessions and interactive workshops led by healthcare professionals and subject matter experts, 
aimed at fostering holistic well-being.
The full Harmonized Manufacturing Policy is publicly accessible on our website.

EPL has rolled out a comprehensive Global Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE) Manual that acts as a core reference for ensuring 
a safe and healthy workplace across all its operational sites. The manual addresses a wide array of critical safety topics, including risk 
assessments, hazard identification, accident reporting and investigations, use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), fire safety protocols, 
emergency preparedness, permit-to-work systems, safe operational and maintenance practices, material handling, and safety audits.
	
To support effective implementation and understanding, the manual is translated into the local languages of the countries where EPL 
operates such as English, Hindi, Chinese, Arabic, Polish, German, and Spanish, ensuring accessibility for all employees.
	
EPL also organizes regular and structured training sessions for employees and plant personnel, covering key areas such as fire 
safety, first aid, permit-to-work procedures, safety audits, and incident reporting. These sessions are aimed at enhancing awareness, 
encouraging safe work practices, and ensuring adherence to safety guidelines.

PRINCIPLE 4: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF AND BE RESPONSIVE TO ALL ITS STAKEHOLDERS
This principle highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement. Companies should consider the interests and perspectives of all 
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate. They should also be 
responsive to stakeholder concerns and feedback.
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity:
	
EPL conducts a materiality assessment every three years, with a comprehensive evaluation completed in FY 2019-20. During this 
assessment, we reviewed our material topics to ensure their relevance and applicability over three consecutive reporting cycles. 
The process involved extensive stakeholder engagement to identify key issues that are significant to both our organization and 
stakeholders, with potential impacts on our operations.
	
For more details, refer to the EPL's Sustainability Report at https://www.eplglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EPL-Global-
Sustainability-Report-FY2024.pdf for FY2024 (Page 48-50). Further, these details are also available on Page nos. 40-42 of the Integrated 
Annual Report.
	
EPL's Materiality Assessment Approach:
•	
Reporting: We report on the progress made on key material issues identified through the materiality assessment.
•	
Categorization: Potential material issues are grouped into three categories: Governance, Environmental, and Social.
•	
Identification: Secondary research and reviews of global and sectoral reports on broader sustainability trends, risks, and 
opportunities help us compile a list of potential material issues.
•	
Prioritization: Material issues are prioritized through extensive consultations with our Corporate Leadership Team and 
Sustainability Steering Committee.
•	
Integration: The prioritized issues are further validated with key stakeholders to identify the most material topics for EPL. These 
issues are then integrated into our business processes, operations, and monitoring mechanisms.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts

Yes
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues:
EPL Ltd. has a comprehensive Human Rights Policy that establishes an organized and effective process for addressing grievances 
related to human rights violations. The policy is backed by a transparent, prompt, robust, and confidential grievance redressal system, 
which is essential in resolving workplace conflicts and fostering a positive work environment across all EPL locations.
Each EPL unit has a designated Grievance Committee that convenes biannually to review and address employee complaints. To 
encourage anonymity, grievance boxes are placed in every unit in areas without CCTV surveillance, enabling employees to submit 
concerns or complaints confidentially and without fear of retaliation.
Grievances are also discussed during monthly and/or quarterly Works Committee Meetings and Focused Group Discussions (FGDs), 
providing employees with regular opportunities to voice their concerns. A formal report is compiled and submitted to the Human 
Rights Committee every six months for comprehensive review and action.
EPL ensures that all employees, supervisors, and staff receive ongoing training and awareness on human rights issues. Anyone who 
suspects or witnesses a human rights violation is required to report it immediately via the Speak Up Portal, even if preventive measures 
are in place.
To ensure full awareness and accessibility, the company shares information about human rights policies and grievance mechanisms 
through induction programs, awareness sessions, email communications, and internal publications such as newsletters and magazines.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission?  (Yes/ No)
Yes
	
If Yes, then provide details:
	
EPL has undertaken several greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction projects as part of its broader climate commitment. In August 2021, the 
company became a signatory to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and in August 2024, its GHG emissions reduction targets 
were formally validated and approved by the SBTi. These targets align with global efforts to limit temperature rise in accordance with 
the goals of the Paris Agreement.
	
To advance toward these targets, EPL has implemented a range of initiatives focused on energy efficiency, process optimization, and 
renewable energy adoption across its facilities.
	
At the Nalagarh plant, older CFL lighting (18 kW) was replaced with energy-efficient LED lights (3.24 kW), significantly lowering 
electricity use. A new suction motor with a lower power rating (0.83 kW) was also installed to reduce energy consumption in daily 
operations.
	
At the Vasind plant, steps were taken to improve the efficiency of cooling and pumping systems. This included replacing three older 
chillers with a single energy-efficient model, redesigning the header system to improve flow and pressure, and installing new high-
efficiency pumps in place of four separate units.
	
These measures contribute directly towards lowering the plant’s overall electricity demand and associated GHG emissions.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
Our company has implemented structured practices for the safe and compliant management of hazardous and toxic chemical waste 
across all operations. Waste is segregated at source, with clear distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous streams. To support 
responsible disposal and regulatory compliance, waste stream mapping is integrated across facilities, allowing for full traceability and 
control. No transboundary movement of hazardous waste is permitted.
All hazardous waste is managed locally through partnerships with authorized vendors, in accordance with Pollution Control Board 
regulations. Each waste transfer is meticulously documented using official waste transfer notes to ensure traceability, transparency, 
and regulatory compliance.
Hazardous waste is collected and stored in a designated storage area secured under lock and key, ensuring controlled access and 
safe handling. Chemical storage areas are also designated and locked spaces, where used and fresh oil are stored separately in an 
organized and controlled manner.
To minimize risks and maintain workplace safety, we have implemented necessary safety measures. These include the availability of 
fire extinguishers, clearly displayed safety signage, and spill kits to manage accidental chemical spills during usage or handling.

Energy Efficiency 
Initiatives at Nalagarh
The plant undertook energy efficiency 
measures by replacing its existing 
CFL lighting system (18 kW) with 
energy-efficient LED lights (3.24 kW). 
Additionally, a new suction motor 
with a lower power rating of 0.83 kW 
was installed to further reduce energy 
usage in operational processes.
As a result of these initiatives, lighting 
power consumption was reduced by 
80%, significantly lowering electricity 
usage and associated costs. The 
new suction motor is expected to 
achieve a 60% reduction in energy 
consumption, contributing to overall 
improvements in energy efficiency.

Project Samvardhan 
- Waste reduction 
initiative at Vasind
The Vasind unit was a key contributor 
to material wastage, accounting for 
61% of the India based plants’ total 
waste. Analysis pointed to trim-related 
issues, such as excess film usage, 
overhanging widths, and inefficient 
slit combinations caused by non-
standard jumbo and laminate widths.
It resulted in a 0.68% and 1.60% 
reduction in waste from Platina 210 
Pro and Platina 220, respectively.
To tackle this, the team 
standardized 
widths, 
optimized slit and laminate 
combinations, 
minimized 
overhang, and evaluated 
machine capabilities. Trials 
on key laminates, along 
with collaboration across 
units, further contributed to 
optimizing width and track, 
leading to a substantial 
reduction in material waste.
Water conservation 
initiative at Assam
We 
implemented 
a 
rainwater 
harvesting system to collect water for 
sustainable use.
This initiative enables us to gather 
around 2,00,000 liters of water 
every month, which is then used to 
recharge borewell reservoirs.
NA
Circular economy 
initiative at Wada
The 
introduction 
of 
the 
New 
Generation Recycler (NGR) process at 
the Wada facility has greatly enhanced 
our circular economy initiatives. This 
process allows for the recycling of 
post-industrial waste, supporting the 
sustainable reuse of materials within 
the production cycle.
In the previous fiscal year, the NGR 
process effectively recycled 1,003 
metric tonnes of waste, cutting 
the facility’s total waste output by 
65%. This initiative resulted in a 60% 
reduction in waste disposal costs 
and a 30% decrease in raw material 
expenses. The recycled materials 
are then repurposed into products 
like liners, core plugs, and PP pallets, 
further promoting sustainability by 
reintroducing these materials into 
the production process.
NA
Energy efficiency 
initiatives at Vasind
To optimize energy efficiency, we 
implemented several key changes 
across our cooling and pumping 
systems. This included replacing three 
existing chillers with a single energy-
efficient Carrier chiller, redesigning 
the header system to optimize flow 
and pressure, and replacing four 
separate pumps with high-efficiency 
alternatives.
These 
enhancements 
led 
to 
substantial energy savings across 
various systems. The new chiller saved 
5,34,699 kWh annually, while the 
optimized priming system reduced 
energy use by 54,360 kWh per year. 
Furthermore, the reconfiguration of 
the condenser pump system resulted 
in savings of 1,35,600 kWh annually, 
collectively improving performance 
and significantly lowering energy 
costs.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation 
or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard:
EPL has identified environmental risks as part of its ESG compliance and aligned with ISO 20400 (Sustainable Procurement) 
accreditation. Corresponding control measures have been implemented to mitigate these risks throughout the entire value chain 
within EPL’s supply chain. All EPL plants globally are certified under ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management System). To support 
this, EPL conducts an Environmental Aspect Impact Study across its global operations, evaluating the environmental aspects at each 
stage of its operations, their impact on the environment, and the control measures adopted.
EPL has developed a Sustainable Procurement Policy to ensure that sustainable practices are integrated into the Supply Chain team’s 
operations. This policy outlines the responsibility of the Supply Chain team to minimize negative environmental and social impacts 
associated with the products and services offered, addressing environmental concerns throughout the supply chain.
The policy is also available on EPL’s website at: https://www.eplglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sustainable-procurement-
policy.pdf
Additionally, we have established a ‘Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct’ to ensure that all our suppliers meet essential business 
expectations while adhering to legal obligations, ethical standards, human rights, and environmental management practices. The 
Code is built on globally recognized international frameworks, such as the International Labour Organization, UN Global Compact 
principles, the UN’s Business and Human Rights principles, and industry best practices. Compliance with this code is a fundamental 
requirement for conducting business with EPL. It sets the minimum standards expected of our suppliers, their sub-tier suppliers, 
and subcontractors. Our Supplier Code of Conduct is also available on our website: https://www.eplglobal.com/wp-content/

Note:
Our strategic suppliers account for 83% of our global procurement expenditure. During the reporting period, 100% of these strategic suppliers have 
committed to our Sustainable Procurement Code of Conduct and have been evaluated for environmental impacts. As part of our supply chain 
operations, EPL conducts Supplier Assessments, which include regular audits of our strategic suppliers. Our procurement team performs on-site audits 
at supplier facilities, using a thorough 15 element checklist. This checklist covers essential areas such as supplier capability, quality control, continuous 
improvement initiatives, documentation, and compliance with processes.
EPL has earned the ISO 20400:2017 certification for sustainable procurement on a global scale. By adopting ISO 20400, EPL is making sustainable 
procurement decisions that benefit both society and the economy, while encouraging suppliers and stakeholders to follow suit. This certification helps 
us minimize environmental impact, address human rights concerns, and improve supplier relationships, all while aligning global costs for the long 
term and enhancing procurement performance. This approach provides EPL with a competitive advantage.
