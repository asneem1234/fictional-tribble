Governance, leadership and oversight
7.  Statement by Director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG 
related 
challenges, 
targets 
and 
achievements 
For Savita, sustainability is a choice not an option which is evident 
from the Company’s initiative to venture into the renewable space 
26 years back. In line with this vision, your Company is making 
conscious efforts towards creating a resilient and sustainable future, 
which has shaped your Company's strategy and decision-making 
over the years not only through early adoption of renewable energy 
but also through development of bio-based product portfolios, and 
a sharp focus on operational eco-efficiency.
Last year, your Company had formalised its ESG Policy, establishing 
a framework for better alignment, accountability, and decision-
making. Building on the foundation laid in the previous reporting 
cycle, this year has been guided by a structured ESG governance 
framework and informed by the material issues most relevant to your 
Company's stakeholders. Moreover, risk awareness has remained 
central to your Company's approach, guided by the Precautionary 
Principle. Your Company actively monitors environmental risks, 
including extreme weather events, and continues to implement 
measures to enhance infrastructure resilience, supply chain stability, 
and water stewardship. By integrating sustainability into R&D, 
such as developing ester-based fluids and specialized immersion 
coolants for emerging applications, your Company aims to reduce 
its environmental impact while creating market-ready solutions.
Your Company also continues to reduce its operational carbon 
footprint by adopting energy-efficient technologies, optimising 
water usage, controlling emissions, and engaging its teams in 
sustainability practices. Transitioning to cleaner energy, including 
installation of solar systems on factory roofs, supports this direction. 
That said, your Company's role in combating climate change and 
fostering a sustainable and resilient future is also reflected through 
its operation of over 53MW of wind power plants over the last two 
and a half decades.
Your Company also remains committed to uplifting the communities 
where it operates. Through its sponsored Mid-Day Meal program, 
your Company helped to serve nutritious meals to approximately 
7,867 school children near its two manufacturing facilities in 
Silvassa.
While external uncertainties remain, be it geopolitical tensions, 
supply chain volatility, or regulatory shifts, your Company remains 
grounded in the principles of reliability, resilience, and sustainability. 
Your Company's commitment is to move forward with discipline and 
intent, creating lasting value for all stakeholders while contributing 
meaningfully to the environmental and social challenges of time.
For more details on your Company's ESG achievements and 
aspirations, please refer to your Company's Sustainability Report 
for FY 2024-2025, which will be available at your Company's website.
