Response
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for zero 
liquid discharge (ZLD)?
Yes
If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
Water being an important environmental resource, 
necessary initiatives are taken across all the 
manufacturing units to conserve and recycle water, 
thus ensuring the ZLD (Zero liquid Discharge). At 
all manufacturing locations suitable and sufficient 
wastewater treatment like sewage treatment plants 
(STP) are installed with primary, secondary, and 
tertiary treatment which include nano filtration / RO 
/ UV treatment facilities to treat wastewater to usable 
quality water. The treated water is further used for 
flushing and gardening activities within the premises. 
This in turn has resulted in reduced use of freshwater.

10.	 Brieﬂy describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in 
your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such waste.:
We have adopted waste management practices as per the statutory/regulatory requirements and ISO 14001. 
For managing all the waste coming from the operations, we have clearly bifurcated the hazardous and non-
hazardous waste categories and separate collection bins are installed at each shop/cell. Waste always remains 
segregated, including during transit from floor to the storage and within the storage area. Relevant vendors 
have been identified and authorized to safety and sustainably manage the waste. 
Recording and monitoring of waste generation and disposal selection and related waste processing agreements 
with waste collection agencies are in line with regulatory obligations. Recycling and disposal of hazardous 
waste are performed through MPCB-authorized agencies. Returnable packaging is used with customers 
thereby reducing waste generation in the value chain.
