are empowering the next generation with knowledge and opportunity. We are proud to inform about our new

and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company recognizes that every material has an intrinsic value not only in its use phase but also at the end of 
life. The generation of any waste materials are a result of significant underutilization of resources and products. 
The intrinsic value can be unlocked through efficient and responsible management of waste.
	
While the Company's cement kilns offer a unique solution to address climate change by managing waste 
generated by societies and industries responsibly, it has made focused efforts within the boundary of its 
operations to segregate waste at source and conserve our natural resources through minimization of waste.
	
The following measures have been taken by the Company to manage significant waste in its operations:
	
E-waste:
	
The Company is not in the business of electronic consumer goods. However, the E-waste produced during the 
office operations is sold to the authorised recyclers.
	
Hazardous waste:
	
The hazardous waste generated is disposed through the authorised recyclers or disposers having permissions 
from State Pollution Control Boards.
	
Jute waste:
	
The Company utilizes in process jute waste as fuel for its captive power plant for the jute mill in Birlapur to 
generate steam and electricity.
	
Biodegradable waste:
	
Biodegradable waste generated at our premises is converted to manure through automatic organic waste 
composting machine.
	
Other waste:
	
Other non-hazardous waste such as steel scrap generated at the premises is recycled through authorised 
recyclers who provide valid certificates of the end use. Coal ash generated at captive power plants is utilized 
in-house as an additive to cement manufacturing.
