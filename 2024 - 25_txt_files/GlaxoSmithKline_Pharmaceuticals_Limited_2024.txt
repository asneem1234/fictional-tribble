1.
Financial 
Controls and 
Reporting
Risk
Non-compliance with existing or 
new financial or new ESG reporting, 
and disclosure requirements, laws 
and regulations could materially 
and adversely affect our financial 
results and reputation. Failure 
to comply with applicable laws 
and 
regulations 
could 
result 
in GSK being investigated by 
relevant 
government 
agencies 
and authorities and/or in legal 
proceedings against us.
The 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
key 
financial 
reporting controls are regularly 
tested 
and 
reviewed 
by 
management 
and 
tested 
by 
external third parties. ESG controls 
are 
tested 
by 
external 
third 
parties. This gives us assurance 
that controls over key financial 
reporting and disclosure processes 
are operating effectively.
Negative
2.
Commercial 
Practices
Risk
Failure to engage in activities 
that are consistent with the 
letter and spirit of the law, or the 
Group’s 
requirements 
relating 
to commercial practices could 
materially and adversely affect 
our ability to deliver our strategy 
and long-term priorities. It may 
also result in ineffective treatment 
of 
patients, 
regulatory/legal 
action, 
financial 
repercussions, 
and reputational harm. 
Your 
Company 
incrementally 
evolved policies and standards, 
including the Code of Practice, to 
ensure that commercial activities 
that are undertaken are executed 
within the established governance 
framework. All the employees are 
trained on relevant information 
with a focus on interactive learning 
and 
elements 
of 
behavioural 
science. 
All 
the 
commercial 
activities must conform to local 
laws, high ethical, regulatory, and 
industry standards.
Annual audits are undertaken by 
internal audit and global audit 
teams to provide assurance on the 
effectiveness of controls.
Negative
3.
Legal 
Matters
Risk
Failure to mitigate legal risk 
could 
expose 
your 
Company 
and 
associated 
persons 
to 
governmental 
investigation, 
regulatory action, and civil and 
criminal 
liability. 
In 
addition, 
failure to manage legal risk could 
have 
substantial 
implications 
for GSK’s reputation and the 
credibility of senior leaders. It 
might erode investor confidence 
in your Company’s governance, 
risk 
management 
and 
future 
performance, 
and 
have 
a 
consequential negative impact 
on share performance. It could 
also lead to the imposition of 
significant 
financial 
penalties 
and the imposition of additional 
reporting obligations.
Your Company’s Group General 
Counsel 
oversees 
and 
is 
accountable for all legal matters. 
We have enterprise anti-bribery 
and corruption, competition law 
and sanctions control frameworks 
and 
programmes 
designed 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable laws and regulations,

and our business activities. Your

Data Ethics 
and Privacy
Risk
Increases in the volume of data 
processed 
and 
advances 
in 
technology have resulted in a 
greater focus on data governance 
and the ethical use of personal 
information, 
over 
and 
above 
compliance with data privacy 
laws. Non-compliance with data 
privacy laws could lead to harm to 
individuals and GSK. It could also 
damage trust between GSK and 
individuals, communities, business 
partners 
and 
government 
authorities.
Your Company has a global 
data privacy policy and a global 
risk 
management 
structure 
comprising of the global Head 
of Digital, Privacy and Cyber 
Security with accountability for 
designing and implementing the 
control framework, while ensuring 
compliance with applicable local 
laws.
Negative
5.
Environment, 
Health, and 
Safety (EHS)
Risk
Failure to manage EHS risks 
could lead to significant harm 
to people, the environment and 
the communities in which we 
operate, fines, inability to meet 
stakeholder 
expectations 
and 
regulatory requirements, litigation 
or regulatory action, and damage 
to the company’s reputation, which 
could materially and adversely 
affect our financial results
Your Company has an effective 
control framework ‘in-place’ and 
‘in-use’ to manage EHS risks and 
impacts. Function leaders ensure 
that the EHS control framework 
is 
implemented 
effectively 
in 
their respective business area. 
Every employee and qualified 
contractor acting on behalf of 
GSK is personally responsible 
for ensuring that they follow 
all 
applicable 
local 
standard 
operating procedures. Our risk-
based, proactive approach is 
articulated in our global EHS 
policy and detailed in our global 
EHS standards, against which we 
audit all our operations to ensure 
compliance.
Negative
6.
Supply 
Continuity
Risk
Disruption to our supply chain 
can lead to product shortages 
and product recalls, regulatory 
intervention, reputational harm 
and lost sales revenue.
Supply 
chain 
organisation 
closely monitors and reviews the 
inventory 
status 
and 
delivery 
of our products. Your Company 
also

7.
Product 
Quality
Risk
Failure to maintain high standards 
of quality in products has an 
adverse impact on patient health, 
launch delays, product shortage 
and recalls. The Company may also 
face severe regulatory, financial 
and reputational consequences 
due to compromised patient and 
safety and low-quality products. 
In order to cater to our patients 
in an effective and safe manner 
and 
enhance 
our 
business 
performance, strict adherence to 
high quality standards is a critical 
priority.
Your Company aligns an extensive 
global network of quality and 
compliance 
professionals 
from 
site-level to senior management 
within each business unit to 
provide 
oversight 
and 
assist 
with 
the 
delivery 
of 
quality 
performance 
and 
operational 
compliance. This management 
oversight is delivered through a 
hierarchy of quality councils and 
a Global Head of Quality. Through 
a 
risk-based 
approach, 
your 
Company assesses and manages 
third party suppliers that provide 
materials used in our finished 
products 
including 
monitoring 
third party labs and how they are 
independently checking goods. 
We expect contract manufacturers 
that make our products to comply 
with GSK standards and regularly 
conduct audits to provide us with 
assurance.
Negative
8.
Patient 
Safety
Risk
The most important consequence 
of ineffective pharmacovigilance 
is the potential for harm to patients. 
Furthermore, 
non-compliance 
with laws and regulations on 
pharmacovigilance could result 
in inspection findings, regulatory 
scrutiny, civil or criminal sanctions 
and temporary/permanent loss of 
product marketing authorisation.
Our Chief Medical Officer is 
accountable for the Patient Safety 
enterprise risk and human safety 
matters, in collaboration with the 
Head of Global Safety. A cross-
enterprise 
safety 
governance 
board oversees implementation 
of 
our 
control 
framework, 
including risk management. Our 
Global 
Safety 
Board 
ensures 
that we address human safety 
proactively throughout a product’s 
lifecycle. Our global policy on 
management of human safety 
information 
requires 
that 
all 
employees 
immediately 
report 
issues relating to the safety of 
our products. Our third-party risk 
management framework supports 
us in identifying and training any 
third parties who may encounter 
human safety information.

Principle 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
Your company’s approach to business is closely integrated with principles of sustainability. Concerted efforts are regularly made to ensure 
that our operations do not have a negative impact on the environment in and around our operations. We have also successfully integrated 
the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) strategy across our value chain. This has enabled us to comply with necessary applicable 
environmental laws and mandates during manufacturing and commercial activities.
We continue to make focused efforts for the achievement of the global targets of a net-zero impact on carbon and a net positive impact 
on nature by 2030. We continue to explore ways in which we can contribute to a greater positive impact on the environment. For instance, 
vaccines are transported regularly and stored in coolers with the Clearing and CFAs and stockists, instead of passive modes such as 
thermocol boxes and coolants. This has enabled a continued reduction in your company's carbon footprint.
