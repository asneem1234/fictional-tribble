Note: Water consumption is estimated based on the document by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), which specifies that a 
water requirement of office employee which is 45 litres per day per head. The document also specifies the breakup of 45 litres per day 
per head into 20 litres per day per head for flushing and 25 litres per day per head for domestic use. This quantity is recorded as water 
withdrawn from third party source i.e. local municipalities.
	
Further the water discharged is considered as aggregate of 80% of the water withdrawn for domestic consumption from source based on 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) database report dated December 24, 2009 and 20 litres per day per head for flushing. Therefore, 
water consumption is reported as “Water Withdrawal – Water Discharge = Water Consumption”.
