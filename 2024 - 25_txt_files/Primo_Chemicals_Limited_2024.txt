3.
Water
Management
Risk
Water is a critical input 
in 
chemical 
production. 
Companies 
with 
water 
intensive operations face a 
greater risk of operational 
disruption due to water 
scarcity, which can also 
increase water procurement
prices 
and 
capital 
expenditures. 
Similarly, 
chemical 
manufacturing 
generates 
process 
wastewater that must be 
treated 
before 
disposal. 
Non 
compliance 
with 
water quality regulations 
may result in regulatory 
compliance and mitigation 
costs.
As a responsible chemical 
manufacturing organization, 
we put a premium on the 
ability to moderate water 
consumption. 
We 
have 
upgraded our wastewater
management by replacing 
normal 
wastewater 
treatment 
with 
new 
age 
technology. 
This 
replacement 
moderated 
water 
and 
power 
consumption, 
helping 
moderate 
environment 
impact and conserve natural 
resources. 
The 
company 
also invested various water 
conservation schemes, this 
water is further used in the 
cooling tower and for other 
processes. As a result of the 
above initiatives, we have 
been able to reduce raw 
water consumption by 5% 
to 6%.

Handling of 
Hazardous Chemicals
Risk
Chemical 
company 
is 
responsible for managing all 
risks related to the storage 
and handling of hazardous 
chemicals. The improper 
handling of chemicals and 
spills can cause harm to the 
environment or humans 
and also imposes a heavy 
fine and reputational risk on 
the company.
The 
Company 
ensures 
that hazardous materials 
are handled in a manner 
that mitigates risks to the 
environment, 
employees, 
and the community. In 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
health & safety at workplace 
company 
conducts 
lot 
of internal and external 
health and safety audits. 
Also, 
the 
environmental 
and 
social 
parameters 
relevant are information is 
provided with the product. 
In case of hazardous waste, 
company ensure the waste 
is managed as per waste 
management 
rules 
and 
regulations.
Negative
5.
Waste Management
Risk
Typically, 
waste 
is 
generated as part of a 
company’s 
operations, 
captive 
power 
plant, 
maintenance of machinery 
and office administrative 
work. 
Improper 
waste 
handling may contribute 
to air pollution, climate 
change, and various direct 
and indirect impacts on 
the ecosystem. It may also 
cause health and safety risks 
to personnel exposed to 
the waste. Non-compliance 
with waste management 
regulations may lead to the 
imposing of heavy fines.
The company has installed 
new STP plant to treat 
domestic 
effluent. 
Also 
the company is in process 
of opting new ways for 
treating effluent & waste 
generation 
which 
will 
reduce the effluent quantity 
& shall be implemented in 
current year.

Product Safety & 
Quality
Risk
Product safety and quality is 
a critical issue for companies 
in the Chemicals industry. 
Chemicals’ potential to have 
negative effects on human 
health or the environment 
throughout 
the 
usage 
phase can affect consumer 
demand for the product and 
regulatory risk, which can 
then damage sales and lead 
to higher operational costs, 
regulatory 
compliance 
costs, and mitigation.
To ensure the safety of the 
product environmental and 
social parameters relevant 
to the product such as 
Safe 
and 
responsible 
usage, Recycling or safe 
disposal are attached on 
product packaging. Also 
we have quality labs at 
the plant which help us 
to maintain the product 
quality. We invested in a 
combination of standard 
operating protocols and 
certifications (ISO 9001 and 
ISO 14001), strengthening 
the 
company’s 
alignment 
with 
Quality 
Management System, Good 
manufacturing

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Our industry follows Zero Liquid Discharge Philosophy. Effluent generated from industry is segregated into High TDS & Low 
TDS effluent. The high TDS effluent is treated in MEE & Low TDS effluent is treated in RO Plant. The permeate separated after 
treatment is taken back into Process system through Cooling Tower make up & the Hazardous waste MEE sludge after drying 
is sent to PPCB approved TSDF facility @ Nimbua, for the safe disposal.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 10 of Essential Indicators above, provide details of 
significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and remediation 
activities.
	
There is a total of 03 no of ecological sensitive areas located in 10km of radius around our industry premises i.e., Protected 
Forest, Wildlife Sanctuary, Wet Land. 
	
Significant aspects that may cause environmental impacts are as follows:
a)	
Fugitive emissions of Chlorine, Emissions of HCl & unabsorbed Cl2, Emissions of PM, SO2, NOx, Deposition of PM & SO2 
on nearby area, Emissions due to venting of gases, Risk during venting of pressurised gas / liquid.
b)	
Possibility of soil contamination due to improper disposal and/or transportation of solid and hazardous waste, Possibility 
of groundwater and soil contamination due to improper disposal/ storage of wastewater.
c)	
Draining material mixed with groundwater and soil can cause damage to flora, fauna found in soil and Soil contamination 
and destruction of surrounding vegetation and associated biodiversity due to deposition of excess chlorine.
Prevention & Remediation Activities:
1.	
Surface water quality will not be affected due to the industry as industry follows Zero Liquid Discharge policy (ZLD). Constant 
R & D is being done to Segregate the Effluent based on Quality i.e. High TDS & Low TDS & reduce the Quantity of Effluent 
generated. Accordingly Proper SOPs are in place for treatment of Waste Water. ZLD is achieved by recycling and reuse of 
treated wastewater from RO & MEE plant. Final hazardous solid waste generated is sent to PPCB approved Recycler and 
Permeate is pumped back to Process System.
2.	
The concentration of the pollutants in the environment is maintained within the allowable limits as recommended by 
MOEF&CC, NAAQI and CPCB guidelines. Through PPCB & CPCB recommended APCD’s, water scrubbers and Electrostatic 
precipitator, vegetation, and human settlements in the vicinity of industry is not likely to be affected. Provision of Caustic 
scrubbers for neutralisation of waste Cl2 gas in the plant has been made. Standardized SOPs for critical operations are 
also followed. Industry has already taken adequate Safety measures to handle such like emergency situations by: Inbuilt 
Control mechanism in the Process operation system, Gas Detectors / Sensors at Critical / Hazardous locations in the plant 
36
PRIMO CHEMICALS LTD.
to Monitor & initiate Safety Control mechanism to control / stop it’s spread beyond the source of leakage and to Mitigate 
the Consequences of leakage, should it spread beyond the plant boundary. All such possible events & Worst case scenario 
leading to large scale spread of Cl2 gas, have been postulated & effect thereof in terms of Dispersion in the Air vis - a vis Dose 
& Distance to which it may effect, has been studied through Dispersion Modelling using ALOHA software. Sensors are also 
being installed at the plant boundary facing towards adjoining villagers to monitor & ensure that no Fugitive Cl2 escapes 
outside the plant.
4.

and their consequences. It also includes Emergency & First Aid Procedures with defined responsibilities of key personnel that 
must be followed during the emergency.
	
For ensuring the continuity in our business, we are preparing a document that outlines all the probable risks (social, financial,
