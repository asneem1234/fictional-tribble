of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
In a world increasingly challenged by emerging risks such as climate change, natural disasters, and cybersecurity threats, the insurance 
sector has a vital role to play. Insurers are expected not only to align with evolving regulatory expectations through robust ESG strategies, 
but also to contribute to addressing broader societal challenges. At ICICI Lombard, we are committed to this responsibility by offering 
innovative risk management solutions and driving sustainable, profitable growth.
This report marks ICICI Lombard’s sixth year of ESG‑related disclosures. The implementation of a comprehensive ESG policy in the previous 
financial year has strengthened our ability to manage our ESG priorities, enabling us to make measurable progress in key areas during 
FY2025. As we enter the next financial year, we continue to uphold our ESG philosophy, building a resilient and future‑ready organisation. 
Our approach is anchored in innovation, strong governance, financial inclusion, responsible investing, and sustainable economic performance.
During the year, we continued to strengthen our position as one of India’s leading private general insurers, enabling us to effectively 
manage risks, build trust with our customers, and contribute to society in a meaningful way.
Driving the Low-Carbon Transition and Fostering Inclusivity through Sustainable Products
At ICICI Lombard, we are reimagining insurance to go beyond traditional protection—creating solutions that are personalised, inclusive, 
and sustainable. Our product portfolio stands as a testament to how we embed ESG principles into our operations.
At the forefront of this effort is our suite of innovative insurance offerings that support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Through 
products designed for electric vehicles, photovoltaic panels, and renewable energy projects, we help customers manage the risks associated 
with green technologies. By enabling this shift, ICICI Lombard plays an active role in accelerating the adoption of low-carbon alternatives.
Our growing market share in EV insurance underscores this commitment. As of March 31, 2025, ICICI Lombard is one of India’s leading 
insurers in the EV segment, with a market share of approximately 23.9% in private electric cars and 32.2% in electric two-wheelers 
(based on the number of vehicles sold).
Beyond environmental sustainability, our product offerings contribute to broader societal resilience, technological advancement, and 
comprehensive risk management. We place a strong emphasis on inclusivity by extending our reach to SMEs, MSMEs, and other underserved 
segments—empowering them with access to resources that drive growth and long-term sustainability.
Our specialised products, such as Cancer Shield for women and Criti Shield—which covers 92 critical illnesses in children—are designed to 
protect vulnerable groups. In alignment with IRDAI’s 'Insurance for All' initiative, we are working to expand insurance access in underserved 
regions such as Bihar and Tripura. Additionally, our telematics-based solutions, Pay As You Use (PAYU) and Pay How You Use (PHYU), 
encourage responsible driving behaviour, reflecting our commitment to social responsibility and environmental sustainability. Through 
Value Added Services (VAS), we have helped over 1,519 corporate clients mitigate operational and environmental risks with holistic risk 
management solutions.
Resultantly, in FY2025, we provided coverage for 93.9 million lives, including 21.0 million lives in the social sector. In FY2025*, we achieved 
an 8.3% growth in Gross Direct Premium Income (GDPI), reaching ₹ 268.33 billion, up from ₹ 247.76 billion in FY2024.
Climate Risk Mitigation 
Climate change is a significant challenge for the global insurance industry, with increasing extreme weather events threatening human 
health, infrastructure, and financial stability. At ICICI Lombard, we are constantly adapting our approach to effectively cover risks from 
events like flooding, cyclones, and wildfires. With our expertise in underwriting and reinsurance risk management, we proactively mitigate 
the financial impact of severe weather and climate-related events.
In FY2025, we reached a milestone by adopting the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, which 
were integrated into our broader risk management strategy. This has strengthened our stress testing and climate risk scenario analysis, 
improving our ability to manage financial and operational risks. During the year, we continued to undertake capacity building to train 
our employees in areas such as climate risk management and climate risk disclosures, which now form an integral part of our business.
Environmental Stewardship 
During FY2025, we continued our efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by enhancing our operational efficiencies 
and meeting our electricity requirements through renewable energy sources. Our key office spaces are now fitted with energy-efficient 
equipment to optimise energy usage. In FY2025, 38.0% of our electricity requirements were met through green energy, up from 27.0% in 
FY2024. Further our decarbonisation efforts, we have set a target to meet 45.0% of our electricity requirements from renewable sources 
by FY2027.
We also adopted the Green Procurement guideline, which promotes sustainable sourcing. Furthermore, we have adopted a comprehensive 
Travel Policy, including measures to reduce emissions associated with business travel.

Customer Relationship Management
At ICICI Lombard, our end-to-end digital capabilities enable us to drive greater customer efficiency and satisfaction. We continue to 
leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to streamline operations and enhance 
our claims processing.
As a result, the average claims settlement time has improved significantly reduced to 5 days for the Motor Own Damage (OD) segment 
in FY2025 (from 6 days in FY2024), and to 3 days for the Health segment (from 5 days in FY2024). Additionally, 100.0% of customer 
grievances were resolved within 15 days.
The trust of our customers place in us is reflected in our improved Net Promoter Score (NPS) claims for Health and Motor 68 in FY2025, 
up from 67 in FY2024.
At ICICI Lombard, we have adopted a comprehensive Data Quality Framework to ensure robust data governance, maintaining high 
standards of accuracy and consistency across all operations. This is complemented by stringent data privacy and cybersecurity measures, 
which safeguard customer information and reinforce our commitment to security and regulatory compliance.
Health and Well-being 
At ICICI Lombard, we remain steadfast in our commitment to enhancing the health and well-being of its customers, with health insurance 
continuing to be a key strategic focus. Through investments made in people, distribution, and the launch of innovative products such 
as Elevate, we have expanded access to health insurance, driving deeper market penetration and catering to diverse healthcare needs.
Our all-in-one health solution, the IL TakeCare App, recorded over 14.9 million downloads by the end of FY2025. This app offers a 
comprehensive suite of services, including 24/7 teleconsultations with qualified doctors, mental well-being support, health tracking tools, 
and a personalised diet and exercise tracker.
As a result of these efforts, our retail health market share has increased to 3.3% in FY2025 from 3.0% in FY2024, reflecting our growing 
presence in the health insurance landscape.
Developing our Human Capital 
At ICICI Lombard, through our vision of ‘One IL One Team’, we have made significant strides in building cohesive teams and leveraging 
synergies to co-create an environment conducive to growth, innovation, and collaboration. While doing so, we have focused on improving 
the diversity and inclusivity of our workforce. As a result, women representation in the workforce has improved to 26.0% in FY2025, from 
24.0% in FY2024. Further, we have set a target of 27.0% women representation by FY2026. Our Human Rights Policy reinforces our 
dedication to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment.
Engaging with the Value Chain Partners
In FY2025, we strengthened our engagement with suppliers in alignment with the Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which outlines our 
expectations related to ethics, sustainability, human rights, and more. As part of this effort, we conducted 12 virtual training sessions on key 
sustainability topics—such as environmental management, ethical business practices, and governance—reaching 129 material suppliers.
We also continued to embed ESG considerations into our investment strategies, ensuring capital allocation supports long-term value 
creation while managing environmental and social risks. Our active engagement with investee companies focused on encouraging the 
adoption of broader sustainability goals aligned with our values. Additionally, we continued to maintain our investment in green bonds.
We also made progress in promoting gender diversity while on-boarding female agents, with new female agents on-boarded increasing 
to 28.6% in FY2025, up from 27.3% in FY2024.
Building Societal Resilience
At ICICI Lombard, we continue to prioritise societal resilience through impactful initiatives that empower communities. In FY2025, our 
CSR programmes supported over 1,000,000 underserved individuals across rural and remote areas, expanding health and wellness 
initiatives and collaborating with local schools.
Through our Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) Scheme advisory services, we are helping farmers adopt sustainable practices, 
including drought-resistant crops and improved irrigation methods. Since 2016, through this scheme, ICICI Lombard has benefitted over 
6.4 million farmers.
Our financial literacy workshops and campaigns, such as 'Bima Hai toh Chinta Nahi,' empower rural populations to secure their financial 
futures. These initiatives are contributing to a more resilient and inclusive society.
Looking Ahead 
The progress we have made this year is a direct reflection of our collective effort towards a sustainable future. I want to express my 
sincere gratitude to all our employees, partners, and stakeholders for their dedication, trust, and collaborative spirit. As insurers, we play 
a crucial role in addressing challenges that confront both society and the economy, and I am confident that together, we will continue to 
drive positive change, innovate for sustainability, and contribute to building a resilient, future-ready society.

The organisation has a Whistle Blower policy in place which provides all employees an opportunity to 
raise any issues/grievances anonymously, where the identity of the whistle-blower is kept confidential. A 
dedicated email ID has been created at an organisational level, to which the employees can write their 
concerns. A dedicated single point contact (SPOC) is assigned to look into all matters independently and 
fairly.
ICICI Lombard has established a well-placed process for addressing employee grievances. An employee 
with a grievance can reach out to his/her immediate or skip manager as the first point of contact. In case 
of no resolution, the respective business HR is the next point of contact, responsible for investigation and 
resolution in a fair & transparent manner. In case no satisfactory results are achieved, the employee can 
reach out to the vertical HRBP, followed by the all-India HR. In case of continuing discontent, the Company 
appoints a Grievance Redressal Committee, consisting of three neutral members to understand the concern, 
investigate the matter, and provide an appropriate resolution. As a next level, the employee can reach out to 
the Appellate authority for appealing against the investigation outcome.
For POSH-related matters, the employees are expected to raise it with the local HR team or to the dedicated 
email ID of the Internal Committee. This can be escalated to the Chairperson of the Internal Committee. The 
final level of escalation is to the Chief - Human Resources. 
ICICI Lombard has also established other platforms to address employees’ concerns and complaints. The 
employees can file their complaints/grievances on Reach MeBOT*, or report directly to HR through their 
representatives. The Company ensures prompt and effective resolution of grievances to create a workplace 
of equitable hiring and eliminated discrimination against employees. In addition, ICICI Lombard provides a 
Fair Appeal process - a unique platform for all employees to raise their grievances related to the fairness of 
the performance management process. This platform provides every employee to appeal for any unfair or 
unjust evaluation of year-end appraisals with relevant facts and evidence. All such grievances are reviewed 
and assessed to provide fair and transparent findings and resolutions to such employees. 
For further appeal on any decision from a grievance redressal body, appellate authorities are available who 
are empowered to deliberate and decide on such matters. 
The Company also has robust mechanisms in place to safeguard the complainant against any adverse 
consequences. In the first place, Company maintains the utmost confidentiality of the Complainant. All related 
parties against whom the Complaint has been reported are sensitised of any retaliatory action against the 
complainant. In case any incident of retaliation is observed or brought to the notice of the management, the 
Company takes appropriate action on the reported matter and ensures that the complainant does not have 
to go through adverse consequences.
