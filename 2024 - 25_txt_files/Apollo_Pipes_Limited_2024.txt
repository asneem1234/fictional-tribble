Permanent workers
The company has established a Grievance Redressal Policy to address any 
conflicts or complaints, emphasizing a corrective action approach. According 
to this policy, upon receiving a Protected Disclosure, the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee forwards it to the Vigilance Officer for necessary action. 
The Vigilance Officer conducts a preliminary investigation to determine the 
authenticity of the disclosure. If the Vigilance Officer finds the disclosure 
genuine, they proceed with a thorough investigation. However, if they find 
it otherwise, they may dispose of the complaint with the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee’s permission, without further investigation. The Vigilance 
Officer conducts the investigation themselves or involves another company 
officer, a designated committee, or an external agency. The investigation is to 
be completed within 60 days of receiving the complaint, with the option to 
seek an extension from the Chairman of the Audit Committee if necessary. The 
findings of the investigation are then submitted to the Audit Committee. The 
Audit Committee may request additional information from the complainant 
if deemed necessary and may involve other company officers, committees, or 
external agencies in the investigation process at its discretion. It’s important to 
note that the investigation is a neutral fact-finding process and does not imply 
any accusation. If the investigation concludes that an improper or unethical act 
has occurred, the Audit Committee will recommend appropriate disciplinary or 
corrective action to the Board of Directors.
