database.
We recognize our responsibility to take concrete action to address climate change, and we continue to assess and manage 
climate-related risks and opportunities for our business and value chain. With a significant operational footprint from our
manufacturing processes, we are focused on limiting GHG emissions at our sites and contributing to sector-wide climate 
actions. In 2022, we continued to make progress toward carbon and energy intensity improvement in our operations, in line 
with our sustainability goals.
To align with best practices, we manage our global manufacturing sites in accordance with the ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management System and ISO 50001 Energy Management System standards. These frameworks provide guidance to 
improve our environmental performance and validate our approach through certifications.
