1
Energy & 
Emissions (GHG 
Emissions, 
Climate 
Change, Energy 
Efficiency)
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk): The Company’s 
manufacturing operations 
are energy-intensive, 
relying on grid electricity, 
which contributes to GHG 
emissions. This exposes 
Everest to risks from 
global warming, which may 
disrupt business operations. 
Furthermore, evolving 
regulatory frameworks, such 
as the introduction of carbon 
taxes, could increase financial 
exposure.
(Opportunity): The rising 
cost of conventional energy 
and decreasing prices of 
renewable energy present an 
opportunity for cost efficiency. 
Additionally, shifting 
consumer preferences 
towards low-carbon products 
offers a market advantage for 
sustainable products.
Everest is exploring a two-
pronged approach aimed at 
improving energy efficiency 
and evaluating the potential 
for renewable energy 
integration.
Energy Efficiency: The 
Company is in the process 
of assessing factory-level 
energy consumption metrics 
(Units/MT), with the goal 
of identifying opportunities 
to enhance efficiency and 
reduce GHG emissions. Initial 
reviews are being carried out 
within the Roofing and ESBS 
business units.
Renewable Energy: 
Preliminary steps have 
been taken to assess the 
viability of rooftop solar 
installations, which currently 
contribute a share (6.4%) to 
total electricity consumption 
at select plants. Everest 
is considering a broader 
evaluation of renewable 
energy options across its 
facilities to potentially lower 
Scope 2 emissions and 
improve long-term resource 
efficiency.

2
Water 
Management
Risk
Everest relies heavily 
on groundwater for its 
manufacturing processes. 
With water scarcity on the 
rise and increasing regulatory 
scrutiny, the Company faces 
potential operational risks.
Most of our plants rely on 
groundwater, and declining 
availability in certain regions 
increases the risk of water 
scarcity, potentially impacting 
production and raising 
operational costs. Two of our 
facilities—Podanur Works in 
Tamil Nadu and Bhagwanpur 
Works in Uttarakhand—are 
situated in semi-critical 
groundwater zones, further 
heightening the risk to long-
term water availability.
To mitigate this risk, Everest 
is prioritizing groundwater 
conservation and rainwater 
harvesting. Over the next 2-3 
years, the Company aims 
to reduce and replenish the 
groundwater it consumes.
All the Company’s plants are 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
facilities, minimizing effluent 
discharge-related regulatory 
risks. Sewage is treated 
through STPs and fully reused 
for greenbelt maintenance.
As a result of the company’s 
efforts towards water 
conservation and water 
recycling there has been 
an improvement in water 
intensity per unit revenue.
Negative
3
Waste 
Management
Risk
Increasing regulatory scrutiny 
around waste management, 
including plastic waste under 
EPR regulations, presents 
a growing compliance 
challenge.
Everest generates both 
hazardous and non-
hazardous waste, making 
regulatory compliance and 
responsible disposal critical 
to business continuity and 
reputation.
Everest is actively evaluating 
alternative materials to 
reduce plastic consumption in 
packaging and is evaluating 
the feasibility of substituting 
virgin plastic with recycled 
plastic.
The Company ensures 
compliance with EPR 
regulations. Hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste is 
disposed of through certified 
vendors in line with legal 
requirements. 
Negative
4
Product 
Stewardship
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk): Regulatory bodies 
are increasingly requiring 
lifecycle assessments (LCAs) 
and certifications, such as 
EPDs, to disclose product 
emissions. Non-compliance 
could lead to regulatory and 
financial risks.
(Opportunity): With growing 
consumer demand for 
transparent, eco-friendly 
products, Everest can 
leverage product stewardship 
to enhance customer trust 
and market differentiation.
Everest has planned for EPD 
certifications for its products 
in the Boards and Panels 
division. The Company plans 
to generate at least 50% of its 
Boards and Panels division 
revenue from EPD-certified 
products by 2027.
80% of Everest’s products 
in the Boards and Panels 
division are already GreenPro 
certified. Moving forward, 
the Company aims to focus 
on low-carbon product 
innovations.

Health & Safety
Risk
The Company’s 
manufacturing operations 
involve interactions with 
machinery and material-
handling equipment, posing 
inherent safety risks to 
employees. Failure to comply 
with safety regulations could 
result in loss of employee 
lives, damage to machinery, 
labour unrest and a halt in 
production.
Everest has implemented 
an EHS risk management 
programme through HIRA 
(Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment) and aims 
to have all eight plants ISO 
45001 certified by 2027.
The Company conducts 
regular safety audits, training, 
and technology upgrades to 
enhance adherence to safety 
standards. Facilities are 
designed not only to meet 
but also to exceed regulatory 
requirements.
Negative
6
Supply Chain 
and Sustainable 
Sourcing
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk): Everest’s value chain 
is resource- and energy-
intensive, relying heavily on 
raw materials like cement 
and steel, which have 
significant environmental 
impacts. Supplier non-
compliance could expose 
Everest to reputational and 
regulatory risks.
(Opportunity): Enhancing 
supply chain sustainability 
improves business resilience, 
reduces environmental 
impact, and strengthens 
social responsibility.
Everest has established 
long-term partnerships with 
certain critical suppliers, 
reflecting a strategic 
approach to building 
supply chain resilience and 
reliability. The Company has 
introduced a Code of Conduct 
for Business Partners, 
outlining sustainability 
expectations.
To reduce exposure to supply 
chain disruptions, Everest is 
increasing domestic sourcing 
and diversifying its supplier 
base for critical imports, such 
as pulp and asbestos fiber.
Positive for 
Opportunity and 
Negative for Risk
7
CSR
Opportunity
Many of Everest’s plants 
are located near local 
communities. Through CSR 
initiatives, the Company 
addresses social challenges, 
fosters goodwill, and 
strengthens its social license 
to operate. Targeted CSR 
programmes in education, 
skills training, and health 
can contribute to community 
development and build 
positive brand equity.
Everest is enhancing its 
CSR focus by evaluating 
environmental indicators 
such as water which will have 
broader societal impacts.
The Company has dedicated 
CSR teams running 
programmes in education, 
vocational skills, youth 
skill-building (e.g., building 
master training), and tobacco 
cessation.

Diversity & 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Promoting diversity and 
inclusion enables Everest 
to access a broader talent 
pool, improve workforce 
productivity, and enhance 
its reputation as a socially 
responsible employer.
Everest actively promotes 
diversity across gender 
and workforce groups. The 
Company has implemented 
an Equal Opportunities 
Policy for differently 
abled individuals and has 
introduced online training 
modules for fostering an 
inclusive culture.
Positive
9
Business Ethics
Risk
Non-compliance with 
regulations or failure to 
prevent unethical practices 
could lead to financial 
losses, legal penalties, and 
reputational damage. Lack 
of reporting mechanisms for 
fraud could further expose 
the Company to financial and 
operational risks.
Everest has adopted Legatrix 
to ensure continuous 
regulatory compliance and 
avoid defaults.
The Company conducts 
regular fraud awareness 
sessions and offers 
whistleblower mechanisms 
to encourage the reporting of 
malpractices.
Regular code of conduct 
training reinforces ethical 
practices across the 
organisation.

Human Capital
- Employee 
Engagement, 
Retention
Opportunity
Opportunity: Fostering a 
culture of strong employee 
engagement and retention 
presents an opportunity 
to build a motivated, high-
performing, and future-ready 
workforce. When employees 
feel valued, empowered, 
and connected to the 
organisation’s purpose, they 
are more likely to contribute 
proactively, collaborate 
effectively, and champion 
innovation.
A stable and engaged 
workforce enhances 
institutional knowledge, 
reduces hiring and training 
costs, and accelerates 
productivity. It also 
strengthens organisational 
culture and loyalty, helping 
position the company as an 
employer of choice. This, in 
turn, supports long-term 
business resilience and 
sustained stakeholder value 
creation.
We continued to strengthen 
employee engagement 
through impactful initiatives 
that promote transparency, 
growth, and recognition.

and open house townhalls 
with workmen across all 
plants have fostered open 
communication and trust. 
Our rewards and recognition 
framework, aligned to our 
core values, celebrates 
individuals who go beyond 
their regular responsibilities, 
inspiring a culture of 
excellence. Career growth 
is enabled through fair, 
merit-based performance 
assessments, annual merit-
linked increments, and 
internal job postings that 
provide equal opportunities 
for advancement. 
Development remains a key 
focus, with targeted product 
and process training, on-the-
job learning, and specially 
designed organisational 
development interventions 
for workmen, along with 
leadership development 
programs for union leaders. 
In addition, succession 
planning through talent 
management reviews and 
focused capability-building 
for critical roles ensures a 
strong, future-ready talent 
pipeline.

Labour Relations Risk
Disruption in manufacturing 
due to labour unrest or 
compliance issues
We have strong processes to 
ensure regulatory and legal 
compliance for both direct 
and indirect manpower. The 
management engages with 
the entire workforce to ensure 
that their issues are
heard and understood. 
Knowledge-sharing sessions 
on labor laws, situation-
based learning, employee life 
cycle documentation, regular 
IR management and contract 
labor management are being

Risk 
Management
Opportunity
A comprehensive risk 
management strategy 
protects an organisation 
from a wide range of 
vulnerabilities, including 
operational disruptions, 
financial losses, and 
reputational damage. Without 
proactive identification and 
mitigation of risks, companies 
are ill-prepared to respond 
to unexpected events such 
as regulatory changes, 
supply chain breakdowns, 
or environmental incidents. 
This not only increases the 
likelihood of non-compliance 
with legal and statutory 
requirements but also 
weakens stakeholder trust.
Everest has established 
a comprehensive risk 
management framework to 
proactively identify potential 
risks and implement effective 
mitigation strategies. The 
ESG risk register plays a key 
role in prioritizing critical 
focus areas. As part of our 
risk mitigation efforts, we 
have finalised a detailed 
Business Continuity and 
Disaster Recovery Plan. 
Additionally, Everest utilises 
a dedicated technology 
platform to ensure 
compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations, while 
also staying informed 
through regular legal updates 
accessed via seminars, 
online resources, and expert 
platforms.

7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements.
	
At Everest, our core values are Respect, Excellence and Integrity (REI) and this also extends to our Vision of improving the 
lives of people by reimagining spaces. We would like to achieve our vision in a long-term and sustainable manner using 
ESG as a foundation for future growth of the organisation.
	
In this sustainability journey, our goal is to grow the business while lowering our environmental footprint, particularly 
in terms of energy consumption, emissions and natural resource use. We recognise the importance of embedding 
sustainability across all dimensions of our operations - not just in emissions and energy, but also in how we manage 
resources, reduce waste and protect natural ecosystems. We are setting plant specific actionable targets that will help 
us build a comprehensive decarbonisation roadmap and replenish water through site-level evaluations. Another area we 
intend to prioritize in the near future is the undertaking of Life Cycle Assessments for key products within the Boards and 
Panels division, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their environmental impacts.
	
On the social front, two pillars stand out as central to our efforts:
	
1. 	
Advancing Health and Safety standards:
	
	
Health and Safety are embedded as a core value throughout our operations. We are actively working toward ISO 
45001 certification across all manufacturing sites. This enables us to systematically identify risks, establish stringent 
safety protocols and promote continuous improvement in workplace safety practices. We aim to cultivate a culture 
where safety is deeply ingrained, incidents are minimised, and the physical and mental well-being of our employees 
is prioritised at every level.
	
2. 	
Fostering a truly inclusive and diverse workplace:
	
	
We recognize the importance of building a more inclusive and diverse workplace and acknowledge that continued 
effort is needed in this area. Women currently hold 29% of board positions and represent 7.62% of the overall 
workforce. Moving forward, we plan to place greater emphasis on supporting individuals with disabilities through 
targeted initiatives and inclusive policies. Our aim is to foster a work environment where all individuals feel respected, 
valued, and able to contribute meaningfully to our broader mission.
150
Annual Report 2024-25
Reimagine. Reinforce. Rise
	
	
These areas also form the foundation of our commitment to employee well-being and equal opportunity for all.
	
	
On the Governance front, we have introduced a Code of Conduct for Business Partners and are in the process of 
building a comprehensive ESG assessment framework for our supply chain.
	
	
These steps are critical to strengthening compliance, improving risk management, and cultivating long-term, 
responsible partnerships that support our sustainability goals.
	
	
ESG is a core component of our objective to build a resilient, future-ready company. Our ESG framework is embedded 
across operations and is aligned with a long-term strategy of sustainable growth.
8. 	
Details of the highest authority responsible for implementation 
and oversight of the Business Responsibility policy (ies).
The Board is responsible for the oversight of the Business 
Responsibility Policies.
The implementation of the policies is the responsibility of

2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
At Everest, we approach sustainable sourcing and procurement through both internal and external lenses. Internally, 
we have established a Sustainable Sourcing and Procurement Policy (https://www.everestind.com/public/storage/
codes-and-policies/August2025/cT1w7QnYROTQxnbBgYRw.pdf), which serves as the foundation for conducting 
business with our partners. Externally, we have developed a Code of Conduct for Business Partners, which acts as a 
guiding framework, ensuring that our partners align with our sustainability principles. As part of our ongoing efforts, 
we are committed to ensuring that our critical suppliers formally acknowledge and adhere to this code of conduct in the 
coming years.
	
	
In line with our long-term sustainability objectives, Everest remains focused on risk mitigation and the production 
of low-carbon products. To strengthen supply chain resilience, we are actively diversifying our supplier base, 
reducing dependency on any single source. Additionally, we are prioritizing domestic sourcing of input materials and 
integrating industrial waste by-products as supplementary cementitious materials. This strategic approach not only 
enhances resource circularity but also significantly reduces the carbon footprint of our products.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
We will categorise EIL’s spending based on sustainability criteria and quantify this in the subsequent reporting years.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Post-consumer product management currently falls outside the direct operational boundaries of Everest, as it involves 
downstream activities that extend beyond the company’s immediate control.
	
a.	
Plastics (Including packaging): Everest is registered as a “brand owner” and “importer” and has adopted EPR practices 
in compliance with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and its amendments to address its responsibilities 
for recycling plastic packaging. Details are provided in Principle 2, Essential Indicator 4.
	
b.	
E-waste: Not applicable. The products of Everest don’t come under the category of e-waste.
	
c.	
Hazardous waste: Not applicable.
	
d.	
Other: Not applicable.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) applies to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? 
If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes. Extended producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the company under The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. 
We are registered as an “Brand owner” & “Importer”. We have adopted EPR practices and approved from CPCB for pre- & 
post-consumer plastic waste management under The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 & its amendments. Waste 
collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to PCB.
	
As per the EPR target for FY 2024-25, we have engaged authorised recyclers to manage 205 MT of plastic waste in 
alignment with regulatory and ESG compliance frameworks.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emissions? If Yes, then provide details.
	
As part of our ESG commitments, Everest is advancing a comprehensive strategy to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions through energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption with a focus on electricity and fuels consumed, and 
responsible product stewardship.
	
Energy Efficiency:
	
We are committed to enhancing energy performance across our operations through structured energy management. 
Multiple energy efficiency projects are underway, with particular emphasis on reducing Units/MT across Business Units—
initially targeting Roofing and ESBS. Additional initiatives include adoption of Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs), rigorous 
preventive maintenance, and other energy-saving interventions to drive sustainable improvements.
	
Renewable Electricity:
	
To reduce reliance on conventional energy sources, we are in the process of evaluating group captive open access models 
to potentially scale renewable electricity use. A broader feasibility study is underway to assess the viability of extending 
these initiatives across locations. Preliminary consumption of renewable electricity from solar in FY25 stood at 11694.03 
GJ, with an estimated CO2 emissions avoidance of 2,362.55tCO2e.
	
(Based on the Grid Electricity EF – Central Electricity Authority, Govt. of India, CO2 baseline database for Indian Power 
Sector, Version 20, December 2024 at the aggregate level (With RE).)
	
Renewable Fuels:
	
We have adopted agricultural biomass as an alternative renewable fuel to generate sustainable energy. In FY25, renewable 
fuel consumption reached 129,970.34 GJ, contributing to a carbon emissions avoidance of approximately 15000 tCO2e as 
compared to Sub-Bituminous coal.
	
(Based on factors and equations from WRI’s GHG Protocol, EPA.Gov, DEFRA and IPCC’s fifth assessment report.)
	
Product Stewardship:
	
As part of our long-term sustainability vision, we will be conducting a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of our Boards and 
Panels business to quantify environmental impacts throughout the product value chain. This evidence-based approach 
will enable us to identify emission hotspots, implement low-carbon materials and technologies, and optimise processes. 
The insights derived will play a critical role in supporting our overall GHG emissions reduction targets.
	
Conclusion:
	
Our integrated approach across operations, energy sources, and product innovation reflects our firm commitment to 
decarbonisation. These collective efforts are pivotal in advancing Everest’s journey toward long-term climate resilience.

Notes: 
	
1)	
All our waste is either recycled or sent to an authorized agency for further re-use/ recovery options. Our current 
process doesn’t include actual reporting of re-use/ recycling by authorized vendors. The waste-handling vendors 
have been selected based on compliance with relevant rules.
	
2)	
The Non-Hazardous scrap numbers have increased in the current year on account of increased steel building 
production resulting in additional MS scrap.
	
3)	
Waste sent for re-use includes wooden scrap which was given by vendor.
	
4)	
Waste sent for other recovery operations include vegetation, paper, cardboard, board waste and cloth used for 
cleaning purpose.
	
5)	
Waste sent to landfill includes Boiler Ash, Process Sludge etc.
	
6)	
The increase in plastic waste volume this year is attributable to the introduction of an additional in-house 
curing process that necessitated the use of plastic sheets, which was unavoidable due to process requirements. 
Consequently, a larger share of pre-consumer plastic waste was generated.
10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
In line with its Environmental Responsibility objectives, Everest has implemented a structured and responsible waste 
management strategy aligned with its key material sustainability topics. The Company adopts a rigorous approach to 
waste segregation—by material type as well as by hazardous and non-hazardous classification—ensuring safe storage, 
handling, and disposal in accordance with regulatory requirements.
	
Hazardous waste is managed with utmost care and is routed exclusively through Pollution Control Board (PCB)-authorised 
vendors for compliant and secure disposal. More than 50% of the hazardous waste is sent for recycling by certified vendors 
and further recovered for utilisation. Asbestos-containing dry waste is either reused in the manufacturing process as 
Hard Ground Waste or re-circulated as green asbestos waste, supported by a robust reuse mechanism that mitigates 
environmental and health risks. Used lubricant oil is also repurposed to reduce the ecological footprint.

(DWR), which is reintroduced into the manufacturing cycle wherever feasible—thereby promoting material circularity.
	
For non-hazardous waste streams, including metal scraps, wooden pallets, and MS drums—which constitute more than 
90% of the non-hazardous waste—Everest enforces strict segregation and compliance with recycling protocols. These 
materials are sold to authorised recyclers for further processing, ensuring environmentally sound reuse or repurposing.

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Our customer engagement and complaint resolution processes are uniquely designed for each business unit.
	
In the case of our Fibre Cement Business, we have a structured approach to address customer grievances, with documented 
procedures for each complaint type. For non-transactional issues, customers can directly contact the Business Unit Head 
via email or phone, with all communications recorded. For transactional or product related issues, the primary resolution 
path involves a structured process governed by our sales force and regional leaders. Along with the sales team, the 
customer service teams conduct on-site inspections to determine the validity of product-related complaints, leading to 
compensation, education, or claim rejection based on merit.
	
Alternate channels of complaints include a helpline number and email address provided on our website. Regular 
meetings with contractors and industry influencers serve as additional feedback channels. A dedicated WhatsApp 
helpline allows for immediate complaint registration and tracking, with resolutions delivered swiftly according to set 
timelines.
	
For Pre-Engineered Steel Buildings with B2B customers, a distinct process addresses grievances, with sales representatives 
and site engineers serving as the first point of contact. Issues are collaboratively examined with stakeholders, followed 
by a formal action plan communicated by the sales team. A dedicated committee handles escalated issues, while Non-
Conformance Reports are systematically tracked. Contractors engage via calls or emails, with resolutions often reached 
through face-to-face discussions. Upon project completion, a comprehensive feedback form evaluates all stages, from 
design to handover.
	
This streamlined structure ensures that all customer feedback is addressed efficiently and effectively, maintaining high 
standards of service and support.
2.	
Turnover of products and/ services as a percentage of turnover from all products/services that carry information about:
	
Our three business units predominantly deal in products that are not packaged, which inherently limits the extent to which 
environmental, social, safety, and end-of-life information can be communicated directly on the products themselves.
	
The Roofing division, which accounts for 47% of our turnover, comprises entirely unpackaged products. Accordingly, these 
products display only the information mandated by regulatory authorities—such as the ISI mark, date of manufacture, 
company branding, and batch number.
	
The Boards and Panels division, contributing 17% to our revenue, includes a mix of packaged and unpackaged products. 
For unpackaged products, we go beyond regulatory compliance by incorporating green labels and symbolic mnemonics 
to indicate key environmental features. Packaged products within this segment are equipped with material handling 
instructions printed on the packaging, while detailed handling guidelines are consistently shared along with each invoice 
across both the Roofing and Boards and Panels businesses. For selected products, we provide comprehensive technical 
documentation and installation manuals in both print and digital formats, including video-based guidance.
	
To further embed sustainability and safety across the product life cycle, we conduct targeted training programmes for our 
network of installers, including roofers and contractors—focusing on safe handling practices, efficiency enhancement, 
and methods to extend product durability.
	
The Pre-Engineered Buildings (PEB) division, which represents 36% of our turnover, operates on a supply-and-service 
model. Here, product-specific communication is facilitated through our site engineers and sales teams, who advise on 
safety protocols during both erection and operational phases, in alignment with project specifications. Additionally, we
