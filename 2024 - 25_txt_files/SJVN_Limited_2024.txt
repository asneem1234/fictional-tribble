7 Governance, leadership and oversight 
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility 
report, growth strategy. In FY highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
At SJVN, sustainability continues to be a foundational pillar of our 
2024-25, we strengthened our ESG practices in alignment with 
national development priorities and global sustainability goals. 
During the year, we addressed a number of ESG challenges, 
including managing the environmental impact of large 
infrastructure projects, ensuring occupational health and safety 
across diverse terrains, and enhancing community development in 
remote and underprivileged regions. 
Key achievements include the expansion of our renewable energy 
portfolio, progress in energy efficiency, and improved resource 
management at project sites. We enhanced our waste and water 
management systems, including the deployment of composting and 
recycling solutions. Our Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System (ISO 45001:2018) was reinforced through regular training, 
audits, and risk assessments. Our CSR and community outreach 
programmes made measurable impacts in areas such as rural 
healthcare, skill development, sanitation, education, and women and 
child welfare—particularly in project-affected and vulnerable regions. 
We also advanced our internal governance by reinforcing policies 
related to human rights, inclusivity, and compliance with statutory 
and environmental regulations. 
Looking ahead, we are committed to scaling up our ESG efforts with 
a clear roadmap focused on expanding clean energy capacity and 
strengthening social value creation.

if necessary. If unresolved, the employee may escalate the grievance in writing using the prescribed format (Annexure- 
1) within 15 days. 
2. Stage Il: Upon receipt, the Head of Department or Head of HR may attempt resolution or refer the matter to the 
Grievance Settlement Committee. The Committee reviews the case and provides a response within 30 days. Where 
necessary, 
it may recommend 
a final decision 
by the Director (Personnel), 
who shall also respond within 30 days. 
3. Stage Ill: In exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of the concerned Director, the employee may appeal to the 
Chairman & Managing Director 
for final redressal.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
At SJVN, stakeholder inclusiveness is a key priority. Designated departmental representatives engage with stakeholders to gather feedback and insights, 
which are escalated to departmental heads. The Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC) facilitates communication of both positive and negative 
feedback 
to the Board, ensuring appropriate actions are taken. 
As part of its commitment to sustainability, 
SJVN conducted a comprehensive stakeholder engagement exercise through a structured materiality 
assessment. The objective was to identify, evaluate, and prioritize key environmental, social, governance, and economic (ESG) issues that hold the greatest 
relevance to both the organization and its stakeholders. Each material topic was carefully assessed against associated risks and corresponding mitigation 
strategies were developed to address them proactively. The findings of the assessment were presented to senior leadership and the Board of Directors to 
incorporate their insights and ensure that the company’s sustainable growth strategy remains closely aligned with stakeholder expectations and 
emerging ESG priorities. 
2 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). 
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the 
entity. 
Corporate Governance lies at the core of SJVN’s operations, with stakeholder consultation playing a pivotal role in shaping decisions, policies, and 
strategic activities. Feedback received from stakeholders is carefully considered and integrated into the Company's action plans, initiatives, and, where 
appropriate, into policy formulation and revision. 
Stakeholder feedback and suggestions are thoughtfully reviewed and integrated wherever appropriate, playing a vital role in shaping the company’s 
decision-making process. Engagement is carried out through multiple channels and is approached as an ongoing, dynamic process to maintain relevance 
and responsiveness to stakeholder expectations. 
The company’s material issues were identified by assessing their importance to both internal and external stakeholders, along with their potential 
influence on business continuity and performance. These insights serve as foundational inputs in formulating the company’s Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) objectives and performance targets. 
3 
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups. 
SJVN is committed to addressing stakeholder concerns and upholding high standards of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainability. Guided 
by the principles of lawful conduct, social equity, and environmental stewardship, the Company aims to improve quality of life and foster sustainable 
development in the communities it serves. Operating in remote and underdeveloped regions, SJVN focuses on delivering long-term, inclusive impact 
through a range of socially relevant initiatives. As a responsible corporate citizen, the Company also embraces green technologies and sustainable 
practices across its operations. For more details, please refer to Principle 8 - Leadership Indicator 6

SJVN is committed to minimizing waste generation at the source by adopting efficient technologies and sustainable practices. The company 
promotes the segregation of waste into recyclable, organic, and hazardous categories to ensure proper disposal and maximize recycling efforts. A 
buy-back policy is in place for e-waste and battery waste, ensuring safe disposal and appropriate recycling through authorized vendors once the 
products reach their end of life. 
To manage hazardous, chemical, and toxic waste responsibly, SJVN has established clear procedures and guidelines covering their storage, 
transportation, treatment, and disposal in compliance with regulatory requirements and environmental standards. The company has also invested 
in bio-composters and plastic waste bailing machines to treat solid waste generated in project-affected villages and colonies. Additionally, a 
recycling plant installed at the Corporate Headquarters 
converts kitchen waste, such as fruit and vegetable scraps, into compost for soil 
enrichment
