Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Inefficient waste 
management 
can lead to 
regulatory risks 
and reputational 
damage, 
while efficient 
practices support 
environmental 
sustainability.
The Company’s waste mainly pertains to 
paper waste/ required disposal of electronic 
equipment and systems (such as computers 
and servers).  The waste generated by paper 
usage is minimal, and the company ensures 
that all correspondence is conducted digitally. 
The company has adopted the measures to 
store the data in electronic form, thereby 
minimising the practice of maintaining and 
storing documents in physical hard copies. 
For the disposal of e-waste generated over 
the period, the company is evaluating waste 
service providers who are authorised to 
conduct waste management services in 
accordance with local waste management 
legislation. 
Negative: Poor 
waste handling may 
result in regulatory 
penalties and 
increased disposal 
costs.
Positive: Efficient 
waste management 
reduces operational 
costs and enhances 
brand reputation 
through compliance 
with sustainability 
standards.

ensure continuous security. Business 
application URLs are only accessible 
via allowed static IP addresses and VPN 
functionality.

(2FA) for blseservices.com email, backend 
security updates, and G Suite for email

Implementation of state-of-the-art firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, and strict access 
controls to safeguard sensitive data.
Employee Education: Ongoing training 
programs for employees on cybersecurity best 
practices and compliance with applicable data 
protection regulations.
Incident Response Strategy: Development 
of a comprehensive incident response plan to 
rapidly address and mitigate potential security 
incidents.

Protecting 
customer privacy 
and data requires 
investment. 
Positive: It helps 
prevent data 
breaches, fosters 
customer trust, 
and enhances 
the company’s 
reputation, 
ultimately 
supporting 
sustained business 
growth.

offering a platform for growth within the 
organization and beyond.
	
With a focus on skill development, 
knowledge enhancement, certification, 
and merit-based performance in our 
learning and development program, 
“Skills of the Future,” these initiatives 
are nurturing a performance-driven 
culture. They also provide employees 
with valuable opportunities to advance 
their careers and achieve professional 
growth.

long-term financial 
performance.

Financial 
Performance
 Opportunity
Financial 
performance is 
impacted by how 
well ESG risks are 
managed. Poor 
performance can 
deter investors; 
strong Financial 
performance 
attracts capital, 
improves stability 
and provides 
resources for 
various ESG 
initiatives.
Strategic Acquisitions: The Company’s 
strategic acquisition of Aadifidelis brought 
a complementary service portfolio, enabling 
BLS E-Services to expand into new market 
segments and cross-sell services.
The integration of Aadifidelis’ service lines 
resulted in an increase in the overall topline 
revenue of the Company.
With Aadifidelis’ established presence and 
client base, BLS E-Services strengthened its 
footprint across key geographies and sectors.
Business Diversification: By entering new 
markets and developing new products, we 
reduce our reliance on any single source of 
revenue or contractual partner.
It includes expanding our service offerings to 
tap into new revenue streams and investing 
in marketing initiatives to increase customer 
engagement and retention. We are also 
enhancing our risk management processes 
to better anticipate and adapt to changes 
in market conditions that could affect our 
revenue generation. 
Cost Optimisation: We are continuously 
reviewing and optimizing our cost structure 
to maintain financial stability regardless of 
external financial pressures.
Positive: 
Strong financial 
performance 
drives business 
growth, attracts 
investment, and 
provides resources 
to manage risks 
and opportunities 
effectively.
7.
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Strong corporate 
governance fosters 
transparency, 
accountability, 
and ethical 
conduct within the 
organisation.
The company had implemented the ‘Lawrbit’ 
compliance tool. Each department is 
responsible for adhering to the Compliances 
applicable on respective department. 
Reminder emails are sent to each user 
one week before the compliance deadline. 
Additionally, the technology notifies the 
appropriate owner by email of any new 
amendments or changes to the law. 
Furthermore, meetings are held with 
independent consultants as needed to discuss 
updates and other compliance matters.
Positive: Good 
corporate 
governance 
enhances decision-
making, mitigates 
risks, fosters 
investor confidence, 
and promotes 
sustainable growth.
