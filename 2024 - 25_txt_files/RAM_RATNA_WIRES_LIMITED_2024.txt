Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:
Sr.
No.
Material issue

Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the risk / 
opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Energy 
Management
Risk/
Opportunity
Energy plays a vital role in the 
core manufacturing operations 
of the Company, particularly in 
high-consumption 
processes 
such as drawing, annealing, and 
enamelling. Given the scale and 
intensity of energy use, it presents 
both a critical risk and a strategic 
opportunity.
On the risk front, fluctuations in 
energy prices, potential supply 
disruptions, 
and 
increasing 
regulatory 
requirements 
on 
emissions and energy efficiency 
can 
significantly 
impact 
production continuity and cost 
structures. At the same time, 
energy presents an opportunity 
to drive operational excellence, 
cost savings, and environmental 
stewardship through the adoption 
of energy-efficient technologies, 
process 
optimization, 
and 
integration of renewable energy 
sources.
The Company has undertaken a 
structured 
approach 
to 
reduce 
energy-related risks by integrating 
energy-efficient technologies and 
upgrading its production systems 
to lower energy intensity across 
operations. The company is also 
progressing towards cleaner energy 
alternatives through the installation 
of rooftop solar systems and the 
exploration of long-term renewable 
energy procurement strategies.
Negative: Higher initial 
capital expenditure.
Positive: 
Long-term 
cost savings on energy 
consumption.
2
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste management is a risk owing 
to the generation of metal scrap, 
insulation waste, and hazardous 
by-products in the manufacturing 
units. 
Improper 
handling 
and 
disposal of these wastes can 
lead to environmental pollution, 
increased operational costs and 
regulatory non-compliance such as 
the Hazardous and Other Wastes 
(Management and Transboundary 
Movement) Rules, 2016, and the 
Solid Waste Management Rules, 
2016.
The Company follows a structured 
Reuse-Recycle-Disposal 
Waste 
Management Policy, ensuring safe 
segregation, recycling, and disposal 
of all waste in compliance with 
environmental regulations.
Hazardous waste, such as chemical 
sludge 
from 
wastewater 
is 
treated using ETP and STP plants. 
Contaminated cotton rags and used 
oil are handed over to government 
approved disposers.
Employee training programs further 
support waste minimization and 
promote 
sustainable 
practices 
across operations.
Negative: 
Waste 
mismanagement 
can 
lead 
to 
significant 
financial risks through 
regulatory 
penalties, 
increased disposal costs, 
and potential liabilities 
from 
environmental 
damage.
3
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Operational health and safety is a 
critical risk in our manufacturing 
units due to the nature of 
manufacturing 
processes 
involving 
equipment 
operating 
on a high temperature, and heavy 
machinery. These conditions pose 
potential hazards to worker safety 
if not properly managed.
The Company actively promotes a 
culture of safety by strengthening 
workplace 
safety 
policies, 
conducting 
regular 
training 
programs, and adopting globally 
recognized 
best 
practices 
to 
safeguard employee well-being.
Our facilities are ISO 45001 certified, 
underscoring our adherence to 
international occupational health 
and safety standards. We also 
implement 
proactive 
measures 
such as Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) to identify, 
evaluate, and mitigate potential 
risks within our operations.
Negative: 
Poor 
occupational health and 
safety (OHS) practices 
can result in financial 
risks due to workplace 
accidents, legal liabilities, 
compensation 
claims, 
and potential disruptions 
to operations.

Statement by the director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting 
ESG 
related 
challenges, 
targets and achievements.
At Ram Ratna Wires Ltd, we recognize the growing importance of 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in shaping the future 
of our business and the industry at large. As we navigate an evolving 
regulatory landscape and increasing stakeholder expectations, we remain 
committed to embedding sustainability into our core operations. One of the 
key challenges we face is the transition towards a low-carbon economy, 
requiring us to optimize energy efficiency, enhance resource conservation, 
and explore sustainable sourcing. Additionally, ensuring responsible supply 
chain practices and maintaining high standards of employee health, safety, 
and well-being remain critical priorities.
Despite these challenges, we have made significant strides in our ESG 
journey. Our recent initiatives include investments in renewable energy, 
the adoption of eco-friendly manufacturing practices, and a stronger focus 
on circular economy principles. Socially, we continue to support employee 
welfare programs, skill development initiatives, and community engagement 
activities. On the governance front, we have strengthened our policies on 
ethical business conduct, transparency, and risk management to ensure 
accountability at all levels. Looking ahead, we have set ambitious targets 
to further enhance our ESG commitments. These include measurable 
reductions in our carbon footprint, increased utilization of sustainable 
materials, enhanced workplace diversity, and stronger supplier due diligence 
mechanisms. Through these efforts, we aim to align our growth strategy with 
global sustainability goals and create long-term value for our stakeholders.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
The Company has undertaken a comprehensive range of initiatives to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 
enhancing energy efficiency, optimizing energy usage, and integrating renewable energy solutions into its operations. 
These efforts align with the Company’s commitment to sustainable manufacturing and reducing its environmental 
footprint.
	
Key initiatives undertaken include:
1.	
Installation of Renewable Energy Plants:
	
In line with its renewable energy transition goals, the Company has installed 1350 kW solar power plants and 2.1 
MW of wind energy significantly reducing dependency on grid-based electricity and contributing to lower Scope 2 
emissions. This initiative directly offsets a substantial portion of the facility’s electricity consumption with clean, 
renewable energy.
2.	
Energy Monitoring through Automation:
	
The Company has implemented automated daily energy monitoring via ERP systems, which capture real-time power 
consumption data from machine panels. This allows for continuous tracking and immediate corrective action when 
deviations occur. This initiative led to a notable 14% reduction in electricity consumption per kilogram of production, 
reflecting improved energy efficiency and reduced emissions.
3.	
Heat Recovery Systems:
	
The Company captures waste heat from electrical furnaces using heat exchangers. This recovered heat is utilized for 
generating steam required in the copper annealing process, thus optimizing thermal efficiency and reducing reliance 
on additional energy sources
4.	
Wind-Powered Ventilation Systems:
	
By installing MS roof ventilator mechanical fans, the Company uses natural wind for ventilation, eliminating the need 
for electrically operated air circulation systems and lowering overall energy demand.
5.	
Natural Daylight Utilization:
	
Acrylic rooftop sheets have been installed to enhance the penetration of natural sunlight into workspaces, significantly 
reducing the need for artificial lighting during daytime operations.
6.	
Smart Lighting Solutions:
	
The Company has adopted energy-efficient LED lighting with motion sensors, ensuring lights are used only
