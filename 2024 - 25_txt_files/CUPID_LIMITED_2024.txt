We have a systematic selection process for all levels 
of employees, and we endeavour to recruit and 
retain the best candidates. Succession Planning 
has helped us to future proof our organization. 
We conduct periodic reviews of our employees’ 
job performance and determine salaries and 
ESOPs based upon those reviews and general 
market conditions. We endeavour to maintain a 
good working relationship with our employees 
with policies that meet the needs of employees as 
well as organizations and their own departmental 
goals. Our employees are not subject to any sexual 
harassment. We believe that our HIRA & Safety and 
training programs have contributed to developing a 
safe work environment and a motivated workforce 
that is focused on fostering healthy relations and 
striving for growth and profitability. As on date, the 
company has 216 employees.

1
Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Risk
Essential 
to 
the 
Company’s 
core 
focus on medical and 
sexual health, where 
any 
compromise 
can affect consumer 
safety, 
brand 
credibility, 
and 
regulatory standing.
Implementation 
of 
stringent 
quality 
control 
systems, 
ISO 
certifications, 
regular

product recalls, 
regulatory 
penalties, and 
reputational loss.
2
Waste 
Management 
(Plastic/Bio)
Risk
Use of plastic 
packaging and 
generation of 
biomedical waste 
pose environmental 
and legal risks.
Waste segregation at 
source, EPR registration,

authorized recycling and 
disposal vendors.
Negative if not 
addressed — 
potential legal 
actions, ESG 
rating impact, and 
reputational loss.
3
Sustainable 
Packaging
Opportunity
Increasing consumer 
and regulatory 
preference for 
eco-friendly 
packaging enhances 
brand appeal and 
marketability.
Development of 
recyclable and 
biodegradable packaging 
materials and phased 
reduction in plastic 
usage.
Positive — improves 
brand equity, 
meets export 
requirements, 
and aligns with 
sustainability 
trends.

(listed entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
I am pleased to present our Company’s Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR). This 
report marks a significant milestone as we begin 
our journey in integrating Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles across our operations—
particularly within our core product segments of 
condoms, in-vitro diagnostics (IVD), and lubricants.
As a business operating in both B2B and B2C segments, 
we recognize the growing importance of aligning our 
strategies with evolving environmental and societal 
expectations. We have set clear and ambitious targets 
aimed at reducing our environmental footprint, fostering 
workplace diversity and safety, and strengthening 
governance practices with greater transparency and 
accountability.
While this report represents our initial steps in the ESG 
domain, we are fully committed to continuous progress 
and meaningful engagement with our stakeholders. 
Through responsible business practices, we aim to drive 
sustainable growth and long-term value creation.

Yes, the Company has implemented an Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System (OHSMS) as part of its commitment to employee 
well-being. The system is guided by our Health & Safety Policy, which 
encompasses key elements such as risk and hazard assessments, 
emergency response planning, safety awareness and training, incident 
reporting and analysis, and strict adherence to applicable legal and 
regulatory standards. This framework is designed to foster a safe, 
secure, and healthy workplace across all areas of our operations.
b.

used to identify work-related 
hazards and assess risks on 
a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
The Company utilizes a structured Permit to Work (PTW) System to 
effectively identify and evaluate work-related hazards during both 
routine and non-routine operations. Through this approach, relevant 
department heads and safety personnel are responsible for completing 
authorization forms that clearly define the nature of the tasks to be 
carried out and the potential risks involved. This proactive system helps 
in recognizing and assessing hazards before any work activity starts, 
supporting risk reduction and reinforcing a culture of workplace safety.

to report work-related hazards and remove themselves from unsafe 
situations. Employees can use Suggestion Boxes placed at various 
locations within the premises to confidentially report safety concerns, 
incidents, or improvement suggestions. This ensures easy and 
anonymous access for all workers. 
In addition, the Whistle Blower Policy provides a formal and secure 
channel for reporting unsafe practices, hazardous conditions, or 
violations of safety norms without fear of retaliation. These processes 
promote a proactive safety culture and empower employees to prioritize 
their well-being.
d.
Do the employees/ worker 
of the entity have access to 
non-occupational 
medical 
and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
No, the Company does not offer dedicated non-occupational medical or 
healthcare services. However, an on-site Occupational Health Centre is 
available to address the health requirements of employees related to 
workplace conditions. This facility provides timely medical assistance for 
job-related health concerns and emergencies, ensuring employee well-
being within the scope of occupational safety.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism 
for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide 
details of its coverage and implementation.
The civil and mild steel structural work for the Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) system is currently underway, and the purchase 
order for the associated machinery has been placed. The project 
is expected to be completed within the next three months. This 
initiative underscores the Company’s strong commitment to 
sustainable water management.
As part of this effort, an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) is being 
implemented to enable the treatment and reuse of wastewater 
generated from operations. The treatment process begins with 
the collection of effluent in a dedicated storage tank, which is then 
pumped into the Chemical Coagulation and Flocculation Tank. In 
this stage, coagulants and flocculants are added to facilitate the 
aggregation and removal of fine suspended particles.
The pre-treated water flows into a Primary Settling Tank for 
initial sedimentation, followed by processing in a Primary 
Tube Settler. From there, the effluent moves to the Aeration 
Tank, where fine air bubbles enhance biological treatment by 
improving oxygen transfer.
Post-aeration, the water passes through Sand Media and 
Activated Carbon Filters to remove any residual suspended 
solids, colour and odour. The treated water is then stored in a 
treated water tank and reused within the facility for activities 
such as gardening and toilet flushing.
Sludge generated during treatment is handled through a filter 
press using effluent settling powder. Additionally, dissolved 
oxygen (DO) levels in the Aeration Tank are continuously 
monitored to ensure a minimum DO concentration of 2.0 mg/L is 
maintained, supporting optimal biological activity.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
Conversion from Furnace 
Oil to LDO/LSHS in Boilers
We have a Low Sulphur Heavy Stock 
(LSHS) and Light Diesel Oil (LDO) 
based boilers. These alternative 
fuels 
significantly 
lowers 
sulfur 
content, enabling a cleaner and more 
efficient combustion process.
There is a substantial reduction in 
sulfur dioxide emissions—bringing 
them down to below detectable 
levels—thereby 
minimizing 
the 
environmental 
footprint 
of 
the 
Company’s operations.

followed by detailed reports that analyze scenarios, response 
effectiveness, and areas for improvement. The manufacturing 
facility operates under a comprehensive Emergency Preparedness 
Plan designed to manage and mitigate crises, minimize panic, and 
reduce potential loss of life and property. Key elements of the 
plan include headcounts, rescue operations, medical assistance, 
record preservation, and preventive measures aimed at restoring 
normalcy efficiently and effectively.
