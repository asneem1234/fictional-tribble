Specific commitments, goals and 
targets set by the entity with defined 
timelines, if any.
EPACK Durable is currently in its second year of BRSR reporting, having 
initiated its ESG journey with its inaugural disclosure in the previous 
financial year. While the Company is still in the process of formalizing 
long-term ESG goals with defined timelines, it remains committed to 
strengthening its sustainability framework. Key focus areas include 
enhancing ESG data maturity, integrating sustainability into core business 
operations, and progressively setting measurable environmental and 
social targets over the next 1–2 years.
EPACK Durable has taken critical steps toward ESG management—
especially through adopting BRSR, ISO systems, solar deployment, 
and workforce safeguards. Still, it has yet to establish quantitative, 
timeline-based ESG targets, particularly around emissions or resource 
efficiency. At present, its ESG strategy is more process- and policy-oriented, 
rather than goal-driven.
6
Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals and 
targets along-with reasons in case 
the same are not met.
During FY 2024–25, EPACK Durable Limited advanced its journey toward 
sustainable growth and responsible business practices in line with SEBI’s 
BRSR framework. The company undertook key ESG initiatives including:
Environmental: Increased renewable energy usage, adopted zero-landfill 
practices in select units, and launched energy-efficient product lines.
Social: Enhanced employee welfare, workplace safety, and diversity while 
supporting communities through targeted CSR programs.
Governance: 
Strengthened 
board 
oversight, 
compliance, 
and 
transparency through improved disclosures and internal ESG audits.
EPACK Durable will embark on its journey to set specific targets and 
report on its  progress in the upcoming financial years.

Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement 
of this disclosure)
As EPACK Durable presents its second Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report, the Company reaffirms its commitment to 
embedding ESG principles across its operations. Over the past year, it has 
made measurable progress in strengthening sustainability governance, 
enhancing resource efficiency, and deepening community engagement. 
While challenges such as evolving regulations, climate resilience, and 
inclusive growth persist, the Company continues to respond with agility 
and accountability. EPACK Durable is in the process of formalizing ESG 
targets and performance indicators, which will guide its journey towards 
long-term sustainable value creation for all stakeholders.
During FY 2024–25, EPACK Durable Limited reaffirmed its commitment to 
responsible and sustainable growth, guided by the SEBI-mandated BRSR 
framework. As we continue our ESG journey, we have made measurable 
progress across key focus areas despite navigating challenges such as 
evolving regulatory expectations, supply chain disruptions, and the 
need for rapid decarbonisation. On the environmental front, we 
enhanced our energy mix by increasing the share of renewable energy
and implemented improved waste management practices to minimize 
our ecological footprint. Socially, we advanced employee well-being 
and inclusivity through focused training and development programs, 
while also strengthening community outreach. On the governance 
side, we reinforced compliance and transparency across our operations. 
Looking ahead, we remain focused on setting ambitious ESG targets, 
including achieving higher energy efficiency, increasing gender diversity, 
and enhancing supplier sustainability practices, as part of our long-term 
strategy for building a resilient and responsible organization.

and Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs), in compliance with the 
E-Waste Management Rules and RoHS guidelines. Hazardous waste is managed 
in accordance with applicable environmental regulations and disposed of 
through licensed vendors with full traceability.
Other non-hazardous materials such as metal scraps, thermocol, and 
cardboard are recycled or reused wherever feasible. Across all waste streams, 
the Company emphasizes minimizing environmental impact and ensuring 
regulatory compliance in waste management practices.
