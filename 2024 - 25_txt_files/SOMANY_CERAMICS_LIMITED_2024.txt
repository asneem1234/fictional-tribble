1
Water 
Conservation
R/O
Water 
conservation 
and 
management 
can 
be 
viewed 
as both a challenge and an 
opportunity, due to the finite nature 
of water resources and their critical 
influence on ceramic industry as 
well as environmental and social 
systems.
Risks 
include 
water 
scarcity, 
tighter 
regulatory 
requirements, 
and 
reputational 
harm 
from 
unsustainable practices.
However, 
adopting 
responsible 
water 
management—such 
as 
through 
recycling, 
reuse, 
and 
conservation initiatives—can lead to 
operational cost savings, improved 
sustainability 
performance, 
and 
stronger stakeholder relationships. 
Proactive 
water 
stewardship 
enables the Company to reduce risk 
exposure, boost resource efficiency, 
and support long-term business 
resilience and sustainable growth 
amid water-related challenges.
The Company has implemented a wide range of 
water conservation initiatives, including process 
optimizations 
and 
comprehensive 
wastewater 
recycling systems.
Both the Kadi and Kassar facilities are designed 
as Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) units, where 100% 
waste water generated is treated and reused 
within operations, ensuring no discharge into the 
environment. To support this, we have installed five 
effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and two sewage 
treatment plants (STPs) enabling the complete 
reuse of processed water in our manufacturing 
processes. Additionally, we have secured an Annual 
Canal Water Agreement for the raw water supply 
and conduct regular ETP and STP water quality 
testing through NABL-accredited laboratories.
Our commitment to responsible water use is further 
validated by a recent government-authorized water 
audit, where our ZLD system was praised for its 
effectiveness. In line with this, we have initiated the 
renovation of toilet facilities, including redesigning 
pipelines to reduce domestic water use, and have 
installed awareness posters throughout the facility 
to promote mindful water consumption.
Positive Implication:
Implementing comprehensive 
water management 
practices—such as recycling, 
efficient treatment systems, 
and zero liquid discharge 
units—not only reduces 
environmental impact and 
builds operational resilience 
but also lowers long-term 
water procurement and 
treatment costs, delivering 
significant savings and 
mitigating future financial 
risks.
Negative Implication:
Poor water management 
for our company can result 
in supply chain disruptions, 
higher operational, 
compliance costs and 
negatively affecting the 
Company’s reputation, all of 
which can adversely affect 
overall financial performance.

Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
R
Rising 
energy 
prices, 
evolving 
requirements for energy reporting 
and disclosures, and increasingly 
stringent environmental regulations 
on emissions highlight the urgency 
of proactively managing energy 
and emissions. These trends point 
to the long-term consequences of 
inefficient resource use, especially 
in 
energy-intensive 
production 
environments.
Recognizing this, Somany views 
energy and emission management 
as a critical risk area requiring 
strategic planning and continuous 
improvement to stay ahead of 
future environmental, regulatory 
and financial impacts.
Energy is a critical enabler of economic development 
and 
societal 
well-being, 
with 
its 
consistent 
availability and efficient usage becoming central to 
both business continuity and global sustainability. 
In response, the Company has embraced a 
comprehensive approach to energy management by 
implementing energy-efficient systems, expanding 
the use of renewable sources, and progressively 
shifting towards greener biofuels to reduce 
dependency on conventional energy sources.
In line with its commitment to sustainability, the 
Company has conducted comprehensive energy 
and greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting to better 
understand its environmental footprint and identify 
areas for improvement. We also have the presence 
of solar power plants with a combined capacity of 
3.50 MWp at both Kadi and Kassar manufacturing 
facilities, significantly contributing to the shift 
towards renewable energy.
We 
have 
implemented 
a 
range 
of 
energy 
efficiency measures, including the adoption of 
bi-fuel technology, solar power procurement, 
and equipment upgrades. These efforts aim to 
reduce dependence on conventional fuels and 
optimize operational energy use. Adjustments in 
systems such as, cooling towers and motor drives 
further contribute to minimizing energy waste and 
enhancing performance.
By maintaining our energy management initiatives 
and ensuring development of newer programs, 
one can see our proactive approach to energy 
conservation and its broader goal of reducing carbon 
footprint while maintaining operational excellence.
Negative Implication:
The increasing cost of energy, 
coupled with the significant 
initial investment required for 
energy-efficient technologies, 
presents an ongoing 
challenge.

Product 
Quality and 
Safety
R
Relying on technologies that have 
not kept up with the latest changes 
in sustainability regulations and new 
innovations in product design in tile 
manufacturing can impact product 
quality, safety, and customer loyalty 
potentially affecting the Company’s 
brand image and overall profitability.
Delivering high-quality products at competitive 
prices, supported by efficient pre- and post-
sales service, offers a strategic opportunity to 
build lasting customer relationships and ensure 
consistent revenue growth. The Company places 
strong emphasis on research and development to 
drive innovation and maintain product excellence. 
All operations are guided by a robust ISO 9001:2015 
certified Quality Management System, ensuring 
compliance with stringent quality and safety 
standards.
The Company focuses on delivering quality products 
at competitive prices while continuously enhancing 
operational efficiency through targeted process 
improvements and innovation. Certified quality 
systems, responsible waste management, and 
cost-effective material substitutions support both 
sustainability and performance goals. Initiatives 
across facilities aim to optimize energy use, reduce 
waste, and improve product consistency.
Somany’s commitment to delivering value through 
innovation, quality, and sustainability can be 
reflected in our initiatives. We have renewed our 
GRIHA certification and also received GreenPro 
certifications, further strengthening our focus on 
environmental compliance and sustainable growth.
Negative Implication:
Substandard product 
quality can result in 
declining sales, higher 
return rates, reputational 
harm, legal liabilities, recall 
expenses, and missed 
business opportunities — 
all contributing to adverse 
financial outcomes for the 
Company.
4
ESG Aspects 
in Supply 
Chain
R
Environmental 
and 
social 
challenges across the Company’s 
value chain have the potential to 
disrupt supply chain operations 
and affect business continuity, 
stakeholder trust, and long-term 
profitability.
To promote responsible sourcing, the Company has 
established a Supplier Code of Conduct outlining 
ESG standards for all vendors. This framework 
encourages 
ethical, 
sustainable, 
and 
socially 
responsible practices throughout the supply chain, 
supporting broader CSR and sustainability goals. 
Adherence to the Code fosters transparency, trust, 
and shared accountability, with our stakeholders 
and customers.
To further strengthen supplier engagement, Somany 
ensures communication and awareness initiatives 
to help suppliers understand and align with the BRSR 
Core requirements. Training is also provided on the 
General Terms and Conditions and the Supplier 
Code of Conduct to ensure clarity and compliance.
At the plant level, supply chain sustainability is 
strengthened through responsible procurement 
practices, including sourcing sustainable materials, 
as well as initiatives like using alternative fuels, 
recycling industrial by-products, and conducting 
resource efficiency trials.
These 
efforts 
demonstrate 
the 
company’s 
commitment 
to 
building 
a 
responsible 
and 
environmentally conscious supply chain.
Negative Implication:
Inadequate ESG practices 
within the supply chain 
can expose a company 
to significant financial 
risks. These include 
operational disruptions due 
to environmental incidents 
or non-compliance with 
regulations, reputational 
damage from unethical labor 
practices or human rights 
violations, and increased 
costs.

Local 
Community 
Development
O
Establishing 
strong, 
long-
term 
relationships 
with 
local 
communities is vital for securing the 
social license to operate. Through 
its Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) initiatives, Somany shows 
its dedication to the well-being 
and sustainable growth of these 
communities. These efforts span 
key areas such as education, 
healthcare, 
environmental 
stewardship, 
and 
economic 
upliftment. By actively engaging 
with and investing in community 
development, the Company builds 
trust, strengthens its reputation, 
and ensures long-term operational 
sustainability.
Positive Implication:
Investing in community 
development yields significant 
financial and strategic 
benefits for the Company, 
including enhanced brand 
reputation, community 
trust, stronger stakeholder 
engagement, and lower 
operational risks, ultimately 
driving business growth and 
ensuring financial resilience.
6
Employee 
Well Being
O
Supporting employee and worker 
well-being 
goes 
beyond 
just 
maintaining workplace safety. We 
take into consideration, physical, 
mental, and emotional health of our 
workforce. The skills, dedication, 
and engagement of our workforce 
is vital to our long-term success 
and the confidence placed in us by 
our stakeholders.
Positive Implication:
Prioritizing employee 
wellness yields measurable 
business benefits, such as 
reduced absenteeism, higher 
productivity, lower attrition 
rates, increased innovation, 
and the development of a 
positive work environment 
that helps attract and retain 
top talent.
7
Compliance 
and Ethical 
Business 
Practices
R
Failure to comply with legal and 
ethical business standards can 
lead to serious consequences, 
including 
legal 
sanctions, 
reputational 
harm, 
disruptions 
in the supply chain, restricted 
market access, loss of trust among 
investors and stakeholders, and 
negative environmental and social 
outcomes.
The Company upholds a strong compliance 
management 
system, 
with 
senior 
leadership 
conducting regular reviews to ensure alignment with 
all applicable regulations.
To manage compliance and ethical risks effectively, 
particularly around the Code of Conduct and POSH, 
we have adopted a multi-modal training framework 
and a structured grievance redressal system. This 
helps identify emerging issues and integrate timely 
solutions, reducing future regulatory risks.
Our responsible business practices are guided by 
Board-approved policies aligned with the NGRBC 
principles, extending to our suppliers. We also 
uphold transparency by publicly reporting any 
regulatory fines or formal complaints as part of our 
ethical governance.
Negative Implication:
Non-compliance with 
regulations or engaging 
in unethical business 
conduct can lead to legal 
consequences, damage the 
Company’s reputation, disrupt 
operations, restrict market 
access, and result in financial 
penalties—all of which can 
adversely impact financial 
performance.

Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
At Somany, ESG is deeply embedded in our philosophy and strategy. We go beyond compliance, 
using ESG as a framework for how we do business, innovate, and create value for customers, 
communities, and the planet. As a global decor solutions pioneer, our extensive portfolio—tiles, 
sanitaryware, bath fittings, and allied products—reflects our focus on quality, sustainability, and 
responsible manufacturing.
To achieve our ESG goals, we follow a structured three-year roadmap covering environmental 
impact, community engagement, and governance.
Our environmental efforts are robust. Both our Kadi and Kassar plants operate Zero Liquid 
Discharge systems, recycling wastewater through multiple ETPs, and prioritizing water reuse, 
efficiency, and audits. Energy conservation combines renewables, alternative fuels, and efficiency 
upgrades—from smart equipment to LED lighting—helping us cut fossil fuel use and emissions.
Process innovations ensure continuous improvement and circularity, supported by certifications 
like ISO 9001:2015. We responsibly source inputs through our Supplier Code of Conduct, vendor 
training, and audits, promoting safe, ethical, and sustainable practices.
Our CSR programs uplift local communities in health, sanitation, education, skills, and agriculture, 
planned in partnership with stakeholders and executed through the HL Somany Foundation and 
trusted partners.
Employee well-being, safety, and inclusivity are central to our culture. With robust policies, fair 
benefits, training, and feedback systems, we foster trust, respect, and growth. Governance 
is driven by compliance, ethics, and transparency, with oversight mechanisms and public 
disclosures reinforcing stakeholder trust.
For Somany, sustainability is not a standalone goal but integral to every decision and relationship. 
Guided by our ESG roadmap and a clear vision for the future, we continue to innovate, act 
responsibly, and deliver long-term value for all.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for
(a)	 Plastics (including packaging) Our company manufactures high-quality tiles and allied products designed for long-term durability, eliminating 
the need for product reclamation. While these products have an extended lifespan and do not require frequent 
replacement, we remain committed to responsible waste management.
We participate in the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system to manage the plastics used in our 
packaging and distribution. Given the varied disposal paths of packaging materials, direct reclamation is 
challenging; however, through the EPR framework, we ensure responsible recycling, reuse, or recovery at their 
final disposal stage.
All operational waste is processed through certified State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) vendors, except for 
certain industrial waste, which is reused in our processes to enhance resource efficiency.
Furthermore, our products do not contribute to electronic or hazardous waste, reinforcing our commitment to 
minimizing environmental impact.

The Company conducts regular safety training programs and emergency drills to enhance awareness among employees regarding workplace 
hazards, associated risks, and appropriate safety protocols. All staff members undergo this training and are strongly encouraged to report any 
hazards, unsafe conditions, or near-miss incidents they observe.
	
	
Reports and observations received are reviewed by the Health & Safety team, which evaluates the inputs and implements suitable corrective and 
preventive measures.
	
	
In cases where issues remain unresolved or require higher-level intervention, they are escalated to the APEX Safety Committee, which is reviewed 
by senior management to ensure accountability, timely resolution, and continuous improvement in workplace safety.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Somany’s waste management practices are in adherence to the State Pollution Control Board as well as the Central Pollution Control Board. Our 
waste management initiatives include:
	
•	
Identification of specific locations for the separate storage of hazardous waste and e-waste. All e-waste and hazardous waste generated in 
stores are secured with a lock and key arrangement at designated locations before being sent to authorized recyclers. A closed-body truck, 
arranged by the authorized e-waste recycler, collects the e-waste directly from our facility. Hazardous Waste (Used Oil) is stored in closed 
containers or drums and sent to an authorized recycler for proper disposal.
	
•	
We manage hazardous waste in compliance with the guidelines of the GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board), wherein, the industrial waste is 
reused as a raw material, plastic barrels and used oil are sold to GPCB-authorized parties and broken tiles are repurposed in the manufacturing 
process to minimize waste.
	
•	
We ensure full compliance with environmental regulations by regularly submitting all required e-waste, hazardous waste, and battery waste 
returns to the Regional Office of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. These timely submissions reflect our commitment to responsible 
waste management and regulatory adherence.
	
We do not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals in our manufacturing process, ensuring a safer workplace and minimizing environmental impact. 
This practice promotes employee health, regulatory compliance, and sustainable operations while also reducing the risk of pollution and waste 
generation.
