(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with 
a comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and 
accountability.)

and 
emerging technologies can further

Sustainable 
Sourcing and 
Supply chain 
Management
Opportunity
Companies that adopt sustainable 
sourcing practices and emphasise 
reuse, refurbishment, and recycling 
are often perceived as more 
responsible. This enhances their 
brand image and fosters trust among 
consumers, investors, and other 
stakeholders. Consequently, such 
companies benefit from stronger 
brand loyalty and increased sales. 
Moreover, sustainable supply chain 
practices appeal to environmentally 
conscious investors, unlocking new 
financial opportunities. In this way, 
sustainable sourcing and supply 
chain management offer textile 
companies a competitive advantage 
in a sustainability-driven future.
Opportunity
3.
Water and 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical resource for textile 
manufacturing. Inefficient use 
of water can lead to scarcity and 
drive-up production costs. Similarly, 
various company operations, 
including manufacturing processes, 
equipment maintenance, and 
administrative activities, generate 
waste. If this waste is not effectively 
managed, it can contribute to air 
pollution, climate change, and have 
both direct and indirect negative 
impacts on the ecosystem.
Our company has adopted 
robust measures to ensure 
responsible water and 
waste management. We 
have installed ETP and 
CTP systems across all our 
facilities to effectively treat 
water discharge and minimise 
pollution. As a Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) company, we 
are committed to recycling and 
treating all wastewater, thereby 
eliminating liquid waste 
discharge.
Our waste management 
approach is designed to reduce 
both environmental and human 
risks. Hazardous waste is 
handled strictly by authorised 
agencies, while non-hazardous 
waste is recycled. For example, 
boiler ash is repurposed by 
brick manufacturers, and we 
compost dry vegetation and 
certain canteen waste on-site, 
significantly reducing our 
ecological impact.

4.
Energy and 
Emission 
Management
Risk
Energy consumption and emissions 
pose a significant challenge in 
the textile industry. The sector’s 
heavy reliance on fossil fuels leads 
to substantial greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. With tightening 
environmental regulations, rising 
energy prices, potential carbon taxes, 
and growing consumer expectations 
for sustainability, the risk continues 
to escalate.
Inefficient energy use not only 
increases operational expenses but 
also jeopardises market access, as 
more customers and stakeholders 
insist on environmentally responsible 
supply chains. To address these 
challenges, textile companies must 
implement effective energy and 
emissions management practices—
such as adopting energy-efficient 
technologies and transitioning to 
renewable energy sources—to lower 
costs, mitigate environmental risks, 
and enhance their sustainability 
performance.
Our company is proactively 
implementing various 
initiatives to lower emissions 
and reduce reliance on non-
renewable energy sources. 
To address greenhouse gas 
emissions, we have deployed 
rooftop solar installations, 
biomass-based co-generation 
thermal power plants, and wind 
turbines. These renewable 
energy solutions significantly 
help us shrink our carbon 
footprint.
Alongside this, we have 
introduced several energy 
conservation measures, 
including converting 
condensing turbines, fixing 
compressed air leakages, 
modifying WCS ducts, and 
fine-tuning the speed of auto 
corner machines. Together, 
these efforts enhance energy 
efficiency, minimise our 
environmental impact, and 
reinforce our dedication to 
sustainable and responsible 
business practices.

Human Rights 
& Labour 
Management
Risk
Companies that prioritise human 
rights demonstrate their commitment 
to fostering sustainable and 
mutually respectful relationships 
with all stakeholders impacted by 
their operations—be it customers, 
communities, employees, or 
investors. This reflects genuine 
concern for the well-being of the 
people connected to their business. 
Likewise, organisations that depend 
on an on-site workforce must 
implement strong labor management 
practices. These practices should 
consider the scale and nature 
of the workforce, the quality of 
management-labor relations, the 
protection of workers’ rights, and 
proactive efforts to engage with 
employees.
Our company is deeply 
committed to upholding 
human and labor rights, 
with dedicated policies and 
grievance mechanisms in 
place to support these values. 
We promote a culture of 
transparency by encouraging 
employees to share their 
concerns openly. To maintain 
high standards, we conduct 
regular internal and external 
audits across all our facilities, 
continuously reviewing and 
refining our practices to ensure 
alignment with human and 
labor rights regulations.
Furthermore, we participate 
in the annual Sedex-SMETA 
4-Pillar Audits, which assesses 
our performance in labor 
standards, health and safety, 
environmental practices, and 
business ethics. This robust 
framework helps us align with 
international benchmarks, 
reduce associated risks, and 
foster a safe, fair, and inclusive 
work environment. These 
thorough measures reflect our 
unwavering commitment to 
responsible labor management 
and human rights protection.

Employee 
training, 
development, 
wellbeing & 
satisfaction
Opportunity
Investing in employee training, 
development, wellbeing, and 
satisfaction presents a valuable 
opportunity for textile companies. 
Enhancing workforce skills can 
significantly improve productivity 
and operational efficiency, resulting 
in stronger performance and a 
more competitive edge. Supporting 
employee wellbeing helps lower 
absenteeism and fosters a healthier, 
more positive work environment, 
which contributes to improved job 
performance. Additionally, increased 
job satisfaction promotes employee 
loyalty and reduces attrition, 
ultimately lowering long-term costs 
associated with hiring and training 
new staff.
Positive
7.
Impact on 
community
Opportunity
When businesses actively support 
local community development, they 
contribute to creating a stronger 
and more resilient ecosystem. Such 
involvement can strengthen the local 
economy and expand the customer 
base, ultimately offering long-term 
advantages to the business itself.
Positive
8.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk
Customer satisfaction plays a vital 
role in a company’s success. By 
placing strong emphasis on meeting 
customer needs, businesses can 
strengthen their brand reputation, 
differentiate themselves from 
competitors, and attract a wider 
customer base. This approach not 
only fosters greater customer loyalty 
but also boosts the overall brand 
value of textile companies.
To effectively manage 
customer satisfaction, we have 
implemented a responsive and 
inclusive system. Customers 
are given direct contact 
information to ensure easy 
access to our support team. 
Upon receiving a complaint, 
it is promptly recorded in our 
system, assigned to a specific 
team member, and thoroughly 
examined. Our goal is to 
resolve concerns quickly while 
keeping customers updated 
throughout the process 
to ensure transparency. 
Additionally, we analyze 
complaint trends to identify 
and address recurring issues, 
helping us continuously 
improve our products and 
services.

Product 
Design and 
Innovation
Opportunity
Product design and innovation are 
key to maintaining competitiveness 
and relevance in the ever-evolving 
textile industry. Adopting advanced 
technologies and novel materials 
allows textile manufacturers to tap 
into new market opportunities while 
improving efficiency and productivity. 
Furthermore, innovations in textile 
materials and production methods 
help minimise the industry’s 
environmental impact, supporting 
broader sustainability objectives.
Positive
10.
Ethics & 
Business 
Conduct
Risk
Textile companies face significant 
risks related to ethics and business 
conduct, including fraud, executive 
misconduct, corruption, money 
laundering, and anti-trust breaches. 
Such issues can seriously damage 
a company’s reputation, financial 
health, and long-term viability. To 
mitigate these risks, it is vital to 
maintain high ethical standards. 
This involves enforcing stringent 
codes of conduct, establishing 
strong monitoring mechanisms, 
and providing ongoing training 
to employees to ensure these 
challenges are managed effectively.
To effectively manage 
risks related to ethics and 
business conduct, we have 
established a comprehensive 
ethics program anchored 
by a well-defined code of 
conduct. These principles 
are clearly communicated 
and embedded throughout all 
aspects of our operations. We 
regularly conduct training and 
awareness sessions to ensure 
our employees fully understand 
and uphold these standards. 
Additionally, we have 
implemented an anonymous 
reporting system to support 
whistleblowing, enabling 
concerns to be raised and 
resolved promptly and fairly.

Compliance 
with Laws & 
Regulations
Risk
Adhering to legal and regulatory 
requirements is a critical challenge 
for textile companies, as it involves 
compliance with a wide range of 
local and international laws related 
to labor rights, environmental 
protection, health and safety, and 
quality standards. Non-compliance 
can result in financial penalties, 
reputational damage, and operational 
setbacks. Hence, it is essential 
for textile companies to maintain 
strict compliance with all applicable 
regulations to effectively manage and 
reduce these risks.
To effectively mitigate 
compliance risk, we ensure 
a deep understanding 
of applicable laws and 
regulations, conduct regular 
audits, and enforce stringent 
internal policies. We also 
prioritise ongoing training and 
education for our employees 
to keep them informed 
about current compliance 
obligations. Moreover, we 
cultivate a strong compliance 
culture across the organisation, 
consistently reinforcing the 
importance of following legal 
and regulatory standards in 
every aspect of our operations.

12.
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
This evaluation is based on a 
company’s performance in key 
governance areas, including 
ownership and control structures, 
board compensation, accounting 
practices, business ethics, and tax 
transparency. It examines how the 
Company’s corporate governance 
and ethical standards affect its 
shareholders and broader investor 
community. The assessment 
highlights the effectiveness of the 
governance framework in promoting 
transparency, accountability, and 
ethical conduct, all of which play a 
vital role in shaping investor trust 
and perceptions of the Company’s 
long-term sustainability and overall 
performance.
Our company is built on the 
core values of transparency, 
integrity, professionalism, 
and accountability. We are 
committed to reinforcing 
these principles by adopting 
innovative approaches 
that promote efficient 
resource utilisation and 
transform opportunities into 
accomplishments. This is 
made possible by empowering 
and inspiring our people, 
ensuring that every aspect of 
our operations remains aligned 
with these foundational values.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As the Director of our leading textile company, I am pleased to present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report, which highlights our ongoing commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. At the core 
of our business philosophy lies a strong belief in the transformative power of sustainable practices and our responsibility 
to create lasting, positive change for society and the environment.
In line with BRSR requirements, we have conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment to identify the most 
significant ESG-related concerns affecting our business and stakeholders. This process highlighted critical focus areas 
such as water stewardship, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, energy efficiency, and the circular economy. 
These areas now form the foundation of our strategic sustainability initiatives across our operations.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy reflects our efforts to address key social and developmental challenges. 
We support initiatives aimed at eradicating hunger, poverty, and malnutrition, and are equally dedicated to enhancing 
access to both general and preventive healthcare. Our priorities also include environmental conservation, ecological 
restoration, livelihood enhancement through skill development, and vocational training.
We continue to invest in education and empowerment, with a particular focus on children, women, the elderly, and persons 
with disabilities. Our programs also extend to promoting gender equality, women’s empowerment, rural development, and 
fostering innovation through academic and technological incubators.
To ensure sustainable progress, we are embedding a culture of accountability and environmental consciousness across 
our organisation. This mindset is helping us take meaningful steps toward integrating sustainable practices in all areas 
of our business.
We have already implemented several energy and emissions reduction measures. These include the adoption of renewable 
energy sources such as rooftop solar panels, biomass-based co-generation plants, and wind energy systems. In addition, 
we have improved energy efficiency through technical upgrades like turbine modifications, compressed air leak detection, 
duct optimisation, and speed control on textile machinery.
Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce is paramount. Our facilities are certified under ISO 45001:2018, confirming 
adherence to global occupational health and safety standards. Our Denim and Sareri units have earned SA 8000:2014 
certification, and we regularly undergo Sedex-SMETA 4-Pillar audits, which assess compliance in labor standards, health 
and safety, environmental performance, and ethical practices.
We also maintain stringent food safety and hygiene standards, supported by a canteen committee and the provision of 
FSSAI-certified meals. Safe water access is ensured through in-house water treatment facilities.
Looking ahead, we have set ambitious goals to further our ESG performance. These include scaling up the use of recycled 
fibers, reducing plastic waste by converting it into raw materials, and promoting organic cotton usage to lower our 
environmental footprint, particularly GHG emissions.
In conclusion, our company remains steadfast in its commitment to integrating ESG principles into every facet of our 
operations. By advancing sustainable business practices and fostering inclusive growth, we aim to contribute meaningfully 
to a more resilient, responsible, and equitable future.

1.

2.	
Plant HR Head or Plant Head
3.	
Function Head or Business Head (FH/BH)
If the concern remains unresolved or the resolution is unsatisfactory, the employee may

We are committed to ensuring that every grievance is either resolved or appropriately 
escalated within 7 days of being raised at any level of the three-tier mechanism. This 
structured approach guarantees that employee issues are managed in a timely and fair 
manner.
In addition, our HR Department conducts a quarterly review of all grievances reported 
over the preceding three months. The goal of this review is to identify recurring concerns 
among employees and develop targeted action plans to address and prevent such issues 
in the future.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Improper waste and effluent management can pose serious risks to both the environment and human health. At SIL, 
we recognise this responsibility and are committed to managing the waste and effluent generated at our facilities in a 
safe and sustainable manner. Our waste management approach is guided by the principles of avoidance, reduction, and 
recycling.
	
At our manufacturing units, we produce various types of hazardous waste, including ETP sludge, used oil, empty chemical 
containers, and MEE salt. We strictly adhere to regulatory standards for the handling and management of hazardous 
waste, ensuring that scientific methods and precautionary measures are applied throughout the process.
	
Each plant is equipped with dedicated hazardous waste storage areas that feature impermeable flooring, proper labelling, 
and strict storage protocols to guarantee safe handling. All our facilities hold authorisation from the respective state 
pollution control board for hazardous waste management and operate in full compliance with the conditions outlined 
in these authorisations. We maintain all necessary documentation, such as Form 3 and Form 4, and submit them to 
the board as required. In addition, our hazardous waste handlers receive regular training to ensure safe and compliant 
disposal practices.
	
We also manage non-hazardous waste generated at SIL locations, including dry vegetation, canteen waste, fabric scraps, 
corrugated boxes, stiffener boxes, and paper waste. These materials are handled with equal diligence and scientific care. 
For instance, boiler ash is supplied to brick manufacturers for reuse, while dry vegetation and select canteen waste are 
composted on-site. Other materials, like paper and remaining canteen waste, are sent to municipal composting facilities 
for appropriate processing.

Each plant unit maintains a dedicated logbook to record all community grievances, enabling systematic documentation 
and resolution tracking.
	
2.	
Once a complaint is received, it is assessed and categorised based on its nature—such as cultural or heritage issues, 
land-related concerns, or health and safety matters. The relevant team or personnel is assigned to ensure expert 
handling of the issue.
	
3.	
After classification, we acknowledge the complaint by reaching out to the concerned individual, providing assurance 
on the action plan and expected resolution steps.
	
4.	
During resolution, we focus not only on addressing the immediate concern but also on identifying root causes to help 
prevent recurrence of similar issues in the future.
	
5.	
Once resolved to the complainant’s satisfaction, the issue is formally closed by the community redressal manager or 
the responsible officer, confirming that appropriate action has been taken.
	
6.	
In cases where the complainant is not satisfied, further investigation is initiated by the redressal manager. If needed, 
an independent third party is brought in to facilitate a fair and impartial resolution.
	
Through this well-defined and empathetic process, we aim to respect community voices, uphold our social responsibility, 
and promote a positive and sustainable relationship with our surrounding communities.
