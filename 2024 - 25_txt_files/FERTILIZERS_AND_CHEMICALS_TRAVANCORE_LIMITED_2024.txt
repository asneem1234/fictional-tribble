In addition, we are focused on reducing our overall 
energy consumption by implementing energy-
efﬁcient technologies and processes, while also

inclusive workforce, and we have plans to improve

7. Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has ﬂexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
FACT is strategically positioned to achieve sustained 
and consistent growth through the implementation 
of various capital expenditure (CAPEX) projects.
The Company is committed to integrating 
Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') 
principles into its businesses.  The company is 
committed to managing and mitigating risks through 
the entire product lifecycle and improving its value 
offerings to meet the needs and aspirations of all its 
stakeholders. The company has a policy on Product 
Responsibility and Sustainability. The Company 
endeavours to ensure responsible and sustainable 
business operations across the entire supply chain- 
sourcing, procurement, manufacturing, packaging, 
transportation, marketing, and end-product use.
The company has a Business Responsibility and 
Sustainable Development Policy which includes all 
essential policies that fall under BRSR principles.
The Company is taking steps to reduce carbon 
emissions and utilise renewable energy for its 
operations. The feedstock and fuel have been 
changed to RLNG, the green fuel.
FACT has taken a signiﬁcant step by switching the 
fuel used in the driers of its phosphate plants from 
furnace oil to Re-gassiﬁed Liqueﬁed Natural Gas 
(RLNG). This transition to RLNG is not only 
environmentally friendly but also improves 
combustion efﬁciency. To ensure sustained 
operation and energy savings, FACT has planned 
several capital expenditure (CAPEX) projects. These 
projects include expanding the capacity of the 
Ammonia Plant, Phosphoric Acid Plant, and Sulphuric 
Acid Plant. FACT intends to fund these projects 
internally, demonstrating its commitment to long-
term growth. FACT has a rich history, celebrating 76 
years of producing fertilizers and serving the nation. 
Throughout its existence, FACT has consistently met 
the fertilizer needs of farmers. Despite facing 
challenges, the company is now focused on 
sustainable growth, adopting industry best practices. 
By ensuring a stable supply of fertilizers, FACT 
contributes to national food security.

- Workforce diversity increased to 11% in FY25, up 
from 10% in Fy24.

establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce

chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
FACT has implemented a comprehensive solid waste 
management plan. Non-hazardous solid waste is 
collected from its point of generation and stored in 
designated on-site facilities. Metal scrap, e-waste, and 
plastic waste are managed through the Metal Scrap 
Trading Corporation (MSTC). Bio-medical waste is safely 
disposed of via the IMA – IMAGE facility. Used batteries 
and other waste are handled by authorized re-processors 
through a buy-back policy. Hazardous waste categories 
include spent catalysts, sulphur muck, waste oil, lead 
scrap, and ETP sludge, all of which are safely disposed of 
by authorized re-processors. Waste oil is recycled for use 
as lubricant in conveyor idlers and other machinery.
