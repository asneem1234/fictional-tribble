Data privacy 
and cyber 
security
R
In the realm of RF/Microwave/ Digital 
electronics, hardware products and 
associated 
software 
can 
harbor 
security gaps that may pose threats 
to consumer data security. Therefore, 
the onus is on the manufacturers 
in 
this 
industry 
to 
ensure 
the 
integrity of user data. If businesses 
operating in this sector fail to devise 
a comprehensive methodology to 
detect such vulnerabilities, they may 
inadvertently place consumer data at 
risk and potentially undermine their 
customer.
To address data privacy and 
security, the company has 
established a robust Cyber 
Risk Management framework. 
This framework, overseen by 
the Information Technology 
& Security Committee and 
Risk Management Committee, 
ensures constant monitoring 
of cyber risks and their 
mitigation. Data access is 
strictly controlled and data 
encryption is employed to 
ensure security. Moreover, the 
company has intensified its 
efforts to educate employees, 
customers, 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
about 
cyber 
frauds and the importance 
of data privacy, as part of its 
commitment to maintaining 
a secure digital environment.

Corporate 
Governance
R
Companies are assessed on their 
performance 
in 
key 
governance 
areas such as ownership structure, 
board 
remuneration, 
accounting 
practices, corporate ethics, and tax 
transparency. This topic examines 
the effect that a company's corporate 
governance 
and 
business 
ethics 
practices have on its shareholders and 
other investors.
To 
mitigate 
corporate 
governance risk, the company 
regularly reviews and updates 
its policies to ensure they 
remain relevant and effective. 
The Board plays a crucial role 
in this process, overseeing 
the review of governance 
practices 
and 
structures. 
Additionally, 
governance 
policies are revised to reflect 
changes in legislation and 
industry 
best 
practices. 
This proactive approach to 
governance 
helps 
manage 
risk, enhance transparency, 
and ensure compliance with 
all relevant regulations and 
standards.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements.
Dear Stakeholders,
At Astra Microwave, we firmly believe that sustainability is a fundamental aspect of our business operations. This 
communication outlines our ongoing efforts and progress in addressing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
challenges.
Our commitment to sustainability is built on a solid foundation. We have undertaken a comprehensive materiality 
assessment to identify and prioritize the most significant sustainability issues, enabling us to address them in a structured 
and effective manner. In addition, we have thoroughly measured our carbon and water footprints, providing critical insights 
into our environmental impact and informing the development of our sustainability strategies and objectives. To further 
institutionalize our approach, we have established a detailed Business Responsibility and Reporting (BRR) policy to guide our 
decisions and actions.
Our commitment is reflected in tangible initiatives. Our facility in Bangalore has received a prestigious 5-star GRIHA rating, 
underscoring our dedication to energy-efficient and environmentally responsible infrastructure. We have also invested in 
a solar power plant to enhance our reliance on clean and renewable energy, reinforcing our pledge to a sustainable future. 
Moreover, sewage treatment plants (STPs) have been deployed across all operational units, promoting responsible water 
management and reducing our ecological footprint.
We recognize that our employees are integral to advancing our sustainability agenda. We prioritize their continuous learning 
and development to empower them to contribute meaningfully to our initiatives. Additionally, we have implemented a 
transparent and efficient grievance redressal portal, providing stakeholders including vendors, customers, investors, and 
employees a reliable platform to voice and resolve concerns.
We are mindful of the challenges inherent in the sustainability journey, such as data availability, dynamic regulatory 
landscapes, and evolving investor expectations. As a forward-looking organization, we actively monitor these developments 
and adapt our strategies accordingly. To ensure alignment with global best practices, we have established specific targets in 
critical areas, including poverty alleviation, energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, health, and the promotion of inclusive and 
productive employment. These objectives serve as benchmarks in our pursuit of sustainable development.
As we move forward, transparency, continuous improvement, and stakeholder collaboration will remain central to our 
approach. We deeply value your continued support and engagement as we collectively strive toward a more sustainable and 
resilient future.

If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief
Permanent Workers
Yes
Our organization has established a structured Grievance Redressal 
mechanism to facilitate the prompt and effective resolution of employee 
concerns. Employees are encouraged to initially raise their grievances 
with their immediate supervisor, ensuring timely communication of 
any issues. In instances where the grievance pertains to the immediate 
supervisor, employees may directly approach the Human Resources (HR) 
department to ensure an impartial and unbiased review of the matter.
The immediate supervisor or designated HR representative will undertake 
a thorough investigation and make reasonable efforts to resolve the issue 
within approximately three working days. All discussions and actions 
taken will be carefully documented and submitted to the HR department 
for record-keeping.
If the employee remains dissatisfied with the resolution provided at 
the initial level, they may escalate the matter by submitting a Grievance 
Form (Annexure - 17) to the next-level manager. The manager will 
conduct a comprehensive review and strive to resolve the grievance 
within a reasonable timeframe, generally within three working days. All 
proceedings and relevant documentation will be diligently recorded and 
shared with the HR department.
In cases where the employee continues to be unsatisfied with the 
outcome, they have the right to seek further recourse by approaching 
the HR department. The HR team will conduct an impartial investigation, 
taking into account all perspectives, and will deliver a final resolution.
Through the implementation of this Grievance Redressal mechanism, 
we aim to ensure that all employee concerns are addressed in a fair, 
transparent, and efficient manner. This structured approach promotes 
accountability and thorough documentation throughout the resolution 
process.

10. 	Health and safety management system
a. 	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No)	 Yes
If Yes, the Coverage such systems?
The company-owned facilities and offices have an established Occupational Health and Safety Management System in 
place, ensuring compliance with relevant standards and the promotion of a safe and healthy working environment.
b. 	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
To identify and assess work-related hazards and risks—both routine and non-routine—the organization follows a structured 
and systematic approach that ensures thorough evaluation and effective management of occupational health and safety 
(OHS) concerns. This methodology comprises the following key stages:
1. 	 Identification of Significant Hazards and Risks:
	
Assessment Based on Defined Criteria and Ratings:
Hazards present in each work area are systematically evaluated using specific assessment criteria and are 
assigned ratings to determine their level of significance.
	
Consideration of Overriding Factors and Potential Emergencies:
Any hazard categorized under “Overriding Factors” or identified as a “Potential Emergency” is automatically 
considered significant due to its potential severity and impact.
	
Classification Based on Significance Scores:
Hazards are further analysed according to their significance scores. Those falling within the “Unacceptable” or 
“Needs Correction” categories, typically with L×S (Likelihood × Severity) values between 5 and 25, are deemed 
significant and prioritized for corrective actions.
2. 	 Post-Control Evaluation of Hazards and Risks:
	
Evaluation of Control Measures:
The effectiveness of implemented control measures aimed at mitigating identified hazards and environmental 
impacts is carefully assessed as part of the overall risk management process.
	
Reassessment of OHS Hazards and Associated Risks:
Occupational health and safety hazards, along with their associated risks, are reassessed using the same 
overriding factors and significance scoring framework.
	
Categorization of Risk Levels:
The significance scores are classified into three categories—High, Medium, and Low—based on a predefined 
evaluation matrix. This classification guides the prioritization and resource allocation for hazard mitigation efforts.
By adhering to this comprehensive and methodical evaluation process, the organization ensures the timely 
identification and effective management of significant hazards and risks. This approach supports
the implementation of appropriate control measures, thereby enhancing workplace safety and reducing potential 
occupational hazards.
c. 	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks?

to minimize operational disruptions during emergencies. The team includes individuals assigned to roles such as Rescue 
Operations, First Aid, Observation, Firefighting, Security, and Communication, all functioning under the direction of the 
on-duty Security Officer.

12. 	Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
The organization has instituted several measures to ensure a safe and healthy work environment. A clearly defined process 
is in place for assessing occupational health and safety (OHS) hazards and risks. This structured evaluation supports the 
identification of potential risks and the development of appropriate control strategies. Moreover, the organization prioritizes 
thorough documentation and record-keeping in accordance with the standards of the Environmental Health and Safety 
Management System (EHSMS). This practice ensures the accurate recording and accessibility of essential information related 
to safety protocols, incidents, and corrective actions.
To maintain high standards of workplace safety, the organization conducts regular internal and external audits throughout 
the year. These audits assess compliance with established safety procedures, identify areas for improvement, and verify 
ongoing conformity with regulatory requirements. In addition, the organization has defined specific Environmental Health and 
Safety (EHS) objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) for each department. These targets are routinely monitored to 
measure performance and address any deviations from expected outcomes. This proactive methodology promotes continuous 
improvement and reinforces the commitment to a safe and secure working environment.

are essential for making well-informed decisions that support our long-term success. To facilitate this, we have implemented 
various channels for collecting feedback on economic, environmental, and social matters. These include email correspondence, 
online surveys, and dedicated suggestion boxes located at our facilities.
We systematically collect and evaluate this feedback to gain a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder concerns, 
priorities, and recommendations. The most significant insights are compiled and presented to the Board of Directors, 
ensuring that stakeholder perspectives are incorporated into strategic discussions and decision-making processes. This 
comprehensive approach enhances transparency and enables us to effectively address the economic, environmental, and 
social issues that are most important to our stakeholders.

5. 	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
Yes, the organization has established a formal grievance redressal mechanism specifically designed to address concerns 
related to human rights. Employees are encouraged to promptly report any grievances to their immediate supervisor for 
resolution. In instances where the grievance pertains to the immediate supervisor, employees may directly approach the 
Human Resources (HR) department.
The supervisor is responsible for conducting a thorough investigation and aiming to resolve the issue within approximately 
three working days. All discussions are to be properly documented, and relevant records must be submitted to HR.
If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution provided by the immediate supervisor, they have the right to escalate the 
matter by submitting a Grievance Form to the next-level manager. The manager will carry out a comprehensive investigation 
and endeavor to resolve the issue within a similar timeframe, ensuring that all proceedings are documented and submitted to 
HR for further review.
Should the employee remain dissatisfied with the outcome, they may escalate the matter to the HR department, which 
will conduct an impartial investigation and provide a final resolution. This grievance redressal process ensures fairness, 
transparency, and accountability in addressing human rights-related concerns within the organization.

10. 	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
Our company maintains a comprehensive waste management system across all plants and offices, recognizing that 
responsible waste handling is fundamental to environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility. We diligently monitor 
and document the waste generated at our facilities and subsequently engage certified vendors who specialize in proper waste 
management. These vendors ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and utilize environmentally sound methods for 
waste disposal or recycling, thereby minimizing our environmental impact.
Moreover, we have established rigorous protocols for managing electronic waste (e-waste) and hazardous waste, which require 
more specialized handling. In line with our general waste management practices, we partner exclusively with certified vendors 
who comply with the most current and stringent standards for waste handling, prioritizing both environmental protection and 
human safety.
In summary, through continuous monitoring and collaboration with accredited waste management providers, we ensure 
that all waste streams—whether general, e-waste, or hazardous—are managed in the most environmentally responsible 
manner possible.
