1.
Sustainable 
Products 
and 
Solutions
Opportunity
When developing new 
products, we expect 
all 3M projects entering 
the new product 
commercialisation process 
to have a Sustainability 
Value Commitment (SVC) 
that demonstrates how the 
product advances overall 
sustainability, improves 
competitiveness, and 
responds to customer 
demand. SVCs describe 
how products contribute to 
resilient business growth: 
- Through reusability, 
recyclability, and use of 
recycled materials. 
- Reduction of waste, 
energy use and water 
use.
- Through third-party eco-
label or certification, and 
responsible sourcing.
-
The Sustainability
Value Commitment
(SVC) boosts
3M’s finances
by attracting
eco-conscious
customers, cutting
production costs,
ensuring regulatory
compliance,
reducing legal risks
and enhancing
brand reputation,
driving sustainable
growth and
profitability.
2.
Safety of 
products 
and 
services
Risk
Any health and safety 
incident related to our 
products poses a risk 
of injury or harm to our 
customers, which can lead 
to legal liabilities, damage 
to our brand reputation, 
and financial losses.
By continuously improving 
product safety standards, 
implementing rigorous testing 
protocols, and swiftly addressing 
any issues through transparent 
communication and prompt recalls 
if necessary, we can mitigate 
risks, protect customer trust, and 
reinforce our commitment to safety 
and quality. The entity provides 
a TDS (Technical Data Sheet) and 
an MSDS (Material Safety Data 
Sheet) for each of its products 
which carry information on product 
usage, hazard status, storage 
conditions, shelf life and disposal 
methodologies.
Prioritising health and 
safety in our products 
and solutions, helps 
build consumer 
trust, boosts product 
demand, strengthens 
brand reputation, 
and avoids costly 
legal actions, while 
fostering confidence 
among stakeholders.

3.
Health and 
Safety of 
employees
Risk
Employee health and 
safety pose a risk to the 
entity due to potential 
accidents, health issues, 
increased costs, reduced 
productivity, and potential 
legal liabilities, impacting 
human resources and 
overall operational 
efficiency.
At 3M India, we prioritise 
employee health and safety with 
rigorous training, regular health 
screenings, and strict compliance 
with safety regulations. We 
foster a culture of awareness, 
utilise advanced technologies, 
and engage employees to ensure 
a safe and supportive workplace 
environment.
Focusing on 
employee health 
and safety creates 
a positive work 
environment that 
minimises medical 
expenses, avoids 
regulatory penalties, 
and boosts 
productivity. By 
prioritising the well-
being of our team, 
we not only enhance 
job satisfaction 
but also make 3M 
India an attractive 
place for talented 
individuals to join and 
stay.
4.
Community 
health, 
safety and 
well being
Risk
The impact of community 
health, safety, and 
well-being issues on the 
entity includes potential 
regulatory scrutiny, 
operational disruptions,
reputational damage, and 
legal liabilities, which can 
affect business continuity 
and stakeholder trust.
3M India's community philosophy 
is enshrined in the CSR policy 
which states that it seeks to 
engage in outcome-based CSR 
programmes that will impact and 
enrich the communities around 
its areas of operation. The 
interventions are mapped to the 
activities listed under Schedule VII 
of the Companies Act 2013 and to 
the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), broadly falling under the 
three focus themes of Education, 
Community & Environment.
By actively 
supporting 
community health, 
safety, and well-
being, we can 
strengthen our brand 
reputation, ensure 
smooth operations, 
and foster positive 
relationships with 
regulators. This 
commitment not 
only helps us avoid 
legal expenses but 
also demonstrates 
our dedication to 
being a responsible 
corporate citizen, 
enhancing the trust 
and goodwill of the 
communities we 
serve.
5.
Climate 
Change 
and GHG 
emissions
Risk
Proactively addressing 
climate change and 
reducing GHG emissions 
presents an opportunity 
to enhance 3M India's 
operations, strengthen its 
reputation, and improve 
financial performance.
3M India has undertaken projects 
to contribute to 3M Global targets 
towards reducing energy, water 
and waste management (Refer 
initiative details in Principle 6)
By proactively 
managing climate-
related risks, 
we can optimise 
operational costs, 
avoid regulatory 
fines, and safeguard 
against disruptions. 
This approach not 
only protects our 
financial health but 
also demonstrates 
our commitment 
to environmental 
stewardship.

6.
Water
usage and 
availability
Risk
Operating in a water-
stressed area poses a 
significant risk to the 
Company’s operations due 
to the potential scarcity 
of a critical resource. 
Water stress can lead 
to restrictions on water 
usage, increased costs 
for water, and potential 
conflicts with local  
communities and other 
water users. It can also 
impact the Company’s 
ability to expand or 
maintain operations in the 
region.
3M’s 2024 global manufacturing 
locations were evaluated using the 
Aqueduct™ Water Risk Atlas stress-
level screening tool, Aqueduct 
4.0. Over 100 3M locations were 
analyzed, with 10 identified as 
being in “extremely high” or “high” 
water-stressed areas. The 10 
locations account for 1.2% of 3M’s 
total water use. Manufacturing 
locations include those with 
annual water use equal to or 
greater than 1,000 cubic meters. 
To mitigate this risk, the entity 
initiated a water conservation and 
management programme in Shirur 
Taluk where it's manufacturing site 
is located (Ranjangaon) to develop 
sustainable water resources and 
infrastructure. This includes 
watershed interventions, rainwater 
harvesting, and community 
engagement to build local water 
management capabilities. By 
elevating water levels in aquifers 
and enhancing irrigation, the 
entity is working to secure its 
water supply and support the local 
community.
Effectively managing 
this risk allows us 
to maintain optimal 
operational costs, 
comply with water 
resource regulations, 
and enhance the 
goodwill of the 
communities we 
serve.
7.
Ethical and 
transparent 
business
practices
Risk
Upholding ethical 
standards and maintaining 
transparency at 3M India 
can enhance the entity's 
reputation, ensure 
regulatory confidence, 
and minimise legal 
liabilities.
The entity mitigates risks through 
robust compliance programmes, 
regular audits, comprehensive 
ethical training, fostering a culture 
of integrity, and transparent 
communication with stakeholders.
Embracing 
strong ethics 
and compliance 
safeguards our 
reputation, avoids 
fines, and boosts 
investor confidence, 
fostering trust and 
transparency with all 
our stakeholders.
Opportunity
Implementing ethical 
and transparent business 
practices enhances trust, 
attracts stakeholders, and 
strengthens corporate 
governance at 3M India, 
driving sustainable growth 
and leadership in the 
marketplace.
-
Ethical and 
transparent practices 
enhance brand 
reputation, attract 
loyal stakeholders, 
reduce operational 
risks for 3M India.

In FY 24, the entity invested capital for all three sites to set 
up equipment to reduce diesel emissions to meet regulatory 
requirements set up by the Pollution Control Board for various states.
As a result, all DG sets at 3M India manufacturing sites were 
upgraded with emission-control retrofits to minimise environmental 
impact and comply with National Green Tribunal (NGT) and 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regulations, resulting in 
a reduction in harmful pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), 
carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HC), and significantly 
enhancing environmental performance.

products and manufactured products under the guidance of the parent company.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life
(a)	
Plastics (including packaging)
The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework, part of the Plastic Waste Management Rules, mandates 
entities to manage their plastic packaging waste through recycling or end-of-life disposal methods like co-processing, 
waste-to-energy, plastic-to-oil conversion, road construction or industrial composting. Pre-consumer waste is 
directed to Pollution Control Board-approved processors for recycling or co-processing.
For post-consumer waste, registered processors collaborate with urban local bodies and logistics partners to collect 
and transport waste across India. These processors, including recyclers and energy converters, handle waste through 
methods like co-processing and waste-to-oil conversion.
Since 2023, 3M has been fulfilling its EPR obligations by acquiring EPR credits via the Centralized Extended Producers’ 
Responsibility Portal, managed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Authorised processors, monitored 
by CPCB/SPCB, handle waste collection and processing.
3M annually meets CPCB-mandated plastic packaging waste targets, which are brand-agnostic and geographically 
neutral. These targets are divided into three categories: Category I (rigid plastic packaging), Category II (flexible 
plastic packaging, including single/multi-layered plastics, sheets, bags, and pouches), and Category III (multi-
layered packaging with plastic and other materials). Compliance is achieved through purchasing EPR credits from 
registered processors.
3M India Limited / Annual Report 2024-25
111
(b)	 E-waste
The E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022 apply to all entities involved in the lifecycle of e-waste or electrical and 
electronic equipment (EEE) listed in Schedule I, including their components and parts. This includes manufacturers, 
producers, consumers, bulk consumers, collection centers, dealers, e-retailers, refurbishers, dismantlers, and 
recyclers.
Under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) principle, producers of notified EEE are responsible for the disposal 
of e-waste. They are assigned annual e-waste collection and recycling targets based on the amount of EEE previously 
sold.
The entity reports on product categories such as Variable Messaging Signs (VMS), Polishers, Dust Extraction 
Machines, Spreading Devices, and certain medical products, as specified in Schedule I.
(c)	
Hazardous waste
The Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Second Amendment Rules, 2023 
apply to producers, recyclers, collection agents, and importers of used oil. 3M India is classified as a “producer” due 
to its manufacture of lubrication oil products, which become contaminated after use. The Central Pollution Control 
Board sets the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Target based on the volume of lubrication oil sold annually. 
Producers must ensure this target is met by recycling the specified quantity through certified recyclers and obtaining 
an EPR certificate as proof. 3M India is subject to EPR for used oil and has been granted “producer” registration.
(d)	 Other waste
The Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR), notified in 2022, replace the 2001 rules and apply to producers, 
dealers, and consumers involved in managing waste batteries. These rules cover all battery types, regardless of 
their characteristics.
3M India is classified as a "producer" and is registered with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for BWMR 
compliance. Batteries introduced to the market must meet collection and recycling targets outlined in Schedule II of 
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) rules. Compliance is achieved by purchasing EPR credits from CPCB-
registered Battery Waste Processors.
Each year by June 30th, 3M India  submits an EPR plan to the CPCB for batteries manufactured in the previous financial 
year. This plan details the quantity, weight, and dry weight of battery materials via a centralised portal.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
Yes, in line with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 3M India aligns its waste management plan with EPR guidelines 
and CPCB targets. Registered as a Brand Owner on the CPCB’s EPR Portal, 3M India reported its plastic waste footprint 
and purchased EPR credits for 1728 metric tons from authorised processors, fulfilling its FY 24-25 obligations.
For FY 24-25, 3M India has completed e-waste registration and met EPR targets, onboarding a new recycler to extract 
Gold, Iron, Aluminum, and Copper from e-waste as per table below.
3M India is subject to EPR for used oil and has been granted “producer” registration.

Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
No, however, the entity is actively developing a mechanism to conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) for newly 
manufactured local products. This initiative reflects our commitment to incorporating Life Cycle Management (LCM) 
into all 3M India products through our new product introduction process. This process involves comprehensive 
Environmental Health & Safety evaluations of raw materials and product characteristics, assessing human health and 
environmental toxicology, ensuring compliance with regulatory and customer EHS requirements, and creating hazard 
communication documents.
At a global level, for select products, 3M provides Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), calculates product 
carbon footprints (PCFs), and conducts screening assessments. We are implementing an automated product carbon 
footprint tool that uses data science to analyze emissions from cradle to gate, enabling us to understand the carbon 
footprint for each of our products. These efforts aim to enhance our understanding of the potential environmental 
and societal impacts of our products.

tracking action items related to workplace incidents, potential hazards, or near-miss events. The ‘See & Act’ 
programme fosters a safety culture by engaging shop floor workers and empowering them to address unsafe acts. 
Achieving Zero Lost Time Injuries is a primary safety goal, maintained at all sites through a focus on preventive 
actions. The EHS Cultural Excellence programme offers a framework for safe and healthy workforces, covering 
ergonomics, industrial hygiene, process hazard management, ventilation, static management, combustible 
dust management, safety training, and health and wellness programmes. Progress is regularly audited against 
these criteria.

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
The entity proactively identifies and mitigates risks through programmes like High Hazard Activity (HHA), Safety 
Hour, and See & Act. The Process Hazard Management workbook addresses process safety risks, while the 
Risk Assessment for Machine (RAM) focuses on machine safety. The Ergonomic Job Risk Analyzer tool targets 
ergonomic risks, and Job Safety Analysis evaluates non-routine activities. These tools are tailored to manage 
different risk types. Actions from these assessments are tracked electronically in the ‘EHS 360’ tool, ensuring 
completion with proper evidence for closure.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, the entity’s EHS cultural acceleration programme encourages employees to create safe environments, 
understand and mitigate risks, adhere to safety practices, and comfortably raise concerns. The ‘See & Act’ 
programme empowers employees to identify unsafe acts and conditions and explore their root causes through 
dialogue. The Guarding Assessment and Prioritization (GAP) tool is implemented at all company sites to assess 
risks to workers from machine hazards. Monthly themes focus on improving EHS categories, while training on 
topics such as fire safety, process safety, behavior-based safety, PPE use, first aid, and machine safety enhances 
competencies. These efforts have led to achieving EHS metrics.
 	
d.	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
Yes, all our manufacturing facilities are equipped with fully functional Occupational Health centers that are

Our supply chain risk assessment process focuses on higher-risk suppliers but is applicable to all. It starts with a 
self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) to evaluate compliance with our Supplier Responsibility Code (SRC). 3M may 
follow up with virtual or on-site assessments. Any identified deficiencies are addressed through the SRC Corrective 
Action Preventive Action (CAPA) process, potentially involving further audits. If a supplier fails to resolve issues, the 
CAPA process escalates to the Responsible Sourcing Supplier Issue Escalation process. If problems persist, a cross-
functional team will explore alternative solutions.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
We regularly engage with stakeholders to gather insights on economic, environmental, and social issues, which are 
integrated into 3M India's Board-level discussions. Business and functional heads present developments, challenges, 
and feedback during Board meetings, allowing for strategic guidance and action recommendations. The Stakeholders 
Relationship Committee handles shareholder and investor matters, the CSR Committee oversees CSR initiatives, 
and the Risk Management Committee manages business risks, including ESG topics. Additionally, the India ESG 
Council at a management level focuses on ESG topics, aligning stakeholder concerns with 3M’s global priorities and 
communicating updates to the Board for decision-making.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Our plants are situated near rural communities, enabling us to build strong relationships with local authorities to 
effectively address environmental and social challenges. We design CSR programmes to align with community needs, 
such as our community water resilience initiative in water-stressed villages of Shirur Taluk, where our manufacturing site 
is located. Through hydrogeological studies, we identified villages suitable for watershed management interventions, 
involving site visits and discussions with local authorities and farmers to prioritise these efforts.
Furthermore, we launched the 3M Wonder Tinkering Lab (STEM) initiative in 10 schools in Ahmedabad, near our 
manufacturing site. Schools were chosen based on recommendations from district education authorities and interviews 
with school management regarding available facilities. We actively gather feedback from school management to 
enhance infrastructure. In FY 24-25, we responded to feedback from Pune schools by installing solar-powered 
systems for uninterrupted power supply, while in Bengaluru, we addressed water scarcity by implementing rainwater 
harvesting systems.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/
marginalised stakeholder groups.
For communities, in 2024, 3M India launched the "We Are All Us" programme, dedicated to supporting gender and sexual 
minority communities. This initiative features a Community Resource Center (Help Desk) that offers a safe haven and a 
comprehensive suite of services focused on social security, economic independence, healthcare, and self-identity. The 
Community Resource Center acts as a central hub where individuals can access vital services and participate in activities 
designed to enhance their overall well-being. The programme currently supports over 5,000 community members.
3M India supports its employee population and builds community through Employee Resource Networks (ERNs), 
which are voluntary and open to all.  These networks foster connections, promote cultural celebrations, and play an 
important role in supporting 3M India’s community giving and volunteerism initiatives. The ERNs include - 3M India 
Women's Leadership Forum, 3M India Pride, Diverse Abilities Network and New Employee Opportunity Network.

Outcome of the initiative
4.
Implemented a 
water management 
programme focused 
on enhancing water 
availability, supporting 
local communities, and 
building long-term water 
resilience.
As a part of a pilot initiated in FY 23–24, 
3M India implemented watershed 
development and rainwater harvesting 
interventions in Kendur using a ridge-
to-valley approach. Structures such 
as contour trenches, sunken ponds, 
check dams, and gabion barriers were 
constructed to capture monsoon runoff 
and enhance groundwater recharge. In 
FY 24–25, these efforts began showing 
tangible impact—improving water 
availability for agriculture during dry 
spells and enabling the local community to 
manage water resources more sustainably.
• The project has positively 
impacted approximately 1,100 
households and over 4,800 people 
in Kendur village, providing 
them with a more reliable water 
source for farming, drinking, and 
domestic use.
• The project has created long-term 
water resilience in the region by 
establishing systems that manage 
water resources more effectively, 
reducing dependence on erratic 
rainfall patterns.
