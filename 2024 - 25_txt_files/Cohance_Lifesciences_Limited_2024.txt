1.
Energy 
Management 
and GHG 
Emission
Risk
The pharmaceutical industry 
contributes to global GHG 
emissions due to its energy-
intensive 
processes 
leading 
to 
climate 
change 
and 
environmental 
degradation. 
Government and regulatory 
bodies 
are 
increasingly 
implementing stricter emissions 
regulations, which can lead to 
fines and penalties.
To 
mitigate 
this 
risk, 
the 
Company engages in numerous 
initiatives to lower Greenhouse 
Gas emissions and efficiently 
manage energy consumption. 
These 
efforts 
encompass 
various projects such as the 
installation of on-site solar 
power 
generation 
systems, 
the substitution of outdated 
machinery with energy-efficient 
alternatives, the exchange of 
CFL bulbs for LED lights, and 
the integration of cutting-edge 
technologies, among others.

2.
Water & 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical component 
in pharmaceutical, used for 
various 
purposes 
such 
as 
cleaning, 
formulation, 
and 
quality control and any issues 
with water quality can lead 
to 
product 
contamination. 
Pharmaceutical companies are 
subject to strict regulations 
regarding water usage, waste 
disposal, and environmental 
protection.
The Company has implemented 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
program, 
which 
aims 
at 
eliminating liquid waste from 
operations. 
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
a 
waste 
management 
system 
and 
protocol that aligns with Local 
Regulations at all of its facilities, 
aimed 
at 
minimizing 
risks. 
Right from the inception, the 
Company places emphasis on 
the 
meticulous 
segregation 
of various waste categories at 
their point of origin.

Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Opportunity
In the pharmaceutical industry, 
ensuring 
product 
quality 
and safety holds significant 
importance. The Company is 
certified to ISO standards (i.e., 
ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 
45001) to maintain consistent 
and 
controlled 
production 
process in accordance with 
quality standards. Additionally, 
the Company employs efficient 
Quality Management Systems 
to oversee and regulate quality 
throughout every phase of 
product 
development 
and 
manufacturing.

Labor Practices
Opportunity
The 
Company 
maintains 
favourable 
labour 
practices 
to draw and retain talented 
professionals in a competitive 
job landscape. It additionally 
acknowledges 
and 
compensates 
exceptional 
employee 
accomplishments 
with 
diverse 
incentives, 
bonuses, 
and 
recognition 
initiatives.
The Company has established 
and 
enforced 
rigorous 
safety 
protocols 
within 
its

Materials 
Sourcing & 
Efficiency
Risk
The Company depends on 
import for KSM and APIs, 
delay in sourcing materials or 
production can lead to project 
delays 
for 
pharmaceutical 
companies that are relying 
on Company’s services. These 
delays strain client relationships, 
lead to loss of business, and 
harm the Company’s reputation 
within the industry.
To 
mitigate 
the 
risk, 
the 
Company 
regularly 
assesses 
supplier capabilities, financial 
stability, 
and 
contingency 
plans to ensure their ability to 
meet demands even during 
unforeseen circumstances.
Negative
6.
Occupational 
Health and 
safety
Risk
As a responsible corporate 
citizen, 
it 
is 
Company’s 
prerogative to maintain a safe 
working environment that is 
free of injuries, accidents, and 
fatalities.
Poor occupational health and 
safety can negatively impact 
labour costs through labour 
productivity. Further, any gaps 
in meeting Health & Safety (HS) 
regulatory standards can lead 
to penal actions.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details:
	
Yes, the Company recognizes the vital importance of reducing GHG emissions not only for the sustainability of our operations 
but also for the larger environmental impact. We have actively invested in renewable energy projects and installed rooftop 
and ground-mounted solar plants of 3.05 MW at various sites. We have also conducted biomass co-firing trials in our process 
boilers for steam generation. Our projects also involve optimizing energy efficiency across operations and implemented 
the following:
•	
Installed auto on/ off switch with temperature controller for cooling towers,
•	
Installed the Flash steam recovery system and reused the flash steam as a heating utility for the methanol 
distillation column,
•	
Dry vacuum pumps for the O-Xylene distillation process to replace the steam consumption
•	
Installed VFDs for the cooling tower fans to reduce the speed based on the temperature set point
•	
Replaced conventional lights with LED lights
•	
Replaced old and Rewind motors with High-efficiency motors, etc.
•	
Replacement of conventional utility of Unit-1 with high energy efficient chiller & air compressor
•	
Energy Recovery from Air compressors
•	
Existing Aluminium fans to be replaced with high energy-efficient cooling fans
•	
Auto tube cleaning system for the Chiller Condensers

Replacement of the IE-2 Motors & Re-wounded motors with IE-3 Motors
•	
Replacement of conventional vacuum pumps (water steam Jet) with dry screw vacuum pumps
•	
Replacing of steam purging hot water system to Skid mounted (PHE) hot water systems
	
Through regular Energy Audits and assessments, we identify areas of improvement and implement energy-efficient 
technologies and practices which will also help in reducing our GHG emissions.
