#Shares means equity shares
*Though, the Company holds 100% equity share capital in Religare Capital Markets Limited (“RCML”), in the present scenario controlling through 
voting rights of RCML is not there with the Company. Besides this, the tripartite agreement entered, in financial year 2011-12, between REL, RCML 
and RHC Holding Private Limited (“RHCHPL”), an erstwhile promoter group company for providing financial support to RCML by RHCHPL (by 
subscribing preference Shares of RCML), severe long-term restrictions and significant restrictive covenants on major decision making at RCML 
were imposed by the holder of preference shares. Accordingly in view of the above, the financial statements of RCML and its subsidiaries have 
been excluded from the consolidated financial statements of the Company w.e.f. October 01, 2011, in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards. The Company has already provided fully for the entire investment made by it into RCML in previous years.

1
Resource 
Management
O
By 
adopting 
responsible 
resource 
management practices, REL can conduct 
its activities in a manner that blends 
financial 
prosperity 
with 
environmental 
consciousness and social responsibility. 
Through careful management of resources 
like waste reduction, water conservation, and 
energy efficiency, the Company will not only 
cut costs significantly but also strengthen its 
business practices in a sustainable manner
-
Positive: By optimising resource usage, REL minimises 
waste disposal costs and conserves resources, 
resulting in long-term cost savings. In reducing its 
operational energy footprint, optimising consumption 
and managing resources responsibly, the Company 
not only induces cost savings but enhances its brand 
reputation. This, in turn, strengthens the positioning 
of 
its 
subsidiaries, 
attracting 
environmentally 
conscious customers and investors and potentially 
increasing market share and profitability across the 
group.
2
Branding and 
Reputation
O
Branding and reputation are key to REL and 
provide the Company an opportunity to 
enhance customer loyalty, build confidence 
in the market, and gain competitive edge for 
subsidiaries.
As the Company focuses on improving its 
brand image, it will be able to further solidify 
its position as a sustainable organisation, 
drawing in the attention of investors, socially 
responsible 
customers 
(for 
Company 
subsidiaries) and ESG rating agencies.
-
Positive: By promoting a strong brand and corporate 
reputation, REL enhances stakeholder trust and 
supports its subsidiaries in expanding their market 
presence and revenue potential.
Good branding and reputation enable REL to 
enhance its market share and earn greater revenue.
3
Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion 
(DEI)
O
It is pertinent for REL to tap into the vast 
potential of diversity and inclusion to 
improve its overall performance and boost 
innovation.
A workforce that is socially, culturally and 
economically diverse not only aids with 
attracting and retaining talent but is also 
critical in enhancing brand reputation. 
By prioritising a diverse workforce, REL 
enhances its market outreach, connecting 
with more varied customer segments.
-
Positive: DEI can help enhance REL’s overall 
group performance through enhanced employee 
productivity, satisfaction and retention across its 
subsidiaries.

Human Capital 
Development
R/O
Risk:
Being in competitive financial services, 
human capital is the most valued asset 
for the Company. Hence, the challenge of 
attracting and retaining skilled employees is 
most pertinent for the continued growth and 
success of the Company.
Opportunity: 
Human 
Capital 
Development 
presents 
itself as an opportunity for REL since an 
investment of resources in this direction can 
further enhance employee productivity and 
efficiency.
Furthermore, a workforce that is consistently 
provided with the requisite trainings is bound 
to be more adaptable to changing business 
environment. This is critical with respect 
to employees being prepared to face any 
challenges in the future.
REL 
is 
committed 
to 
the 
continuous upskilling and re-
skilling of its employees. Health 
and safety training is delivered 
through health and wellness 
webinars, featuring esteemed 
experts in their respective fields. 
Similarly, 
skill 
development 
training sessions are conducted 
regularly to ensure professional 
growth. 
The 
Company 
also 
conducts periodic performance 
reviews and feedback sessions 
to boost employee morale and 
enhance job satisfaction.
Negative: Proactive talent management programs 
are crucial to lower recruitment and training costs. 
Appropriate skill development of the workforce 
is critical in minimising errors and associated 
costs. These measures collectively enhance REL’s 
operational efficiency.
Positive: REL can enhance its efficiency through 
the retention of a highly skilled and experienced 
workforce leading to reduced cost.
Managers 
support 
employee 
development 
by 
exposing them to new domains, cross-functional 
initiatives, and complex assignments in collaboration 
with professional firms. These experiences broaden 
knowledge 
and 
deepen 
technical 
expertise. 
Additionally, curated training programs enhance 
efficiency and workplace performance.
5
Financial 
Inclusion
O
Investment 
companies 
such 
as 
REL 
can 
bolster 
entrepreneurship, 
foster 
job 
growth, 
and 
stimulate 
economic 
advancement in marginalized communities 
through investments in financial inclusion 
endeavours. Such investments not only yield 
financial returns but also deliver substantial 
social benefits, meeting the rising desire for 
socially responsible investment options.
Underserved communities often exist in 
growing markets with promising prospects. 
Investing in financial inclusion prospects 
in these areas also opens new paths for 
growth and expands investment horizons 
geographically.
-
Positive: 
Financial 
inclusion 
presents 
several 
opportunities before REL such as enhanced brand 
reputation and access to untapped markets which 
help diversify revenue streams.
6
Sustainable and 
Responsible 
Financing
O
By taking sustainability and ESG factors into 
account while making investment decisions, 
REL can generate extra revenue streams 
through innovative sustainable financial 
products offered through subsidiary entities.
Furthermore, sustainable and responsible 
financing 
initiatives 
can 
improve 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
and 
strengthen relationships with all relevant 
stakeholders. This can help REL better assess 
and manage risks associated with ESG.
-
Positive: REL can benefit immensely from sustainable 
and responsible financing since the consideration 
of ESG factors can optimise financing in companies 
with potential ESG risks.

Regulatory 
Compliance 
and Risk 
Management
R/O
Risk: Businesses must adhere to a diverse 
array of laws and regulations across local, 
national and global jurisdictions. Regulatory 
compliance 
aids 
REL 
in 
recognising, 
evaluating and mitigating an array of risks 
spanning legal, financial, operational, and 
reputational realms. Demonstrating a robust 
record of compliance can draw in investors 
and 
collaborators, 
fostering 
heightened 
confidence and allegiance.
Opportunity: Regulatory compliance and risk 
management builds trust with stakeholders. 
By adhering to regulations, REL can protect its 
reputation and financial stability. Moreover, 
proactive risk management enables the 
Company to identify potential threats and 
mitigate them before they escalate, ensuring 
operational continuity.
REL has implemented adequate 
internal controls systems to 
ensure adherence to applicable 
laws, 
rules 
and 
regulations, 
which are commensurate with 
the size, scale and complexity of 
its operations. Internal controls 
of the Company encompass 
documented policies, standard 
operating procedures, approval/
authorization matrix, circulars 
and risk & control matrices 
for 
ensuring 
the 
systematic 
and efficient conduct of its 
business & support functions, 
the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of 
frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and 
completeness 
of 
the 
accounting records and timely 
preparation of reliable financial 
information for the stakeholders.
Negative: By not complying with regulatory standards, 
REL may have to face expensive interruptions to 
business operations. Fines or penalties may also be 
levied on account of non-compliance.
Positive: Adherence to regulations aids companies in 
avoiding penalties and maintaining a good standing 
with regulatory bodies, which further translates 
into financial savings. Additionally, effective risk 
management helps in identifying and mitigating 
potential 
threats, 
reducing 
the 
likelihood 
of 
disruptions and associated costs.
These subsequently lead to enhanced reputation 
and access to capital.
8
Corporate 
Governance
R/O
Risk: Compliance with ethical standards 
protects companies from legal sanctions, 
fines and penalties, as well as reputational 
damage, business interruptions, and a loss 
of trust.
Opportunity: Companies stand to benefit 
immensely 
from 
strong 
corporate 
governance 
since 
possessing 
robust 
governance frameworks exhibit superior 
management, transparency and resilience 
against mismanagement, thereby potentially 
increasing shareholder value and lowering 
investment risk.
A 
robust 
system 
for 
whistleblowing and addressing 
grievances has been established 
alongside creating awareness 
and imparting periodic trainings 
to 
internal 
stakeholders 
on 
ethical business practices.
Adequate internal controls are 
in place to ensure monitoring 
and adherence to applicable 
compliances.
Negative: Corporate governance is critical to efficient 
business functioning today. Non-compliances may 
lead to financial penalties, fines and reputational 
damage.
Positive: 
Responsible 
corporate 
governance 
measures bolster investor confidence and trust, 
attracting a larger investor base and fostering 
long-term shareholder value. Additionally, robust 
corporate governance practices lead to better 
decision-making, strategic planning, and operational 
efficiency, ultimately driving improved financial 
performance.

Cybersecurity 
and Data 
Privacy
R
As a Company with multiple subsidiaries, 
it is pertinent for REL to protect employee 
and any other confidential data. Additionally, 
since the Company’s subsidiaries deal 
with 
customer/client 
data, 
prioritising 
cybersecurity and data privacy aids REL to 
manage cyber risks and safeguard sensitive 
data.
REL has implemented robust 
information security systems 
and protocols to oversee the 
handling of sensitive customer 
data.
Employees are also educated on 
privacy policies and information 
security 
protocols 
governing 
the proper access, usage, and 
disclosure of personal data.
REL has also established an 
IT 
Strategy 
committee 
to 
oversee upgrades and strategic 
initiatives, besides periodically 
conducting information security 
audits.
Negative: Data breaches and cyber-attacks may 
result in substantial financial losses. These losses 
may include direct costs such as incident response, 
legal fees, regulatory fines, and compensation for 
affected parties. Indirect costs may also arise from 
reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and 
decreased market value.
10
Responsible 
Investment
R/O
Risk: Investing holds potential for growth 
and profit, yet it carries diverse risks that 
core investment firms such as REL must 
prudently address to safeguard their capital 
and attain investment goals. The outcomes 
of investments are unpredictable, with 
no assured returns. Economic downturns, 
disruptions in industries, or unforeseen 
occurrences 
can 
detrimentally 
affect 
investment values. Additionally, alterations in 
regulations might influence the profitability 
of specific investments or introduce new 
compliance obligations.
Opportunity: REL can achieve substantial 
growth by selecting high-quality investments 
and managing risks effectively.
In 
navigating 
investment 
complexities, 
REL 
adopts 
a 
diversified 
approach. 
By 
spreading investments across 
various assets, REL mitigates 
risks associated with economic 
shifts, industry disruptions, or 
regulatory changes. This strategy 
ensures resilience in the face 
of uncertainties, safeguarding 
REL's capital and investment 
objectives.
Negative: Underperforming investments or losses can 
directly impact REL's profitability, potentially eroding 
its reputation and undermining client trust. Regulatory 
violations can also tarnish REL's reputation, eroding 
investor confidence and potentially leading to client 
withdrawals or reluctance to engage with the firm. 
Additionally, market volatility, currency fluctuations, 
and interest rate changes can compound the 
challenges of managing investments, making it more 
difficult for REL to achieve its financial objectives and 
maintain investor trust.
Positive: By selecting high-quality investments and 
managing risks adeptly, REL can potentially increase 
profitability. Consistent positive returns can enhance 
REL's reputation, attracting investors while retaining 
existing ones. Diversification across different asset 
classes and geographies can mitigate risks and 
contribute to more stable portfolio performance. 
Moreover, staying informed about market trends 
and innovative investment strategies can create 
opportunities for long-term growth.

The identification of material topics enables REL to prioritize issues critical to its long-term success and sustainability and 
formulate strategies accordingly. This ensures efficient resource allocation to areas with the greatest impact. Materiality 
assessments also reveal potential risks and opportunities associated with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
factors, enabling organisations to remain responsive to stakeholder expectations. By focusing on key material topics, 
Companies can make more informed and effective choices, leading to better outcomes and avoiding dilution of efforts on 
less critical issues. 
	
Keeping these factors into consideration, REL has conducted a Risk Assessment process in collaboration with its internal 
stakeholders. In today’s dynamic environment, the Company plans to build on this foundation by engaging in further 
stakeholder consultations and conducting in-depth research to identify the most relevant ESG issues as it continues 
moving forward in its ESG journey.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
REL has implemented a Human Rights policy aimed at fostering socio-economic empowerment through inclusive growth. 
The policy establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that all employees and associates are treated with respect 
and dignity. It encompasses a set of principles guiding the Company’s business practices upholding human rights, preventing 
violations, and abstaining from any involvement in human rights abuses. REL strives to promote the universal recognition 
of fundamental human rights and the widespread implementation of this policy. Addressing grievances promptly and in 
a culturally appropriate manner is a core commitment. The Company tries to ensure positive legal compliance with all 
applicable legal and constitutional laws and considers interaction with relevant stakeholders on human rights concerns as 
an important practice. REL is committed to ensuring that no unlawful practices are followed that violate the dignity and the 
basic human rights of its employees and associates and prohibits all forms of child/forced labour and human trafficking. The 
Company aims to create a safe and healthy workplace and respects the right of all workers to form and join a trade union 
of their choice without fear of intimidation or reprisal, in accordance with national law. REL also maintains a firm stance with 
respect to prohibition of any contribution to armed conflict or human rights abuses in conflict-affected and high-risk areas. 
	
The Group Head of Human Resources is responsible for investigating and resolving employee concerns, responding 
appropriately, and taking corrective measures in case of violations. No reprisal or retaliatory action can be taken against 
any employee for raising concerns under this policy. REL’s guiding principle is to uphold the highest standards, particularly 
in cases where national laws differ from international human rights norms. During conflicts, the Company aims to adhere 
to national law, while seeking ways to respect international human rights to the greatest extent possible.

Yes, the Company has a duly documented business continuity and disaster management plan to manage any untoward 
incident and at the organizational level. The Company has documented Risk Control Matrices (RCMs), which categorize 
controls as either preventive or detective in relation to risk. Assessing and documenting risks are integral parts of the business 
planning and evaluation process. Identifying specific control activities at the process level is crucial for implementing 
effective detective or preventive controls that address associated risks. These controls undergo further scrutiny as part of 
ongoing monitoring activities. The Business Continuity Plan emphasizes operational readiness from alternative locations 
and supports REL's mandate on Business Continuity Management (BCM), aimed at enhancing the company's resilience. 
As a Core Investment Company, REL does not engage in direct business operations, so its IT service continuity plan / 
business continuity plan primarily focuses on managing its information technology framework, including information 
and communication systems, in case of any catastrophe. REL takes a comprehensive approach to IT service continuity, 
incorporating multiple layers of protection.
	
Specific conditions such as network outages, blackouts, external factors like terrorist attacks, civil unrest, natural disasters
