1   A fine of Rs. 11,800 (including GST) was levied by both BSE and NSE for delayed disclosure of the record 
date for dividend under Regulation 42(3) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. The company has paid the 
fines and informed both exchanges on 14th September 2024. 
 
2  There was a delay in disclosure of the record date and non-compliance with the prescribed gap between 
two record dates under Regulation 42(3)/(4) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. BSE and NSE levied a 
fine of Rs. 11,800 (including GST) each, communicated via email on 14th October 2024. The company 
provided clarification and paid the fines on 15th October 2024. The deviation was due to an inadvertent

committed to ensuring timely compliance going forward.

reporting year, the majority of our cotton seeds were sourced from certified sustainable sources such as Better 
Cotton, Global Recycled Standard, and Regenagri Organic. We work closely with thousands of farmers across 
hundreds of villages, supporting them through capacity-building initiatives. Additionally, we source yarns made 
from recycled and alternative natural fibers and cotton. Overall, 45.00% of our raw materials this year came 
from responsible sources.

PRINCIPLE 4:  Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its 
stakeholders 
 
 
➢ 
This principle emphasizes that Organisation must go beyond serving investors and customers - and recognize their 
broader impact on society, natural resources, and communities. 
➢ 
For a Company engaged in Cotton, Yarn, and Agri-Commodity sectors, this includes responsibility toward: 
• 
Farmers and Suppliers involved in sourcing raw materials 
• 
Local Communities affected by agricultural and manufacturing activities 
• 
Natural Ecosystems such as land, water, and biodiversity 
• 
Workers and Trade Partners across the value chain 
➢ 
The principle calls for identifying all relevant stakeholders, understanding their expectations, and integrating these 
insights into business strategies. It ensures that the benefits of operations are shared equitably, adverse impacts are 
minimized, and grievances are addressed transparently and fairly. 
Essential Indicators 
1. Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who are affected by, or have an influence on, the Company’s business 
operations and projects. Among them, key stakeholders are those who either significantly impact the business or 
are substantially affected by it, and contribute to the Company’s value creation. 
Key stakeholders typically include, but are not limited to: employees, shareholders/investors, distributors, 
customers, channel partners, research analysts, vendors, suppliers, regulators, and government agencies. 
The identification process is qualitative in nature, carried out through cross-functional consultations and feedback 
involving relevant departments. It is guided by inputs from Senior Management and the Board, ensuring a well-
rounded understanding of stakeholder relevance, influence, and expectations. 
2. List stakeholder groups identified as key for your entity and the frequency of engagement with each stakeholder

Leadership Indicators 
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
At ACL, we recognize that ongoing engagement with key stakeholders is vital for shaping effective strategy and 
driving sustainable performance. Our executives and functional heads regularly engage with stakeholders across 
various platforms to gather meaningful feedback. 
This input is periodically consolidated and presented to the Board of Directors and relevant Committees for 
review and strategic consideration. Insights gained from these consultations inform policy updates and business 
decisions, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations and reinforcing ACL’s commitment to long-term 
value creation in line with its business goals. 
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
 No 
 
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
ACL remains dedicated to engaging with and addressing the concerns of vulnerable and marginalized 
stakeholder groups. Through our CSR activities, we collaborate with non-governmental organizations to better 
understand community needs and shape our CSR strategy accordingly. We maintain open communication 
channels and take timely action to support these groups, ensuring no one is overlooked.

PRINCIPLE 5: Businesses should respect and promote human rights 
 
This principle is grounded in the belief that human rights are inherent, non-negotiable, and must never be compromised 
for business interests. According to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, businesses have a 
responsibility to respect human rights, prevent violations related to their operations, and take appropriate action if 
violations occur. 
There are five core elements to this Principle as below: 
➢ 
The company’s governance must ensure that employees and partners are informed about human rights as outlined in 
the Indian Constitution, relevant national laws, and the International Bill of Rights. Appropriate authorities should be 
designated to address potential human rights impacts. 
➢ 
The organization should implement clear policies, structures, and procedures to identify, prevent, and mitigate any 
human rights risks associated with its operations. 
➢ 
When human rights issues arise, the company must respond effectively with corrective measures to resolve them and 
prevent recurrence. 
➢ 
The business should conduct awareness and educational programs across its value chain to inform employees and 
partners about human rights, potential violations, and responsible practices. 
➢ 
An accessible and effective grievance redressal mechanism must be in place, allowing affected individuals and 
communities to raise concerns and seek remedies.

as excessive use of agrochemicals, overextraction of water, and soil degradation. These practices can contaminate 
freshwater sources, harm biodiversity, and adversely affect the health of farmers and surrounding communities. 
 
To mitigate these impacts, we have actively engaged with farmers to promote sustainable agricultural practices. We 
conduct seminars and training programs focused on organic farming and provide ongoing guidance and education 
to encourage environmentally responsible methods of cotton cultivation.

PRINCIPLE 9:  Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a 
responsible manner  
 
➢ 
As the core elements of Principle 9 include the company should minimize and mitigate any adverse impact of its 
goods and services on consumers, the natural environment and society at large, the company may give title of the 
policy relevant for Consumer Value Development. 
➢ 
This Principle is related to the concept that the primary purpose of the business enterprise is to create wealth by 
producing quality products, or delivering services to the targeted customer, and keeping them satisfied to mutually 
benefit both the parties. 
➢ 
The principle comprehends that the customer has a freedom of choice of the products and services, and hence the 
organisations will put their efforts to provide quality at affordable and reasonable process, that are easy to use and 
dispose of. 
➢ 
It also aligns with the UN SDG-12 for responsible consumption and production, when is expects the business 
organisations to educate, make information available to the customers about the impacts of excessive usage of the 
products to their well-being, and to the society or the planet. 
 
Following are elements for this principle as below: 
a. Organisations should put in their efforts to reduce the negative impacts of their products and services on 
consumers, natural environment, and society at large. 
b. When conceptualizing, designing, and marketing their products, the organisation should not, in any manner, 
prevent the freedom of choice and fair competition. 
c. The organisation should transparently and accurately disclose all kinds of adverse impacts to the user, planet, 
society, on the biodiversity from their products. This may be done by labelling, marketing, or by providing 
information on their social media platforms. 
 
Essential Indicators
