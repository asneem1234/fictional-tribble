2025 - Where AI Meets Human Experience
A revolution that will redefine the world’s economic 
order is underway. Much like smartphones, which are 
an inseparable part of our daily lives, AI will soon play 
a fundamental role in every wake of human economic 
activity. At R Systems, we see this transformation not 
as a distant future but as today’s reality, where AI is 
amplifying human capabilities and enhancing all 
human experiences. 
The dawn of Agentic AI marks a pivotal moment in 
technology history. Beyond simply responding to 
commands, AI now anticipates needs, learns from 
interactions and adapts to human behaviors with 
remarkable precision. This evolution fundamentally 
changes how we build digital products, shifting from 
mere functionality to genuine human connection. 
The AI landscape continues to evolve rapidly with 
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-o4, Claude, 
Gemini, and Llama leading broader adoption across 
industries. We recognize that different use cases require 
different approaches. While LLMs excel at general 
knowledge tasks, Small Language Models (SLMs) offer 
greater efficiency and focus for 
specialized applications. Our expertise spans the full 
spectrum of AI models, allowing us to match the right 
technology to each client’s unique requirements. 
The foundation of effective AI implementation lies in 
data quality and preparation. Through our work with 
clients across sectors, we have developed robust 
methodologies for data preprocessing, cleaning, 
and enrichment that address the critical “garbage in, 
garbage out” challenge facing many AI initiatives. Our 
approach includes sophisticated techniques for handling 
unstructured data, enabling previously impossible 
insights from documents, images, and 
audio sources. 
Organizations across both traditional industries and 
digital-native sectors are navigating this AI transition 
with common universal concerns. Regardless of 
industry or maturity, successful AI implementation 
requires data readiness, appropriate tooling selection, 
and clear business case focus. These fundamentals 
determine whether AI initiatives deliver sustainable 
value or become expensive experiments. 
Organizations that address these essentials 
systematically build competitive advantages, while those 
that overlook them risk falling behind regardless of their 
size or technical sophistication. 
AI is also profoundly accelerating digital product 
engineering, compressing development timelines while 
expanding creative possibilities. Tasks that once 
required weeks are now completed in days or hours, 
allowing teams to iterate faster and deliver more 
sophisticated solutions. This acceleration forces 
organizations to rethink traditional constraints around 
product development cycles. Engineering teams 
empowered with AI tools can explore more design 
alternatives, catch issues earlier, and create experiences 
that adapt to user needs with greater precision. The 
result is a fundamental shift in both what digital 
products can achieve and how quickly they reach users. 
What makes this moment unique is how AI is becoming 
the invisible orchestrator of human experiences. When 
we developed a GenAI-powered Q&A system for a 
mental health platform, the result was more than its 
efficient 24/7 support. The real value was realized 
through a 40% growth in user engagement and its more 
meaningful therapeutic interactions. As we progress 
through 2025, companies that flourish will be those
that leverage AI’s capabilities while maintaining a human-
centric focus. This means developing
interfaces that feel intuitive and natural, automating 
processes that free people for more creative work,
and ensuring technology serves human values rather 
than the reverse. 
R Systems is at a unique advantage in guiding its clients 
through this AI revolution. Our AI-Automation First 
methodology and growing portfolio of successful 
implementations demonstrate our commitment to this 
vision. Embedding intelligence into every layer of digital 
products and the process of creating them, we are 
delivering experiences that make technology more 
accessible, efficient and perceptive. 
While there is significant excitement about the future 
possibilities, the road ahead requires thoughtful 
navigation. AI regulation, data privacy, and ethical 
considerations must guide implementation. Our approach 
factors these elements into every solution, ensuring AI 
serves as a tool for human advancement rather than 
replacement. As AI continues its rapid evolution, we are 
leveraging its abilities to create digital products that 
make technology more intuitive, personal, and impactful 
for everyone who uses it. The future we envision will see 
AI enriching the human experience for builders and users 
of technology alike.

Director’s Letter
Throughout my career in technology, one belief 
has remained constant-the fundamental purpose of 
technology is to elevate human experience. Never has 
this been more evident than with artificial intelligence. 
What began as an exciting possibility has rapidly 
integrated into the fabric of our daily lives, 
transforming how we interact with technology and 
with each other. 
The past year has witnessed a remarkable 
acceleration in AI adoption. Our journey with clients 
has evolved from cautious exploration, “Can AI really 
do this?” and “How much of this can be done with AI?” 
to confident implementation, “Can you deliver this with 
AI, in less time?” This shift reflects a maturing 
understanding of AI’s capabilities and its role in 
enhancing human potential. 
This evolution is visible in our work across industries. 
A leading Swiss chemical company faced challenges 
with knowledge accessibility across its organization. 
Our AI assistant reduced search time by up to 30% 
and improved client satisfaction by 15%. The system 
excels where human abilities are limited, handling 
complex data formats while freeing specialists to focus 
on applying insights rather than searching for them. 
Similarly, in healthcare, we developed a mental health 
platform utilizing GenAI for 24/7 support. This solution 
increased user engagement by 40% while reducing 
response times by 25%-30%. GenAI is complementing 
therapists’ work by handling routine inquiries while 
enabling professionals to dedicate more time to 
personalized therapeutic interactions. 
Our OptimaAI platform has become the core of our AI 
offering, with remarkable uplift this year.
R Systems has delivered over 120 AI projects including 
proof of concepts that have significantly impacted 
clients’ operational metrics and has also established 
proof of concepts on many industry-specific 
applications. AI is accelerating the entire software 
development life cycle, from requirements analysis to 
deployment and maintenance. This acceleration 
particularly helps clients expedite their digital product 
engineering, enabling faster creation and delivery of 
innovative solutions. For our clients, this translates to 
quicker implementation of new features and 
accelerated adoption of emerging technologies. 
Through these implementations, we have refined our 
approach to AI adoption. Our client conversations 
consistently highlight three key pillars that determine 
successful AI implementation. 
•	
First, know your objectives and plan your ROI 
before diving in. A global media client needed to 
scale production knowledge across its worldwide 
talent pool. Our team created a multilingual 
creative knowledge hub that expanded beyond its 
	
initial scope to support content in multiple 
languages and roles, leading to improved creator 
onboarding and consistent production quality 
across regions. 
•	
Second, understand which AI approach suits
	
your specific needs. For an educational 
technology provider, what started as a request
	
for topic-wise video segmentation evolved intoa 
comprehensive AI-powered video intelligence 
suite. This solution includes features such as 
AI-generated summaries, avatar-based content 
delivery, and interactive learning tools that 
significantly enhance user engagement and 
learning outcomes. 
•	
Third, remember that AI without proper data lacks 
any value. In the relocation and logistics domain, 
our team built an AI Policy Benchmarking tool 
that allowed HR teams to query and compare 
company policies using natural language. This 
LLM-based solution boosted workflow efficiency 
by 60-70% and reduced decision time by 55%, all 
while maintaining strict data governance standards. 
R Systems takes a distinct approach to AI services 
through three interconnected strategies. We offer 
a holistic portfolio that integrates data platforms, 
computer vision capabilities, and AI services, 
recognizing that quality data foundations are 
essential for meaningful AI outcomes. Additionally, we 
incorporate AI throughout all stages of the software 
development life cycle, particularly focused on 
shortening the time-to-market for digital products. This 
integration improves quality, accelerates development 
cycles, and enhances the maintainability of solutions. 
Our work with Agentic AI moves significantly beyond 
basic automation, addressing complex process 
improvements and operational metrics for domain-
specific applications that deliver uniquely tailored 
business value. 
The current macroeconomic uncertainties and 
geopolitical tensions have influenced spending 
patterns across industries. Many organizations have 
become more cautious with discretionary investments, 
carefully evaluating technology initiatives based 
on immediate business impact. This market reality 
requires us to demonstrate even more clearly the 
value proposition and ROI of our solutions. We have 
high conviction in delivering continued value to 
our clients and stepping up to the ever-increasing 
relevance of our digital product engineering services. 
Our talented global teams, trusted client relationships, 
and strategic partnerships position us strongly 
to deliver value at the intersection of AI and 
human experience. I encourage you to review the 
Management’s Strategic Insights section for an 
overview of our performance and strategic direction.

through AI generation 
Our AI-powered testing solutions have 
delivered 30% productivity improvements in 
quality assurance functions through: 
•	
Automated generation of test cases 
covering edge scenarios that human testers 
might overlook
 
•	
Simulation of realistic user behavior patterns 
that identify performance bottlenecks 
•	
Defect prediction and root cause analysis that 
reduces debug time from days to minutes
Cloud security has become fundamental to brand 
reputation and user safety. AI integration creates 
new possibilities for human-centered security that 
anticipates threats before impacting end users. 
For digital product engineering teams, security now 
serves as both an essential requirement and 
a strategic differentiator in market offerings. 
Transformative AI-Powered threat
detection networks 
Advanced machine learning analyzes network 
traffic patterns to identify anomalies that conventional 
systems miss. Our enterprise clients use AI-driven 
analytics to detect potential threats through 
behavioral analysis, critical when monitoring 
infrastructure for subtle attack indicators. This 
capability allows digital product teams 
to build solutions with security
intelligence embedded throughout the
application architecture.
When protection itself becomes a vulnerability 
AI systems introduce unique security challenges. 
Large language models make impersonation 
attacks more convincing, while machine learning 
pipelines create multiple attack surfaces.  
R Systems’ security teams help clients implement 
specialized monitoring tools against these 
emerging threats. Digital product engineers
must now consider these AI-specific security 
vectors during initial design phases rather than
as an afterthought. 
Building human-AI security partnerships 
R Systems security implementations emphasize: 
•	
Clear protocols for human oversight of AI
	
security systems
•	
Structured testing against potential
	
AI manipulation 
•	
Security teams combining data science
	
with traditional security skills 
•	
Targeted training on recognizing
	
AI-generated content 
Our security practice continues expanding its 
capabilities through specialized talent development 
and advanced infrastructure investments, helping 
clients balance technological capability with 
human judgment in cloud security programs. This 
approach enables the creation of digital products 
that proactively protect user data and maintain trust 
throughout their life cycle.
Network defense breakthroughs
A major telecommunications client achieved 
80% accuracy in identifying network issues 
through our AI-based solution. The system 
analyzes real-time video stream data and
network metrics, enabling faster response to 
potential security incidents.

Technology Leadership
In 2024, R Systems reinforced its position as a
digital product engineering partner by scaling 
advanced automation platforms, enhancing 
operational resilience, and investing in security-ﬁrst 
cloud practices. These initiatives address the 
growing demand for agile, maintainable, and 
risk-resilient systems. 
A key enabler of this progress is OptimaAI, our 
enterprise-grade Generative AI suite designed to 
enhance engineering eﬃciency across the software 
development life cycle. It integrates seamlessly into 
enterprise environments, supporting compliance, 
version control, and traceability from the outset. 
Teams utilize OptimaAI for tasks such as code 
generation, automated testing, observability, and 
legacy modernization. Beyond engineering, it also 
augments customer service operations and internal 
workﬂows. As a modular platform, OptimaAI adapts 
to diverse technical stacks and operating models, 
enabling organizations to accelerate development 
while maintaining stability and governance. 
Operational reliability also took center stage. We 
advanced our resilience engineering model by 
combining Chaos Engineering with Disaster 
Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS). Clients in healthcare, 
ﬁnance, and regulated public services were among 
the early adopters. These implementations simulate 
controlled failures, memory leaks, API rate-limit 
breaches, and node outages, and measure recovery 
under stress. These simulations help teams identify 
design weaknesses early, quantify risk in operational 
terms, and implement controls that minimize 
disruption during real incidents. 
Our cloud transformation practice continued to 
deliver in four core domains: infrastructure migration, 
SaaS rollouts, legacy modernization, and integrated 
Cloud-Data-AI solutions. Backed by structured 
FinOps, we have helped clients optimize cloud 
spending and apply usage governance without 
compromising performance. For a global ﬁnancial 
institution, this included workload right-sizing across 
deployments on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, 
supported by automated alerts and usage 
forecasting tied to business cycles. 
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
operates in ﬁve regions with 24/7 incident
response capability. 
Clients continue to seek solutions that are intelligent, 
adaptive, and secure by design. Our investments in 
platform automation, operational resilience, and 
cloud security reﬂect our long-term strategy to meet 
that need across industries and geographies.
In 2024, R Systems advanced its shift toward a 
capability-driven organization by expanding skills 
infrastructure, academic collaboration, and delivery 
scale. These eﬀorts were designed to meet project 
demand and strengthen the systems that enable 
repeatable, high-quality execution across locations 
and technologies. 
One of the year's most strategic steps was the 
establishment of the Center of Excellence on Applied 
AI for Sustainable Systems at IIT Delhi. Developed as 
a long-term partnership, this initiative includes an 
endowed faculty chair, lab infrastructure, and 
scholarships for technical students. It extends our 
innovation ecosystem into the research domain and 
builds a talent pipeline tuned to real-world 
implementation challenges. 
In parallel, internal restructuring shaped a new 
skill-linked job architecture, replacing legacy 
hierarchies with growth paths based on role 
complexity and proﬁciency. This has enabled better
alignment between learning, performance, and 
compensation, particularly for delivery roles and 
engineering specialists. Our delivery network 
continued to expand. New oﬃces in Pune and 
Chennai are now fully operational. In Mexico City, a 
dedicated team serves Spanish-speaking customers 
of North American clients. These locations were 
selected for regional relevance, language 
compatibility, and delivery resilience. 
Across geographies, we continue to deepen 
technical capability through Centers of Excellence 
(COE) in artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud, data, analytics, 
Future-

reusable assets, cross-functional solutions, and client 
accelerators that reduce time-to-market while 
maintaining code integrity and governance. 
With investments in people, partnerships, and 
scalable practices, R Systems remains 
well-positioned to support clients with precision and 
continuity—regardless of market conditions.

Responsibility in Action 
Our corporate social responsibility work in 2024 
emphasized local relevance, sustained engagement, 
and measurable reach. Activities spanned education 
access, healthcare awareness, community 
well-being, and environmental restoration, driven by 
employee participation and non-proﬁt partnerships. 
In education, we partnered with public institutions 
and NGOs to support school upgrades, classroom 
digitization, and scholarship programs. These eﬀorts 
beneﬁted students across India, Southeast Asia, and 
Eastern Europe. Several initiatives focused on 
improving digital readiness and STEM engagement in 
underrepresented groups. 
Environmental projects included tree-planting drives, 
urban clean-up campaigns, and e-waste awareness 
sessions, with employee volunteers participating 
across delivery centers. These events were often 
organized in tandem with local authorities and 
community partners. Our commitment to health 
continued through blood donation camps, preventive 
care screenings, and marathon participation in 
several cities. Many of these eﬀorts were 
employee-initiated and scaled with support from the 
CSR Committee. 
All projects are reviewed and approved under a 
structured governance framework that ensures 
alignment with our values, compliance with local 
regulations, and a clear link between funds deployed 
and outcomes achieved.

A.	
Conservation of Energy
	
Although your Company does not have energy-intensive 
operations, every effort has been made to ensure optimal 
energy usage, avoid wastage, and conserve energy. 
R Systems continuously evaluates new technologies 
and makes appropriate investments to enhance energy 
efficiency. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 
R 
Systems 
adopted 
various 
energy 
conservation 
technologies and measures to reduce energy consumption. 
These included using energy-efficient equipment and 
devices, replacing existing CFL fittings with LED fittings 
to reduce power consumption, and conducting timely 
preventive maintenance of all major and minor equipment.
	
The 
air 
conditioning 
system 
uses

compressors for central air conditioning and split air 
conditioning for localized areas. The Company has 
also converted its diesel generators to dual-fuel-based 
generators at one of its premises. Please refer to the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report for details on energy 
consumption. R Systems is always in search of innovative 
and efficient energy conservation technologies and applies 
them prudently. Being in the software industry, the operations 
of the Company are not energy-intensive, and energy costs 
constitute a small portion of the total cost. Therefore, the 
financial impact of these measures is not material.

A.	
Industry Structure and Developments 
	
As per NASSCOM Annual Strategic Review Report 2025, 
the last year has been a year of strategic resilience for 
India’s IT sector amid shifting global economic patterns 
and evolving market dynamics. The total revenue of IT 
industry in FY 2024-25 was over US$ 282.6 billion. India’s 
ITES sector contributing to more than 58% to the global 
outsourcing market indicates its position as the IT talent 
powerhouse of the world. Segments such as Engineering 
R&D and GCCs (Global Capability Centres), especially in 
services and BPM (Business Process Management) have 
contributed to the domestic IT sector. India is now home to 
over 1750 GCCs which indicates a shift toward high value 
services and advanced product engineering capabilities. 
Digital engineering is increasingly being adopted in BFSI, 
healthcare and retail sectors, with nearly two-thirds of large 
tech deals focused on these transformations. 
	
Further, in CY 2024, the global technology sector entered 
a new era defined by the widespread adoption of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI. AI has transcended 
hype and is delivering measurable operational efficiencies 
across industries.

Enterprise demand for AI-led transformation, cloud migration,

this by expanding its data, AI, and cloud service portfolio.

setting up Global Capability Centres (GCCs), the Company has 
rolled out a dedicated playbook to partner with such GCCs 
either to set up or scale their operations. The Company has 
launched multiple AI-powered platforms such as OptimaAI 
and AI-enabled migration solutions. These have helped 
modernize client applications and positioned R Systems as 
a valued partner for high-tech and next gen services.
	
With the addition of new delivery centre in Mexico, 
R Systems now added the capability to serve clients through 
nearshore models along with onshore and offshore offerings. 
This flexibility enhances service capability, reduces delivery 
risk along with cost efficiencies.

where the Company has no control over outcome. R Systems 
recognizes that business conditions are constantly changing, 
evolving, and entering into cycles. Following is the model adopted 
by the Company for managing risk:
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
Risk management is an integral part of the charter of the Board 
of Directors at R Systems. The Board has constituted the Risk 
Management Committee which is entrusted with the responsibility 
of monitoring risk levels on various parameters and to suggest 
measures to address the same. The day to day management of the 
risk is entrusted to the management team of R Systems. Based on the 
philosophy of “No risks, No rewards”, our management continuously 
keeps monitoring the level of our existence on the path of growth 
and within R Systems management structure, certain personnel are 
designated with responsibility of managing risks including ensuring 
compliance with laws, rules and regulations with the assistance 
of both internal and external resources. Further, formal reporting, 
escalation of risk events and control mechanisms ensure timely 
communication, response and proactive management of the risks.
RISK MANAGEMENT AT R SYSTEMS
1.	
Customer Concentration
	
R Systems revenues are dependent to a considerable extent 
upon relationships with a limited number of customers 
and retaining those customers. The percentage of total 
consolidated revenues during fiscal year 2024 and 2023 
that R Systems derived from contracts with its top line 
customers is as follow:

Concentration of revenues from a limited number of 
customers deepens our relationship with those customers but 
at the same time imposes a risk of dependence. Customer’s 
vendor management strategies and business risks radiate 
on to R Systems through fluctuations in utilization, pricing for 
services and service level demands. All these factors could 
potentially impact revenues and profitability of R Systems.
	
INITIATIVES: The business model and strategy followed by 
R Systems involves serving the customers in a manner that 
they get measurable tangible benefits. When customers see 
value in the services/solutions that R Systems provides, we 
believe that customer’s relationship can be nurtured into 
the long term. Further, with our proactive strategy of adding 
new customers, we attempt to reduce our dependency on a 
smaller number of customer relationships.
2.	
Geographical Concentration
	
R Systems has traditionally derived most of its revenues from 
the North America, given the technology focus and specialized 
outsourced product development services offered by it. The 
geographic break-up of the revenue is given below:

INITIATIVES: In order to mitigate the risk of geographical 
concentration, R Systems has stepped up its business 
activities 
in 
other 
geographic 
areas 
like 
Europe, 
South East Asia etc.
3.	
Risks Associated with Fixed Price Contracts
	
Under our product engineering and digital offerings most 
of our assignments are on the basis of time and material 
task orders, some proportion of the services provided by 
us is in the nature of fixed bid assignments. Under fixed bid 
assignments, in the event of cost overruns, our profitability 
will be adversely affected.
	
INITIATIVES: We have our internal processes to ensure 
accuracy in the estimation of the time required to execute 
fixed price projects, and processes to implement and monitor 
the progress of such projects. Further, the experience 
gained from such projects is also used for new projects. 
However, given the very nature of the fixed price projects, 
cost overruns and delayed deliveries cannot be ruled out.
4.	
Competition
	
The IT & ITES sector is a highly competitive sector. Our 
competitors include IT outsourcing firms in India as well as 
in other countries, national and multinational consulting and 
technology firms, Indian IT services firms, software firms and 
in-house IT departments of large companies. The competition 
in the IT industry is very intense and our competitors are 
aggressive in winning new business and customers that may 
drive a harder bargain
	
INITIATIVES: We believe that R Systems is well positioned 
and enjoys following competitive advantages: 
 
 
Experience in providing end-to-end solutions and 
services to customers; 
 
 
Best 
practices, 
tools 
and 
methodologies 
for 
flawless execution;
 
 
Investment in processes, talent and methodologies;
 
 
Strong customer franchise consisting of large and mid-
sized corporations;
 
 
Strong financial position;
 
 
Proven global delivery model;
 
 
Our vertical focus for services and solutions;
 
 
Industry best human resource practices to attract, 
develop, deploy and retain talent.	
5.	
Disaster Prevention and Recovery
	
The IT industry is very sensitive to security risk and a real 
or perceived threat of a risk to the security and integrity 
of information available to us may adversely affect 
customer perception, give rise to litigation and reduce our 
customer base, thereby negatively affecting R Systems 
revenues and profit margins. The contracts entered into by 
R Systems typically hold us solely responsible for maintaining 
satisfactory standards of personnel competency, conduct 
and integrity and for taking required disciplinary action.
	
R Systems may be vulnerable to risks due to natural or 
manmade calamities / disasters which may impact business 
operations, inflicting heavy economic losses and risk to 
employee safety.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems has adopted industry-standard 
security precautions such as ensuring that our employees 
and strategic partners enter into non-disclosure and 
confidentiality agreements with us, verifying that there is 
no information leakage through test procedures, carrying 
out background checks and verifications, creating and 
maintaining data backups, and maintaining an adequate 
disaster recovery plan. 
	
R Systems makes continual investments in organisation 
behaviour and management processes to ensure that these 
certified industry standards are continually adhered to.
	
During the year 2024, Noida IT as well as Digital Operations 
Division have underwent recertification audit for ISO 
27001, assessment for SOC2, Type 2 and the IT division 
has been successfully appraised for CMMI L5. As of the 
date of this report, Noida IT division and Digital Operations 
Division are ISO 9001:2015, ISO 27001:2022 and HITRUST 
Certified. Additionally, the IT Division holds CMMI L5 (ver 3.0) 
certification, while the Digital Operations Division maintains 
PCI-DSS (ver 4.0) certification for its IT Infrastructure and 
relevant projects, processes, and applications.
	
The 
continuing 
compliance 
with 
these 
standards 
demonstrates the rigor of R Systems processes and 
differentiates us to keep our competitive edge in service and 
product offerings.
	
Further, our distributed offshore and near shore infrastructure 
is seamlessly connected through a strong infrastructure 
design and appropriate bandwidth, work from home facility 
for employees that provides us the capability to initiate and 
maintain uninterrupted support across the world. Although 
the Company cannot avoid such risk that could impact 
the entire Industry, the Company has taken appropriate 
insurance cover for hazard events.
6.	
Talent Acquisition & Retention
	
The IT and BPO sector is highly competitive in terms of hiring 
strategy and incentives. 
	
R Systems is highly dependent on its employees at various 
levels of the organisation to provide leadership, manage the

business, to provide services and execute complex projects 
for the clients. These skilled professionals are in high 
demand by other organisations and if R Systems is unable to 
attract and retain the skilled people, it will affect R Systems 
ability to grow and provide services to its customers.
	
INITIATIVES: At R Systems, we follow industry best human 
resource practices to attract, develop, deploy and retain 
talent. The Company is committed to develop and innovate 
such programmes that motivates them and develop 
their potential and also inculcate leadership attributes of 
the employees, which helps us to retain the best talent 
in the industry.
7.	
Key Managerial Role & Succession Planning 
	
Succession planning is one of the most critical functions of 
an organization. This is the process that identifies the critical 
and core roles of an organization and identifies and assesses 
the suitable candidates for the same. The process ramps up 
potential candidates with appropriate skills and experiences 
in an effort to train them to handle future responsibilities in 
their respective roles. Succession planning is applicable for 
all critical roles in any organization. The upper management 
of each practice or department is responsible for coming up 
with a suitable succession plan for each core position under 
his or her department.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems has implemented a comprehensive 
and clearly defined Succession Planning policy. This policy 
encompasses all key roles within the organization, as 
determined by the Senior Management. Mission-critical 
positions include the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Senior Management Team comprising Vice Presidents, 
and other roles essential for the continuity of business 
operations. Succession planning at R Systems is conducted 
at least annually, coinciding with the annual performance 
appraisal cycle.
	
Further, the Company maintains extensive recruitment teams 
across its operational markets to continuously attract skilled 
personnel at various organizational levels. Additionally, 
R Systems implements a rigorous training program for entry-
level professionals, aimed at developing the next generation 
of managers and leaders. The Company employs modern HR 
practices, offering competitive compensation and benefits 
packages, as well as an engaging work environment to 
attract and retain talent. To mitigate the impact of attrition on 
service continuity for clients, R Systems utilizes its proprietary 
processes and methodologies that enable project teams to 
seamlessly share knowledge and collaborate on project.
8.	
Technological Obsolescence
	
Technological obsolescence poses significant risks to IT 
organizations, including heightened security vulnerabilities, 
operational inefficiencies, and potential financial penalties. 
Mitigation strategies emphasize proactive risk management 
through continuous innovation, strategic adaptability, and the 
cultivation of ecosystem partnerships.
	
INITIATIVES: The IT and ITES sector is marked by rapid 
technological advancements, the evolution of existing 
products, and the introduction of new technologies. To keep 
pace with these developments, we continuously enhance 
our competencies in the latest technologies to deliver state-
of-the-art products and solutions for our customers.
	
Additionally, R Systems regularly recruits, trains, and nurtures 
domain and market specialists. We continuously evaluate 
opportunities to expand our portfolio of technology alliances 
and partnerships to enhance our offerings.
9.	
Acquisitions
	
R Systems’ growth strategy involves future strategic 
acquisitions, partnerships and exploration of mutual interests 
with other parties. These future acquisitions may not 
contribute to our profitability, and we may be required to 
incur or assume debt, or assume contingent liabilities, as part 
of any acquisition. We could have difficulty in assimilating the 
personnel, operations, software assets and technology of 
the acquired company. These difficulties could disrupt our 
ongoing business, distract our management and employees 
and increase our expenses.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems will remain sharply focused on those 
acquisitions and partnerships that add to the competitive 
strengths of our business. Specific transactions are 
evaluated in detail with experienced internal personnel and 
external advisors, wherever relevant, before consummating 
any transaction. Deal teams conduct technical, operational, 
marketing due diligence and build detailed financial model 
to evaluate the risks and benefits of any transaction. Further, 
contractual agreements are negotiated with the advice of 
legal counsel to protect Company’s interests.
10.	 Credit Risk
	
As a matter of business practice, the payment collection 
process may extend over a period of time. Customers 
budgeting constraints can impact their ability to make the 
required payments. In addition, the creditworthiness of our 
clients may deteriorate and we can be adversely affected by 
bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems’ credit terms are standard and there is 
rigorous process in following up with customers for payments as 
and when the invoices fall due for payment. The Company has 
suitably streamlined its processes to develop a more focused 
and aggressive receivables management systems to ensure 
timely collections as a result of the global liquidity crunch.
11.	
Foreign Currency Rate Fluctuations
	
Managing an equilibrium state in the light of the unfavourable 
movements in exchange rates involved in earnings and 
expenditure in foreign currency continues to be one of the 
Risk Management Report
124
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
challenges when exposed to global markets. A significantly 
large percentage of R Systems consolidated revenues are 
either foreign currency denominated or derived from export 
earnings. Whereas a major portion of R Systems expenses 
in India are incurred in Indian Rupees. As a result, operating 
profits will be highly impacted by foreign currency rate 
fluctuations. While depreciation of the Indian Rupee would 
have a favourable bottom-line impact, an appreciation would 
affect R Systems profitability adversely.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems cannot directly influence exchange 
rates, it is incumbent upon management to follow a well 
thought out policy to hedge the risk associated with foreign 
currency without taking speculative positions. R Systems 
attempts to minimize currency fluctuation risks on export 
earnings by taking forward covers on Rupee - USD/EURO 
exchange rate based on anticipated revenues and debtors 
at periodic intervals. R Systems has laid down appropriate 
policies and processes for the use of financial derivative 
instruments consistent with its risk management strategy. 
The Company does not use the foreign exchange forward 
contracts for trading or speculation purposes.
12.	 Inflation and Cost Structure
	
R Systems’ cost structure consists of salary and other 
compensation expenses, overseas travel, and other 
general selling and administrative costs. Rapid economic 
development in India and increasing demand for global 
delivery may have a significant impact on these costs and the 
rate of inflation as relevant to the IT & ITES services industry. 
This is compounded by the fact that overseas competitors 
may treat their India strategy as a cost centre and develop 
the same regardless of the cost incurred and its impact on 
their profitability.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems’ major costs are salary and benefit 
cost that it incurs on employees. These costs may have a 
tendency to escalate faster than the rate of inflation because 
of the demand for skilled and experienced professionals. 
R Systems attempts to mitigate the risks associated with wage 
inflation by obtaining increased price from clients, increasing 
bench mark prices for new business, enhancing productivity, 
increasing utilisation and inducting fresh graduates and training 
them. Further, R Systems has implemented robust processes 
and information systems to enable personnel to make the 
right decisions for revenue realisation and cost optimisation to 
minimise the risks of changes in salary cost structure.
13.	 Intellectual Property Rights
	
As a part of R Systems’ business, there are risks associated 
with intellectual property of the Company, intellectual 
property of R Systems’ customers who may be end users or 
even the intellectual property of the end user.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems’ information security arrangements 
are managed under international standard ISO 27001: 2022 
series and are being audited by both internal and experts 
from third parties assessors who periodically audit and certify 
R Systems compliance
	
We have registered the following marks and their 
corresponding words as R Systems’ trademarks:

the Word Mark “RSYSTEMS” in USA and Logo 
 in USA 
and Europe. Further, Velotio Technologies Private Limited, 
subsidiary of the Company, has registered the logo 
 
under relevant class with the Registrar in India.
14.	 Information Security Management
	
R Systems being an IT and Software service provider company 
focusses on maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of business data and information to the exclusive 
but optimum use for the accomplishment of organizational 
objective. The task of maintaining the confidentiality of 
business data and information not only faces threat from 
outside the organization but also within the organization 
where the business data and information are put to use.

INITIATIVES: For ensuring the effectiveness of Information security, it is important that information security can be effective only 
if it is addressed at people, process and technology levels and is integrated in the way an organization operates. R Systems has 
established, documented and implemented Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and shall continually improve its 
effectiveness in accordance with requirements of ISO 27001:2022, SOC2 Type 2 and HITRUST. The approach applied to the ISMS 
is given in Figure below:

R Systems security policy provides a framework for 
protecting confidentiality, integrity and ensuring availability of 
organization’s Information assets to the authorized persons. 
This is to safeguard the interest of customer, business continuity 
and continual improvement of ISMS at R Systems. The security 
policy of R Systems has been designed to safeguard the risk 
associated with information security management.
15.	 Contractual Risk
	
The primary contractual risks that R Systems faces pertain 
to obligations of R Systems to provide services with full 
adherence to contracted terms of quality, time deadlines, 
output per hour, protection of confidential information, 
protection of intellectual property rights, patents and 
copyrights. R Systems has a rigorous process to evaluate 
the legal risks involved in a contract, ascertains its legal 
responsibilities under the applicable law of the contract and 
tries to restrict its liabilities to the maximum extent possible.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems attempts to protect itself with “no 
consequential losses” and “maximum liability” clauses. R Systems 
also ensures that risks are protected through various insurances 
like professional liability, workers compensation, directors’ and 
officers’ liability, cyber & crime insurance. The Company’s past 
record in this regard has been good and there has been no 
significant damages awarded against the Company that has 
resulted in material adverse impact on our financial position. 
	
R Systems also has an escalation process to immediately involve 
senior management personnel in case R Systems customers or 
contractors make any assertion of breach of contract.
	
R Systems has employed professionals with adequate legal 
expertise who plays handy role in finalizing the various terms 
under written contracts on behalf of the Company. The experience 
gained from past contracts and transaction entered into by the 
Company are also analysed and implemented for the new contracts 
envisaged by the Company. As a matter of practice depending 
upon the criticality of the transactions, contractual agreements 
are well discussed within the organization in coordination with 
technical team as well legal professionals and are also negotiated 
with the advice of legal counsel to protect Company’s interests.
16.	  Execution Risk
	
R Systems clients are Tech and Independent Software 
Vendors and companies from Healthcare, Manufacturing and 
Logistics, Telecom, Media, and Entertainment, Banking and 
Financial Services and Retail and Hospitality Sectors. These 
clients need high quality and timely delivery of services 
with very stringent services level agreements. Any failure in 
delivery, quality, meeting service level bench agreements, 
product features and functionalities could adversely affect 
R Systems relationship with its clients, which could potentially 
impact R Systems revenues and profitability.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems has continuously invested in 
processes, people, training, information systems, quality 
standards, frameworks, tools and methodologies to mitigate 
the risks associated with execution of projects. Adoption of 
quality models and practices such as ISO, Capability Maturity 
Model (CMM) and HITRUST have ensured that risks are 
identified and mitigated at various levels in the planning and 
execution process. Further, senior management personnel, 
126
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
project managers and process leaders are entrusted with 
the responsibility to meet the project and service level 
expectations on various engagements. Planned intervention 
and escalation systems are further deployed to minimise risks.
17.	
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Risks
	
The directors and officers of R Systems are required to take 
material decisions in the best interest of the Company. Such 
decisions might result in errors and omissions and R Systems 
might be sued by the other counterpart.
	
INITIATIVES: To mitigate this risk, the directors and officers 
take legal and expert advice when required and have 
taken various insurance policies outlined earlier including 
professional liability and directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance. The Company attempts to limit its contractual 
liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, 
mistakes or omissions by directors and officers in rendering 
services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of 
liability set forth in its service contracts will be enforceable 
in all instances or will otherwise protect the Company from 
liability for damages. Though the Company maintains general 
liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or 
omissions, going forward, there can be no assurance that 
such coverage will be available on reasonable terms and in 
sufficient amount to cover one or more large claims, or that 
the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. 
The successful assertion of one or more large claims against 
the Company could adversely affect the Company’s results 
of operations and financial condition.
18.	 Visa Regulations / Restrictions 
	
Several overseas employees of R Systems are Indian 
nationals. The ability of R Systems to render its services in 
the US, Europe and other countries depends on the ability 
to obtain visas and work permits. Immigration to US, Europe 
and other countries are subject to legislative changes as well 
as variations in standards of application and enforcement 
due to political forces and economic conditions for example, 
any major change in immigration policy of USA may put the 
challenge to Indian IT Companies. It is difficult to predict the 
political and economic events that could affect immigrations 
laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or 
monitoring work visas. The reliance on visas makes R Systems 
vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects the 
ability of the Company to staff projects with employees 
who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be 
performed. As a result, R Systems may not be able to get a 
sufficient number of visas for employees or may encounter 
delays or additional costs all of which may affect profitability. 
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems monitors the status of visa availability 
and requirements on a regular basis in consultation with 
external legal counsel. In house legal personnel are entrusted 
with the responsibility for compliance with the immigrations 
laws which is validated by periodic independent audit. 
R Systems may expand its business in other geographies 
to de-risk from US business meanwhile it may boost US 
hiring. R Systems may look forward to change its business 
models so that it can deliver from different locations globally 
through innovation.
19.	 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Risks
	
ESG Risks are those concerns arising from Environmental, 
Social and Governance factors that are likely to affect the 
financial situation or operating performance of a company. 
The environmental aspect focuses on how the business 
minimises its impact on the environment. The social 
aspect focuses on how a business impacts wider society 
and workplace culture. Governance refers to business's 
ethical behaviour and its transparency with stakeholders 
about its activities. These factors have a significant impact 
on a Company's long-term sustainability, profitability and 
reputation of the Company.
	
INITIATIVES: The Company is cautious of the impact of 
its operation on the environment and society as well. The 
Company is diligently integrating good environmental, social 
and governance practices into its policies and operations. 
Though your Company does not have energy intensive 
operation, every possible endeavour has been made for 
optimal usage of energy and resources. 
	
The Company promotes a safe and healthy working 
environment, ensuring equal opportunities, respects human 
rights and fair treatment for all employees. The Company also 
expects all its employees, consultants, independent contractors 
and suppliers to observe these practices. As a responsible 
Corporate Citizen, the Company engages with the Community 
through its Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. 
	
The Company ensures a transparent and effective 
communication with its stakeholders, fostering a diverse and 
balanced board structure, inculcating anti-corruption policies, 
and establishing fair and reasonable executive compensation.
	
R Systems has a compliance management system with 
qualified managers entrusted with compliance of various 
laws including the listing laws and regulations applicable to 
public companies in India. The Company uses independent 
legal counsel to advise the Company on compliance issues 
with respect to the laws of various countries in which the 
Company has its business activities and to ensure that it is 
not in violation of the laws applicable.
	
Details of policies and action taken to address the ESG Risk 
are covered in Business, Responsibility and sustainability 
Report as forms Part of Directors’ Report.
20.	 Political Risk
	
The Government of India has been favourably disposed 
towards the IT and BPO industry in India. Further, we operate 
in multiple countries of which the US is a major market. While 
most governments in the countries where we operate are 
in favor of free trade, we cannot be immune to changes 
in policies that may discourage off-shoring to protect 
local employment.

the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) 
of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the standalone financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone 
financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may 
be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any 
identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Annual Report 2024
Annexure “A” to The Independent Auditor’s Report 
(Referred to in paragraph 1(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements section of our report of even date)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements of R Systems International Limited 
(“the Company”) as of 31 December, 2024 in conjunction with our 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended on that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements based on the internal control with 
reference to standalone financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) (the “Guidance Note”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on 
Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to the standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to standalone 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company's internal financial control with reference to standalone 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial control with reference to standalone financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Annual Report 2024
(xix)	 On the basis of the financial ratios, ageing and expected 
dates of realization of financial assets and payment of 
financial liabilities, other information accompanying the 
standalone financial statements and our knowledge of the 
Board of Directors and Management plans and based on our 
examination of the evidence supporting the assumptions, 
nothing has come to our attention, which causes us to 
believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date 
of the audit report indicating that Company is not capable 
of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet 
as and when they fall due within a period of one year from 
the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not 
an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We 
further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the 
date of the audit report and we neither give any guarantee 
nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period 
of one year from the balance sheet date, will get discharged 
by the Company as and when they fall due.

R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024  
1.	
Nature of operations
	
R Systems International Limited (the ‘Company’ or ‘R Systems’) 
(Corporate Identification Number: L74899DL1993PLC053579) 
is a public company domiciled in India having its registered 
office at New Delhi. Its shares are listed on National Stock 
Exchange of India Limited and BSE Limited. The Company is 
a leading global provider of technology, artificial intelligence, 
intelligent process automation services and solutions along 
with knowledge services. The Company delivers its services 
and solutions to leading technology companies and businesses 
to enable their digital transformation. The Company’s services 
and solutions span over six business verticals namely (i) Tech, 
Internet and Platforms, (ii) Health, (iii) Manufacturing & Logistics 
(M&L), (iv) Telecom, Media & Entertainment (TME), (v) Banking, 
Finance & Insurance (BFSI) and (vi) Services.
2.	
Summary of material accounting policies
	
(a)	
Basis of preparation and presentation 
	
	
These standalone financial statements (the 'financial 
statements') are prepared in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read 
with Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) Rules 
as amended from time to time and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India.
	
	
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except 
where a newly issued accounting standard is initially 
adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
	
	
The financial statements have been prepared on 
accrual and going concern basis and under the 
historical cost convention except for certain financial 
instruments, equity settled share-based payment 
transactions, net defined benefit obligations and 
other long-term employee benefits which have been 
measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally 
based on the fair value of consideration given in 
exchange of goods and services.
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable 
or estimated using another valuation technique. In 
estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the 
Company takes into account the characteristics of the 
asset or liability if market participants would take those 
characteristics into account when pricing the asset or 
liability at the measurement date. 
	
	
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value 
measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value 
measurements are observable and the significance of 
the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:
	
	
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity 
can access at the measurement date;
	
	
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices 
included within Level 1, that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
	
	
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers 
and the time elapsed between deployment of resources 
and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the 
consideration of the services rendered, the Company 
has determined its operating cycle as 12 months for the 
purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities as 
current and non-current.
	
(b)	 Functional and presentation currency 
	
	
The financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupee (INR), which is also the Company’s functional 
currency. All amounts have been presented in million 
and rounded off upto two decimal places, unless 
otherwise indicated. 
	
(c)	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. The cost comprises the purchase price 
and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to 
its working condition for its intended use. Any trade 
discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the 
purchase price. 
	
	
When significant parts of an item of property plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major component) of 
property plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure 
related to an item of property, plant and equipment is 
added to its book value only if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Company. All other expenses on existing property, 
plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and 
maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, 
are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the 
year during which such expenses are incurred.
	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or retirement i.e. when 
no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Gains or losses 
arising from disposal or retirement of property, 
143
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTICE
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024  
plant and equipment are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
Amounts paid towards the acquisition of property, plant 
and equipment not received till the reporting date and 
the cost of property, plant and equipment received 
but not ready for intended use before such date are 
disclosed under capital advances and capital work-in-
progress (CWIP), respectively.
	
(d)	 Depreciation 
	
	
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, 
plant and equipment and Investment Property, less 
their estimated residual values using the straight line 
method over the useful lives of the assets estimated 
by the management. The assets residual values and 
useful lives are reviewed at each financial year end 
or whenever there are indicators for review, and 
adjusted prospectively.
	
	
The management believes that depreciation rates 
currently used fairly reflect its estimate of the useful 
lives are in align with Part C of Schedule II of the 
Companies Act 2013. 
	
	
The 
management 
estimates 
the 
useful 
lives 
are as follows:
Category
Useful life up to
Buildings
30 years
Leasehold land
Lease period
Leasehold improvements
Lower of lease 
period or useful life
Plant and equipment - air 
conditioners
5 years
Plant and equipment - other 
than air conditioners
15 years
Office Equipment (other than 
end user devices)
5 years
Office Equipment 
(end user devices)
3 years
Computer hardware and 
network installations (other 
than end user devices)
6 years
Computer hardware 
(end user devices)
3 years
End-user devices such as 
desktop, laptop, mobile 
phones etc.
3 years
Furniture and fittings
10 years
Vehicles
8 years
Electrical installation
10 years
	
(e)	
Intangible assets
	
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
	
	
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the 
effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for 
on a prospective basis.
	
	
The management estimates the useful life as follows:
Category
Useful life up to
Computer software
Lower of license period or 
3 years
	
	
Expenditure incurred during development of intangible 
assets is included under “Intangible Assets under 
Development”. The same is allocated to the respective 
items of intangible assets on completion of the project.
	
(f)	
Investment property 
	
	
Investment properties are properties held to earn 
rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including 
property under construction for such purposes). 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are measured in 
accordance with requirements of Ind AS 16 for cost 
model i.e. cost less accumulated depreciation.
	
	
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal 
or when the investment property is permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits 
are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising 
on de-recognition of the property (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
net carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss in the period in which the 
property is derecognised.
	
(g)	 Financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments. 
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets 
and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) 
are added to or deducted from the fair value of the 
financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
144
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024  
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the 
net amounts are presented in the standalone balance 
sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it 
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
(h)	 Financial assets
	
	
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets 
are recognised and derecognised on a trade date 
basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the marketplace.
	
	
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured 
in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, 
depending on the classification of the financial assets.
	
	
Classification of financial assets
	
	
(i)	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions 
are 
subsequently 
measured 
at 
amortised cost (except for debt instruments that 
are designated as at fair value through profit or 
loss on initial recognition):
-	
the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets in order to 
collect contractual cash flows; and
-	
the contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(ii)	
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions 
are subsequently measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) (except 
for debt instruments that are designated as at fair 
value through profit or loss on initial recognition):
-	
the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved both by 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets; and
-	
the contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss for 
FVTOCI debt instruments. For the purposes of 
recognising foreign exchange gains and losses, 
FVTOCI debt instruments are treated as financial 
assets measured at amortised cost. Thus, the 
exchange differences on the amortised cost are 
recognised in profit or loss and other changes 
in the fair value of FVTOCI financial assets are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated under the heading of ‘Reserve for 
debt instruments through other comprehensive 
income’. When the investment is disposed of, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in 
this reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
	
	
	
All other financial assets are subsequently 
measured at fair value.
	
	
	
Effective interest method
	
	
	
The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument 
and of allocating interest income over the relevant 
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
(including all fees and points paid or received 
that form an integral part of the effective interest 
rate, transaction costs and other premiums or 
discounts) through the expected life of the debt 
instrument or where appropriate, a shorter period, 
to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
	
	
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis 
for debt instruments other than those financial 
assets classified as at FVTPL. Interest income is 
recognised in profit or loss and is included in the 
“Other income” line item.
	
	
(iii)	
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI
	
	
	
On initial recognition, the Company can make 
an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-
instrument basis) to present the subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income pertaining to investments in equity 
instruments. This election is not permitted if 
the equity investment is held for trading. These 
elected investments are initially measured at fair 
value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the ‘Reserve for equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income’. The cumulative gain or 
loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal 
of the investments.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024  
	
	
	
A financial asset is held for trading if:
-	
it has been acquired principally for the 
purpose of selling it in the near term; or
-	
on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio 
of identified financial instruments that 
the Company manages together and 
has a recent actual pattern of short-term 
profit-taking; or
-	
it is a derivative that is not designated and 
effective as a hedging instrument or a 
financial guarantee.
	
	
(iv)	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Investments in equity instruments, other than 
investment in subsidiary, are classified as at 
FVTPL, unless the Company irrevocably elects on 
initial recognition to present subsequent changes 
in fair value in other comprehensive income for 
investments in equity instruments which are not 
held for trading.
	
	
	
Debt instruments that do not meet the amortised 
cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria (see above) are 
measured at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments 
that meet the amortised cost criteria or the 
FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL 
are measured at FVTPL.
	
	
	
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost 
criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVTOCI 
criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon 
initial recognition if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency that would arise from 
measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the 
gains and losses on them on different bases. 
	
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair 
value at the end of each reporting period, with 
any gains or losses arising on re-measurement 
recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or 
loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates 
any dividend or interest earned on the financial 
asset and is included in the ‘Other income’ line 
item. Dividend on financial assets at FVTPL is 
recognised when the Company’s right to receive 
the dividends is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend 
will flow to the Company, the dividend does 
not represent a recovery of part of cost of the 
investment and the amount of dividend can be 
measured reliably.
	
	
(v)	
Investment in subsidiary companies
	
	
	
Investment 
in 
subsidiary 
companies 
is 
measured at cost.
	
	
De-recognition of financial assets
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 
expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset to another party. If the Company neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership and continues to control the 
transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated liability for 
amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
a transferred financial asset, the Company continues 
to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a 
collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
	
	
On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
sum of the consideration received and receivable and 
the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss 
would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss 
on disposal of that financial asset.
	
	
Foreign exchange gains and losses
	
	
The fair value of financial assets denominated in a 
foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency 
and translated at the spot rate at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
(i)	
For foreign currency denominated financial 
assets measured at amortised cost and FVTPL, 
the exchange differences are recognised in profit 
or loss except for those which are designated as 
hedging instruments in a hedging relationship.
	
	
(ii)	
Changes in the carrying amount of investments in 
equity instruments at FVTOCI relating to changes 
in foreign currency rates are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
	
	
(iii)	
For the purposes of recognising foreign exchange 
gains and losses, FVTOCI debt instruments 
are treated as financial assets measured at 
amortised cost. Thus, the exchange differences 
on the amortised cost are recognised in profit 
or loss and other changes in the fair value of 
FVTOCI financial assets are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.

for the year ended December 31, 2024  
	
(i)	
Financial liabilities 
	
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
liabilities are classified as:
-	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. The change in measurements is 
recognised as finance costs in the statement of 
profit and loss.
-	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Financial liabilities at FVTPL represented by 
contingent consideration are measured at fair 
value with all change recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
De-recognition of financial liabilities
	
	
The 
Company 
derecognises 
financial 
liabilities 
when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or have expired. 
	
(j)	
Impairment
	
	
i.	
Financial assets
	
	
	
The Company applies Expected Credit Loss 
(ECL) model for measurement and recognition 
of impairment loss on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost and financial assets that are 
debts instruments and are measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). 
ECL is the difference between contractual cash 
flows that are due and the cash flows that the 
Company expects to receive, discounted at the 
original effective interest rate.
	
	
	
For trade receivables, the Company recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECL at 
each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. 
Further, the Company considers information 
developed internally or obtained from external 
sources indicating that the debtor is unlikely to pay 
as constituting an event indicating credit impairment.
	
	
	
For other financial assets, the Company determines 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has 
not increased significantly, 12 month ECL is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk 
has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.
	
	
ii.	
Impairment of investment in subsidiaries:
	
	
	
The Company assesses investments in subsidiaries 
for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
of the investment may not be recoverable. If any 
such indication exists, the Company estimates the 
recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary. 
The recoverable amount of such investment is the 
higher of its fair value less cost of disposal and 
its value-in-use (VIU). The VIU of the investment 
is calculated using projected future cash flows. If 
the recoverable amount of the investment is less 
than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction 
is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
iii.	
Non-financial assets
	
	
	
The Company’s non-financial assets, excluding 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date or whenever there is any indication of 
impairment based on internal/external factors. If 
any indications exist, the Company estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount.
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognised wherever 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the greater of the asset’s fair value and its value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the asset. 
	
(k)	
Derivative financial instruments
	
	
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward 
contracts to manage its exposure to foreign 
exchange rate risks. 
	
	
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the 
date the derivative contracts are entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end 
of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition 
in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship and the nature of the hedged item.
	
	
Hedge accounting
	
	
The Company designates certain hedging instruments, 
which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and 
147
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTICE
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024  
non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as 
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Hedges 
of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges.
	
	
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its 
risk management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, 
at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing 
basis, the Company documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in 
fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable 
to the hedged risk.
	
	
Fair value hedges
	
	
Changes in fair value of the designated portion 
of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are 
recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with 
any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or 
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The 
change in the fair value of the designated portion of 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in profit 
or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised 
to profit or loss from that date.
	
	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash 
flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated under the heading of cash 
flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
	
	
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity relating to (effective 
portion as described above) are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. 
However, when the hedged forecast transaction results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-
financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred 
from equity (but not as a reclassification adjustment) 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or 
when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated 
in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
(l)	
Borrowing costs
	
	
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in 
connection with the borrowing of funds and interest on 
lease liabilities. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or development of an asset that 
necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of 
that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
	
(m)	 Leases
	
	
Where the Company is a lessee
	
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land, buildings and furniture. The Company, 
at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the 
contract is a lease or not lease. A contract is, or contains, 
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves 
the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from use of 
the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the 
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-
use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate 
of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or 
to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is 
located, less any lease incentives received. 
	
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated 
from the commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-
use assets are determined on the same basis as those 
of property, plant and equipment.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
148
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024  
payments are discounted using the rate implicit in 
the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the 
incremental borrowing rate. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising from 
a change in an index or rate or if the Company changes 
its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, 
extension or termination option. When the lease liability 
is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment 
is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, 
or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of 
the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. 
	
	
Lease concessions received are accounted for as a 
lease modification and a corresponding adjustment is 
made to the carrying amount of the related right-of-use 
asset and lease liability.
	
	
The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of 
low-value assets. The Company recognises the lease 
payments associated with these leases as an expense 
over the lease term. 
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing activity under cash 
flows statements.
	
	
Where the Company is a lessor
	
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership 
of the asset are classified as operating leases. Assets 
comprising land and building which are subject to 
operating leases are included under non-current 
assets as investment property and are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation. Lease income on an 
operating lease is recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Costs, including depreciation, are recognised as an 
expense in the statement of profit and loss.
	
(n)	 Revenue 
	
	
The 
Company 
derives 
revenue 
primarily 
from 
information technology services and business process 
outsourcing services. The Company recognises 
revenue when the performance obligations as 
promised have been satisfied with a transaction price 
and when there is no uncertainty as to measurement or 
collectability of the consideration. 
	
	
The Company has applied the guidance in Ind AS 
115, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, by 
applying the revenue recognition criteria for each 
distinct performance obligation. The arrangements with 
customers generally meet the criteria for considering 
these services as distinct performance obligations. 
For allocating the transaction price, the Company has 
measured the revenue in respect of each performance 
obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling 
price. The Company accounts for volume discounts 
and pricing incentives to customers as a reduction of 
revenue based on the ratable allocation of the discounts 
/ incentives to each of the underlying performance 
obligation that corresponds to the progress by the 
customer towards earning the discount/ incentive.
	
	
Contract modifications are accounted for when 
additions, deletions or changes are approved either to 
the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for 
modifications of contracts involves assessing whether 
the services added to an existing contract are distinct 
and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling 
price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted 
for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are 
distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a 
separate contract, if the additional services are priced 
at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of 
the existing contract and creation of a new contract if 
not priced at the standalone selling price.
	
	
The Company collects Goods and Service Tax on 
behalf of the government and, therefore, these are not 
economic benefits flowing to the Company. Hence, 
they are excluded from revenue.
	
	
Arrangements with customers for services are 
either on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-
and-material basis.
	
	
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognised 
as the related services are performed and revenue 
from the end of the last invoicing to the reporting date 
is recognised as unbilled revenue.
	
	
Revenue from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, 
where the performance obligations are satisfied over time 
and where there is no uncertainty as to measurement 
or collectability of consideration, is recognised as per 
the percentage-of-completion method. When there is 
uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability, 
revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty 
is resolved. Efforts or costs expended have been used 
to measure progress towards completion as there is 
a direct relationship between input and productivity. 
Maintenance revenue is recognised ratably over the 
term of the underlying maintenance arrangement.
	
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a 
right to use are recognised at the time the licenses is 
made available to the customers.
149

Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as 
contract assets (referred as unbilled revenue) while 
invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (referred as unearned revenues).
	
	
Unbilled revenue for fixed price contracts are 
classified as non-financial asset if the contractual 
right to consideration is dependent on completion of 
contractual milestones. Unbilled revenue on contracts 
other than above is classified as a financial asset.
	
(o)	 Other income
	
	
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, 
dividend income, net gain on foreign exchange 
fluctuations, rental income and gain on investments. 
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis 
taking into account the carrying amount and the effective 
interest rate. Dividend income is recognised when the 
Company’s right to receive dividend is established.
	
(p)	 Foreign currency transactions and balances 
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional 
currency of the Company, by applying to the foreign currency 
amount the exchange rate between the functional currency 
and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.
	
	
Conversion
	
	
Foreign currency monetary items are reported using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. 
Non- monetary items, which are measured in terms of 
historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are 
reported using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary items which are carried at 
fair value or other similar valuation denominated in a 
foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates 
at the date when the values were determined.
	
	
Exchange differences
	
	
Exchange differences arising on conversion / settlement 
of foreign currency monetary items and exchange gain 
/ loss on forward contracts are recognised as income or 
expenses in the statement of profit and loss.
	
(q)	 Employee benefits
	
	
The Company participates in various employee benefit 
plans. Post-employment benefits are classified as either 
defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under 
a defined contribution plan, the Company’s only obligation 
is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to 
pay all related employee benefits. The related risks fall on 
the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution 
plans is recognised as expense during the period when the 
employee provides service. Under a defined benefit plan, it 
is the Company’s obligation to provide agreed benefits to the 
employees. The related actuarial risks fall on the Company. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligations is 
calculated using the projected unit credit method.
	
	
(i)	
Employee benefits falling due wholly within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified 
as short-term employee benefits. The benefits 
like salaries, wages, short term compensated 
absences and performance incentives are 
recognised on undiscounted basis in the year in 
which the employee renders the related service. 
	
	
(ii)	
The Company's contribution to social security 
plans such as provident fund, employee state 
insurance scheme, 401K etc. are considered as 
defined contribution plans and are charged as 
an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are 
rendered by the employees.
	
	
(iii)	
Gratuity is a defined benefit obligation plan 
operated by the Company for its employees 
covered under Company Gratuity Scheme. The 
cost of providing benefit under gratuity plan is 
determined on the basis of actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method at the 
reporting date and are charged to the statement 
of profit and loss except for the re-measurements 
comprising of actuarial gains and losses which 
are recognised in full in the statement of 
other comprehensive income in the reporting 
period in which they occur. Re-measurements 
are not reclassified to statement of profit and 
loss subsequently. 
	
	
	
The provision for gratuity recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of 
the defined benefit obligations reduced by the 
fair value of scheme assets. The present value of 
the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
by reference to market yields at the end of the 
reporting period on government bonds that 
have terms approximating to the terms of the 
related obligation.
	
	
(iv)	
Compensated absences
	
	
	
The employees of the Company are entitled 
to compensated absences. The employees 
can carry forward a portion of the unutilised 
accumulating compensated absences and utilise 
it in future periods or receive cash at retirement 
or termination of employment. The Company 
records an obligation for compensated absences 
in the period in which the employee renders 
150
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024  
the services that increases this entitlement. 
The Company measures the expected cost of 
compensated absences as the additional amount 
that the Company expects to pay as a result of 
the unused entitlement that has accumulated at 
the end of the reporting period. The Company 
recognises accumulated compensated absences 
based on actuarial valuation. The actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss. Non-accumulating compensated 
absences are recognised in the period in which 
the absences occur.
	
	
	
The Company presents the entire Compensated 
absences liability as a current liability in the 
balance sheet, since it does not have an 
unconditional right to defer its settlement for 
twelve months after the reporting date.
	
(r)	
Income taxes
	
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It 
is recognised in statement of profit or loss except to 
the extent that it relates to a business combination 
or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
	
	
Current tax
	
	
Current income tax is measured at the amount expected 
to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India and tax laws 
prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions where the 
Company operates. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date. 
	
	
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset 
and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases. Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates 
and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except deferred tax liability arising 
from initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit/ loss at the 
time of transaction. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, except 
deferred tax assets arising from initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit/ loss at the time of transaction. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised only to the extent that sufficient 
future taxable income will be available against which such 
deferred tax assets can be realised.
	
	
In the situations where the Company is entitled to a tax 
holiday under the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India 
or tax laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions 
where it operates, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is 
recognised in respect of temporary differences which 
reverse during the tax holiday period, to the extent 
the Company’s gross total income is subject to the 
deduction during the tax holiday period. Deferred tax 
in respect of temporary differences which reverse after 
the tax holiday period is recognised in the year in which 
the temporary differences originate.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will 
be available against which such deferred tax assets 
can be realised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to 
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
	
	
Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged 
to the statement of profit and loss as current tax. MAT 
credit available is recognised as an asset only to 
the extent that there is convincing evidence that the 
Company will pay normal income tax during the period, 
i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be 
carried forward. MAT credit asset is created by way of 
credit to the statement of profit and loss and shown as 
“MAT Credit Entitlement” under deferred tax assets. 
	
(s)	
Segment reporting
	
	
The Company determines reportable segment based 
on information reported to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM) for the purposes of resource 
allocation and assessment of segmental performance. 
The CODM evaluates the Company's performance and 
allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments. The 
accounting principles used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are consistently applied to record 
revenue and expenditure in individual segments.

for the year ended December 31, 2024  
	
	
Each segment item reported is measured at the 
measure used to report to the CODM for the purposes 
of making decisions about allocating resources to the 
segment and assessing its performance.
	
	
Inter segment transfers:
	
	
The Company generally accounts for inter segment 
sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to 
third parties at current market prices.
	
	
Allocation of common costs:
	
	
Common allocable costs are allocated to each segment 
according to the relative contribution of each segment 
to the total common costs.
	
	
Unallocated items:
	
	
The corporate and other segment includes general 
corporate income and expense items which are not 
allocated to any business segment.
	
(t)	
Earnings per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year. 
	
	
The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the reporting period is adjusted for 
events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a rights 
issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation 
of shares), if any occurred during the reporting 
period, that have changed the number of equity 
shares outstanding, without a corresponding change 
in resources. The number of shares and potential 
dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for 
all periods presented for any bonus shares issues 
including for changes effected prior to the approval of 
the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year, are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
(u)	 Share based payments
	
	
The cost of equity-settled transaction is determined by 
the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and 
recognised as employee benefits expense over the 
vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised 
for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the Company’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest.
	
	
The expense recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss for a year represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that 
year and is recognised in employee benefits expense. 
In case of the employee stock option schemes having 
a graded vesting schedule, each vesting tranche 
having different vesting period has been considered as 
a separate option grant and accounted for accordingly.
	
	
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award 
are modified, the minimum expense recognised is 
the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if 
the original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
	
(v)	
Provisions
	
	
A provision is recognised when the Company has a 
present obligation as a result of past event; it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, in 
respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. 
Provisions are determined based on the best estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. If 
the effect of time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects 
the risks specific to the liability. These estimates are 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates.
	
(w)	 Contingent liabilities
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the 
Company or a present obligation that is not recognised 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation. 
	
(x)	
Business combinations
	
	
Business combinations arising from transfers of interest 
in entities that are under the control of the shareholder 
that controls the Company are accounted for using 
pooling of interest method as if the acquisition had 
occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative

for the year ended December 31, 2024  
period presented. The assets and liabilities acquired 
are recognised at their carrying amounts. The identity 
of the reserves is preserved and they appear in the 
financial statements of the Company in the same form 
in which they appeared in the financial statements 
of the transferor company. The difference, if any, 
between the share capital issued plus any additional 
consideration in the form of cash or other assets and 
the amount of share capital of the transferor shall be 
recorded as capital reserve and presented separately 
as capital reserve under common control.
	
(y)	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalents comprises bank balances, 
cash on hand and short term deposits with an original 
maturity period of three months or less.
	
(z)	
Assets held for sale
	
	
The Company classifies non-current assets as held 
for sale when it is highly probable that they will 
be recovered primarily through sale rather than 
through continuing use. Items of property, plant and 
equipment, intangible assets and investment property, 
once classified as non-current assets, are no longer 
depreciated or amortised. Such assets are presented 
separately from the other assets in the Balance Sheet. 
They are measured at lower of their carrying value and 
fair value less cost to sell. 
	
(aa)	 Use of estimates and judgements
	
	
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities 
and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of year. 
These estimates are based on the management’s best 
knowledge of current events, historical experience, 
actions that the Company may undertake in the future 
and on various other assumptions that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. 
	
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on a periodic basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in any future periods affected.
	
	
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
	
	
i.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
	
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion 
method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. 
Use of the percentage-of-completion method 
requires the Company to estimate the efforts or 
costs expended to date as a proportion of the 
total efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts or 
costs expended have been used to measure 
progress towards completion. Provisions for 
estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted 
contracts are recorded in the period in which such 
losses become probable based on the expected 
contract estimates at the reporting date.
	
	
ii.	
Income taxes 
	
	
	
The Company’s major tax jurisdictions is India, though 
the Company also files tax returns in other overseas 
jurisdictions. Significant judgements are involved in 
determining the provision for income taxes.
	
	
	
The Company reviews carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets at the end of each reporting period. 
	
	
iii.	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment
	
	
	
The charge in respect of depreciation is derived 
after determining an estimate of an asset’s 
expected useful life and the expected residual 
value at the end of its life. The useful lives 
and residual values of Company’s assets are 
determined by management at the time the 
asset is acquired and reviewed periodically. The 
lives are based on historical experience with 
similar assets as well as anticipation of future 
events, which may impact their life, such as 
changes in technology.
	
	
iv.	
Leases
	
	
	
The Company considers extension-options under 
the commercial contract for determining the lease-
term which forms the basis for the measurement 
of right-of-use asset and the corresponding 
lease-liability.
	
	
v.	
Impairment of investments
	
	
	
The Company reviews its carrying value of 
investments at each Balance Sheet date, or 
more frequently when there is an indication that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If 
the recoverable amount is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is accounted for.
	
	
vi.	
Employee benefit plans
	
	
	
The present value of provision for gratuity 
and 
compensated 
absence 
is 
based 
on 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit 
credit method. An actuarial valuation involves 
153

for the year ended December 31, 2024  
various assumptions that may differ from actual 
developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future 
salary increases and mortality rates. Due to 
the complexities involved in the valuation and 
its long-term nature, provision for gratuity and 
compensated absence is highly sensitive to 
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
	
vii.	
Employee share-based payments
	
	
	
The Company measures compensation cost 
relating to employee share-based payments 
using the fair valuation method. Fair value of 
time-based restricted stock units (RSUs) was 
determined using Black Scholes model. The 
expected number of performance-based RSUs is 
determined using Monte Carlo Simulation. 
	
	
Recent accounting pronouncements

Disaggregate revenue information
The table below presents disaggregated revenues from the Company’s contracts with customers by geography and customer's industry 
type. The Company believes this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenues and cash 
flows are affected by industry, market and other economic factors.
Revenue by geography:
Revenue by customer's industry type :
Trade receivables and contract balances
The company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as unbilled revenue.
Revenue for time and material contracts are recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance contracts 
is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as unbilled revenue and is 
classified as a financial asset for these cases as right to consideration is unconditional upon passage of time.
Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion method. Invoicing to clients is based 
on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing of revenue recognition being different from the timing of billing 
the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed price development contracts is classified as non financial assets as the contractual right to 
consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.
Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as of 
the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognise these amounts as revenue. The 
Company has applied the practical expedients as given in IND AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the remaining 
performance obligations related disclosures where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to customer of 
the entity’s performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on the basis of time-and-material basis.

Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes 
in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment of revenue that has not materialised and adjustments for currency.
Disclosure relating to remaining performance obligation relating to fixed bid price contracts require the aggregate amounts of transaction 
price yet to be recognised as revenue at the reporting date and expected timelines to recognise these amounts. In view of the fact that 
all outstanding contracts have an original expected duration for completion of less than a year no disclosure is warranted.

The reconciliation between the provision of income tax of the Company and amount computed by applying the Indian statutory income 
tax rate to profit before taxes is as follows:
#The Company has two units at Greater Noida registered as Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units which are entitled to a tax holiday under Section 10AA of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961.
*The Company may opt for tax rate of 22% plus surcharge and cess (totaling to 25.17%) as specified under section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, while filing return 
of income for financial year effective April 01, 2025. Consequently, the Company has remeasured deferred tax balances to give effect to the lower rate of income tax 
under new tax regime. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have been remeasured during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Fair value hierarchy:
The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or 
unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a 
valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same 
instrument nor are they based on available market data.
There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
31. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors and risk management objectives
The Company’s activities expose it to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability 
of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:
Market risk
The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate 
foreign exchange related risk exposures. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by team that has the 
appropriate skills, experience along with supervision. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in derivative for speculative purposes 
shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk
The Company’s exchange risk arises from its foreign currency revenues (primarily in U.S. Dollars and Euros). A significant portion of 
the Company’s revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian Rupees. As a result, if 
the value of the Indian Rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company’s revenues measured in Rupees may 
decrease or vice versa.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. 
These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or inputs that are directly 
or indirectly observable in the marketplace. The Company has not applied hedge accounting as these forward contracts do not qualify 
for hedge accounting. As at December 31, 2024, the Company has recognised mark-to-market liability of H 55.45 million (previous year: 
mark-to-market asset of H 9.86 million) relating to aforesaid foreign currency forward contracts resulting in to mark-to-market loss of H 65.31 
million (previous year gain of H 107.92 million) for the year ended December 31, 2024 recorded as foreign exchange fluctuation.
The following table gives details in respect of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts:

The following table analyses Company's foreign currency exposure from non-derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 
and December 31, 2023:
# Others include currencies such as SGD and GBP.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange 
rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies, would decrease / increase Company’s profit before tax margin by approximately 
1.35% and 1.00%, respectively.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference 
rates could have an impact on the Company cash flows as well as costs. The Company has availed floating rate borrowings in the form of 
working capital demand loan and cash credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2024, every one percentage increase / decrease 
in interest rates, would result in decrease / increase Company’s profit before tax margin by approximately 0.03% (previous year 0.25%).
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk arises from 
deposits held with banks, investments with financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial 
assets. The Company assesses the credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience 
and other factors.
Trade receivables
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of 
the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit 
risk assessment.
The following table gives details in respect of revenues generated from top customer and top 5 customers:

Impairment Assessment of Goodwill 
(Refer note 3(e) of the consolidated financial statements)
The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 
December 31, 2024 carries goodwill amounting to INR 2,657 
million in relation to the Acquisition of Velotio Technologies Private 
Limited (“Velotio”) in previous year. 
Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually. 
During the current year, management has carried out impairment 
assessment by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill to 
their recoverable amount to determine whether an impairment 
was required to be recognized. 
We considered the assumptions relating to future revenue growth 
and the valuation assumptions, specifically, the assumptions 
relating to weighted average cost of capital and terminal growth 
rate, used in estimation of recoverable value of Velotio as a key 
audit matter due to the significance of the investment amount and 
the significant estimates and judgement involved in estimation of 
these assumptions.
Principal audit procedures performed:
 
 
Evaluated the design, implementation and tested the 
operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls 
relating to impairment assessment of Goodwill.
 
 
Evaluated 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
business 
assumptions relating to future revenue growth;
 
 
We have used our valuation specialists to assess overall 
reasonableness of the assumptions used particularly 
those relating to the weighted average cost of capital and 
terminal growth rate;
 
 
Performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions 
such as weighted average cost of capital and 
terminal growth rate.
Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of R Systems International Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of R Systems International Limited (”the Parent”) and 
its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to 
as “the Group”), which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
as at 31 December, 2024, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of material accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of 
reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements of 
the subsidiaries referred to in the Other Matters section below the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so 
required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian 
Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act (“Ind 
AS”), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 December, 
2024, and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total 
comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and their 
consolidated changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under 
section 143 (10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for 
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the 
audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by 
the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other 
Matters section below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Information Other than the Financial Statements and 
Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Parent’s Board report including Annexures to 
Board’s Report but does not include the consolidated financial 
statements, the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. The Company’s Board report is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, when 
it becomes available and compare with the financial statements 
of the subsidiaries, audited by the other auditors, to the extent it 
relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the work 
of the other auditors and consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance as required under SA 
720 ‘The Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to Other Information’.

the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 
of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies

adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for

cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors/Those Charged with Governance 
of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for 
overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists

related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
 
 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the branch and entities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audit of the financial statements of 
such branch and entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors. For 
the other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, 
such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried out by 
them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated 
financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may 
be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any 
identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Parent and such other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
We did not audit the financial statements of 24 subsidiaries whose 
financial statements reflect total assets of H 3,120.76 million as at 
31 December, 2024, total revenues of H 5,454.88 million, total net 
profit after tax of H 140.62 million, total comprehensive income of H 
165.01 million and net cash outflows of H 164.63 million for the year 
ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial 
statements. These financial statements have been audited by 
other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the 
Management and our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures 
included in respect of these subsidiaries and our report in terms 
of subsection (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to 
the aforesaid subsidiaries is based solely on the reports of the 
other auditors.
We did not audit the financial statements of 1 subsidiary, whose 
financial statements reflect total assets of H 7.64 million as at 
31 December, 2024, total revenues of H NIL, net cash inflows 
amounting to H 7.01 million, total net loss after tax of H 0.84 
million and total comprehensive loss of H 0.84 million for the year 
ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial 
statements. These financial statements are unaudited and have 
been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts and disclosures included in respect of this subsidiary, 
is based solely on such unaudited financial statements. In our 
opinion and according to the information and explanations given 
to us by the Management, these financial statements are not 
material to the Group.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements above and 
our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements below, is 
not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our 
reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors 
and the financial statements certified by the Management.
The financial statements of 26 subsidiaries have been prepared 
under accounting principles generally accepted in their respective 
countries. The Parent’s Management has converted the financial 
statements of these subsidiaries, from accounting principles 
generally accepted in their respective countries to accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. We reviewed the 
adjustments that were applied to prepare the audited consolidated

Annexure “A” to The Independent Auditor’s Report 
(Referred to in paragraph 1(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) 
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the Parent as at and for the year ended 31 December, 2024, we have 
audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements based on “the 
internal control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
criteria established by the respective Companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)”. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of 
the Parent and its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of 
the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiary 
company, which is company incorporated in India, in terms of 
their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of 
the reports of the other auditors referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, the Parent and its subsidiary companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were 
operating effectively as at 31 December, 2024, based on the 
criteria for internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements established by the respective companies 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in 
so far as it relates to 1 subsidiary company, which is company 
incorporated in India, is based solely on the corresponding report 
of the auditors of such company incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matters.

Summary of material accounting policies
	
(a)	
Basis of preparation and presentation
	
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have 
been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standard) Rules as amended from 
time to time and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India.
	
	
The Group has consistently applied accounting 
policies to all periods except where a newly issued 
accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to 
an existing accounting standard requires a change in 
the accounting policy hitherto in use.
	
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group 
have been prepared on accrual and going concern 
basis and under the historical cost convention except 
for certain financial instruments, equity settled share-
based payment transactions, contingent consideration, 
net defined benefit obligations and other long term 
employee benefits, which have been measured at 
fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the 
fair value of consideration given in exchange of 
goods and services.
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable 
or estimated using another valuation technique. In 
200
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024
estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the 
Group takes into account the characteristics of the 
asset or liability if market participants would take those 
characteristics into account when pricing the asset or 
liability at the measurement date.
	
	
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value 
measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value 
measurements are observable and the significance of 
the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:
	
	
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity 
can access at the measurement date;
	
	
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices 
included within Level 1, that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
	
	
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset 
or liability.
	
	
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers 
and the time elapsed between deployment of resources 
and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the 
consideration of the services rendered, the Group has 
determined its operating cycle as 12 months for the 
purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities as 
current and non-current.
	
(b)	 Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items included in the consolidated financial statements 
of each of the Company’s subsidiaries are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which these entities operate (i.e. the “functional 
currency”). The Group uses the Indian Rupee (INR) as its 
reporting currency, which is the functional currency of 
the Parent Company. All amounts have been presented 
in nearest million and rounded off upto two decimal 
places, unless otherwise indicated.
	
(c)	
Principles of consolidation
	
	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with the principles and procedures for the 
preparation and presentation of consolidated financial 
statements as laid down under Indian Accounting 
Standard (Ind AS) 110 Consolidated Financial Statements.
	
	
The consolidated financial statements include the 
financial statements of R Systems International Limited 
and its subsidiaries (as explained in note 1 above).
	
	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared 
using uniform accounting policies for like transactions 
and other events in similar circumstances and are 
presented, to the extent possible, in the same manner 
as the Company's standalone financial statements.
	
	
The financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries have been consolidated on a line-by-
line basis by adding together the book values of like 
items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after 
eliminating intra-group balances / transactions.
	
	
Minority interest's share in the net comprehensive 
income of consolidated subsidiaries for the year is 
identified and adjusted against the income of the 
group in order to arrive at the net income attributable 
to shareholders of the Company. In case the losses 
applicable to consolidated minority are in excess of 
minority interest in the equity of the subsidiary, the 
excess, and any further losses applicable to the minority 
are adjusted against majority interest except to the 
extent minority has a binding obligation to, and is able 
to, make good losses. If the subsidiary subsequently 
reports profit, all such profits are allocated to the majority 
interest until the minority's share of losses previously 
absorbed by the majority has been recovered.
	
(d)	 Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. The cost comprises the purchase price 
and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its 
working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts 
and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price.
	
	
When significant parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major component) of 
property, plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure 
related to an item of property, plant and equipment is 
added to its book value only if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to the Group. All other expenses on existing property, 
plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and 
maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, 
are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the 
year during which such expenses are incurred.
	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or retirement i.e. when no 
future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Gains or losses arising from 
disposal or retirement of property, plant and equipment 
are measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Depreciation
	
	
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, 
plant and equipment and investment property less 
their estimated residual values using the straight line 
method over the useful lives of the assets estimated 
by the management. The assets residual values and 
useful lives are reviewed at each financial year end 
or whenever there are indicators for review, and 
adjusted prospectively.
	
	
The management believes that depreciation rates currently 
used fairly reflect its estimate of the useful lives are in align 
with Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.

(f)	
Intangible assets
	
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the 
effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for 
on a prospective basis.
	
	
The

are as follows:
Category

Expenditure incurred during development of intangible 
assets is included under “Intangible Assets under 
Development”. The same is allocated to the respective 
items of intangible assets on completion of the project.
	
(g)	 Investment property
	
	
Investment properties are properties held to earn 
rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including 
property under construction for such purposes). 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are measured in 
accordance with requirements of Ind AS 16 for cost 
model i.e. cost less accumulated depreciation.
	
	
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or 
when the investment property is permanently withdrawn 
from use and no future economic benefits are expected 
from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition 
of the property (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount of the 
asset) is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the 
period in which the property is derecognised.
	
(h)	 Business combination, Goodwill and Intangible 
assets
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
purchase (acquisition) method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity 
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at 
the date of exchange. The cost of acquisition also includes 
the fair value of any contingent consideration. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
	
	
Transaction costs incurred in connection with a 
business combination are expensed as incurred.
	
	
a.	
Goodwill
	
	
	
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s share in the fair value of the acquiree’s 
202
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
consideration is recognised as goodwill. If the 
excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is 
recognised in capital reserve.
	
	
b.	
Intangible assets
	
	
	
Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible 
assets and contingent consideration to be fair 
valued in order to ascertain the net fair value 
of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree. Significant estimates are 
required to be made in determining the value of 
contingent consideration and intangible assets. 
These valuations are conducted by independent 
valuation experts.
	
	
Business combinations arising from transfers of interest 
in entities that are under the control of the shareholder 
that controls the Company are accounted for using 
pooling of interest method as if the acquisition had 
occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative 
period presented. The assets and liabilities acquired 
are recognised at their carrying amounts. The identity 
of the reserves is preserved and they appear in the 
financial statements of the Company in the same form 
in which they appeared in the financial statements of 
the transferor company. The difference, if any, between 
the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any 
additional consideration in the form of cash or other 
assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor 
shall be transferred to capital reserve and should 
be presented separately as Capital reserve under 
common control.
	
(i)	
Financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments.
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from 
the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, 
as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets 
or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the 
net amounts are presented in the standalone balance 
sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it 
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
(j)	
Financial assets
	
	
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets 
are recognised and derecognised on a trade date 
basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the marketplace.
	
	
All recognised financial assets are subsequently 
measured in their entirety at either amortised cost 
or fair value, depending on the classification of the 
financial assets.
	
	
Classification of financial assets
	
	
(i)	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions 
are 
subsequently 
measured 
at 
amortised cost (except for debt instruments that 
are designated as at fair value through profit or 
loss on initial recognition):
 
 
The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets in order to 
collect contractual cash flows; and
 
 
The contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(ii)	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) (except for debt instruments that are 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition):
 
 
The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved both by 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets; and
 
 
The contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss for FVTOCI 
debt instruments. For the purposes of recognising 
foreign exchange gains and losses, FVTOCI debt 
instruments are treated as financial assets measured at 
amortised cost. Thus, the exchange differences on the 
amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss and other 
Annual Report 2024
203
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTICE
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024
changes in the fair value of FVTOCI financial assets 
are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated under the heading of ‘Reserve for debt 
instruments through other comprehensive income’. 
When the investment is disposed of, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously accumulated in this reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
	
	
All 
other 
financial 
assets 
are 
subsequently 
measured at fair value.
	
	
Effective interest method
	
	
The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating 
interest income over the relevant period. The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid 
or received that form an integral part of the effective 
interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums 
or discounts) through the expected life of the debt 
instrument or where appropriate, a shorter period, to 
the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
	
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt 
instruments other than those financial assets classified as 
at FVTPL. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss 
and is included in the “Other income” line item.
	
(iii)	
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI
	
	
On initial recognition, the Group can make an 
irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument 
basis) to present the subsequent changes in fair value in 
other comprehensive income pertaining to investments 
in equity instruments. This election is not permitted if 
the equity investment is held for trading. These elected 
investments are initially measured at fair value plus 
transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at 
fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in 
fair value recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the ‘Reserve for equity instruments 
through other comprehensive income’. The cumulative 
gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on 
disposal of the investments.
	
	
A financial asset is held for trading if:
 
 
It has been acquired principally for the purpose of 
selling it in the near term; or
 
 
On initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of 
identified financial instruments that the Group 
manages together and has a recent actual pattern 
of short-term profit-taking; or
 
 
It is a derivative that is not designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument or a financial guarantee.
	
	
(iv)	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Investments in equity instruments are classified as 
at FVTPL, unless the Group irrevocably elects on 
initial recognition to present subsequent changes 
in fair value in other comprehensive income for 
investments in equity instruments which are not 
held for trading.
	
	
	
Debt instruments that do not meet the amortised 
cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria (see above) are 
measured at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments 
that meet the amortised cost criteria or the 
FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL 
are measured at FVTPL.
	
	
	
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost 
criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVTOCI 
criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon 
initial recognition if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency that would arise from 
measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the 
gains and losses on them on different bases.
	
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair 
value at the end of each reporting period, with 
any gains or losses arising on re-measurement 
recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or 
loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates 
any dividend or interest earned on the financial 
asset and is included in the ‘Other income’ line 
item. Dividend on financial assets at FVTPL is 
recognised when the Group’s right to receive 
the dividends is established, it is probable that 
the economic benefits associated with the 
dividend will flow to the Group, the dividend does 
not represent a recovery of part of cost of the 
investment and the amount of dividend can be 
measured reliably.
	
	
De-recognition of financial assets
	
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 
expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the 
204
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024
asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have 
to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, 
the Group continues to recognise the financial asset 
and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received.
	
	
On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
sum of the consideration received and receivable and 
the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss 
would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss 
on disposal of that financial asset.
	
	
Foreign exchange gains and losses
	
	
The fair value of financial assets denominated in a 
foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency 
and translated at the spot rate at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
(i)	
For foreign currency denominated financial 
assets measured at amortised cost and FVTPL, 
the exchange differences are recognised in profit 
or loss except for those which are designated as 
hedging instruments in a hedging relationship.
	
	
(ii)	
Changes in the carrying amount of investments in 
equity instruments at FVTOCI relating to changes 
in foreign currency rates are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
	
	
(iii)	
For the purposes of recognising foreign exchange 
gains and losses, FVTOCI debt instruments are 
treated as financial assets measured at amortised 
cost. Thus, the exchange differences on the amortised 
cost are recognised in profit or loss and other 
changes in the fair value of FVTOCI financial assets 
are recognised in other comprehensive income.
	
(k)	
Financial liabilities
	
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
liabilities are classified as:
-	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. The change in measurements is 
recognised as finance costs in the statement of 
profit and loss.
-	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
Financial liabilities at FVTPL represented by contingent 
consideration are measured at fair value with all change 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
De-recognition of financial liabilities
	
	
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and 
only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or have expired.
	
(l)	
Impairment
	
	
i.	
Financial assets
	
	
	
The Group applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) 
model for measurement and recognition of 
impairment loss on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost and financial assets that are 
debts instruments and are measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). 
ECL is the difference between contractual cash 
flows that are due and the cash flows that the 
Group expects to receive, discounted at the 
original effective interest rate.
	
	
	
For trade receivables, the Group recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECL at 
each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. 
Further, the Group considers information developed 
internally or obtained from external sources 
indicating that the debtor is unlikely to pay as 
constituting an event indicating credit impairment.
	
	
	
For other financial assets, the Group determines 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has 
not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk 
has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.
	
	
ii.	
Non-financial assets (including goodwill)
	
	
	
The Group’s non-financial assets, excluding 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date or whenever there is any indication of 
impairment based on internal/external factors. 
If any indications exist, the Group estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount.
	
	
	
For impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets (cash 
generating unit or CGU) that generates cash flows 
from continuing use that are largely independent 
of the cash flows of other assets or CGUs. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is 
allocated to each of the CGUs that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies arising from the 
business combination.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is 
the greater of its fair value and its value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and risks 
specific to the asset or CGU.
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognised wherever the 
carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
They are first allocated to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and 
then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other 
assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
	
	
	
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not 
subsequently reversed.
	
(m)	 Derivative financial instruments
	
	
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward 
contracts to manage its exposure to foreign 
exchange rate risks.
	
	
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the 
date the derivative contracts are entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end 
of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition 
in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship and the nature of the hedged item.
	
	
Hedge accounting
	
	
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, 
which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and 
non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as 
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Hedges 
of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges.
	
	
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking 
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception 
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument is highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows 
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
	
	
Fair value hedges
	
	
Changes in fair value of the designated portion of 
derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are 
recognised in profit or loss immediately, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged 
risk. The change in the fair value of the designated 
portion of hedging instrument and the change in 
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are 
recognised in profit or loss in the line item relating to 
the hedged item.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised 
to profit or loss from that date.
	
	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash 
flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated under the heading of cash 
flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
	
	
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity relating to (effective 
portion as described above) are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. 
However, when the hedged forecast transaction results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-
financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred 
from equity (but not as a reclassification adjustment) 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any 
gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity 
and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or 
loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss.

(n)	 Borrowing costs
	
	
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred 
in connection with the borrowing of funds and interest 
on lease liabilities. Borrowing costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction or development of an 
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time 
to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised 
as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing 
costs are recognised as an expense in the period in 
which they are incurred.
	
(o)	 Leases
	
	
Where the Group is a lessee
	
	
The Group lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land, buildings, computer hardware and 
furniture. The Group, at the inception of a contract, 
assesses whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A 
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
time in exchange for a consideration.
	
	
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, the Group 
assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of 
an identified asset (ii) the Group has substantially all of 
the economic benefits from use of the asset through 
the period of the lease and (iii) the Group has the right 
to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-
use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate 
of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset 
or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it 
is located, less any lease incentives received.
	
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated 
from the commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-
use assets are determined on the same basis as those 
of property, plant and equipment.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the rate implicit in 
the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the 
incremental borrowing rate. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising from 
a change in an index or rate or if the Group changes 
its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, 
extension or termination option. When the lease liability 
is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment 
is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, 
or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of 
the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
	
	
Lease concessions received are accounted for as a 
lease modification and a corresponding adjustment is 
made to the carrying amount of the related right-of-use 
asset and lease liability.
	
	
The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of 
low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease 
payments associated with these leases as an expense 
over the lease term.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing activity under cash 
flows statements.
	
	
Where the Group is a lessor
	
	
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership 
of the asset are classified as operating leases. Assets 
comprising land and building which are subject to 
operating leases are included under non-current 
assets as investment property and are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation. Lease income on an 
operating lease is recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Costs, including depreciation, are recognised as an 
expense in the statement of profit and loss.
	
(p)	 Revenue
	
	
The Group derives revenue primarily from information 
technology services and business process outsourcing 
services. The Group recognises revenue when the 
performance obligations as promised have been 
satisfies with a transaction price and when where there 
is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of 
the consideration.
	
	
The Group has applied the guidance in Ind AS 115, 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, by applying 
the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct 
performance obligation. The arrangements with 
customers generally meet the criteria for considering 
these services as distinct performance obligations. For 
allocating the transaction price, the Group has measured 
the revenue in respect of each performance obligation 
of a contract at its relative standalone selling price.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024
The Group accounts for volume discounts and pricing 
incentives to customers as a reduction of revenue 
based on the ratable allocation of the discounts / 
incentives to each of the underlying performance 
obligation that corresponds to the progress by the 
customer towards earning the discount/ incentive.
	
	
Contract modifications are accounted for when additions, 
deletions or changes are approved either to the contract 
scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of 
contracts involves assessing whether the services added 
to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing 
is at the standalone selling price. Services added that 
are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch 
up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for 
prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional 
services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a 
termination of the existing contract and creation of a new 
contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.
	
	
The Group collects indirect taxes like Goods and 
Service Tax, value added taxes (VAT) etc. on behalf 
of the government and, therefore, these are not 
economic benefits flowing to the Group. Hence, they 
are excluded from revenue.
	
	
Arrangements with customers for services are 
either on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-
and-material basis.
	
	
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognised 
as the related services are performed and revenue 
from the end of the last invoicing to the reporting date 
is recognised as unbilled revenue.
	
	
Revenue from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, 
where the performance obligations are satisfied over time 
and where there is no uncertainty as to measurement 
or collectability of consideration, is recognised as per 
the percentage-of-completion method. When there is 
uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability, 
revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty 
is resolved. Efforts or costs expended have been used 
to measure progress towards completion as there is 
a direct relationship between input and productivity. 
Maintenance revenue is recognised ratably over the 
term of the underlying maintenance arrangement.
	
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtain a 
right to use are recognised at the time the licenses is 
made available to the customers.
	
	
Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as 
contract assets (referred as unbilled revenue) while 
invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (referred as unearned revenues).
	
	
Unbilled revenue for fixed price contracts are 
classified as non-financial asset if the contractual 
right to consideration is dependent on completion of 
contractual milestones. Unbilled revenue on contracts 
other than above is classified as a financial asset.
	
(q)	 Other Income
	
	
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, 
net gain on foreign exchange fluctuations, rental 
income and gain on investments. Interest income is 
recognised on a time proportion basis taking into 
account the carrying amount and the effective interest 
rate. Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s 
right to receive dividend is established.
	
(r)	
Foreign currency transactions and balances
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the 
respective functional currencies using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the respective 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation at the exchange rates prevailing 
at reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and 
reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses).
	
	
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a 
foreign currency and measured at historical cost are 
translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date 
of transaction.
	
	
For the purposes of presenting the consolidated 
financial statements assets and liabilities of Group’s 
foreign operations with functional currency different 
from the Company are translated into Company’s 
functional currency i.e. INR using exchange rates 
prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income 
and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
arising if any are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity.
	
	
On the disposal of foreign operation, all of the exchange 
differences accumulated in equity in respect of that 
operation attributable to the owners of the Company 
are reclassified to the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
	
	
For translating income, expense and cash flows items, 
during the year ended December 31, 2024, the rates

during the year ended December 31, 2023, the rates 
used were US $ 1= H 82.57, Euro 1= H 89.29, Singapore 
$ 1 = H 61.47 and Canadian $ 1 = H 61.19. For translating 
assets and liabilities at the year-end, the rates used 
were US $ 1= H 83.21, Euro 1= H 91.95, Singapore $ 1 = 
H 63.00 and Canadian$ 1 = H 62.79.
	
(s)	
Employee benefits
	
	
The Group participates in various employee benefit 
plans. Post-employment benefits are classified as either 
defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. 
Under a defined contribution plan, the Group’s only 
obligation is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation 
to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold 
sufficient assets to pay all related employee benefits. 
The related risks fall on the employee. The expenditure 
for defined contribution plans is recognised as expense 
during the period when the employee provides service. 
Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Group’s obligation 
to provide agreed benefits to the employees. The 
related actuarial risks fall on the Group. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligations is calculated 
using the projected unit credit method.
	
	
(i)	
Employee benefits falling due wholly within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified 
as short-term employee benefits. The benefits 
like salaries, wages, short term compensated 
absences and performance incentives are 
recognised on undiscounted basis in the year in 
which the employee renders the related service.
	
	
(ii)	
The Group's contribution to social security 
plans such as provident fund, employee state 
insurance scheme, 401K etc. are considered as 
defined contribution plans and are charged as 
an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are 
rendered by the employees
	
	
(iii)	
Gratuity is a defined benefit obligation plan 
operated by the Company and its Indian 
subsidiaries for its employees covered under 
Gratuity Scheme. The cost of providing benefit 
under gratuity plan is determined on the basis of 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit 
method at the reporting date and are charged 
to the statement of profit and loss except for 
the re-measurements comprising of actuarial 
gains and losses which are recognised in full in 
the statement of other comprehensive income 
in the reporting period in which they occur. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to statement 
of profit and loss subsequently.
	
	
	
The provision for gratuity recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair 
value of scheme assets, if any. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on government bonds that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
	
	
(iv)	
Compensated absences
	
	
	
The employees of the Group are entitled 
to compensated absences. The employees 
of the Group can carry forward a portion of 
the 
unutilised 
accumulating 
compensated 
absences and utilise it in the future periods or 
receive cash at the retirement or termination of 
employment. The Group records an obligation for 
compensated absences in the period in which the 
employee renders the service that increases this 
entitlement. The Group measures the expected 
cost of compensated absences as the additional 
amount that the Group expects to pay as a result 
of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at 
the end of the reporting period.
	
	
	
Accumulated compensated absences which 
are expected to be availed or encashed within 
12 months from the end of the year are treated 
as short term employee benefits. The obligation 
towards the same is measured at the expected 
cost of accumulating compensated absences as 
the additional amount expected to be paid as a 
result of the unused entitlement as at the year end.
	
	
	
Accumulating compensated absences which are 
expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 
months from the end of the year are treated as other 
long term employee benefits. The Group’s liability 
is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit 
Credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial 
losses/ gains are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.
	
	
	
Non-accumulating 
compensated 
absences 
are recognised in the period in which the 
absences occur.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024
	
	
	
The Group presents the entire leave encashment 
liability as a current liability in the balance sheet, 
since it does not have an unconditional right to 
defer its settlement for twelve months after the 
reporting date.
	
(t)	
Income taxes
	
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss except 
to the extent that it relates to a business combination 
or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
	
	
Current tax
	
	
Current income tax is measured at the amount 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India and tax 
laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions where 
the Group operates. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date.
	
	
The Group off sets current tax assets and current tax 
liabilities only if there is a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to 
realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or 
simultaneously.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases. Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates 
and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except deferred tax liability arising 
from initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit/ loss at the 
time of transaction. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, except 
deferred tax assets arising from initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit/ loss at the time of transaction. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised only to the extent that sufficient 
future taxable income will be available against which such 
deferred tax assets can be realised.
	
	
In the situations where the Group is entitled to a tax 
holiday under the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India 
or tax laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions 
where it operates, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is 
recognised in respect of temporary differences which 
reverse during the tax holiday period, to the extent the 
Group’s gross total income is subject to the deduction 
during the tax holiday period. Deferred tax in respect 
of temporary differences which reverse after the tax 
holiday period is recognised in the year in which the 
temporary differences originate.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to 
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
	
	
Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged 
to the statement of profit and loss as current tax. MAT 
credit available is recognised as an asset only to 
the extent that there is convincing evidence that the 
Company will pay normal income tax during the period, 
i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be 
carried forward. MAT credit asset is created by way of 
credit to the statement of profit and loss and shown as 
“MAT Credit Entitlement” under deferred tax assets.
	
(u)	 Segment reporting
	
	
The Group determines reportable segment based 
on information reported to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM) for the purposes of resource 
allocation and assessment of segmental performance. 
The CODM evaluates the Group's performance and 
allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments. The 
accounting principles used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are consistently applied to record 
revenue and expenditure in individual segments.
	
	
Each segment item reported is measured at the 
measure used to report to the CODM for the purposes 
of making decisions about allocating resources to the 
segment and assessing its performance.
	
	
Inter segment transfers:
	
	
The Group generally accounts for inter segment sales 
and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third 
parties at current market prices.
	
	
Allocation of common costs:
	
	
Common allocable costs are allocated to each segment 
according to the relative contribution of each segment 
to the total common costs.

R Systems International Limited

Unallocated items:
	
	
The corporate and other segment includes general 
corporate income and expense items which are not 
allocated to any business segment.
	
(v)	
Earnings per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year.
	
	
The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the reporting period is adjusted for 
events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a rights 
issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation 
of shares), if any occurred during the reporting 
period, that have changed the number of equity 
shares outstanding, without a corresponding change 
in resources. The number of shares and potential 
dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for 
all periods presented for any bonus shares issues 
including for changes effected prior to the approval of 
the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year, are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
(w)	 Share based payments
	
	
The cost of equity-settled transaction is determined by 
the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and 
recognised as employee benefits expense over the 
vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until 
the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
	
The expense recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss for a year represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that 
year and is recognised in employee benefits expense. 
In case of the employee stock option schemes having 
a graded vesting schedule, each vesting tranche 
having different vesting period has been considered as 
a separate option grant and accounted for accordingly.
	
	
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award 
are modified, the minimum expense recognised is 
the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if 
the original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
	
(x)	
Provisions
	
	
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a 
reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are determined 
based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation 
at the reporting date. If the effect of time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-
tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. These 
estimates are reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
(y)	
Contingent liabilities
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the 
Group or a present obligation that is not recognised 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation.
	
(z)	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalents comprises bank balances, 
cash on hand and short term deposits with an original 
maturity period of three months or less.
	
(aa)	 Assets held for sale
	
	
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale 
when it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing 
use. Items of property, plant and equipment, intangible 
assets and investment property, once classified as non-
current assets, are no longer depreciated or amortised. 
Such assets are presented separately from the other 
assets in the Balance Sheet. They are measured at lower 
of their carrying value and fair value less cost to sell.
	
(ab)	 Use of estimates and judgements
	
	
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities 
and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of year. 
These estimates are based on the management’s best 
knowledge of current events, historical experience, 
actions that the Group may undertake in the future 
and on various other assumptions that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on a periodic basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in any future periods affected.
	
	
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
	
	
i.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
	
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion 
method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. 
Use of the percentage-of-completion method 
requires the Group to estimate the efforts or costs 
expended to date as a proportion of the total 
efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts or costs 
expended have been used to measure progress 
towards completion. Provisions for estimated 
losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are 
recorded in the period in which such losses 
become probable based on the expected 
contract estimates at the reporting date.
	
	
ii.	
Income taxes
	
	
	
The Group’s major tax jurisdiction is India, though 
the Group also files tax returns in other overseas 
jurisdictions. Significant judgements are involved 
in determining the provision for income taxes.
	
	
	
The Group reviews carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets / liabilities at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
iii.	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment
	
	
	
The charge in respect of depreciation is 
derived after determining an estimate of an 
asset’s expected useful life and the expected 
residual value at the end of its life. The useful 
lives and residual values of Group’s assets are 
determined by management at the time the 
asset is acquired and reviewed periodically. 
The lives are based on historical experience 
with similar assets as well as anticipation of 
future events, which may impact their life, such 
as changes in technology.
	
	
iv.	
Leases
	
	
	
The Group considers the extension-options 
under the commercial contract for determining 
the lease-term which forms the basis for the 
measurement of right-of-use asset and the 
corresponding lease-liability.
	
	
v.	
Impairment of goodwill
	
	
	
The calculation of value-in-use of cash generating 
unit involves use of significant estimates and 
assumptions, which include turnover, growth 
rates and net margins used to calculate projected 
future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, 
future economic and market conditions.
	
	
vi.	
Business Combination and Intangible Assets
	
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for using 
Ind AS 103, Business Combinations, which requires 
the acquirer to recognise the identifiable intangible 
assets and consideration at fair value. Estimates 
are required to be made in determining the value 
of consideration, value of option arrangements 
and intangible assets. These valuations are 
conducted 
by 
external 
valuation 
experts. 
These measurements are based on information 
available at the acquisition date and are based 
on expectations and assumptions that have been 
deemed reasonable by the Management.
	
	
vii.	
Employee benefit plans
	
	
	
The present value of provision for gratuity and 
other long-term employee benefit is based 
on actuarial valuation using the projected unit 
credit method. An actuarial valuation involved 
various assumptions that may differ from actual 
developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future 
salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its 
long-term nature, provision for gratuity and other 
long-term employee benefit is highly sensitive to 
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.

viii.	 Employee share-based payments
	
	
	
The Group measures compensation cost relating 
to employee share-based payments using the 
fair valuation method. Fair value of time-based 
restricted stock units (RSUs) was determined 
using Black Scholes model. The expected number 
of performance-based RSUs is determined using 
Monte Carlo Simulation.

3 (e). Goodwill
Impairment testing:
Goodwill amounting to H 2,657.40 million (previous year H 2,657.40 million) and H 68.06 million (previous year H 68.06 million) pertains 
to the acquisition of Velotio Technologies Private Limited and Scaleworx Technologies Private Limited, respectively (refer to Note 36). 
The recoverable amount of this Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) is determined based on a value in use calculation which uses cash flow 
projections covering a five-year period, and a pre-tax discount rate of 15.40% per annum. The annual growth rate of 5% is used subsequent 
to the forecast period of 5 years.
The Company has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the key assumptions used i.e. operating margin, discount rates and long-term 
average growth rate to determine the recoverable amount for CGU to which goodwill is allocated. Based on analysis, the Company did 
not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.
The remaining amount of goodwill of H 111.12 million and H 110.78 million as at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, 
(relating to different CGUs which are individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs 
and the recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts.

Disaggregate revenue information
The table below presents disaggregated revenues from the Group’s contracts with customers by geography and customer's industry 
type. The Company believes this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenues and cash 
flows are affected by industry, market and other economic factors.
Revenue by geography:
Revenue by customer's industry type :
Trade receivables and contract balances
The company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as unbilled revenue.
Revenue for time and material contracts are recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance contracts 
is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as unbilled revenue and is 
classified as a financial asset for these cases as right to consideration is unconditional upon passage of time.
Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion method. Invoicing to clients is based 
on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing of revenue recognition being different from the timing of billing 
the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed price development contracts is classified as non financial assets as the contractual right to 
consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.
Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as of the end 
of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Group expects to recognise these amounts as revenue. The Group has applied 
the practical expedients as given in IND AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligations related 
disclosures where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to customer of the entity’s performance completed to 
226
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2024
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended December 31, 2024
date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on the basis of time-and-material basis. Remaining performance obligation estimates are 
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, 
adjustment of revenue that has not materialised and adjustments for currency.
Disclosure relating to remaining performance obligation relating to fixed bid price contracts require the aggregate amounts of transaction 
price yet to be recognised as revenue at the reporting date and expected timelines to recognise these amounts. In view of the fact that 
all outstanding contracts have an original expected duration for completion of less than a year no disclosure is warranted.

The Code on Social Security, 2020 (the 'Code’)
	
The Code relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment benefits received Presidential assent in 
September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date on which the Code will come into 
effect has not been notified. The Group companies incorporated in India will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into 
effect and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.
(b)	 Gratuity
	
The Group companies incorporated in India have a defined benefit gratuity plan that provides a lump-sum payment to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment in accordance with the “Payment of Gratuity Act, 
1972”. The amount is based on the respective employee’s last drawn salary and the tenure of employment with the Companies.

The reconciliation between the provision of income tax of the Company and amounts computed by applying the Indian statutory income 
tax rate to profit before taxes is as follows:
# The Parent Company has two units at Greater Noida registered as Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units which are entitled to a tax holiday under Section 10AA of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961.
*The Parent Company may opt for tax rate of 22% plus surcharge and cess (totaling to 25.17%) as specified under section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, while 
filing return of income for financial year effective April 01, 2025. Consequently, the Company has remeasured deferred tax balances to give effect to the lower rate of 
income tax under new tax regime. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have been remeasured during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Fair value hierarchy:
The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or 
unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a 
valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same 
instrument nor are they based on available market data.
There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
31. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors and risk management objectives
The Group’s activities expose it to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of 
financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:
Market risk
The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign 
exchange related risk exposures. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by team that has the appropriate 
skills, experience along with supervision. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in derivative for speculative purposes shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exchange risk arises from its foreign currency revenues (primarily in U.S. Dollars and Euros). A significant portion of the 
Group’s revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian Rupees. As a result, if the value of 
the Indian Rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Group’s revenues measured in Rupees may decrease or vice versa.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group holds foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. 
These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or inputs that are directly or 
indirectly observable in the marketplace. The Group has not applied hedge accounting as these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange 
rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies, would decrease / increase Group’s profit before tax margin by approximately 
1.0 % and 0.87%, respectively.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference rates 
could have an impact on the Group cash flows as well as costs. The Group has availed floating rate borrowings in the form working capital 
demand loan and cash credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2024, every one percentage increase / decrease in interest rates, 
would result in decrease / increase Group’s profit before tax margin by approximately 0.03 % (previous year 0.28%).
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk arises from deposits 
held with banks, investments with financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients, including outstanding accounts receivable. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. The objective of managing counterparty credit 
risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Group assesses the credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their financial 
position, past experience and other factors.
accounting. As at December 31, 2024, the Group has recognised mark-to-market liability of H 55.45 million (previous year: mark-to-market 
asset (net) of H 9.40 million) relating to aforesaid foreign currency forward contracts resulting in mark-to-market loss of H 64.85 million 
(previous year mark-to-market gain of H 109.10 million) for the year ended December 31, 2024 recorded as foreign exchange fluctuation.

Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of 
the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit 
risk assessment.
The following table gives details in respect of revenues generated from top customer and top 5 customers:
No customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Further, there 
is one customer account for more than 10% of the receivable as at December 31, 2024 and one customer had more than 10% of the 
receivable as at December 31, 2023.
Investments including bank deposits
Credit risk on cash and bank balance is limited as the Group generally invests in deposits with banks. Investments primarily includes 
investment in liquid mutual funds having good rating. The Group does not expect any losses from non-performance by the counterparties.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The 
investment of surplus cash is governed by the Group’s investment policy approved by the Board of Directors. The Group believes that the 
working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements.
As at December 31, 2024, the Group had a working capital of H 3,219.68 million including cash and cash equivalents and current fixed 
deposits of H 1,981.23 million . As at December 31, 2023, the Group had a working capital of H 2,578.80 million including cash and cash 
equivalents and current fixed deposits of H 1,822.94 million. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.
