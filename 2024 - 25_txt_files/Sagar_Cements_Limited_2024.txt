members of the Board? (Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
	
A conflict of interest situation would be deemed to have arisen, when an individual’s 
interest is perceived to be inconsistent with or is in conflict with the business interest of 
the Company. One should avoid such conflict of interest with the Company. However, in 
case such a situation arises, he shall, on becoming aware of the same, make full and true 
disclosure of all facts and circumstances thereof to the Company. Some of the situations 
wherein a conflict of interest may be deemed to have arisen are elucidated below:
	
a.	
Pecuniary benefit: Where one’s conduct is likely to confer a pecuniary benefit to 
oneself or in favour of any relative(s) or in favour of any company, body corporate or 
firm where one or one’s relative is an employee, member, director or partner.
	
b.	
Related Party Transactions: Where one enters into transaction(s)/arrangement(s) 
(directly or indirectly through relatives) with companies, bodies corporate or firms, for 
personal gain, which may conflict with the business interest of the Company.
	
c.	
Corporate Opportunities: Where one uses and/or exploits for personal gain, 
opportunities that rightly belong to the Company or are discovered through the use of 
one’s position or through the Company’s image, property or information.
	
d.	
Outside directorships: It is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of any company 
that competes with the Company. Directors/Senior Management must first 
obtain approval from the Company’s Board/Managing Director before accepting 
a directorship.
