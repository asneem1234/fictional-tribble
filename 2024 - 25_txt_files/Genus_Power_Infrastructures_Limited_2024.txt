Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
Genus Power has a clear vision and objective centered around 
enabling utility providers to efficiently serve society with world-
class metering products, solutions, and services. Our core values 
i.e. Trust & Respect, Integrity, Customer Focus, Inclusive Growth, 
and Innovation are not just principles but integral components of 
their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) framework and 
sustainability practices. The Company has established its medium-
term, and long-term ESG goals for FY’30 and FY’40 respectively, 
keeping the baseline year FY’25 on several key areas: Energy 
emissions, water management, compliance, sustainable supply 
chains, and employee well-being. These goals provide a roadmap 
for their strategic initiatives in the coming years.
The Company specialises in manufacturing and deploying 'smart 
meters & smart metering solutions' globally. These sophisticated 
advanced systems accurately monitor energy consumption in real-
time, providing customers with precise billing information and detail 
insights into their energy usage patterns. By facilitating efficient 
energy management, Genus’s products contribute significantly 
to conserving energy, minimising waste, and lowering carbon 
emissions, thus benefiting both the economy and the environment.
The Company places a strong emphasis on social responsibility, 
striving to make a positive impact on society. They prioritise 
initiatives that promote equal opportunities irrespective of caste or 
gender, foster employee engagement and well-being, and empower 
communities through comprehensive CSR programs. Their efforts 
are directed towards promotion of health care including preventive 
health care, promotion of education including special education 
and employment enhancing vocational skills, protection of National 
Heritage, art and culture, and animal welfare. Further, Genus Power 
maintains robust governance practices that go beyond mere 
compliance. They ensure transparency and accountability in their 
operations, striving for continuous improvement and exploring 
new market opportunities. Given their industry focus on smart 
meters, they place a significant emphasis on cybersecurity, actively 
monitoring and mitigating cybersecurity risks to safeguard their 
products and customers.
We have consistently emphasised that aligning value creation 
with sustainable business practices are mutually reinforcing goals. 
Therefore we are confident that our ESG initiatives will contribute 
to generating enduring value for all our stakeholders in the long run.
