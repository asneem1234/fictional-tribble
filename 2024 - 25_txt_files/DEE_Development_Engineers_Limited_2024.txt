Statement by the director responsible for business
responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity
has flexibility regarding the placement of this
disclosure)
Our ESG strategy is a foundational pillar that underscores our commitment to
embedding sustainability across our operations and achieving ESG goals. A
cornerstone of this strategy are our biomass-based waste-to-energy power
plants in Abohar and Muktsar, Punjab. These facilities play a dual role:
contributing to avoiding GHG emissions and providing an additional source
of income for local communities. By utilising agricultural residues, such as
paddy straw, to generate electricity, these power plants have delivered
substantial emissions avoidance, a contribution formally recognised by the
UNFCCC under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
FY 24-25 has marked an acceleration in the formalisation of our ESG journey.
Building upon our existing practices, the company is in the process of
constituting an ESG Committee guided by our Board of Directors. The ESG
Committee will be further complemented by an Implementation and Monitoring
Team, to help drive sustainability efforts with oversight and accountability.
Additionally, we’re currently in the process of developing a comprehensive
decarbonisation roadmap that will establish clear, time-bound targets and a
robust framework for emissions reduction and efficiency. This approach is set
to guide our trajectory towards a more sustainable and resilient future.
DEE Piping remains dedicated to building on its ongoing ESG initiatives while
progressing towards structured goal-setting. Through a process of technical
and stakeholder consultations, the Company is developing a decarbonisation
roadmap that will shape meaningful and time-bound targets. Guided by this
approach, DEE aims to set achievable commitments that align with its long-
term vision of sustainable growth and positive impact.
At DEE Piping, we view sustainability as integral to our growth and resilience.
Our ESG journey has been strengthened through concrete initiatives that deliver
measurable impact while laying the foundation for long-term transformation.
A key achievement has been the contribution of our biomass-based waste-to-
energy power plants in Punjab, which continue to avoid significant GHG
emissions and generate rural livelihood opportunities-an effort previously
recognised by the UNFCCC under the CDM.
To institutionalize and accelerate our ESG agenda, we’re in the process of
constituting an ESG Committee and an Implementation and Monitoring Team.
These governance structures ensure that our strategy, progress, and
accountability are closely aligned with stakeholder expectations and global
best practices. Complementing this, we are implementing a comprehensive
Environmental & Social Management System (ESMS) and a structured
stakeholder engagement plan to strengthen trust and transparency.
We have also aligned our disclosures with emerging requirements, including
those linked to the EU's CBAM, and are in the process of finalising a
decarbonisation roadmap. This roadmap will establish science-based, time-
bound targets and embed risk assessments across climate, workplace safety,
and operational domains. Together, these efforts aim to balance growth with
responsibility, ensuring that we continue to create enduring value for all our
stakeholders.
Looking ahead, our focus remains on driving measurable progress, building
resilience, and positioning DEE Piping as a forward-looking leader in sustainable
industry practices.

from the packaging of incoming raw materials from our suppliers. This practice significantly minimizes the need
for virgin plastic, thereby actively reducing our environmental footprint associated with packaging.

category. Our specialized process piping solutions are designed and produced with non-hazardous materials for
their intended end-use.

industry entities, serving markets domestically and abroad. Our products are renowned for their exceptional
longevity and robust construction, designed to endure for 25-30 years or more in demanding industrial
environments. In our packaging practices, the Company champions sustainability by primarily employing recycled
and reused wood, steel, and other non-plastic materials, predominantly sourced from the packaging materials of
incoming raw materials from our suppliers. This commitment to using recovered resources reduces waste and
minimizes our environmental impact.

accountability framework. Building on its existing Whistle Blower Policy
and Fair Practice Policy, which provide employees and directors a
confidential and secure process to report ethical concerns, the Company

against victimisation, with complaints reviewed by the Chairman of
the Audit Committee.
•
The Fair Practice Policy encourages transparent reporting and
safeguards employees from retaliation.
•
In FY 24–25, the Company introduced additional policies including a
Human Rights Policy and a Supplier Code of Conduct, further
embedding accountability and ethical practices across its value chain.
•
A comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) was also finalised,
detailing systematic mechanisms for stakeholder feedback, information
disclosure, and a structured grievance resolution process at the site
level.
•
The Company also rolled out its Environmental and Social Management
System (ESMS) and ESG Framework FY 25–26, both of which integrate
grievance redressal as a core function to ensure responsiveness and
transparency.
For direct access, stakeholders may now also raise concerns by writing to
secretarial@deepiping.com, in addition to the existing whistleblower
channels. Through this expanded framework, the Company reaffirms its
commitment to transparency, responsiveness, and inclusive engagement
with all stakeholders.

7.
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions? If yes, then provide details.
Yes, the Company has projects related to reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The company operates two
biomass power generation plants located in Abohar and Muktsar, Punjab, with an annual contracted capacity of 8
MW and 6 MW, respectively. These plants generate electricity using biomass such as paddy straw, cotton stalks,
wheat stalks, and mustard straw and supply it to various consumers connected to the regional grid. The primary goal
of this project is to utilise the surplus biomass available in the region for effective electricity generation, thus reducing
GHG emissions that would have occurred from fossil fuel-based power generation. By focusing on environmental
sustainability, the Company has successfully reduced more than 191,067 tCO2e emissions by producing green power.
The biomass-based project contributes to sustainable development in several ways:
1.
Social Well-being: By purchasing crop residue from local farmers, the project provides an additional source of
income, thereby enhancing the purchasing power of the local population. The project also creates employment
opportunities by preferentially hiring local workers during the construction and operation phases. It is expected
141
Annual Report 2024-25
to employ 70-80 people directly and 2,000-2,500 people indirectly in transportation activities. Improved
connectivity to nearby locations due to the project leads to overall regional development.
2.
Economic Well-being: The project creates business opportunities for local stakeholders, such as suppliers,
manufacturers, and contractors. It helps bridge the demand-supply gap in the power-deficient regional grid,
reducing transmission losses and ensuring reliable power supply. This encourages industrial growth in the area,
contributing to regional prosperity.
3.
Environmental Well-being: The project reduces GHG emissions that would have been generated from fossil fuel-
based power plants. By utilising renewable biomass, the project promotes environmental sustainability and
conserves finite, nonrenewable resources like coal and gas.
4.
Technological Well-being: The plant employs a modern, energy-efficient, and environmentally safe steam turbo
generator and boiler capable of firing multiple fuels. This technology strengthens the grid, increases energy
availability, and improves the quality of power in nearby rural areas, thereby addressing local energy demands
and promoting technological advancement.
