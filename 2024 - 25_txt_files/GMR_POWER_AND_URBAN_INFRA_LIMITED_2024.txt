3. We have performed assurance engagement on the Identified Sustainability Information for reporting 
boundaries as disclosed under Question 13 of Section A – General Disclosures of the BRSR. 
4. Our reasonable assurance engagement is with respect to the Identified Sustainability Information for the 
reporting boundary as mentioned above for the financial year ended 31st March 2025 only unless otherwise 
stated and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements 
included in the BRSR and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon. 
Criteria 
5. The criteria used by the Holding Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is summarised 
below (hereinafter referred to as ‘Criteria’): 
a. Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘LODR Regulations’) as amended, read with SEBI 
Master circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated 11 November 2024 and SEBI Circular 
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42 dated 28 March 2025; and 
b. SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated 20 December 2024 read with 
BRSR Core Reporting Standard formulated by Industry Standards Forum.  
Management’s Responsibilities 
6. The Holding Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for 
preparing the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if 
any, related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified 
Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Inherent limitations 
7. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can 
affect comparability between entities.  
Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control 
8. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (‘IESBA’), 
which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour. 
9. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements” which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management 
including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards 
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

•
Energy Costs: High energy consumption
and inefficient energy management can
result in high energy costs, which can
impact the financial performance.
•
Energy Security: Dependence on fossil
fuels and centralized energy systems can
pose risks to energy security, such as
supply disruptions and price volatility,
which can impact the operational and
financial performance.
•
Regulatory Compliance: Non-compliance
with energy regulations, such as energy
efficiency standards and emissions
regulations, can result in fines and
penalties, as well as reputational damage,
which can impact the financial
performance.
•
Environmental Performance: High energy
consumption and emissions can have
negative environmental impacts, such as
air pollution and climate change, which
can result in increased regulatory scrutiny,
reputational damage, and potential
litigation risks.
•
Recycling: Implementing a recycling
program for construction waste, such as
asphalt, concrete, and steel, can reduce
waste disposal costs and generate
revenue by selling recycled materials.
•
Circular Economy: Adopting a circular
economy approach can promote the
reuse and recycling of materials, reduce
waste generation, and create new
business opportunities. For example,
waste materials can be used as inputs
for new products, such as recycled
asphalt or concrete.
•
Increasing efficiency: Improving water
management practices, such as
reducing water use and improving
wastewater treatment, can help energy
companies become more efficient and
reduce their operational costs.
•
Lowering risks: Water scarcity and
quality issues can pose a risk to the
energy sector, especially for companies
that rely heavily on water for their
operations. Implementing sustainable
water management practices can help
reduce these risks and ensure long-term
viability.
•
Energy Efficiency Measures:
Implementing energy efficiency
measures, such as upgrading
lighting systems, HVAC systems,
and building insulation, can reduce
energy consumption and costs.
•
Energy Management Systems:
Adopting energy management
systems, 
such 
as 
energy
monitoring 
and 
building
automation systems, can optimize

Engagement:
Engaging with stakeholders, such
as regulators, customers, and local
communities, 
can 
improve
compliance 
with

regulations 
and 
enhance
reputational 
benefits. 
By
identifying and addressing these
material 
ESG 
issues 
and
implementing effective mitigation
measures, the sector can minimize

to be absent due to illness or injury. This
can help Energy and Highways
companies improve their operational
efficiency and reduce costs.
•
Enhancing reputation: Demonstrating a
commitment to workforce health and
safety can help Energy and Highways
companies enhance their reputation
and build trust with stakeholders,
including customers, investors, and
regulators.
•
Reducing regulatory risks: The energy

health and safety regulations, and
noncompliance can result in financial
penalties and legal liability.

system 
to 
improve
occupational health and safety, eliminate
hazards and minimize OH&S risks (including
system deficiencies), take advantage of
OH&S opportunities, and address OH&S

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements
At GMR Power and Urban Infra Limited (GPUIL), our belief in sustainability is rooted in the Group’s vision of “making a difference to society through creation of value”. Given this, GPUIL continues to integrate
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles across its operations and strategic decisions.
In FY 2024–25, we moved ahead with the implementation of Energy 2.0 Strategy, a strategic initiative towards capex-light low-carbon solutions. We completed GHG inventorization aligned with ISO 14064 and
strengthened our water efficiency performance by securing ISO 46001 certification at both major units at Warora and Kamalanga. Further, nearly 100% fly ash utilization, expansion of rooftop solar capacity, and
promotion of biomass usage reinforced our commitment to circularity and emission reduction. We launched a CO2 reduction pilot program at Warora, aimed at driving long-term decarbonization. A significant
achievement, for the year, came in form of Warora becoming the first thermal power plant in India to receive a Gold Rating under the CII Blue Rating Program. Both Warora and Kamalanga units received
recognition from the National Productivity Council in the ‘Pradarshak’ category along with multiple other national recognitions for environmental stewardship.
On the social front, GPUIL continued its focus across community empowerment, employee well-being and safety. Through the GMR Varalakshmi Foundation, we positively impacted over 70,000 lives. It is
noteworthy that over 95% of these beneficiaries were from marginalized and vulnerable communities. Warora’s certification under SA 8000 reflects our commitment to labour rights, while targeted investments
in occupational health, inclusion, and mental well-being reinforce our employee-first culture. Kamalanga also received the prestigious Sword of Honor from the British Safety Council for its robust Occupational
Health and Safety Management System.
Guided by the ESG Committee and other Board level Committees, we have continued to our rigour across aspects such as data protection, anti-corruption safeguards, ethical conduct through ongoing capacity
building and awareness programs.
As we move ahead, GPUIL remains steadfast in its pursuit of long-term value creation by aligning its business model with national sustainability imperatives. Through a future-focused, technology-driven, and
socially-inclusive ESG strategy, we aspire to lead India’s energy security and transition and contribute to a more sustainable, equitable tomorrow.

Plastics: Plastic waste is primarily generated through packaging materials. It is sold as scrap to authorized recyclers to
avoid landfill disposal. In certain cases, innovative technology is deployed at highways by integrating plastic waste into
road construction as per IRC SP 98-2013 guidelines. This enhances road durability while addressing plastic waste management
•
E-Waste: E-waste such as LEDs, computers, and accessories is stored in designated areas and sold to authorized recyclers
in compliance with environmental regulation. In certain cases the equipment may be replaced and returned to the service
provider.
•
Hazardous Waste: Hazardous waste is collected and stored in designated hazardous waste facilities and then sent to
authorized recyclers compliant with environmental regulations. Used batteries are returned to authorized dealers/recyclers,
in line with the regulations.
•
Other Waste: Fly ash is fully utilized for bricks, cement manufacturing, and road construction as per fly ash notification.
Sludge is used as manure for horticulture development. Domestic waste is segregated into biodegradable and non-
biodegradable at source. Biodegradable waste is processed via in-house mechanical bio-digester to produce compost,
used for horticulture. Non-biodegradable waste is sent to authorized municipal vendors or recyclers. Significant portions
of construction waste is reused or recycled, especially in road/highway projects. Non-hazardous operational waste like
scrap is sold via tender for recycling. Damaged solar PV modules are handled by the OEM for safe recycling/disposal.

Yes, HR related grievances can be logged by the employees through the 'Ask HR' section of
the intranet portal. Post logging of the grievance, it is allotted to the concerned SPOC who is
responsible for providing a resolution in two working days. In cases, where the resolution is
not provided within two working days, automatic escalation happens, with the resolution
turn-around time of one working day. In cases which still remain open post escalation,
Operational Head of HR is required to provide resolution on priority.
For non-HR related operations, employees can raise such grievances in written to the reporting
authority, who is required to provide resolution within five working days. In cases where
resolution requires more time, the complainant should be informed within five working days.
For an unsatisfactory resolution, the employee can write to Head of the Department with a
copy to Business HR who would be providing the resolution in two working days. The grievance
is reviewed and post consultation with the relevant stakeholders, feedback / resolution is
provided to the employee. If the employee finds the resolution to be inadequate, he / she can
submit the grievance to the CEO / Group CXO (GCXO), who is required to provide the employee
a personal hearing within two working days on receipt of the grievance and document the
discussion. Post examining the grievance, aggrieved employee is provided a solution within
10 working days. Here, the CEO / GCXO may consult a neutral expert consultant or committee
before taking a decision. The aggrieved employee who is not satisfied with the decision of the
CEO / GCXO has an option to appeal to Chairman with the detailed reasons for the appeal.
The Chairman will take a decision and communicate the same within 7 working days from the
receipt of the appeal and the decision will be considered final and binding.

a.
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes,
the coverage such system?
Yes, an Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) has been implemented by GPUIL. The system is aligned
with ISO 45001 standards and is in place across all major assets. It covers employees and contractors operating at our units. It
includes structured processes such as Permit to Work (PTW), Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control (HIRAC),
Certified medical teams on site for occupational health services etc.
6th Annual Report 2024-25
133
b.
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the
entity?
GPUIL has implemented a comprehensive process to identify and assess work-related hazards and risks on both routine and
non-routine basis, as part of its ISO 45001-certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS). Hazard
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) is conducted for plant activities, ensuring risks are evaluated and mitigated before
the commencement of any task. Detailed Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is prepared and reviewed, specific to the task and location.
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Work Instructions (WIs) are developed for each activity based on HIRA outcomes to
guide safe execution. A Permit to Work (PTW) system is in place to manage high-risk tasks, ensuring that necessary controls are
enforced prior to job initiation. These processes apply to all departments and personnel, from top management to the ground-
level workforce, including contractors at the units.
c.
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.
(Y/N)
Yes, GPUIL has well-defined processes in place that allow workers to report work-related hazards and withdraw from unsafe
conditions as part of its robust Occupational Health and Safety Management System. Employees and contractors at site are
actively encouraged to report hazards through structured mechanisms such as near-miss reporting systems, safety observations,
and suggestion schemes. These inputs are formally captured and addressed through safety forums, plant-level safety committees,
and the "Sarathi" safety incident management platform. All employees or contractors are empowered to halt or not undertake
tasks until identified risks are mitigated to acceptable levels, in line with the Hierarchy of Controls principle. This participatory
framework ensures that safety concerns are promptly addressed and that everyone has the right and means to remove themselves
from hazardous situations without fear of reprisal.
d.
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
Yes. GPUIL has medical centres at all the offices which are accessible to the employees and contractors.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
GPUIL has instituted a comprehensive set of measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace for all employees and contract
workers across its operations. The entity has implemented a robust Occupational Health and Safety Management System
aligned with ISO 45001, encompassing clear safety protocols, and emergency response plans. Regular safety training and
awareness programs are conducted for employees and contract workforce, often facilitated by external experts, and include
mental health and stress management workshops. For high-risk tasks, Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is conducted, and third-party
safety audits are carried out to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards.
To further mitigate risks, appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets, gloves, and masks is provided, with
a focus on continuous improvement in PPE quality and usage. Health and wellness are supported through on-site medical
facilities or hospital tie-ups, regular BMI checks, periodic health check-ups, and Employee Assistance Programs. Clean and
ergonomically designed workspaces with proper lighting, ventilation, sanitation, and noise control are maintained to prevent
physical strain and promote hygiene. Emergency preparedness is reinforced through routine fire drills, mock drills, and first aid
training.
The Company also has well-defined mechanisms for reporting and addressing safety concerns. These include anonymous
reporting systems, regular safety committee meetings, and digital platforms to track and investigate incidents and near-misses.
All these measures collectively reinforce GPUIL's commitment to creating a safe, healthy, and compliant work environment for
its workforce.

15. Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant
risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
GPUIL has a structured approach in place for taking corrective actions in response to safety-related incidents and addressing
significant risks identified through health and safety assessments. Corrective actions are tracked and implemented under the
framework of its ISO 45001-certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS). Following any incident or
observation, root cause analyses are conducted, and corresponding corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) are implemented
to eliminate recurrence. These actions are reviewed at safety committee meetings and tracked through internal digital systems
"Sarathi". Additionally, third-party safety audits, job safety analyses (JSA), and routine inspections help proactively identify gaps
or unsafe conditions, which are promptly addressed through updated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), retraining, and
engineering or administrative controls.
At the GMR Warora plant, for example, significant risks are mitigated through safety modifications in equipment, enhanced PPE
protocols, and periodic safety drills. At the highway operations, awareness campaigns and stakeholder engagement (e.g.,
during National Safety Week, road safety drives, and distribution of safety kits) have been undertaken as corrective actions in
response to safety risk hotspots on corridors.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices
adopted to manage such wastes.
GPUIL adopts a structured and compliant waste management approach focused on segregation, recycling, and safe disposal.
At power plants, fly ash is utilized in bricks, cement, and roads, while sludge is used as manure. Biodegradable waste is composted
on-site, and non-biodegradable waste is sent to authorized recyclers. Units follow IMS-defined procedures for hazardous and
non-hazardous waste, with departmental reduction targets reviewed monthly. Across sites, used batteries and e-waste are
returned or sold to authorized handlers. GPUIL also minimizes hazardous chemical use through reduction targets and process
improvements.
