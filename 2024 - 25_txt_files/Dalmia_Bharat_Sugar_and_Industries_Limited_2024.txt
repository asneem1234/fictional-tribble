Overview
Digital Transformation: 
Sweetening the Future
Our legacy as a leading integrated sugar and 
ethanol producer has always been rooted in physical 
infrastructure and agricultural strength. But in today’s 
world, growth is no longer defined by scale alone—it 
is defined by agility, intelligence, and sustainability. 
That’s why we are embedding digital capabilities 
across our manufacturing and supply chain ecosystem, 
using data and automation to optimise every step 
from cane field to ethanol tank.
FY2025 marked an inflection point in this journey. With 
a clear roadmap, we accelerated the digitalisation 
of our operations—from real-time SCADA and DCS 
systems in our plants, to predictive maintenance using 
IoT, and even satellite-based Crop Monitoring that 
links the farm to the factory. Every process is being 
retooled for greater efficiency, every asset is being 
repurposed for sustainability, and every byte of insight 
is being leveraged for smarter decisions.
Yet digital transformation for us is not just about 
hardware or software - it’s about reshaping how we 
create value. It allows us to scale responsibly, manage 
volatility more effectively, and deepen our stakeholder 
relationships through transparency and traceability.
As we scale capacity, diversify our feedstock, expand 
green energy output, and modernise our workforce, 
our goal remains clear: to be a future-ready enterprise 
where sustainability and profitability go hand in hand.
Through ”Digital Transformation: Sweetening the 
Future”, we are building a business that is not only fit 
for the present but resilient for the decades ahead.
At Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited (Dalmia Bharat Sugar/DBSIL/Company)’, 
we are reimagining our future—one that is not only productive and profitable but also 
intelligent, inclusive, and low-carbon. The theme for this year’s Integrated Annual Report, 
Digital Transformation: Sweetening the Future, reflects this purposeful shift.
As we scale capacity, diversify feedstock, and expand green 
energy, our aim is clear: building a future-ready enterprise 
where sustainability and profitability go hand in hand.

[GRI 2-1 to 2-4, 2-22, 2-29, 3-1 to 3-3]
About This Report
This report is anchored in the strategic theme “Digital Transformation: Sweetening 
the Future.” It presents the Company’s performance and value-creation narrative in the 
context of its operating environment in FY2025 — a year that marked a transition from 
foundational investments to tangible outcomes. The report illustrates how the Company 
continues to build resilience, pursue sustainable growth, and create long-term value for 
stakeholders. The integrated business model highlights a holistic, forward-looking approach 
that reinforces the Company’s contribution to inclusive and sustainable 
national development.
Reporting Boundary and Scope
Our reporting for FY2025 is grounded in the principles 
of transparency, materiality, and integrated value 
creation. Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited 
adopts the Integrated Reporting Framework developed 
by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) 
to articulate how we create value over time through the 
effective use of six capitals—Financial, Manufactured, 
Intellectual, Human, Social & Relationship, and Natural. 
This approach is complemented by our adherence to 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, with 
particular alignment to GRI 3: Material Topics 2021. The 
materiality determination process involves identifying 
and prioritising actual and potential impacts on the 
economy, environment, and people—including human 
rights—across the organisation’s operations and business 
relationships. These issues, regardless of their immediate 
financial materiality, are considered critical to value 
creation and are disclosed accordingly. This structured 
methodology ensures our Integrated Annual Report and 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) 
reflect stakeholder priorities, comply with regulatory 
expectations, and support our alignment with the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). The 
Materiality Matrix serves as a central cross-referencing 
tool linking material topics to strategic pillars, GRI 
Standards, and stakeholder concerns, ensuring 
transparency, relevance, and comparability.
Integrated Reporting Principles and Our 
Approach
The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) 
merged with the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) in 2021 to form the Value Reporting 
Foundation, which was then consolidated into the IFRS 
Foundation in 2022. The Integrated Reporting Framework 
is now maintained by the International Sustainability 
Standards Board (ISSB)under the IFRS Foundation. 
Despite these transitions, the framework remains widely 
used and is actively promoted for its role in fostering 
integrated thinking and holistic value reporting.
The Integrated Reporting Framework is founded on a set 
of guiding principles that underpin the preparation and 
presentation of an integrated report. These principles 
aim to provide a holistic view of how an organisation 
creates value over time across multiple capitals. DBSIL 
affirms its commitment to these principles and embeds 
them across this Integrated Annual Report for FY2025 
through structured disclosures, narrative clarity, and 
a cross-referenced architecture that aligns strategy, 
performance, governance, risks, and material issues.
IIRC’s Guiding Principles and Our Alignment
IIRC Principle
Principle Definition
Our Implementation Approach in FY2025 Report
Strategic Focus 
and Future 
Orientation
The report should show a holistic 
picture by connecting factors that 
affect value creation over time.
Connectivity is established through cross-referencing 
systems that link material issues to strategic pillars, GRI 
disclosures, UNSDGs, business model components, and risks 
(see Materiality Matrix, GRI Index, and Risk and Governance 
chapters).
Connectivity of 
Information
The report should explain how the 
organisation’s relationships with 
stakeholders affect value creation.
Stakeholder perspectives are addressed through dedicated 
disclosures (see Stakeholder Engagement, CSR, and Human 
Capital sections). Material topics have been determined 
through a structured stakeholder engagement process.
Stakeholder 
Relationships
The report should disclose information 
about matters that substantively 
affect the organisation’s ability to 
create value.
Material issues have been identified and prioritised based 
on their significance to stakeholders and impact on business 
(see Materiality Matrix). These are linked to GRI Standards 
and UNSDGs for transparency.
Materiality
The report should be concise, avoiding 
excessive detail or duplication.
This report uses summary tables, pullouts, and icons to 
present complex information clearly, while detailed content 
is layered in annexures such as the GRI Index and Corporate 
Governance Report.
Conciseness
All material matters, both positive 
and negative, must be presented in a 
balanced and accurate manner.
The report covers both achievements and risks. Our 
disclosures are based on verifiable data points and aligned 
with SEBI’s BRSR requirements (see BRSR Report on 
page 219).
Reliability and 
Completeness
The report should enable 
comparisons over time and with other 
organisations.
Multi-year data comparisons are provided for key 
performance indicators across financial, operational, and 
ESG dimensions
Grounded in the IIRC 
framework and GRI 
Standards, our reporting 
reflects what truly 
matters to stakeholders 
and value creation.

Managing Director’s Review
Dear Stakeholders,
It is my privilege to present my review for the financial year ended 31st March, 2025. This year 
has been defined by our strategic focus on “Digital Transformation: Sweetening the Future,” 
the central theme of our Integrated Annual Report. This theme reflects our intent to leverage 
technology as a driver of efficiency, sustainability, and long-term value across our operations.
FY2025 presented external challenges, including reduced cane availability in Uttar Pradesh 
and regulatory restrictions on sugar diversion for ethanol production. Despite these pressures, 
our focus on digital transformation played a key role in helping us navigate this evolving 
environment. We concentrated on optimising operations, integrating recent investments, and 
strengthening our strategic position by translating past investments into measurable outcomes.
Reflecting on FY2025, we navigated a dynamic external environment with resilience and 
strategic effectiveness. We achieved a Total Income of `3,820 crore in FY2025, representing 
a significant increase of approximately 26% over the `3,028 crore reported in FY2024. This 
top-line expansion was accompanied by a substantial improvement in profitability, with Profit 
After Tax rising to `387 crore, an increase of over 42% compared to `272 crore in FY2024. As 
a result, our Basic Earnings Per Share improved to approximately `47.78  up from `33.66 in the 
previous year. Crucially, we strengthened our financial position considerably by achieving  the 
gearing ratio of 0.18x recorded at the end of FY2025.
In FY2025, we also made decisive strides in strengthening the foundational capitals that 
underpin our long-term value creation. Our Intellectual Capital was enhanced through 
targeted R&D, such as the Sugarcane Seed Varietal Enhancement programme, and the 
deployment of digital tools—satellite imaging, geo-sensing, and SAP Ariba—that deepened 
data-driven decision-making across operations. These initiatives were complemented 
by structured digital upskilling, aligning Human Capital with our innovation agenda. We 
advanced workforce capabilities through customised learning modules, while embedding 
inclusivity, safety, and ethics via robust engagement and redressal mechanisms. On the

Overview
Natural Capital front, we adopted a regenerative approach—evidenced by a 15% year-on-
year reduction in emissions intensity and zero environmental non-compliances. Our operations 
sustained 100% Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) status and delivered significant water conservation 
outcomes, supported by a `575 lakh investment. Concurrently, our Social and Relationship 
Capital efforts centred on trust-building through continuous stakeholder engagement. 
Structured community feedback loops, alignment with national welfare schemes, and proactive 
CSR execution reinforced our identity as a responsive, responsible, and future-
ready organisation—one that integrates technology, sustainability, and inclusion into its core 
business ethos.
As a result, FY2025 was a pivotal year for your Company, defined by the integration of digital 
intelligence, disciplined capital deployment, and operational resilience. We translated long-
term strategies into measurable outcomes across core value levers - from manufacturing and 
agriculture to sustainability, finance, and people capability.
Digital Transformation: Embedding Intelligence Across 
the Value Chain
Digitalisation is not merely a project, but a company-wide agenda embedded in every layer of 
our operations. we prepared our enterprise-wide digital transformation roadmap. Now in the 
phase of implementation and once it is fully implemented will deliver real-time responsiveness, 
energy optimisation, predictive maintenance, and systemic transparency. We are in the process 
of putting  predictive IoT platforms, enabling visibility, reliability, and improved decision-making, 
Smart manufacturing systems and AI-driven forecasting tools enhanced throughput, uptime, 
and returns on invested capital. Across procurement, SAP Ariba implementation resulted in 
streamlined vendor collaboration and  digitised sourcing workflows with aim to optimized 
procurement cost.
Our agronomy operations also saw a leap forward. We scaled regenerative farming pilots, 
linked field-level data with factory analytics. We are in the process of  deploying  satellite 
sensing and drone technology to improve cane yield, soil health, and input efficiency. Research 
and development activities focused on seed quality improvement and data-driven productivity 
enhancement, reinforcing our commitment to future-ready farming. 
Human capital was a key enabler. We launched focused upskilling programs on digital tools, 
analytics, and automation. Digital learning platforms like Nalanda were leveraged to increase 
accessibility, while simulation tools and interactive content supported deeper engagement. 
Industry 4.0 skills and digitised SOPs were embedded across functions, ensuring our people are 
equipped to lead in a digitised environment.
Manufacturing and Infrastructure: Scaling Smart, 
Sustainable Assets
In FY2025, we focused on building a future-ready manufacturing ecosystem by scaling smart, 
sustainable infrastructure and deriving operational leverage from prior investments. Despite 
external challenges - including reduced sugarcane availability in Uttar Pradesh and regulatory 
constraints on sugar diversion for ethanol - we maintained healthy plant utilisation and 
completed all major expansion projects on schedule. Significant capacity enhancements were 
delivered across the sugar business. The Nigohi unit was upgraded to 10,500 TCD, Ramgarh 
to 7,700 TCD along with a modernised packing house, and Ninaidevi reached 4,000 TCD 
with improved diversion capacity. The newly acquired Baghauli Sugar and Distillery Limited, 
comprising a 3,500 TCD sugar unit and 12 MW co-generation plant, was revived and made 
operational within just 90 days of acquisition - an outcome that demonstrated execution speed 
and operational discipline.
In the ethanol segment, installed distillation capacity reached 850 KLPD, supported by the 
full-year contribution of the 250 KLPD grain-based plant at Jawaharpur. These upgrades were 
strategically timed and completed ahead of the crushing season, ensuring seamless integration 
into FY2025–26 performance cycles. 
Our Capital expenditure for the year was directed toward high-impact projects designed to 
increase capacity, embed digital maturity, improve environmental performance, and build long-
term operational resilience. Our ability to pivot between feedstocks, combined with digitally 
synchronised systems, provided the flexibility to adapt production in response to market 
dynamics while sustaining efficiency and quality standards. This de-risked scalability approach 
has positioned us to capture full performance benefits in the coming fiscal year, further 
strengthening our leadership in the sugar and ethanol ecosystem.
FY2025 marked a 
transformative year with 
key capacity upgrades 
driving scale and resilience.

Overview
Financial Capital: 
Prudent Stewardship and Growth-Driven Allocation
In FY2025, we adopted a financial strategy rooted in prudence and forward-looking capital 
allocation. We balanced our ambition for growth with a disciplined approach to managing the 
balance sheet - ensuring resilience across operational cycles while investing in capabilities 
aligned with our long-term strategic objectives.
We demonstrated strong financial performance, generating `450.45 crore in Cash from 
Operations during the year. This robust internal accrual base enabled us to pursue capital 
expansion without undue leverage. Access to concessional finance - particularly through 
government-supported interest subvention schemes for ethanol-linked projects - further 
strengthened this position. These schemes reimburse approximately 50% of the interest burden, 
resulting in an effective borrowing cost of around 6%. We maintained a conservative capital 
structure, with a Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.18x as of 31st March, 2025, reflecting a well-
balanced and robust financial foundation.
During the year, `149crore was deployed as capital expenditure towards high-impact, growth-
oriented investments. Key allocations included the commissioning of the Baghauli grain-based 
distillery and the expansion of ethanol capacity at the Jawaharpur unit - both strategically 
aligned with the national ethanol blending roadmap. Additional investments were directed 
towards supply chain digitisation, leveraging platforms like SAP Ariba, and smart agriculture 
initiatives, including drone-enabled fertiliser application and satellite-based geo-sensing to 
enhance field-level productivity. All capital allocation decisions were guided by a disciplined 
productivity lens, aiming to maximise asset yields, reduce operating costs, and strengthen our 
strategic positioning. Investment decisions were calibrated to prevailing market conditions and 
sector fundamentals, with an internal rate of return (IRR) expectation in the range of 18–20%.
Innovation and Research: Accelerating Productivity and Precision
In FY2025, we advanced our innovation and research agenda as a strategic enabler of 
sustainable growth. We focused on embedding precision and data-driven intelligence across 
our agricultural and industrial value chains to boost productivity and operational efficiency. 
On the agricultural front, we continued to strengthen our sugarcane seed varietal programme, 
addressing key agronomic challenges and improving yield performance. We also piloted 
advanced precision farming technologies, including satellite-based geo-sensing and drone-
enabled fertiliser application, with notable implementation at the Baghauli unit. These tools 
generated granular data to optimise resource use and enhance field-level decision-making.
Within factory operations, we invested in process innovation and began exploring AI-enabled 
manufacturing intelligence to support predictive analytics and real-time optimisation. This 
integrated approach created a continuous feedback loop between innovation, execution, and 
impact, ensuring that process improvements are both scalable and measurable. Crucially, the 
innovation agenda informed workforce capability-building efforts, further strengthening the 
integration between Intellectual and Human Capital. Through this synergy, we are positioning 
ourselves as a technology-led enterprise, ready to meet the evolving demands of the sugar and 
ethanol ecosystem.
Strategic Ethanol Expansion: Capturing the Biofuel Opportunity
In alignment with India’s National Biofuel Policy, we pursued a deliberate and assertive 
sugar-to-ethanol diversification strategy in FY2025. Despite regulatory constraints on sugar 
diversion during the year, we maintained high plant utilisation by leveraging our feedstock 
flexibility, particularly through expanded grain-based distillation capacity. Our operational 
ethanol capacity reached 850 KLPD, supported by the full-year contribution of the 250 KLPD 
grain-based facility at Jawaharpur. These strategic investments were completed ahead of 
the crushing season to ensure seamless integration and full-scale performance in FY2025–26. 
This pivot to grain-based ethanol not only mitigated the impact of sugar market volatility and 
diversion restrictions but also strengthened our alignment with the national goal of achieving 
20% ethanol blending. As ethanol continues to emerge as a key driver of future value, our 
biofuel strategy is positioned to deliver both environmental benefits and long-term 
financial resilience.
Risk-Adjusted Growth and Financial Prudence
Our growth in FY2025 was pursued with a risk-adjusted approach, assessing and managing 
risks related to market volatility, policy changes, and operational factors. We made measured 
capital allocation decisions for strategic investments and expansions, including those aligned 
with our digital transformation efforts. Our financial approach in FY2025 centered on 
balancing growth aspirations with prudent financial stewardship, leveraging strong cash flows 
for future-ready investments aligned with the digital transformation theme. We continue to 
manage our debt effectively. We remain strategically confident in our grain-based ethanol and 
blended revenue base, supported by policy tailwinds such as ethanol blending targets.
As we move forward, we do so with renewed confidence in our strategic direction and the 
resilience of our integrated business model. We are committed to deepening our digital 
capabilities, expanding sustainable practices, and investing in our people, communities, and 
innovation agenda. Our journey of transformation is a shared one, and we are grateful for the 
trust and support of all our stakeholders. On behalf of the leadership team, we extend our 
sincere thanks to our shareholders, employees, farmers, business partners, and customers for 
standing with us as we continue to build a future-ready Company.

Overview
Global and Domestic Sugar 
Industry Trends
India remains at the heart of the global sugar economy - 
as the world’s second-largest producer and consumer of 
sugar, and as a critical player in the livelihoods of nearly 
50 million farmers and rural workers. Sugar continues 
to be a staple of the Indian agro-based economy, 
underpinned by consistent domestic demand driven by a 
growing population.
However, the sector continues to face cyclical pressures. 
Global and domestic price volatility, climate-induced 
variations in cane output, surplus inventory management, 
and export competitiveness remain key concerns. Indian 
sugar exporters contend with structural advantages held 
by surplus-producing countries such as Brazil, including 
favourable exchange rates and export subsidies. In 
addition, climate variability has increasingly disrupted 
sowing patterns and yields, further compounding supply-
side unpredictability.
Despite these structural constraints, FY2025 presented 
the potential for recovery, with prospects of improved 
production volumes in 2025–26. The industry’s ability 
to rebound will depend not only on weather patterns 
and cane availability but also on policy continuity and 
infrastructure readiness to adapt to demand shifts in 
both domestic and global markets.
Policy and Regulatory Landscape
The regulatory environment continues to play a critical 
role in shaping the trajectory of the Indian sugar and 
ethanol industry. The Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), 
a cornerstone of India’s National Bioenergy Strategy, 
remains a transformative opportunity for the sector. 
Having achieved the 10% national blending milestone 
in June 2022, India is now targeting 20% blending by 
2025–26. This ambition necessitates the expansion of 
ethanol capacity, particularly through the use of grain-
based feedstocks and surplus sugar derivatives, thereby 
converting agricultural overcapacity into strategic 
energy resources.
Policy incentives such as interest subvention schemes, 
assured offtake pricing by Oil Marketing Companies 
(OMCs), and enabling frameworks for cane-based and 
grain-based ethanol production continue to provide 
financial viability to integrated sugar-ethanol players. 
Importantly, the Government of India introduced the 
Sugar (Control) Order, 2025during the year to modernise 
sectoral oversight, improve supply chain transparency, 
and bring ethanol diversion and by-products under 
clearer regulatory scope.
Nonetheless, FY2025 was not without disruption. In late 
2023, the government temporarily suspended the use 
of cane syrup for ethanol due to projected lower sugar 
output, which affected realisations and volumes in both 
sugar and ethanol segments. While this decision was 
short-term in nature, it highlighted the sensitivity of the 
sector to policy recalibrations. We remain optimistic 
about a full resumption of ethanol-from-cane permissions 
in the 2024–25 season, which would restore momentum 
in integrated production.
Our acquisition of Baghauli Sugar and Distillery Limited 
in December 2023, including a 100 KLPD grain-based 
distillery, was a strategic move to strengthen our ethanol 
capacity and de-risk our product portfolio. In addition, 
the use of bagasse-based cogeneration continues to 
enhance our renewable energy footprint while offering 
the potential for future carbon credit monetisation. DBSIL 
actively participates in industry forums and structured 
government dialogues to help shape long-term ethanol 
and sugar sector reforms.
Climate-Related and Socio-
Economic Factors
Climate change continues to be a defining factor in 
our operational strategy. As an agro-based enterprise, 
we are exposed to water stress, unpredictable 
monsoons, and rising temperatures, especially in 
key cane-producing states such as Uttar Pradesh 
and Maharashtra. These conditions necessitate an 
integrated climate response, including precision 
farming, regenerative agriculture, and improved water 
stewardship.
India’s national commitment to reach net-zero 
emissions by 2070 places ethanol, bagasse-based 
power, and circular practices at the centre of the low-
carbon transition. Ethanol production from biomass 
significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions 
compared to fossil fuels and plays a key role in 
lowering urban air pollution and enhancing energy 
independence. In FY2025, our total renewable energy 
consumption remained at 1066 million KJ, matching the 
previous year.
We continue to invest in sustainable water 
infrastructure, including desilting, pond rejuvenation, 
and new harvesting structures, as part of our long-term 
water positivity goals. The interplay between land, 
water, and energy use is now central to our Natural 
Capital strategy, with multiple cross-linkages to 
climate resilience and social responsibility.
From a socio-economic standpoint, our business 
model is deeply embedded in rural ecosystems. Our 
operations not only support direct employment but 
also contribute to community welfare through targeted 
CSR investments. In FY2025, our CSR expenditure 
stood at `7.25 crore, consistent with FY2024. Our 
projects focused on education, health, sanitation, and 
livelihood generation - ranging from water purification 
plants and school infrastructure to income-generating 
tools and skill development. These efforts are aligned 
with the Swachh Bharat mission and underscore our 
commitment to inclusive growth.
India@2047: Our Role in Nation-Building
In alignment with India’s long-term vision of becoming 
a developed economy by 2047, we view our strategic 
investments in clean energy, sustainable agriculture, 
and ethanol blending as a contribution to national 
priorities. The transition from fossil fuels to biofuels, the 
goal of doubling farmer incomes, and the emphasis on 
rural industrialisation are all areas where DBSIL plays a 
catalytic role.
Our theme for the year Digital Transformation: 
Sweetening the Future, symbolises the convergence 
of past investments with current impact. Through 
operational excellence, digital innovation, stakeholder 
empowerment, and policy advocacy, we are helping 
shape a resilient and future-ready sugar and biofuel 
industry - one that contributes meaningfully to India’s 
energy security, environmental goals, and social equity.
We remain committed to working alongside policymakers, 
communities, and partners to build a thriving ecosystem 
that enables sustained value creation - not just for our 
stakeholders, but for the nation at large.

Extreme climate events (droughts, floods, heatwaves) are disrupting sugarcane 
cultivation, reducing yields, and threatening raw material supply. For instance, more 
frequent droughts and floods linked to climate change are destroying crops and 
plunging farmers into debt. This poses a risk to the company’s production volume 
and financial performance. Adapting through climate-resilient cane varieties, crop 
insurance, and farm support programs is critical to sustain farmer livelihoods and 
secure the supply chain.

Sugarcane is a highly water-intensive crop (about 2,000 litres of water needed 
to produce 1 kg of sugar). Over-dependence on water in both farming and milling 
means water scarcity or poor irrigation practices which can severely impact 
operations. Sustainable water management – e.g. drip irrigation in cane fields, 
rainwater harvesting, recycling process water – is material for reducing costs and 
avoiding conflict with local communities. Any threat to water availability directly 
affects the environment and society, making water stewardship a vital issue for 
long-term business continuity.

Waste Management 
& Circular Economy
UNSDGs: 
 
GRI Standards: 
GRI 306 (Waste), GRI 301 
(Materials), 
GRI 302 (Energy)
Sugar and distillery operations generate substantial waste and effluents – e.g. press 
mud (filter cake), bagasse ash, distillery spent wash, boiler emissions. Improper 
waste disposal can pollute land, air, and water, harming the company’s reputation 
and violating regulations. Villagers in sugar belts often “bear the brunt of poorly 
implemented environmental regulations and water scarcity” when mills discharge 
untreated waste. Thus, achieving zero waste through a circular economy approach 
is a material opportunity. The Company can convert by-products into value: e.g. use 
bagasse (cane fibre) as biofuel for power, process press mud into bio-compost, and 
ferment molasses to ethanol. This not only ensures compliance with environmental 
laws but also creates additional revenue streams and reduces environmental impact.
Stakeholders Concerned:

Our response:
Waste Management & Circular Economy is a material issue encompassing both environmental and 
social dimensions. Recognizing the potential impacts of waste and effluents, we actively pursue a 
circular economy approach, viewing waste as a valuable resource. We utilize by-products like bagasse 
for power generation, molasses for ethanol production, and press mud for bio-compost or biogas. Our 
operations are supported by Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems to eliminate effluent release. These 
initiatives reduce environmental footprint and create value, addressing stakeholder concerns.
Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions 
& Clean Energy
UNSDGs: 
GRI Standards: 
GRI 302 (Energy), GRI 305 
(Emissions)
The sugar industry’s value chain contributes significantly to GHG emissions – from 
cane cultivation (methane from crop decay) to processing (energy use). Managing 
the carbon footprint is material, especially as India transitions to a low-carbon 
economy. The Company has opportunities to mitigate emissions by using renewable 
energy: for example, bagasse-based cogeneration to produce electricity and 
steam, which replaces fossil fuels and lowers carbon emissions. Similarly,  ethanol 
produced from molasses or cane juice can be used as a biofuel to cut transport 
emissions nationwide. Focusing on energy efficiency in operations and investing in 
clean energy not only reduce environmental impact but can earn carbon credits and 
meet stakeholder expectations for climate action.
Stakeholders Concerned:
Government/Regulators (climate targets, renewable energy policies); Investors 
(ESG and climate-risk considerations); Customers/Oil companies (who blend 
ethanol as fuel); Communities (benefit from cleaner air); Employees (pride and 
security in working for a sustainable business).
ESG Dimension:
Environmental
Capitals Impacted (IIRC)
Natural (climate stability, air quality); Manufactured (power plants, boilers running on renewables); 
Financial (energy costs, carbon credit potential); Intellectual (R&D in clean tech).
Our response:
Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Clean Energy is a material issue for us, linked to Natural, Manufactured, 
Financial, and Intellectual Capital. We address this through a circular economy approach, treating by-
products as resources. Bagasse is used in our cogeneration plants to produce 100% renewable energy 
for our operations and export to the grid, replacing fossil fuels. Our ethanol production, primarily from 
molasses and grain supports the national biofuel policy, contributing to reducing transport sector 
emissions. We also prioritize energy efficiency measures in our operations. These initiatives moderate 
our carbon footprint and support a low-carbon economy, aligning with stakeholder expectations.
Materiality Matters
We adopt a circular economy approach- 
transforming waste into value through 
by-product reuse and Zero Liquid 
Discharge systems.

Performance), 
GRI 302 (Energy), GRI 203 
(Indirect Economic Impacts)
Over-reliance on a single product (sugar) is risky given cyclical prices and policy 
controls. Diversifying into ethanol production and renewable power is a material 
strategic opportunity. The Indian government has advanced its target of 20% ethanol 
blending in petrol to 2025, creating robust demand for ethanol. This provides the 
Company a chance to use excess cane or molasses to produce ethanol, turning 
a policy mandate into profit. Ethanol and power exports also generate additional 
income and cushion the impact of sugar price volatility. Moreover, these businesses 
support rural development – ethanol production “offers a new source of income for 
farmers” and revitalizes rural economies. Pursuing innovation (such as newer biofuel 
technologies, higher-efficiency cogeneration turbines, or even other cane-derived 
products) increases the company’s Intellectual Capital and future-readiness. Overall, 
diversification aligns with both Financial Capital growth and Natural Capital 
conservation by contributing to cleaner energy.
Stakeholders Concerned:

Our response:
Business Diversification & Innovation (Ethanol and Renewable Power) is a material strategic 
opportunity impacting our Financial, Manufactured, Natural, and Intellectual Capital. Recognizing the 
cyclical nature of the sugar business, we have significantly diversified our operations. Our focus on 
ethanol production leverages molasses and grain, capitalizing on India’s Ethanol Blending Programme 
(EBP). We expanded our Jawaharpur grain-based distillery capacity in FY2024 and acquired the 
Baghauli Sugar and Distillery Limited which included a distillery. Ethanol provides guaranteed volumes 
and prices, reducing dependency on sugar price volatility. Our bagasse-based cogeneration plants 
produce renewable energy for internal use and export, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering 
our carbon footprint. This strategy enhances financial resilience and contributes to a cleaner energy 
landscape.
Farmer Prosperity 
& Responsible 
Sourcing
UNSDGs: 
GRI Standards: 
GRI 204 (Procurement 
Practices), 
GRI 413 (Local Communities)
Sugarcane farmers are the lifeblood of the business – the company’s profitability 
and raw material supply depend on their well-being. In India, ~50 million people’s 
livelihoods are linked to sugarcane, with ~6 million farmers directly engaged. Key 
issues include ensuring farmers receive fair and timely payments for cane, providing 
agronomic support to boost yields, and promoting sustainable farming practices 
(to improve soil health and reduce input costs). The sector has faced challenges 
of high input costs, low farm productivity, and unstable cane prices. If farmers 
are not financially viable, they may switch crops or default on loans, threatening 
the company’s supply chain. Thus, investing in Social & Relationship Capital 
with farmers – e.g. through training on better cultivation techniques, seeds and 
fertilizer support, and transparent cane procurement policies – is a material issue. 
Strengthening farmer incomes and resilience (for example, through crop insurance 
or sharing gains from ethanol by-product sales) not only secures raw material supply 
but also maintains the company’s social license to operate in rural areas.
Stakeholders Concerned:
Farmers (income and livelihood security); Government/Agri Authorities (rural income 
and food security concerns); Investors (supply chain stability, no disruptions from farmer 
agitations); Local communities (many are farming communities benefiting from 
prosperity).
ESG Dimension:
Social
Capitals Impacted (IIRC)
Social & Relationship (farmer relations); Human (knowledge transfer in farming); Natural (sustainable 
agriculture impacting land and water); Financial (stable supply reduces procurement risk).
Our response:
Farmer Prosperity & Responsible Sourcing is a material issue for us, as sugarcane farmers are the 
lifeblood of our business and crucial for raw material supply. This impacts our Social & Relationship, 
Human, Natural, and Financial Capitals. We prioritize farmers and their well-being. Our initiatives 
include prompt payment for cane purchases, assisting in income enhancement, and catalysing yield 
improvement through new cane varieties. We educate and support farmers on sustainable agricultural 
practices, including soil health management and low-water techniques like drip irrigation. We 
distribute organic materials like press mud, encourage intercropping, and use technology such as 
satellite sensing and drones for scientific farming. These efforts enhance farmer livelihoods and secure 
our raw material supply.

Operating sugar mills, distilleries, and power plants involves significant workforce 
and safety challenges – from heavy machinery to handling of chemicals and boilers. 
Maintaining a healthy, safe, and skilled workforce is materially important. A strong 
safety culture (zero-harm workplace) helps prevent accidents and production 
stoppages. Prioritizing employee well-being (fair wages, good working conditions, 
health check-ups) and investing in training increases productivity and retention. In a 
competitive labor market, especially in rural locations, being an employer of choice 
can reduce attrition. Ensuring a safe workplace also has direct financial benefits: 
it lowers injury-related costs and improves efficiency. For example, companies 
report that a safe work environment reduces absenteeism and attrition, and 
helps in retaining top talent. Human Capital development (continuous training in 
new farming techniques, process automation, digital skills) is equally critical as the 
industry modernizes. This material issue impacts not only the company’s performance 
and reputation but also its compliance with labor laws and standards (a governance 
aspect).
Stakeholders Concerned:
Employees (health, safety, job satisfaction); Regulators (Factory safety inspectors, 
labor authorities); Investors (workforce stability and productivity as part of ESG

UNSDGs: 
 
GRI Standards: 
GRI 413 (Local Communities), 
GRI 203 (Indirect Economic 
Impacts)
Sugar factories are often located in rural or semi-rural areas and are closely 
interwoven with local communities. Maintaining good community relations and 
contributing to local development is a material social issue that affects the company’s 
Social & Relationship Capital. If the company’s activities negatively impact the 
community (e.g. pollution, strain on local resources, or inadequate compensation), 
it can face community opposition, protests, or reputational damage. Conversely, 
proactively supporting communities through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives – such as rural infrastructure, healthcare camps, educational programs, and 
environmental conservation projects – helps secure a social license to operate. For 
example, some sugar companies run programs for drinking water, soil conservation, 
and youth employment in villages, aligning with stakeholders’ needs. With India’s 
mandate on CSR spending for profitable companies, this is also a regulatory 
expectation. Community development efforts address stakeholder concerns and foster 
goodwill, which in turn can lead to smoother operations (fewer conflicts or delays 
in permits). In summary, being seen as a responsible neighbour and partner in local 
progress is material for long-term sustainability.
Stakeholders Concerned:
Local Communities (villagers, panchayats concerned with local impacts 
and benefits); Local Governments (district authorities focusing on regional 
development); Regulators (expecting compliance with social obligations, 
e.g. mandatory CSR, rehabilitation plans); Employees (many belong to local 
communities; morale is higher if community is supportive); NGOs/Civil Society 
(monitoring company’s social impact).
ESG Dimension:

Community Engagement & Development is a material social issue for us, crucial for Social & 
Relationship Capital and securing our social license to operate. Integrating CSR based on the 
principle of Trusteeship, we aim for a triple bottom-line impact: social, economic, and environmental. 
Through the Dalmia Bharat Foundation, our initiatives in local communities focus on livelihood and 
skill development, social infrastructure, healthcare, education, and environmental conservation. 
We engage regularly to understand needs and address concerns through recorded requests and 
grievance mechanisms. These efforts foster inclusive growth, community well-being, and strong

Embracing digital technology and innovation is an emerging material issue that 
touches multiple capitals. Digitalization – such as using farm management software, 
satellite imaging for crop monitoring, IoT sensors in factories, and data analytics – 
can significantly improve efficiency and decision-making. For instance, deploying 
precision agriculture tools can optimize fertilizer and water use, boosting cane yields 
while conserving resources. In manufacturing, automation and digital control systems 
increase throughput and reduce downtime. Investing in Intellectual Capital (R&D, 
tech partnerships) and IT infrastructure builds a competitive edge in an industry that 
has traditionally been slow to adopt advanced tech. Additionally, digital platforms 
can improve stakeholder engagement: e.g. mobile apps to communicate with farmers 
about cane pickup schedules and prices enhance transparency and trust. Overall, 
technology adoption and continuous innovation are material as they drive productivity 
improvements (affecting Financial and Manufactured capital) and enable better 
governance through real-time monitoring of ESG performance (e.g. tracking emissions 
or compliance digitally). In a climate of rapid change, the company’s ability to 
innovate will determine its long-term resilience.

enabling marketplace-based sourcing and vendor expansion. Within our distilleries, the adoption 
of MVR technology contributed to a 50% reduction in energy requirements, enhancing operational 
sustainability.
We continued to invest in R&D and digital skills development, reflecting our commitment to future 
readiness. Technology interventions were implemented with structured cost-benefit analyses and 
Board oversight, ensuring alignment with governance, efficiency, and sustainability priorities. Through 
these efforts, we are embedding digital capabilities across operations, building resilience, and laying 
the foundation for scalable, efficient, and environmentally responsible growth, while supporting long-
term stakeholder value creation.
Financial Stability 
& Operational 
Efficiency
UNSDGs: 
GRI Standards: 
GRI 201 (Economic 
Performance), 
GRI 103 (Management 
Approach)
The sugar business is cyclical and highly regulated – domestic sugar prices swing 
with global markets and crop output, while farmers must be paid a government-
fixed cane price. This dynamic can squeeze margins and even lead to losses in 
downturns. Ensuring financial stability is therefore a material issue. This involves 
prudent risk management (hedging, maintaining adequate financial reserves) and 
improving operational efficiency to remain profitable even when sugar prices are 
low. Efficiency efforts include maximizing sugar recovery from cane (notably, India’s 
sugar recovery rate is among the lowest globally, which affects profit margins), 
optimizing energy usage, reducing downtime, and controlling costs in every part of the 
value chain. By focusing on lean operations and cost leadership, the Company can 
better withstand commodity price volatility. This issue links strongly to Manufactured 
Capital (efficient utilization of plant and equipment) and Financial Capital 
(profitability, low debt levels). It also has a Governance angle: strong oversight and 
strategy are needed to navigate market cycles and allocate capital (e.g. investing 
in diversification during good times to prepare for bad times). In essence, without 
financial resilience, the Company cannot create value for any stakeholder over time, 
making this a foundational material concern.
Stakeholders Concerned:
Investors/Shareholders (sustainable returns, risk management); Lenders 
(repayment capacity); Regulators (industry financial health, as defaults can impact 
farmers and banks); Farmers (timely cane payments depend on mill’s finances); 
Employees (job security and wages depend on a financially sound Company).
ESG Dimension:
Governance (Economic)
Capitals Impacted (IIRC)
Financial (cash flows, margins, capital allocation); Manufactured (asset utilization, production 
efficiency); Intellectual (process improvements, management systems)
Our response: 
Financial Stability and Operational Efficiency is a critical material issue for DBSIL, arising from the 
inherently cyclical and highly regulated nature of the sugar industry. Price volatility, coupled with fixed 
cane costs, can significantly impact margins, making financial resilience fundamental to sustaining 
value creation for all stakeholders.
The Company addresses this issue through prudent risk management and a strong focus on 
operational efficiency to preserve profitability. Key strategies include maximising sugar recovery, 
optimising energy use, reducing downtime, and implementing rigorous cost control measures. 
Diversification into ethanol production and renewable power provides an important hedge against 
market volatility, strengthening the company’s ability to navigate industry challenges.
This material matter has a direct bearing on the company’s Financial and Manufactured Capitals and 
is intricately linked to effective governance practices in strategy formulation and capital allocation. It 
remains a subject of interest to critical stakeholders, including investors, lenders, regulators, farmers, 
and employees, whose confidence and engagement are closely tied to the company’s financial health 
and operational performance.

As a listed entity, the Company must uphold high standards of corporate 
governance and ethical conduct – this is material to maintaining stakeholder trust 
and meeting regulatory requirements. The sugar-energy sector in India intersects 
with sensitive areas like farmer economics and fuel supply, attracting government 
oversight. Non-compliance or unethical practices (such as corrupt procurement, 
political lobbying issues, or poor transparency) could lead to legal penalties and 
reputational damage. Robust governance structures – an effective Board, risk 
controls, and ethical business practices – ensure long-term value protection. This 
issue also covers compliance with evolving regulations: for example, environmental 
norms (air and water emissions standards), ethanol blending quality standards, and 
the SEBI BRSR disclosure framework. The BRSR aims to enhance transparency 
and promote sustainability among businesses, underscoring that regulators 
and investors expect candid reporting on ESG performance. By fostering an ethical 
culture (Principle 1 of India’s National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct) 
and full compliance (with laws on environment, labor, taxes, etc.), the Company 
safeguards its Social & Relationship Capital (reputation and stakeholder trust) 
and avoids governance-related risks. In summary, strong Governance is a material 
issue that underpins the credibility and sustainability of the company’s operations in 
all other areas.
Stakeholders Concerned:
Investors (corporate governance and transparency); Regulators (SEBI, pollution 
control boards – compliance with laws and reporting standards); Board of Directors 
(accountability for ethical oversight); Employees (clarity on code of conduct and 
whistleblower mechanisms); Communities (expect fair and responsible 
Company behaviour).
ESG Dimension:

Our response: 
Governance, Ethics, and Regulatory Compliance is a material issue for DBSIL, fundamental to 
maintaining stakeholder trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and supporting responsible growth. 
Operating at the intersection of farmer livelihoods and national fuel supply, the sugar-energy sector 
is subject to significant government oversight, making strong governance practices essential. Non-
compliance or ethical breaches could expose the Company to legal, financial, and reputational risks.
DBSIL’s approach is anchored in a robust corporate governance framework, driven by a commitment 
to maximise stakeholder value by blending growth, efficiency, governance, and ethics. Strategic 
oversight is provided by an experienced Board of Directors and specialised committees, including 
the Audit Committee and CSR/Sustainability Committee, which monitor compliance, risk, and 
sustainability practices.
The Company has instituted a formal Code of Conduct, a Whistle Blower Policy, and a Vigil 
Mechanism that enable directors, employees, and stakeholders to report concerns on misconduct, 
financial irregularities, unethical behaviour, or environmental and safety issues, with protections 
against victimisation and direct access to the Audit Committee Chairman. An Anti-Corruption and 
Anti-Bribery Policy reinforces this commitment to ethical conduct.
Compliance with evolving regulations, including environmental standards and SEBI’s BRSR framework, 
remains a priority, strengthening transparency, resilience, and long-term sustainability.
At the crossroads of farmer livelihoods 
and national energy needs, strong 
governance anchors our role in a 
closely regulated sugar-energy 
ecosystem.

At DBSIL, understanding and addressing the issues 
that matter most to our business and stakeholders is 
fundamental to our ability to create and sustain value. 
Materiality refers to topics or issues that significantly 
impact the Company’s value creation, influence its 
performance, and affect stakeholder perceptions 
over the short, medium, and long term. These material 
issues are dynamic, are reviewed, and analysed 
regularly. Our structured approach to materiality 
is aligned with global best practices, including the 
International Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC) 
Integrated Reporting Framework, which considers how 
a business creates value across six capitals – Financial, 
Manufactured, Human, Social & Relationship, Natural, 
and Intellectual – and relevant Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Standards. Engaging with relevant 
stakeholders is a key part of this process.
The analysis of material issues directly influences our 
strategic priorities and mitigation efforts. Materiality is 
also linked to the Company’s strategic, financial, and 
compliance risks.
Engaging stakeholders and 
assessing material issues regularly 
drives our ability to create value

Overview
Materiality Determination Process
DBSIL follows a structured process to identify the topics that are most important to its business and stakeholders. 
This process is reviewed regularly and considers the company’s impact on the economy, environment, and people, 
including human rights. These impacts may be positive or negative, actual or potential, and can result from the 
company’s operations or its business relationships. Stakeholder input is an important part of identifying and assessing 
these issues.
Our process for identifying material issues involves 
several steps, informed by the guidance in GRI 3: 
Material Topics 2021:
	
Understand the organisation’s context: This 
involves creating an initial high-level overview 
of our activities and business relationships, the 
sustainability context in which they occur, and 
our stakeholders. We study internal and external 
factors impacting DBSIL’s business. (See our 
chapter on Operating Context on page 22).
	
Identify actual and potential impacts: We 
identify actual and potential impacts on the 
economy, environment, and people, including 
human rights, across our activities and business 
relationships. This step is informed by analysing 
the product value chain and conducting a SWOT 
analysis. We also examine the material issues 
faced by peer companies through sources like 
the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB) and GRI standards, creating a bucket list 
of potential material aspects.
	
Assess the significance of the impacts: We 
assess the significance of identified impacts 
through quantitative and qualitative analysis, 
consulting relevant stakeholders and experts. We 
prioritise impacts for reporting based on their 
significance. Where it is not feasible to address 
all impacts at once, we prioritise potential 
negative impacts based on their severity and 
likelihood, with severity taking precedence for 
human rights impacts. Engaging with internal 
cross-functional teams is crucial to evaluate the 
current status regarding potential material issues.
	
Prioritise the most significant impacts for 
reporting: We group impacts into topics and 
prioritise the most significant for reporting, 
which determines our material topics. We set a 
threshold to define which topics are material. 
This step is informed by mapping ambitions and 
revamping the strategy to align with all relevant 
teams. Based on this analysis and mapped 
ambitions, we identify key action areas and 
prioritise them into short, medium, and long-
term needs, considering the relevance to both 
internal and external stakeholders. We also list 
the material elements under four key pillars: 
empowering people, responsible consumption, 
business ethics, and sustainable 
business practices.
The process of determining material topics requires 
the organisation to review each topic described in the 
applicable Sector Standards (such as those relevant 
to agriculture, aquaculture, and fishing sectors based 
on sugarcane cultivation for our sugar business) and 
determine whether it is material to DBSIL. If any topic 
included in the Sector Standards is determined not to be 
material, it will be listed in the GRI content index along 
with an explanation.
The organisation’s highest governance body, the Board, 
oversees the process and reviews and approves the 
material topics. We document our process, including the 
approach, decisions, sources, and evidence. We review 
our material topics annually to account for changes 
in impacts resulting from changes in our activities and 
business relationships, ensuring the list represents our 
most significant impacts in each new reporting period.
Material topics represent our most significant impacts 
on the economy, environment, and people. These topics 
cannot be deprioritised solely because they are not 
considered financially material by the organisation. 
Material topics inform financial and value creation 
reporting by providing crucial input for identifying 
financial risks and opportunities related to our impacts.
Our materiality assessment process feeds into the 
development of a Materiality Matrix, which clearly 
connects the identified material issues to our strategic 
pillars and stakeholder priorities. This structured 
approach ensures that our Integrated Annual Report and 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) 
comprehensively address the issues most critical to our 
value creation journey and responsive to stakeholder 
concerns and regulatory expectations.

Our Business Model
A Resilient and Integrated 
Business Model
At DBSIL,our business model exemplifies a holistic 
and future-facing approach to value creation. As 
an integrated agro-energy enterprise, we convert 
renewable raw materials into high-value products 
- namely sugar, industrial alcohol (ethanol), and 
power - while generating long-term returns for all 
stakeholders. In FY2025, under the theme “Digital 
Transformation: Sweetening the Future”  we 
moved decisively from a phase of foundational 
investment to a period of execution, integration, 
and tangible impact. We continue to strengthen 
our model through digital enablement, responsible 
capital stewardship, stakeholder partnerships, and 
environmental resilience.
To clearly articulate our value-creation logic, we 
employ the Business Model Canvas, developed 
by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, and 
integrate it with the six capitals defined by the 
International Integrated Reporting Framework: 
Financial, Manufactured, Intellectual, Human, 
Social & Relationship, and Natural. This dual-
lens approach allows us to demonstrate how we 
create, deliver, and sustain value - enhancing 
our competitiveness today while positioning us to 
meet the evolving expectations of tomorrow and 
contributing meaningfully to national development.
13% 
Return on Equity (ROE)
Delivering healthy shareholder returns 
through disciplined capital allocation  
and sustained profitability.
11%
Return on Capital Employed 
(ROCE)
Reflecting efficient utilisation of capital across 
integrated sugar, ethanol, and power operations.
How we Create Value
At DBSIL, value creation is a continuous, integrated 
process that begins with responsibly managing our 
six capitals and culminates in delivering high-quality 
products, resilient revenues, and shared prosperity. 
Our value proposition - rooted in sustainable sugar, 
ethanol, and power - is enabled by a robust mix 
of resources, including advanced manufacturing 
assets, digital infrastructure, a skilled workforce, 
and deep stakeholder relationships. These offerings 
reach institutional buyers, farmers, and communities 
through direct sales, supply chains, and development 
platforms. Our key activities - such as sugarcane 
development, production, R&D, digital transformation, 
and environmental stewardship - are executed in 
partnership with farmers, regulators, and technology 
providers. This ecosystem is supported by a well-
managed cost structure and underpinned by 
disciplined financial stewardship. Revenue is primarily 
generated from product sales, supplemented by 
policy-linked price stability and efficient capital 
allocation. Throughout this cycle, we engage 
stakeholders meaningfully - ensuring fair farmer 
remuneration, delivering impact-driven CSR, and 
fostering employee growth. By embedding digital 
innovation, sustainability, and inclusive growth at 
every touchpoint, our business model creates value 
that is not only financial, but social, environmental, 
and enduring.
At DBSIL, value creation is a 
continuous, integrated process that

our six capitals and culminates in 
delivering high-quality products,

At DBSIL our governance framework is built on the 
principles of transparency, ccountability, integrity, 
and ethical conduct. It is designed to ensure that the 
interests of our Board, management, shareholders, 
investors, regulators, and broader stakeholders are 
aligned and effectively represented. Our commitment 
to upholding the highest standards of corporate 
governance is reflected in the Corporate Governance 
Report for FY2024–25, prepared in accordance 
with the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015
Board Composition, Diversity, 
and Independence
As of 31st March, 2025, the Board of Directors is 
composed in line with statutory and regulatory 
requirements, including gender and professional diversity. 
The Board is chaired by an Independent Director and 
comprises individuals with expertise across finance, 
strategy, agriculture, engineering, and public policy. 
All Independent Directors have submitted declarations 
confirming compliance with the independence criteria 
as prescribed by SEBI Listing Regulations and the 
Companies Act, 2013. The Board affirms that these 
Directors are independent in both letter and spirit.
Board Committees and 
Oversight Responsibilities
(See Corporate Governance Report on Page 194)
To support its oversight responsibilities, the Board 
operates through six well-constituted Committees. Each 
Committee functions under a clear charter, with roles 
and responsibilities defined by applicable laws and 
governance codes. These Committees facilitate focused 
deliberation on critical matters and report regularly 
to the Board. All recommendations made by these 
Committees during FY2024–25 were accepted by
the Board.
Notably, the Audit Committee oversees risk management 
and internal control effectiveness, while the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee governs Board evaluation 
and succession. The Corporate Social Responsibility 
Committee is responsible for CSR policy and project 
oversight. The Risk Management Committee provides 
structured oversight of the enterprise risk framework.

Ethical Leadership and Responsible 
Conduct
DBSIL fosters a culture of integrity and ethical conduct 
through its Code of Conduct applicable to Directors and 
senior management. The Whistle Blower Policy and Vigil 
Mechanism provide a secure and confidential channel 
for employees and stakeholders to report concerns 
regarding ethical breaches, financial improprieties, and 
other grievances. Access to the Chairperson of the Audit 
Committee is available in appropriate cases. These 
mechanisms reflect our zero-tolerance approach to 
misconduct and safeguard the company’s 
ethical foundation.
ESG Governance and Decision-
Making Integration
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
considerations are integrated into our core business 
strategies. The Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (BRSR), forming part of the FY2024–25 
Annual Report, outlines our ESG performance and 
goals. ESG oversight is supported at the Board level 
through designated Committee responsibility. The 
Company conducts periodic materiality assessments, 
and sustainability issues are escalated to the Board 
for discussion and action. CSR is embedded as a 
strategic function aligned with our triple-bottom-line 
commitments—social, economic, and environmental.
Enterprise Risk Management
DBSIL recognizes that risk is inherent to all business 
operations. We have implemented a comprehensive 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to identify, 
evaluate, and manage risks across operational, financial, 
regulatory, and strategic domains. This structured 
framework supports informed decision-making by the 
senior leadership and the Board.
The ERM process is designed to assess both actual and 
potential risks across the short (0–2 years), medium 
(2–5 years), and long term (5–10 years). It covers 
internal control systems, legal and compliance risks, 
sustainability-related risks, and emerging issues such 
as climate impact and digital disruptions. The Risk 
Management and Audit Committees provide ongoing 
oversight and ensure that risk mitigation strategies are 
robust and aligned with the company’s objectives.
Residual Risk Analysis
The Company applies a residual risk framework to 
track the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and 
ensure continued oversight. Residual risks are assessed 
periodically and reported to the Board. In the opinion 
of the Board of Directors, there are no material risks 
currently threatening the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. DBSIL’s commitment to robust 
governance and risk management is foundational to 
our long-term sustainability. Through ethical leadership, 
strong oversight, and proactive risk mitigation, we aim to 
protect stakeholder interests and uphold the trust placed 
in us. Governance excellence and risk preparedness 
remain vital enablers of our purpose-driven, future-
ready enterprise.

Leveraging Digital Foresight to Strengthen Financial Capital
DBSIL’s commitment to digital foresight played a pivotal role in enhancing its Financial Capital management 
during FY2025. The Company has progressively positioned itself as a technology-driven manufacturing 
organisation, moving beyond traditional digital adoption toward embedding data intelligence and automation at 
the core of its operations and financial strategy.
This forward-thinking approach involves the systematic replacement of manual and legacy systems with digital 
interventions across both manufacturing and enterprise functions. In FY2025, the focus was on deploying 
technology to deliver disproportionately superior outcomes by reimagining how processes are structured and 
managed through digitalisation and the emerging applications of artificial intelligence.
Financial capital serves as the essential resource 
enabling DBSIL’s growth and the creation of value for all 
our stakeholders. In FY2025, our financial performance 
has been instrumental in funding strategic investments, 
providing returns to shareholders, and enhancing our 
resilience across different operational cycles. We 
structure this chapter to highlight how our disciplined 
financial management and strategic capital allocation 
directly drive sustainable value creation. It demonstrates 
the connection between our financial outcomes and 
the value we generate, from financing innovation 
and expansion, particularly in the realm of digital 
transformation, to delivering profits and returns.
The narrative for FY2025’s financial capital centres on 
balancing growth aspirations with prudent financial 
stewardship. We have leveraged strong cash flows to 
make future-ready investments, notably those aligned 
with our Digital Transformation: Sweetening the 
Future theme. At the same time, we have maintained a 
solid balance sheet. This approach aligns with the IIRC’s 
principles by illustrating how our financial results are 
interconnected with broader value creation for 
our stakeholders.

Overview
Digital investment is being channelled into three critical 
levers of value creation:
1.	
Agricultural Yield and Operational Precision
	
The Company is using tools such as satellite 
imagery, drone-assisted fertilisation, geo-sensing, 
and scientific farming practices to enhance 
sugarcane yield and input efficiency. These efforts 
are supported by the deployment of digital systems 
that enable real-time monitoring and farm-level 
decision-making.
2.	
Procurement and Supply Chain Optimisation
	
Platforms such as SAP Ariba are being implemented 
to digitise procurement, introduce marketplace 
models, and reverse auctions, and improve 
sourcing efficiency. These steps contribute to better 
cost control, vendor transparency, and 
procurement agility.
3.	
Enterprise Process Transformation
	
A digital transformation roadmap, developed in 
partnership with PwC, is being implemented to 
rewire internal systems. This roadmap focuses on 
end-to-end visibility, workflow automation, and cost 
optimisation, particularly in procurement and supply 
chain operations.
These digital initiatives are designed not only to 
improve productivity but also to enhance the efficiency 
of capital utilisation. By linking digital investments to 
operational gains, the Company is targeting measurable 
improvements in Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) 
and Return on Net Worth (RoNW). With data analytics 
supporting faster, insight-driven decisions, financial 
capital is being deployed more effectively and with 
greater strategic clarity.
Through this integrated digital agenda, DBSIL is future-
proofing its financial model—building a platform where 
capital is not only preserved but systematically amplified 
through technology-led transformation.
Key Financial Highlights 
(FY2025 vs. FY2024)
In FY2025, DBSIL demonstrated a robust financial 
performance, navigating market dynamics while 
continuing strategic investments. Despite challenging 
scenario the Company delivered robust growth in 
revenue and profitability. Key performance ratios 
- including EBITDA margin, ROCE, and RoNW - 
underscore the Company’s consistent operational 
efficiency and disciplined capital deployment. The 
strong interest coverage and low net debt-to-equity 
ratio reinforce our financial resilience and prudent 
debt management. We strategically retain borrowings 
only where the return on capital exceeds the cost of 
debt, thereby enhancing shareholder value through 
efficient capital structuring. This balanced gearing 
approach provides us with significant headroom 
to pursue future growth opportunities without 
compromising financial stability. 
Financial Capital
Here are the key updated data points for FY 2025 
compared to FY2024
Capital Allocation and 
Strategic Investments
Financial capital in FY2025 was strategically deployed 
to fuel our value creation journey, significantly supporting 
the “Digital Transformation: Sweetening the Future” 
theme. A key focus was realizing the benefits of prior 
strategic initiatives, marked by the timely completion 
and successful commissioning of critical capacity 
expansion projects at multiple units including Nigohi, 
Ramgarh, Ninaidevi, and Baghauli. The acquisition of 
Baghauli Sugar and Distillery Limited was also part of the 
new investments during the year. These projects were 
commissioned ahead of the operational season, ensuring 
readiness for full-year performance potential in FY2025-
26. Investments in areas like Distillery capacity, Smart 
Agriculture Technology, and other initiatives reflect our 
commitment to growth and efficiency, aligning with the 
focus on ethanol production, farming automation, and 
technology deployment.

Overview
Financial Capital
Returns and Shareholder Value
Our financial performance in FY2025 translated into 
tangible value creation for shareholders. Basic Earnings 
Per Share (EPS) for the year stood at `48, reflecting the 
strength of our bottom-line performance. The proposed 
dividend for FY2024–25 is `1.50 per share, in addition 
to an interim dividend declared earlier in the year. We 
delivered a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 
11% and a Return on Average Net Worth (RoNW) of 13%, 
reaffirming our ability to generate efficient returns on 
the capital entrusted to us.
These metrics underscore the effectiveness of our capital 
allocation strategy and operational efficiency. Looking 
ahead, we expect future investments - particularly those 
in digital transformation and capacity expansion - to 
further enhance these return metrics, strengthening long-
term shareholder value.
Segment-Level Insights – Contributions 
to Consolidated Outcomes
DBSIL’s integrated business model spans three 
synergistic segments - Sugar, Ethanol (Distillery), and 
Cogeneration Power - each contributing distinctly 
to consolidated performance. FY2025 reaffirmed 
the strategic benefits of this diversification, with 
ethanol emerging as a growth engine, power providing 
cost-offsetting support, and sugar continuing as the 
foundational core.
Ethanol (Distillery) Segment
FY2025 marked a pivotal year for our ethanol business, 
which contributed approximately 28% of total revenue. 
This underscores the growing strategic importance 
of ethanol within our portfolio. The performance was 
underpinned by a combination of higher production 
volumes and firm realization rates driven by government 
blending mandates and strong offtake from Oil 
Marketing Companies.
Notably, ethanol production surged 2% year-on-year in 
FY2025, reaching 17.94 crore litres, compared to 
17.64 crore litres in the previous year. Over the full fiscal, 
ethanol sales volumes and revenues reached all-time 
highs. This growth was supported by an increase in 
installed distillation capacity, which rose to 850 KLPD 
in FY2025 from 710 KLPD in FY2024. The Company 
operated its distilleries at peak utilization during Q4, 
contributing to robust revenue and margin delivery.

Overview
Ethanol’s inherently superior margins compared to 
sugar manufacturing further supported consolidated 
profitability. As a result, this segment played a critical 
role in stabilizing EBITDA margins during a year marked 
by input cost volatility in the sugar segment. The rise in 
ethanol’s share of the revenue mix reflects a deliberate 
pivot toward value-accretive, policy-supported, and 
less cyclical income streams, reinforcing our long-term 
capital allocation strategy.
Sugar Segment
Despite its declining share in total revenue, the Sugar 
segment remained the largest contributor, accounting 
for an estimated 71% of total revenue in FY2025. This 
relative shift reflects the increasing weight of ethanol 
in our revenue composition, aligned with our long-term 
diversification strategy.
Operationally, sugar production is 5.6 lakh tonnes in 
FY2025, versus 6.4 lakh tonnes in FY2024. Sales 
volumes for FY2025 is 6 lakh tonnes vs 4.2 lakh tonnes 
in FY 2024.
Sugar prices also increased. For FY2025 period, the 
average realization was `38/kg, reflecting a 3% YoY 
increase. Recovery rates stood at 9.16% in Uttar Pradesh 
and 11.81% in Maharashtra, marginally adjusting from 
9.86% and 12.76% respectively in FY2024, indicating 
stable operational efficiency despite regional agro-
climatic variability.
While the sugar segment faced export restrictions and 
regulatory interventions, higher domestic realizations 
and increased sales volumes ensured that it continued 
to contribute significantly to consolidated earnings. It 
also provided the base for value chain extensions into 
ethanol and power, reaffirming its role as the operational 
backbone of the enterprise.
Connectivity to Other Capitals and 
Theme Integration
The story of our Financial Capital in FY2025 is deeply 
intertwined with our progress across other capitals, 
particularly as we advance our “Digital Transformation: 
Sweetening the Future” theme. Robust financial 
performance provides the necessary investment for:
	
Manufactured Capital: Funding new manufacturing 
assets, technology deployment, and automation 
initiatives.
	
Intellectual Capital: Investing in innovation, the PwC 
IT roadmap, process rewiring for digitization, and 
proprietary knowledge
Financial Capital
	
Human Capital: Supporting employee training, skill 
development for digital technologies, and ensuring a 
safe working environment (relevant GRI 403).
 Social & Relationship Capital: Financing community 
development programs, farmer engagement initiatives 
like smart agriculture technology adoption, and 
maintaining strong relationships with suppliers, 
customers, and communities.
	
Natural Capital: Investing in sustainable agriculture 
practices, resource efficiency (water, energy, 
materials), and environmental management, all 
potentially enhanced by digital solutions. Our 
financial discipline also strengthens relationships with 
investors and lenders, crucial components of financial 
and social capital.
Strengthening Liquidity While Preserving 
Capital Discipline
DBSIL’s financial management in FY2025 continued to 
reflect a disciplined and balances approach - anchored 
in maintaining a healthy balance sheet, robust liquidity, 
and targeted capital deployment. The Company 
remained focused on creating long-term value 
through strategic investments while safeguarding its 
financial strength.
As of 31st March, 2025 the Company’s total financial 
indebtedness - comprising both short-term and long-
term borrowings - was reported at `1043.78 crore. 
Nevertheless, the Company has affirmed its “net zero” 
debt posture at year-end. This is characterised by 
a net surplus liquidity stance, wherein cash and cash 
equivalents exceed gross long-term borrowings - 
extending a positive trajectory observed across 
earlier quarters.
This capital stewardship builds upon a trend of declining 
leverage. As of 31st March, 2025, the Company’s debt-to-
equity ratio stood at 0.18x, well within prudent thresholds, 
underlining the Company’s long-standing commitment to 
financial discipline.
The Company’s funding strategy includes the selective 
use of concessional loans, particularly where the return 
on capital employed (ROCE) is demonstrably higher than 
the cost of borrowing. This approach ensures that every 
rupee of financial capital is allocated efficiently, thereby 
enhancing return potential while avoiding unnecessary 
balance sheet strain. A strong cash position further 
enables the Company to proactively manage liquidity 
risk, meet operational and investment requirements, and 
remain agile in the pursuit of future growth opportunities.
Notably, this strategy has also supported strategic 
expansion - such as the acquisition and revival of 
Baghauli Sugar & Distillery Ltd, expansion of Jawaharpur 
grain based distillery to 250 KLPD (from 110 KLPD) and 
investing in Baghauli 100 KLPD grain based distillery .By 
balancing internal accruals, concessional capital, and 
conservative gearing, the Company is well-positioned 
to support future capacity additions and technology-
led operational enhancements without compromising 
financial resilience.
A net surplus liquidity 
stance positions us with 
near-zero net debt—
preserving capacity for 
growth without balance 
sheet strain.

Manufactured Capital
Building Value from the Ground Up
At DBSIL, manufactured capital is not just infrastructure—it is the strategic powerhouse 
that translates vision into value. From every tonne of cane crushed to every litre of ethanol 
distilled and every megawatt of green power exported, it is through our physical and digital 
infrastructure that we deliver on our promise as an integrated agro-energy enterprise.
A Journey of Expansion, Integration, 
and Modernisation
Since our inception in 1939, DBSIL has evolved from a 
single-location sugar manufacturer into a multi-
plant, multi-feedstock integrated energy enterprise. 
Here’s a snapshot of our key milestones in 
manufacturing development:
But this ecosystem isn’t just defined by its capacity—it’s driven by intelligence and 
intention. Our network of sugar mills, grain- and molasses-based distilleries, 
co-generation plants, and digitally synchronised systems is meticulously engineered 
to work in harmony. We optimise material flows, reduce emissions, and embed 
circularity into every operation.
Every investment we make in this backbone is guided by a dual purpose: 
operational excellence and environmental stewardship. In doing so, we don’t 
just scale our topline—we reduce costs, mitigate risks, and build resilience. This is how 
we create value today—while preserving value for tomorrow

Geographic Footprint: Concentrated 
Strength with Strategic Reach
Our manufacturing assets are geographically 
concentrated in two of India’s most agriculturally 
productive states—Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra—both 
of which are sugarcane heartlands. This deliberate 
clustering allows us to optimize cane procurement 
logistics, reduce transport-related emissions, and 
maintain strong relationships with local farming 
communities. Uttar Pradesh, home to the majority of our 
plants, provides us with scale advantages and proximity 
to key consumption centres in North India. Maharashtra, 
on the other hand, complements our footprint with 
high-recovery cane and operational seasonality that 
balances our throughput across the year. This focused 
geographical presence ensures operational efficiency, 
continuity of supply, and better infrastructure utilization—
all of which contribute to enhanced cost competitiveness 
and reliability of delivery.
Manufactured Capital
By investing in intelligent, 
integrated, and impact-
conscious infrastructure, we 
are not only safeguarding our 
operations against regulatory 
and climate risks, but also 
strengthening our long-term 
profitability, reducing cost 
of capital, and improving 
stakeholder confidence.
Infrastructure That Works Smarter
At DBSIL our infrastructure is built not just to scale but 
to synergise. Spread across seven manufacturing sites 
in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, our network of sugar 
plants, distilleries, and co-generation units is designed 
to operate as a seamlessly integrated ecosystem. 
This regional concentration allows for standardized 
operations, shared logistics, and centralised digital 
command, while still adapting to the micro-dynamics of 
each geography.

Every project we executed was calibrated not merely 
for capacity growth, but for long-term efficiency, digital 
maturity, and environmental stewardship.
These were investments in smart, flexible, and future-
ready infrastructure—enhancing our ability to convert 
more feedstock into higher-value output, across 
geographies, across fuels, and across market formats. In 
doing so, we’ve strengthened plant utilization, de-risked 
supply volatility, deepened our relationships with buyers, 
and unlocked greater value from every unit of energy, 
material, and manpower.
By expanding capacity and increasing flexibility 
(across geographies, fuels, and formats), we are better 
positioned to:
	
Improve plant utilization and yield, boosting overall 
asset productivity
	
De-risk input volatility through dual-
feedstock readiness
	
Increase supply reliability, enabling stronger 
relationships with OMCs and industrial buyers
	
Capture downstream value, through better energy 
export and higher-grade product delivery.
We generate 544 million 
units of renewable electricity 
annually using 100% bagasse-
based fuel. This enables 
energy self-sufficiency, carbon 
savings, and grid contribution.
This modular yet interconnected model allows us to 
balance load, reroute feedstock, and deploy shared 
utilities across units—maximising energy recovery, 
reducing redundancies, and enhancing 
responsiveness. Each site has also been configured 
to support closed-loop utilities, such as condensate 
recovery systems, zero-liquid discharge distilleries, 
and vapor balancing networks.
Smart Layouts & Circular Flows:
•	
Bagasse is seamlessly diverted from crushing 
units to power boilers
	
Spentwash from distilleries is incinerated or 
reused for fuel
	
DDGS from grain distilleries is marketed as high-
protein animal feedprotein animal feed
	
Press mud is converted into bio-compost, 
supporting sugarcane soil health
Digital Enablement:
All units operate under a harmonised ERP and are 
equipped with SCADA/DCS platforms, ensuring 
real-time visibility, process standardisation, and 
predictive maintenance protocols. This digitised 
architecture strengthens decision-making and 
ensures consistency across locations. This intelligent, 
integrated infrastructure ecosystem allows us to:

Key Milestones Delivered:
1.	
Baghauli Acquisition and Revival: In a standout 
demonstration of strategic execution, we acquired 
the with ‘Baghauli Sugar and Distillery Limited 
under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Baghauli 
manufacturing complex through the NCLT resolution 
process in late 2023. Within a span of three months, 
we successfully revived and operationalised the sugar 
unit with a capacity of 3,500 TCD, along with the 
12 MW co-generation plant. The 100 KLPD grain-based 
distillery, inherited in an incomplete state, progressed 
to 90% mechanical completion by the end of FY2025, 
with commissioning targeted for Q2 FY2026. This 
turnaround initiative not only restores latent industrial 
capacity but also unlocks synergies from a command 
area spanning approximately 60,000 hectares, 
thereby strengthening our footprint in the region and 
contributing to the Company’s integrated 
value chain.
2.	
Jawaharpur Distillery Expansion: We  scaled up 
our grain-based distillation capacity at Jawaharpur 
from 110 KLPD to 250 KLPD, making it one of the 
largest ethanol production units in our portfolio. This 
strategic enhancement strengthens our contribution 
to the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP) and 
provides the flexibility to switch between grain-
based (250 KLPD) and molasses-based (220 KLPD) 
operations, offering a robust operational hedge 
against feedstock variability and seasonal supply 
shifts..
3.	
Nigohi Enhancement: We enhanced Nigohi’s sugar 
crushing capacity to 10500 TCD, reinforcing its 
position as one of our largest integrated sites. The 
plant also underwent a series of technical upgrades, 
including steam-saving systems, enhanced molasses 
diversion infrastructure for ethanol integration, and 
improvements in SCADA-enabled energy balancing 
mechanisms. These interventions have led to improved 
operational throughput, higher energy efficiency, 
and better linkage between sugar and ethanol value 
streams.
4.	
Ramgarh Modernisation: The processing capacity at 
Ramgarh was modernized to 7,700 TCD, aligning with 
our goal to optimise throughput across core locations. 
This was accompanied by targeted investments in 
automation and bulk material handling systems, 
ensuring improved process control and operating 
efficiency. In parallel, a state-of-the-art hygienic 
sugar packing facility was commissioned, designed 
to support food safety compliance, and enhance 
export-readiness—particularly for premium refined and 
specialty sugars.

slowing down—we are doubling down on our core 
strategy of intelligent infrastructure for integrated value 
creation. Our forward initiatives are designed to deepen 
efficiency, expand optionality, and elevate our impact.
	
	 The commissioning of the Baghauli 100 KLPD distillery 
and 12 MW co-gen unit will close a vital loop in our 
Uttar Pradesh cluster.
	
	 We are initiating green hydrogen pilots at select 
energy-intensive units—exploring alternative fuels for 
internal combustion and export potential.
	
	 AI-enabled optimisation engines are being 
introduced to automate fermentation controls, yield 
forecasting, and shift scheduling.
	
	 And a fully ERP-integrated logistics module will soon 
connect cane procurement, factory operations, and 
ethanol dispatch in real time—improving traceability, 
delivery accuracy, and working capital rotation.
Each of these projects is grounded in the same 
philosophy that guided our FY2025 transformation:
build for resilience, digitise for speed, and circularise 
for sustainability.
These outcomes are not 
short-term wins-they are 
long-term capabilities that 
keep generating recurring 
value. The synergy between 
scale, sustainability, and 
systems thinking has begun 
to deliver EBITDA support, 
lower marginal costs, and new 
revenue streams.

2. 	 Sustainable Agriculture and 
Soil Health
	
[GRI 301-1, 304-2, 308-1, 308-2, 413]
	
As a Company fundamentally rooted in agriculture, 
DBSIL recognises that the long-term productivity and 
resilience of its operations depend on the sustained 
health of soil and the ecosystems that support it. 
Soil, water, and biodiversity are not just passive 
inputs—they are active enablers of sustainable value 
creation in sugarcane cultivation. In particular, the 
integrity of soil organic carbon, nutrient balance, 
and water retention capacity are material to our 
core business model and stakeholder commitments.
	
DBSIL’s environmental strategy prioritises these 
elements, grounded in its understanding that 
healthy soils are vital for sustaining agricultural 
livelihoods, mitigating climate risks, and securing raw 
material continuity for integrated sugar and ethanol 
operations. Stakeholder consultations consistently 
highlight concerns around land degradation, 
soil fertility, and water conservation—particularly 
among the agrarian communities in our command 
area. These insights reinforce our commitment to 
sustainable agriculture as a strategic imperative.
	
Farmer Partnership and 
Sourcing Ecosystem
	
[GRI 301-1, 413-1]
	
DBSIL’s operations continue to be supported 
by a strong and collaborative network of over 
2,00,000 sugarcane farmers across an estimated 
1,20,000 hectares of command area. In FY2024, 
the Company procured 55.59 Lakh Metric Tonnes 
of cane, engaging with growers through a 
comprehensive sourcing model that integrates input 
support, agronomy advice, and price assurance. 
While FY2025 figures are being finalised, the 
engagement structure remains robust and strategic 
to ensure sustainability across the value chain.
	
Our farmer relations go beyond transactions—they 
are structured partnerships aimed at co-creating 
sustainable agricultural value. This includes 
disseminating agronomic best practices, promoting 
crop diversification, and jointly investing in 
resource conservation.
	
Strategic Initiatives in Soil and Farm 
Health Management
	
[GRI 304-2, 306-2]
	
DBSIL’s multi-pronged approach to sustainable 
agriculture includes the following interventions:
	 Soil Health Diagnostics:
	
Regular soil testing is conducted through in-house 
labs, with soil health cards issued to optimise the 
application of fertilisers and nutrients. Tailored 
agronomic advisories are provided to each farmer 
to minimise soil fatigue and over-fertilisation.
	 Organic Fertilisation and Composting:
	
	
The Company actively promotes organic 
inputs such as press mud (a sugar by-product), 
vermicompost, and farmyard manure to enhance 
microbial activity and restore nutrient cycles. 
These are either distributed directly or converted 
into value-added soil conditioners.
	 Trash Mulching and Residue Management:
	
Sugarcane leaf residues are retained on-field 
through trash mulching, conserving moisture, 
suppressing weed growth, and enriching topsoil. 
Residues are otherwise repurposed or safely 
disposed in compliance with 
environmental regulations.
Natural Capital
	 Improved Cane Varieties and 
Planting Techniques:
	
DBSIL is accelerating the adoption of high-yield, 
disease-resistant cane varieties, while phasing out 
obsolete ones. Sustainable planting techniques 
such as paired row, trench planting, and tray-
grown seedlings are being introduced to improve 
root aeration, water efficiency, and soil structure.
	 Intercropping with Legumes:
	
In a bid to increase farm productivity and enrich 
soil with nitrogen, intercropping with legumes 
is being promoted. This not only supports 
biodiversity but also boosts farmer incomes and 
land-use efficiency.
	 Digital Farming Advisory:
	
The Company is piloting satellite imaging, 
drone surveillance, and sensor-based 
monitoring to create real-time visibility into farm 
conditions. These tools will enable precision 
agriculture through site-specific irrigation and 
nutrient application.
	
Towards Regenerative Agriculture and 
Climate Resilience
	
[GRI 305-5, 304-2]
	
DBSIL’s commitment to regenerative agriculture 
is foundational to its climate and Natural Capital 
strategy. Key goals include:
	 Soil Organic Carbon Enhancement:
	
Targeting a soil carbon range of 0.5%–0.75% by 
2030, DBSIL is introducing rotational cropping, 
cover crops (such as green manures), and organic 
matter enrichment strategies. These practices aim 
to rebuild topsoil, increase water retention, and 
enhance drought resilience.
	 Crop Residue Management:
	
Burning of crop residue is strictly discouraged, 
with support extended to farmers for mulching or 
composting alternatives, thereby curbing harmful 
emissions, and maintaining soil integrity.
	 Sustainable Livelihoods and Rural Resilience:
	
By strengthening agroecological practices, DBSIL 
supports not only ecological outcomes but also 
farmer income stability, input cost savings, and 
overall socio-economic upliftment.
	
Outlook
	
In the coming years, DBSIL aims to scale these 
practices across 100% of its command area, 
embedding regenerative agriculture principles into 
the Company’s sourcing model. The focus will be on 
driving systemic transformation in soil restoration, 
input efficiency, and carbon sequestration—
contributing to the resilience of farming systems and 
ensuring a sustainable supply base.
	
This vision aligns with our overarching Natural 
Capital strategy, ensuring that agricultural prosperity 
does not come at the expense of ecological 
integrity, but rather grows in harmony with it.

3. 	 Water Stewardship
	
[GRI 303-1, 303-2, 303-3, 303-4, 303-5]
	
Water is one of the most critical elements of 
Natural Capital—essential for life, livelihoods, 
agriculture, and industrial processes. At DBSIL 
water plays a central role across our value chain, 
from the upstream cultivation of sugarcane to 
the downstream processing of sugar, ethanol, 
and power. In a country like India, where water 
stress is rising, particularly in agrarian belts such 
as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, sustainable 
water stewardship is not merely a compliance 
requirement—it is a strategic imperative.
	
We recognise that the long-term viability of our 
agro-industrial operations hinges on judicious 
water use, enhanced recycling, and ecosystem 
restoration. Our water stewardship approach is 
therefore designed to safeguard the availability, 
quality, and equitable access to water resources for 
both operational resilience and community well-
being. These principles are reinforced through our 
alignment with the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (particularly SDG 6: Clean Water and 
Sanitation), SEBI BRSR, and the GRI 303 standard.
	
Water Consumption and Efficiency Trends
	
In FY2025, DBSIL’s total water consumption was 
recorded at 1.11 million kilolitres, marking continued 
emphasis on resource optimisation. Our operations 
achieved a water intensity of 0.07 KL per metric 
tonne of cane and 3.6 KL per kilolitre of ethanol, 
reflecting improved process efficiencies and system-
level interventions. These figures underscore the 
outcomes of our plant-level improvements, including 
condensate recovery and process water recycling.
[GRI 303-5]
	
Zero Liquid Discharge and Water 
Circularity
	
DBSIL has adopted a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
policy across all its manufacturing locations, 
ensuring that no industrial effluent is released 
into the environment. Instead, all treated effluents 
are either recycled within the process loop or 
repurposed for non-potable applications, such as 
greenbelt irrigation and utility services. Our water 
recycling infrastructure is supported by:
•	 Condensate Polishing Units, which purify 
condensate for reuse in boiler feed and 
process applications.
	 Advanced Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), 
which recover and treat wastewater to reduce 
freshwater intake.
	 Online Effluent Monitoring Systems, which 
provide real-time data on emissions and 
discharge, integrated with state pollution control 
board portals.
[GRI 303-2, 303-4]
	
	
These systems help us sustain near-zero 
freshwater withdrawal in key operations and meet 
or exceed statutory discharge norms.
	
Water Conservation at the Farm Level
	
Sugarcane cultivation is water-intensive and 
therefore a key focus area for upstream water 
conservation. DBSIL supports farmers in transitioning 
to water-efficient irrigation technologies such 
as drip and sprinkler systems. In partnership with 
NDRIP, a pilot project in Ramgarh implemented 
drip irrigation across 29.28 acres, demonstrating 
measurable water savings and yield benefits. 
In addition:
•	 Piped recycled water is supplied to farmer groups 
in Jawaharpur and Nigohi for crop irrigation.

Our goal is to embed water efficiency into every 
hectare of our command area.
	
Watershed Management and Community 
Engagement
	
Beyond factory gates, DBSIL actively participates 
in landscape-level water replenishment through 
rainwater harvesting, pond rejuvenation, and 
watershed interventions. These projects are often 
executed in collaboration with local administrations 
and community groups to amplify their social and 
environmental impact. In FY2024 alone:
	 	 Significant capital expenditure was made in 
water conservation infrastructure.
	 	 Village ponds were desilted, and new water 
harvesting structures were constructed.
	 	 Projects contributed to a significant annual 
harvesting potential, aiding groundwater 
recharge and biodiversity support.
	
	
These measures are particularly critical in 
addressing the two-metre decline in groundwater 
levels observed in parts of our catchment over the 
past decade.
	
	
[GRI 303-1, 303-2]
	
Water Positivity Targets and Long-Term 
Vision
	
DBSIL’s long-term ambition is to become 10x 
water positive by 2030, meaning we will replenish 
ten times the volume of water we consume. This 
commitment is supported by several ongoing and 
planned initiatives:
	 Reducing groundwater usage in cane farming 
by 500 KL per hectare annually, with a total 
conservation target of 25 billion litres per

for operational resilience but also imperative for 
contributing to national and global climate goals.
	
Renewable Energy: Our Integrated 
Strength
	
DBSIL’s integrated sugar-ethanol-power model 
enables us to run an energy-efficient, largely self-
reliant and renewables-based system. A distinctive 
feature of our operations is the extensive use of 
bagasse—a fibrous sugarcane by-product—as a 
biomass fuel in our cogeneration plants. This circular 
approach ensures:
	 100% fulfilment of our internal power 
requirements through renewable energy
	 Surplus green electricity exported to the grid, 
displacing fossil-based power
	 100% renewable fuel use in FY2024 and FY2025, 
affirming our commitment to bio-based energy
	
In FY2025, bagasse (constituting 27% of cane 
crushed) was the principal contributor to our 
renewable energy matrix.

5. 	 Waste Management and Circular 
Economy
[GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 306-4, 306-5]
	
At DBSIL we view waste not as a burden, but as 
a latent source of value. Waste management 
and circular economy practices are recognised 
as material issues, fundamental to our long-
term environmental stewardship and operational 
efficiency. With a declared ambition to achieve zero 
waste to landfill, we have embedded a “waste-to-
wealth” philosophy across all our operations.
	
We adopt a systemic approach to managing waste, 
encompassing minimisation at source, valorisation 
of by-products, resource efficiency, and responsible 
disposal. This closed-loop model supports our 
Natural Capital
broader sustainability goals while creating ancillary 
economic value. By transforming potential liabilities 
into productive assets, our circular economy 
model directly enhances both Natural Capital and 
Manufactured Capital.
	
Valorising Waste Streams: FY2025 
Performance Highlights
	
In FY2025, our major waste streams—fly ash, spent 
wash, press mud, and packaging materials—were 
almost entirely diverted from landfill through reuse, 
recycling, or responsible disposal. The performance 
and purpose for each stream are as follows:
	
Fly Ash from Cogeneration Units:
	
In FY2025, 16,413 metric tonnes (MT) of fly ash 
generated from bagasse combustion were 
partially repurposed into fly ash bricks, offering a 
sustainable alternative to clay-based bricks. This 
initiative not only mitigates landfill dependency 
but also contributes to reducing construction-
sector emissions. Fly ash, rich in potash and 
micronutrients, is also applied directly to fields 
as soil amendment
	
[GRI 306-3, 306-4]
	
Spent Wash from Distilleries:
	
A total of 206,735 MT of spent wash was 
utilised as renewable fuel in incineration boilers, 
contributing significantly to our clean energy 
portfolio. This initiative reduces fossil fuel 
consumption while managing distillery effluents 
effectively. In parallel, spent wash is increasingly 
diverted for biogas generation via third-party 
off-take agreements, enhancing 
energy circularity.
	
[GRI 306-2, 306-4]
	
Press Mud (Filter Cake):
	
We processed 207784 MT of press mud into 
organic manure and bio-fertilisers, which were 
distributed to farmers within our command area. 
This organic amendment supports regenerative 
agriculture by improving soil fertility and structure. 
In addition to direct field application, DBSIL is 
exploring cellulosic biogas conversion from 
press mud.

Compliance to Leadership
	
We have achieved Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
status across all our manufacturing units. This 
represents a major milestone in our environmental 
management system. Through advanced Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETPs), we ensure that 100% 
of liquid waste is treated and reused within plant 
boundaries. Reclaimed water is used for:
	
	 	
Green belt development and industrial 
cooling
	
	 	
Irrigation by farmers via piped networks
	
	 	
Condensate recovery for reuse in 
production cycles
	
In parallel, we have deployed real-time effluent 
monitoring systems linked to regulatory servers, 
ensuring continuous compliance and transparency.
	
(GRI 306-2,  306-4, 306-5)

Our sugar mills and distilleries are designed to 
operate as resource-integrated systems. By-
products are rechannelled into commercially 
valuable products, which include:
	
Fly ash bricks from boiler ash
	
Fertiliser-grade press mud
	
Bio-energy from spent wash
	
Potential future revenue from 
cellulosic biogas
	
This model aligns with low-carbon development 
pathways, reduces our dependency on virgin 
resources, and supports circular industry ecosystems.
	
Strategic Alignment and Future Outlook
	
Our waste management strategy aligns with key 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:
	
	
Going forward, we aim to strengthen closed-loop 
material flows, establish waste traceability systems, 
and pilot new industrial symbiosis models across our 
operational regions. Our ambition is to formalise 
our zero-waste commitment into a company-wide 
policy, backed by performance targets and 
audit protocols.
6. 	 Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Conservation
	
[GRI 304-1, 304-2, 304-3]
	
 At DBSIL we recognise that biodiversity underpins 
the resilience of natural ecosystems, agricultural 
productivity, and long-term human well-being. 
As an agriculture-based enterprise, the health 
of local flora and fauna directly influences our 
raw material availability, ecosystem services, and 
environmental license to operate. Accordingly, 
the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity 
is embedded in our approach to Natural Capital 
stewardship and regarded as a material issue under 
our sustainability framework.
	
Biodiversity safeguards pollination, nutrient cycling, 
water purification, and carbon sequestration—all 
of which are critical for sustainable sugarcane 
cultivation. Natural habitats also regulate pests 
and diseases, enhance climate adaptation, and 
protect against environmental degradation. We 
align our biodiversity initiatives with the principles 
of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the 
UN SDGs (especially Goals 13 and 15), and the GRI 
Standardson biodiversity (GRI 304 series).
	
Biodiversity Context and Commitments
	
None of our manufacturing facilities or agricultural 
operations are situated within or adjacent to legally 
protected areas or biodiversity hotspots [GRI 304-1]. 
However, DBSIL proactively seeks to protect and 
restore biodiversity in its areas of influence through 
strategic interventions that support local ecosystems 
and rural communities.
	
FY2025 Initiatives and Practices
	
Our ecosystem enhancement efforts in FY2025 
focused on the following core initiatives:
	
Green Belt Development using Native Species
	
All DBSIL plants maintain ecologically sensitive 
green belts, designed with native plant species 
to enhance local biodiversity, stabilise soil, and 
serve as carbon sinks. These green buffers offer 
a range of ecosystem services including habitat 
creation, erosion control, air filtration, and 
microclimate regulation.
	
(GRI 304-2)
	
Miyawaki Afforestation around 
Plant Peripheries
	
We adopted the Miyawaki method for 
developing dense, fast-growing urban forests at 
factory perimeters. This technique accelerates 
habitat regeneration and improves the quality 
of degraded land while strengthening carbon 
sequestration capabilities. In FY2025, over 
360,70 trees  trees were planted across our
units as part of our broader ecological 
enrichment programme.
	
[GRI 304-3]
	
Agroforestry and Intercropping with 
Native Trees
	
In collaboration with sugarcane growers, DBSIL 
piloted agroforestry models in select command 
areas, integrating native trees alongside 
sugarcane rows. This practice improves soil

Pest Management and Pollinator Protection
	
Through integrated pest management (IPM) 
techniques, DBSIL helps reduce chemical 
pesticide use, promoting the survival of 
beneficial insect species such as pollinators 
and natural predators. These efforts support a 
healthier agro-ecosystem and reduce ecological 
disruption in sugarcane-growing regions.
	
[GRI 304-2]
	
Waste-to-Bio-compost for Soil Biodiversity
	
Organic by-products such as press mud are 
repurposed into nutrient-rich bio-compost. This 
organic fertiliser supports microbial diversity, 
improves soil structure, and reduces dependence 
on synthetic inputs.
	
[GRI 304-2, 304-3]
	
Water-Linked Ecosystem Protection
	
DBSIL ensures that all treated effluents meet 
regulatory thresholds for aquatic safety. By 
implementing Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) across

efficiency through green process innovations.
	
Soil Carbon Enhancement through 
Regenerative Agriculture:
	
We aim to expand regenerative practices across 
all command areas and improve soil organic 
carbon to a medium range of 0.5–0.75% by 2030 
through organic manuring, crop rotation, and 
minimising residue burning.
	
Water Positivity and ZLD:
	
With ZLD already implemented across all 
manufacturing locations, we aim to extend the 
same compliance to distillery units. We are on 
track to exceed our target of becoming 2.5x 
water positive, with a longer-term ambition to 
become 10x water positive by 2030.
	
Zero Waste Circularity:
	
We continue to focus on 100% reutilisation of 
solid and liquid waste, including bagasse, spent 
wash, fly ash, and press mud. Waste-to-value 
initiatives remain central to our circular 
economy approach.
	
Biodiversity Enhancement:
	
We will scale up afforestation efforts, expand 
Miyawaki plantation zones, and promote 
agroforestry-based intercropping to enhance 
natural habitats within our areas of operation.
	
Long-Term Vision: From Compliance 
to Contribution
	
Our broader vision is to create a net-positive 
impact on Natural Capital, restoring more resources 
than we extract. This transition from compliance 
to contribution aligns with our circular economy 
aspirations and reinforces our position as an 
environmentally conscious business. We are exploring 
nature-based solutions, biofuel innovations, and 
water stewardship models that benefit both our 
business and society at large

Stakeholder Engagement and 
Trust-Building
[GRI 2-29, 3-3; 413-1] 
At Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited 
(DBSIL), stakeholder engagement is a strategic 
imperative and a foundational element of its 
business philosophy. The Company recognises that 
cultivating inclusive, collaborative, and responsive 
relationships with its stakeholders is essential to 
sustaining long-term value creation. Stakeholders 
are defined as individuals, groups, or organisations 
that either influence or are influenced materially by 
the company’s operations, policies, and outcomes.
DBSIL adopts a structured, transparent, and 
participatory engagement approach that enables 
the integration of stakeholder insights into strategy 
Dalmia Bharat Sugar & Industries Limited  passionately believes that enduring 
stakeholder relationships and sustained investments in social development are 
foundational to its long-term business resilience, risk management, and inclusive 
growth. In line with the International Integrated Reporting Framework (IIRF), which 
identifies Social and Relationship Capital as one of the six core capitals contributing 
to value creation, the Company has embedded stakeholder engagement and 
community development deeply into its strategic and operational ethos.
At DBSIL Social and Relationship Capital refers to the strength, trust, and continuity 
of its relationships with a broad set of stakeholders—including local communities, 
sugarcane farmers, customers, supply chain partners, NGOs, industry associations, 
and regulatory bodies. It also encompasses the company’s social license to 
operate, built on its reputation for integrity, transparency, and community-centric 
action.
Recognising that social equity and stakeholder empowerment are critical 
enablers of long-term performance, the company’s approach reflects an inclusive, 
participatory, and accountable model of engagement. DBSIL Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) philosophy is rooted in the belief that inclusive growth and 
wealth-sharing with society are not merely ethical imperatives but strategic drivers 
of sustainable development. Through its CSR and sustainability programmes, 
the Company actively leverages Human and Natural Capital to generate social, 
economic, and environmental value—thereby reinforcing the interconnectedness of 
all capitals under the integrated reporting framework.
Trust is built not only on performance, but on the dignity 
of two-way dialogue. Our stakeholder relationships are 
strengthened through deep listening and consistent action.

Identification of Material Topics and 
Responsive Action
[GRI 3-1, 3-2, 413-1] 
Ongoing stakeholder consultations serve to surface 
critical environmental and social concerns. Through 
village consultations, supplier forums, and customer 
feedback mechanisms, DBSIL identifies emerging issues 
that shape its operational and social priorities. Key 
concerns raised include:
	
	 From farmers and local communities: Soil health 
degradation, water conservation, and access to 
clean water.
	
	 From communities: Youths unemployment and access 
to skill development.
	
	 From employees: Concerns around remuneration, 
leave policies, career development, grievance 
resolution, and performance appraisal systems.
Social & Relationship Capital
Every voice counts, 
every interaction shapes 
our journey. We have 
institutionalised inclusiveness 
into the very fabric of our 
engagement strategy.
Feedback from the grassroots 
is not a risk to be managed—
it’s a resource to be 
harnessed. Our operational 
strategy is shaped by those 
who are closest to our impact.
	
	 From regulatory and policy stakeholders: Changing 
government regulations and challenges related to 
sugarcane overproduction.
These inputs are systematically reviewed and presented 
to senior management and the Board through quarterly 
reports and presentations. Stakeholder perspectives 
inform strategic decisions, policy amendments, and the 
design of specific programs.
Illustrative Outcomes
DBSIL has taken tangible actions in response to 
stakeholder inputs:
	
	 Feedback on soil health and water conservation led 
to scaled-up initiatives in sustainable agricultural 
practices, supported by the cane department and 
CSR teams.
	
	 Community requests for potable water resulted in 
the installation of a water purification plant.
	
	 Concerns over youths’ unemployment inspired 
the establishment of skill training centres offering 
placement-linked, short-term vocational courses.
All service requests from community members are 
formally recorded, assessed, and prioritised based 
on relevance, urgency, and resource availability. This 
structured response mechanism establishes a feedback 
loop that reinforces trust and strengthens stakeholder 
confidence in the company’s intent and accountability.
Transparency and Disclosures
DBSIL ensures transparency in stakeholder 
communication by publishing comprehensive disclosures 
in accordance with globally recognised frameworks. 
These include the Integrated Annual Report aligned with 
the International Framework and GRI Standards, and the 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) 
as mandated by SEBI. Additional communication tools, 
such as community newsletters, sustainability reports, and 
CSR updates, help maintain a continuous flow 
of information.
Grievance redressal mechanisms are available for 
external stakeholders, particularly community members 
and suppliers, with defined procedures for timely 
investigation and resolution.
Collaborative Social Impact and 
Structured External Engagement
[GRI 203-1, 413-1] 
DBSIL believes that forging strategic partnerships with 
external entities is essential to enhancing its social 
impact, reinforcing community relationships, and securing 
its social license to operate. The company’s stakeholder 
engagement extends beyond direct beneficiaries to 
include meaningful collaboration with public institutions 
and civic organisations.
Collaboration with Government and Public 
Sector Schemes
DBSIL actively partners with government bodies at the 
local, state, and national levels to align its Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives with public 
development priorities. The company’s CSR projects are 
designed to dovetail with national schemes such as:
	
	 Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission): Under 
this programme, DBSIL supports the construction of 
sanitation infrastructure including toilets and waste 
management systems, contributing to public health 
and hygiene in its operational areas.
Collaboration multiplies 
impact. By aligning with 
public priorities, we ensure 
that our social investments 
deliver real change.

	 Poshan Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission): 
The company’s interventions in rural nutrition and 
maternal health are informed by and coordinated 
with this national framework.
In implementing such programmes, DBSIL collaborates 
closely with local administrative bodies to ensure 
relevance, alignment, and regulatory coherence. These 
joint initiatives have demonstrably improved living 
standards for surrounding communities, particularly in 
underserved rural locations.
Community-Focused Initiatives
In addition to its public-private partnerships, DBSIL 
designs and delivers standalone initiatives targeted at 
community upliftment. One notable example includes 
the distribution of 220 high-quality tailoring machines 
to 220 rural women entrepreneurs across five of its 
sugar-producing locations. This programme is intended 
to empower women through income-generating 
opportunities, ensuring that financial constraints do not 
impede their economic independence. The initiative 
also contributes to rural livelihoods and microenterprise 
development—key levers of localised socio-economic 
advancement.
Customer Interface and Feedback Systems
Customer engagement is maintained through formal 
mechanisms that allow for the collection and resolution 
of grievances and product-related feedback. Customers 
typically interface with DBSIL’s field personnel, such as 
sales officers or technical service engineers, who are 
responsible for escalating relevant feedback to internal 
teams for resolution and improvement.
This feedback loop not only helps resolve individual issues 
but also provides critical insights for refining product 
quality and customer service frameworks. It contributes 
to relationship continuity and long-term brand trust.
Impact Identification and Assessment
In line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Standards—specifically GRI 2 (General Disclosures), GRI 
3 (Material Topics), and GRI 413 (Local Communities)—
DBSIL undertakes a structured process to identify and 
evaluate actual and potential impacts of its operations. 
This includes:
	
	 Assessment of its environmental footprint from sugar 
and ethanol manufacturing activities.
	
	 Evaluation of the social and ecological impact on 
proximate communities and ecosystems.
	
	 Incorporation of stakeholder perspectives in shaping 
mitigation and enhancement measures.
Such analysis is foundational to maintaining the 
company’s social license to operate and ensuring that 
DBSIL remains responsive to its broader social and 
ecological context.
Investor Engagement, Relations, and 
Voting Transparency
[GRI 2-29, 207-4]

	 Broker-hosted Corporate Access Events: The 
Company participates in investor conferences, 
non-deal roadshows, and broker-organized group/

company’s strategic outlook, ESG initiatives, and 
competitive position.
	
	 Analyst Briefings and Plant Visits: To provide 
a grounded understanding of the company’s 
operational realities, DBSIL offers selected analysts 
opportunities for site visits and direct interaction 
with functional leadership, where appropriate. 
These interactions facilitate deeper insights into 
the company’s manufacturing, sourcing, and 
sustainability practices.

DIKSHa - Skilling and Employability Program
{GRI 404-2, 203-1] 
Launched in 2016, DIKSHa is a flagship Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative of Dalmia Bharat 
Foundation (DBF), anchored in the ethos of “Giving Back 
to Society.” It is strategically designed to equip rural 
youths with industry-aligned vocational skills to enhance 
employability, income generation, and long-term career 
resilience. The program was conceptualized following 
a skill gap analysis conducted by the National Skill 
Development Corporation (NSDC), which underscored a 
significant deficit in skilled manpower across rural India.
The DIKSHa initiative currently operates through four 
training centres across two states, offering six vocational 
training programs aligned with workforce needs in key 
sectors such as healthcare, retail, beauty & wellness, 
textiles & apparel, IT, and power. These centres 
collectively hold an annual training capacity exceeding 
1,800 youths.
FY25 Highlights and Performance Metrics:
	
	Trainee Enrolment and Gender Inclusion
In FY25, a total of 1,827 rural youths were trained 
across DIKSHa centres. Notably, 51% of these 
beneficiaries were female, reaffirming the program’s 
focus on gender equity and women’s empowerment. 
Many women trainees have reported experiencing 
enhanced financial independence and socio-
economic mobility post-training.
	
	 Extended Post-Placement Support
A distinguishing feature of the DIKSHa model is its 
commitment to providing at least one year of post-
placement support to all trainees. This surpasses the 
90-day minimum requirement under the Pradhan 
Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), ensuring 
more stable integration of trainees into the formal 
workforce.
	
Strategic Partnerships and Funding Commitments
DIKSHa’s operational effectiveness is reinforced 
through collaborations with a range of institutions 
including NSDC, Odisha Skill Development Authority 
(OSDA), Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development 
Corporation (APSSDC), NABARD, Karur Vysya Bank 
(KVB), Bosch, and Schneider Electric Foundation.
	
p
In FY25, an MoU was executed with Schneider 
Electric Foundation committing `1.03 crore 
towards infrastructure enhancement, including 
the establishment and upgrade of electrical and 
solar labs at two Dalmia ITIs and five DIKSHa 
centres, along with the creation of a new solar 
lab at the Lanka DIKSHa centre.
	
p
Additionally, the National Institute of Social 
Defence (NISD) sanctioned `56.7 lakh to 
conduct 12 batches of Geriatric Caregiver 
Training at eight DIKSHa centres during the year.

salaries secured through DIKSHa.
•	
	 76% reported being satisfied or highly satisfied with 
the extended post-placement support.
	
p
Income Outcomes: Over 56% of the trainees 
were earning between `10,000 and `30,000 per 
month, indicating tangible income upliftment.
	
p
Social Return on Investment (SROI): The program 
recorded an impressive SROI of 7.76:1, implying 
that every rupee invested by stakeholders 
yielded `7.76 in social value. State-level 
disaggregation showed Rajasthan with the 
highest SROI (8.36) and Tamil Nadu with the 
lowest (5.71).
	
p
Stakeholder Experience: The report also 
highlighted marked improvements in the 
beneficiaries’ technical proficiency, employment 
readiness, self-confidence, financial literacy, 
and awareness of career opportunities.
Through its integrated approach, DIKSHa not only 
bridges the rural skill gap but also delivers demonstrable 
socio-economic outcomes for individuals, families, and 
communities. It continues to be a cornerstone of DBSIL’s 
CSR vision for sustainable human capital development.

Supporting Sustainable Farming Practices
	
A notable share of capital expenditure in FY2025 
was allocated to “smart agriculture” initiatives. These 
include:
	
p
Drone-based fertiliser application
	
p
Geo-sensing technologies for resource 
optimisation
	
p
Development of high-quality seed varieties to 
enhance climate resilience
	These investments not only support environmental 
sustainability but also improve farmer productivity, 
enhance resilience to climate variability, and reduce 
input costs—thereby strengthening rural livelihoods. 
Furthermore, R&D efforts in FY2025 encompassed 
themes of soil health improvement, carbon footprint 
reduction, and sustainable farming methods, 
reinforcing the interdependence between Natural 
and Social Capital.

Addressing Climate-Related Risks 
and Opportunities
	Under GRI 201-2, the Company plans to disclose 
its assessment of climate-related financial risks 
and opportunities for FY2025. While inherently 
financial in nature, such disclosures also bear social 
implications. Understanding and mitigating these 
risks ensures supply chain stability, operational 
continuity, and sustained livelihoods for dependent 
communities and farmers.
Future Outlook on Social and 
Relationship Capital
[GRI 2-22, 3-3, 413-1]
Acknowledging the ongoing challenges posed by rural 
socio-economic disparities, climate volatility affecting 
farmer resilience, and the evolution of stakeholder 
expectations, the Company intends to implement 
structured and scalable strategies. These will include 
enhanced outreach, technical training for farmers, and 
improved mechanisms to address climate risks at the 
community level.
Going forward, DBSIL is focused on strengthening its 
role in industry dialogues and policy forums to promote 
the long-term sustainability of the sugar and ethanol 
ecosystem. Future plans include increasing the scope 
and number of CSR beneficiaries, designing high-impact 
community development projects with measurable 
outcomes, and setting specific targets and timelines 
for their implementation. The Company also aims to 
institutionalise systems to measure stakeholder trust and 
satisfaction in a more quantitative manner.
The leadership continues to view Social and Relationship 
Capital as vital to the company’s long-term success. 
Empowering external stakeholders—particularly 
farmers, rural communities, supply chain partners, 
and consumers—is expected to yield mutual benefits 
and reinforce the company’s license to operate and 
grow. Future investments in Social and Relationship 
Capital will also be structured to align with and 
support other capitals—such as Human Capital, through 
deeper employee engagement in volunteering, and 
Natural Capital, through expanded community-based 
environmental initiatives—thereby demonstrating 
integrated thinking in practice.
In summary, DBSIL envisions a future where sustained 
investment in social and stakeholder relationships 
contributes meaningfully to inclusive development, 
enhanced resilience, and the creation of long-term 
shared value.
We look ahead 
with purpose, not 
projection. The future 
of our relationships 
will be measured in 
lives uplifted and 
value shared.

5. 	 Digital Transformation and 
Workforce Productivity
	
Embracing digital technologies and automation 
is not merely an operational enhancement but a 
central pillar of our strategy, explicitly highlighted as 
the theme for our FY2025 Integrated Annual Report: 
“Digital Transformation: Sweetening the Future”. 
This theme underscores our belief that technology 
is key to driving a more efficient, sustainable, and 
value-added future for DBSIL and our stakeholders. 
We recognize that the world is undergoing its 
most exciting technology phase, with accelerated 
movement within the digital space towards artificial 
intelligence, redefining functions and resulting in 
disproportionately superior outcomes.
	
DBSIL has been consistently investing in digital 
technologies, replacing manual and conventional 
processes with modern interventions in 
manufacturing and back-end operations. Over 
time, we are evolving to be perceived more as a 
technology-driven manufacturing Company rather 
than a conventional sugar Company. Being in 
our thirtieth year of existence, we are poised to 
transition faster towards a predominantly digital 
personality. Business digitalization has become 
integral to competitiveness.
	
Our strategic approach to digital transformation 
impacts various areas, including:
	
Operational Efficiency: Accessing near real-
time manufacturing data provides actionable 
insights for informed decision-making and 
competitiveness. We are integrating digital 
technologies in manufacturing to enhance 
automation and data-driven decision-making. 
Process automation initiatives aim to reduce 
manual intervention and human error, while 
manufacturing automation has reduced 
unplanned downtime. Automation levels in 
equipment have increased over the years.
	
Supply Chain and Procurement: We are 
strengthening supply chain management through 
automation, mobility, and cloud solutions. We 
invested in the Ariba software for procurement, 
creating a marketplace for reverse auctioning 
and increasing vendor options.
	
Farming and Raw Material: We are using 
satellite sensing, drones, and new systems to 
gain visibility into farms, monitor cultivation, 
and optimize irrigation and fertilizer application 
to increase productivity per acre. Automation 
and real-time monitoring help detect early-
stage inefficiencies in the field. Digital tools like 
Human Capital
mobile apps are used to improve engagement 
with farmers and provide timely information on 
schedules and prices, enhancing transparency 
and trust.
	
Process Rewiring: Given the long tenure of 
many employees, we are reviewing standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) and automating 
processes to bring greater efficiency, 
recognizing this is a gradual journey.
	
Employee Productivity and Engagement: 
Digital transformation enhances employee 
productivity. The Company has developed 
mobile applications to improve information 
accessibility for employees. The Oracle 
platform is used for managing the entire 
employee lifecycle.
	
In alignment with the FY2025 theme, DBSIL’s 
HR function has prioritized digital capability 
development. We are implementing targeted 
upskilling programs for our employees to adopt 
Industry 4.0 tools, recognizing that increasing 
digitalization and technological advancements 
necessitate evolving skill requirements for our 
workforce. Key initiatives in FY2025 have included 
identifying future skill gaps through cross-functional 
collaboration and developing tailored programs 
focused on digital literacy, analytics, automation, 
and digital transformation. We leverage digital 
learning platforms like Nalanda – the Dalmia 
School of Leadership, Learning and Change 
(LLC) to improve accessibility and impact. Our 
L&D function actively supports human capital 
development by evaluating and introducing new 
learning technologies such as Video simulation tools, 
Kiosk -based platforms, and interactive content, 
enhancing engagement and retention. We are 
focused on ensuring our workforce, including those 
with longer tenures, is effectively upskilled and 
supported in adapting to new digital processes.
	
By strategically embracing digital technologies 
and investing in the digital skills of our workforce, 
we are driving process efficiency and productivity 
improvements across our operations. This proactive 
approach ensures our employees are equipped to 
thrive in a technologically advanced environment 
and positions DBSIL to scale the business without 
proportionately enhancing costs, which is a basis 
for superior profitability. Our digitally-enabled 
people transformation is expected to enhance 
talent development and nurture/empower leaders 
at every level. The company’s strategic plan involves 
integrating digital technologies in manufacturing to 
enhance automation and data-driven 
decision-making.

Human Capital
With 100% of our sites assessed 
for human rights risks and zero 
unresolved safety complaints 
in FY2025, our governance 
approach upholds ethical 
labour practices, fair wages, 
and a safe, harassment-free 
workplace.
7. 	 Labour Standards and Compliance
	
[GRI 401–409, 414] 
	
	
At DBSIL, we are committed to upholding fair 
labour practices, ethical conduct, and regulatory 
compliance as integral to our governance 
framework and long-term value creation. Our 
practices are guided by the Dalmia Way of Life, 
which promotes inclusive growth, employee well-
being, and community development.
	
We comply with all applicable labour laws, ensuring 
fair wages, equal opportunity, and human rights 
protections. DBSIL maintains a zero-tolerance 
policy towards child labour, forced labour, and 
discrimination, with 100% of sites assessed for 
related risks in FY2025. No significant issues 
were identified. All external contracts include 
clauses addressing human rights due diligence. 
We respect the right to unionise and engage in 
collective bargaining, with active trade unions at 
select sites (e.g., Kolhapur and Ninaidevi). Worker 
engagement on health and safety is supported 
by formal committees with equal representation. 
Wage settlements and bonuses were negotiated at 
Maharashtra units.
	
Our Code of Conduct defines standards on 
anti-corruption, conflict of interest, and ethical 
behaviour. All employees receive annual training 
and certification. In FY2025, 59% of employees 
completed ethics training. We provide a 
harassment-free workplace, supported by grievance 
mechanisms such as the Whistleblower Policy, POSH 
Committee, and Ethics Helpline. In FY2025, none 
sexual harassment cases were reported.
	
Our approach includes pay equity monitoring 
and living wage compliance across employment 
categories. We report employee benefits under GRI 
401-2, including parental leave (GRI 401-3). Return-
to-work and retention post parental leave stood at 
100% in FY2025. All permanent staff are covered 
by retirement benefits (PF and Gratuity), and our 
premises are made accessible to persons with 
disabilities. We enforce an Equal Opportunity Policy, 
in line with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
Act, 2016.
Our FY2025 priorities include 
expanding digital literacy, 
enhancing DEI, and deepening 
leadership capabilities

About This GRI Content Index
This GRI Content Index has been developed to support the principles of integrated thinking and cross-referenced 
disclosure as advocated by the International Integrated Reporting (<IR>) Framework and the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Standards. It provides a structured mapping of key GRI disclosures to the respective chapters and 
themes of Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited’s Integrated Annual Report for FY2024–25.
By aligning each GRI disclosure with the relevant Strategic Pillars, Business Model Components, and Material 
Issues, this table facilitates deeper interconnectivity between strategy, governance, performance, and sustainability 
outcomes—core tenets of integrated reporting. It enables stakeholders to trace how material topics are managed 
across capitals, how sustainability-related disclosures are embedded in strategic execution, and how ESG priorities 
intersect with financial and operational performance.
This index is intended to aid readers, analysts, and assurance providers in navigating the report with clarity, while 
also reinforcing the Company’s commitment to transparency, comparability, and global best practices in corporate 
reporting.

Global Economy Overview
The global economy entered 2025 facing heightened 
uncertainty after relative a period of stabilisation in 
2024. According to the April 2025 IMF World Economic 
Outlook, global GDP growth is projected at 2.8% for 
2025, down from 3.3% in the January 2025 forecast. 
This downward revision stems mainly from the sharp 
Management Discussion & Analysis
escalation of trade tensions, triggered by the United 
States’ near-universal tariff announcements in April 
2025. While tariff hikes have since been temporarily 
paused for 90 days for most U.S. trading partners, the 
lack of clarity on post-pause trade dynamics continues 
to weigh on global sentiment, investment planning, and 
supply chain resilience.
Under these looming uncertainties, advanced economies 
are projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025, with the United 
States slowing to 1.8% due to trade-driven uncertainty 
and weakened domestic demand. In contrast, emerging 
market and developing economies (EMDEs) are xpected 
to grow by 3.7%, down from prior estimates, with 
countries more exposed to global trade disruptions 
seeing steeper slowdowns.1 ​ 
1.	
World Economic Outlook, IMF, April 20, 2025.
Global currency markets have experienced increased 
volatility in 2025, with the U.S. dollar strengthening 
due to risk aversion and elevated U.S. yields. This has 
increased depreciation pressure on several emerging 
market currencies, including the Indian rupee.
Inflation and Interest Rate Movements
Global headline inflation is projected to ease to 4.3% in 
2025 and further to 3.6% in 2026, though the pace of

Outlook, global GDP growth is projected at 2.8% for 
2025, down from 3.3% in the January 2025 forecast.
disinflation varies across regions. Advanced economies 
are expected to reach their inflation targets earlier, 
with price growth moderating to 2.2% by 2026, while 
Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) 
are likely to see inflation decline to 4.6%. Since January, 
the 2025 inflation forecast has been revised slightly 
upward, driven by notable U.S. and UK increases. In the 
U.S., a 1.0 percentage point upward revision reflects 
persistent services inflation and recent tariff-induced 
supply shocks. The UK’s 0.7 percentage point revision 
is attributed to temporary regulated price changes. 
Inflation expectations in the euro area remain stable. 
These dynamics are expected to shape monetary policy 
decisions as central banks across the globe will try to 
balance inflation control with growth risks.2
Global Trade Disruptions and Recovery
The optimism surrounding post-pandemic trade recovery 
has been overshadowed by escalating protectionism. The 
World Trade Organisation (WTO) has sharply downgraded 
its 2025 global merchandise trade forecast from a 3.0% 
increase to a 0.2% decline, citing the resurgence of U.S. 
tariffs and broader economic spillovers as key factors. 
WTO expressed concern about the contraction and its

potential impact on global GDP, financial markets, and 
particularly on developing economies. This shift has 
weakened global trade momentum. Although headline 
trade volumes increased in Q4 2024 due to front-
loading of imports, underlying indicators—particularly in 
Asia and Europe—point to a slowing trajectory. Further, 
the policy unpredictability has increased market volatility 
and constrained investment planning across regions.3

Crude Oil Prices and Implications for 
Ethanol Economics
While off their 2022 highs, crude oil prices remain under 
pressure, driven by supply and demand uncertainties 
in the current global economic climate. Within a week, 
the benchmark Brent crude price dropped sharply from 
nearly $75 per barrel to below $60—a four-year low—
following the announcement of sweeping global tariffs 
by the United States, including steep duties on Chinese 
goods. Prices have since stabilised but continue to hover 
below the $70 mark.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration 
(EIA), global oil inventories are expected to rise from mid-
2025 as OPEC+ members gradually unwind production 
cuts, non-OPEC output increases, and international oil 
demand growth decelerates. As a result, the average 
Brent crude price is forecast at $68 per barrel in 2025, 
declining further to $61 per barrel in 2026.4

Overview
Indian Economy Overview
Despite facing spillover effects from global headwinds, 
India continues to exhibit remarkable economic 
resilience. The country is growing at nearly twice the 
pace of the worldwide economy, reflecting the strength 
of its domestic demand, policy support, and structural 
reforms. According to the April 2025 IMF World Economic 
Outlook, India’s real GDP is projected to grow at 6.2% 
in FY25 and 6.3% in FY26, significantly outpacing the 
global growth forecasts of 2.4% and 3.0% for the same 
periods, respectively. This robust momentum underscores 
India’s growing role as a key driver of global growth, even 
amid heightened global economic uncertainty.5
Inflation and Interest Rate Movements
According to government statistics, headline inflation 
eased to a 67-month low of 3.3% in March 2025, 
primarily due to a decline in food prices.6 The Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) projects CPI inflation to moderate

to 4.0% in FY26, indicating a continued disinflationary 
trend. Inflation is expected at 3.6% in Q1, 3.9% in Q2, 
3.8% in Q3, and 4.4% in Q4.7 Meanwhile, the RBI has 
pegged India’s GDP growth rate at 6.5% for FY26, 
reflecting continued economic momentum amidst easing 
price pressures.8
In response to moderating inflation and global 
economic uncertainties, the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) implemented two consecutive 25 basis point cuts 
to the policy repo rate in February and April 2025, 
bringing it down to 6.0%. The April meeting also marked 
a shift in the monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to 
‘accommodative’, signalling the central bank’s intent 
to support economic growth amid external challenges 
such as global trade tensions and subdued private 
investment.9

Management Discussion & Analysis
Monsoon Performance and Sowing Patterns
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has 
forecasted an above-normal southwest monsoon for 
2025, with expected rainfall at 105% of the Long Period 
Average (LPA) of 87 cm, with a model error of ±5%. 
This prediction is based on neutral El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and below-normal 
Eurasian snow cover, both conducive to enhanced 
monsoon activity.10 The anticipated robust monsoon 
is expected to positively impact kharif crop sowing, 
particularly in central and eastern India, which rely 
heavily on monsoon rains. However, northwest, northeast, 
10.	 2025 Southwest Monsoon likely to be above normal, Ministry of Earth 
Science, PIB, April 15, 2025.
and southern peninsular India regions may experience 
below-average rainfall, potentially affecting localised 
sowing patterns.  A favourable monsoon will likely boost 
agricultural output, stabilise food prices, and support 
rural incomes, contributing to overall economic growth. It 
also provides an opportunity to enhance exports of farm 
commodities like rice, onions, and sugar, while reducing 
dependence on imports of edible oils. 
Fiscal Measures Related to the Agri-Economy 
In the Union Budget for FY2025–26, the Government 
of India reaffirmed its commitment to the agricultural 
sector by allocating substantial funds to enhance farmer 
welfare and ensure food security.​
According to the April 2025 IMF 
World Economic Outlook, India’s real 
GDP is projected to grow at 6.2% in 
FY25 and 6.3% in FY26.
The Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI) projects 
CPI inflation to 
moderate to 4.0% 
in FY26, indicating 
a continued 
disinflationary 
trend.

and animal husbandry. 
Overview of the Global Sugar Sector
As per the latest Quarterly Market Outlook report 
published in May’25, ISO presented its third revision of 
the global 2024/25 sugar balance. ISO’s fundamental 
view of the global supply/demand situation sees a large 
global deficit (the difference between forecast world 
consumption and production) of 5.466 mln tonnes, up 
0.585 mln tonnes since February. A global deficit of 
this magnitude has not been seen for nine years. World 
production in 2024/25 was revised to 174.795 mln 
tonnes, down 6.469 mln tonnes from last season. Drivers 
include lower than expected production in India and 
Pakistan. World consumption is projected to reach a 
record 180.261 mln tonnes in 2024/25, down 0.160 mln 
tonnes on our previous estimate, while the 2023/24 
estimate is revised to 179.225 mln tonnes, down 0.747 
mln tonnes.13
Global sugar prices had surged by 55%, with global 
deficit increasing, reaching their highest levels since 
2011. This sharp increase is primarily attributed to severe 
droughts in India and Thailand, two of the world’s top 
sugar exporters, exacerbated by the El Niño weather 
pattern. These climatic conditions have significantly 
reduced sugarcane yields, leading to a global shortage. 
Although Brazil, the leading sugar producer, has 
experienced a robust harvest, it has not been sufficient 
to offset the deficits caused by the droughts in Asia. 
Consequently, countries heavily reliant on sugar imports, 
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, face heightened food

insecurity as the supply-demand imbalance drives up 
prices.14 Prices have recently declined due to anticipated 
increase in global supplies. 
On the trade front, the re-imposition of tariffs by the U.S. 
administration in 2025 has introduced uncertainties in 
global sugar trade. These tariffs have led to retaliatory 
measures from trading partners, affecting global supply 
chains and pricing dynamics. Trade barriers continue 
to influence the international sugar market. The U.S. 
maintains tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for sugar imports, 
with specific allocations for countries like Brazil, Mexico, 
and the Philippines. While providing market access, 
these quotas also limit the volume of duty-free imports, 
affecting global trade flows. Countries like South Africa 
also have increased import duties to protect domestic 
industries. In August 2024, South Africa doubled its sugar 
import duty to shield local producers from lower global 
sugar prices.15
Brazil’s biofuel policies significantly impact sugar 
production. The country’s RenovaBio program mandates 
a ethanol blend of 27%. This policy encourages the

Management Discussion & Analysis
diversion of sugarcane to ethanol production, potentially 
reducing sugar availability for export. However, in the 
2025/26 season, Brazil is expected to produce 36.8 
billion litres of ethanol, a 1% drop from the previous 
season. This decline is attributed to a higher share of 
sugarcane being directed towards sugar production 
instead of ethanol, influenced by favourable sugar prices.
Overview of the Indian Sugar Sector
The Indian sugar industry, a cornerstone of the nation’s 
agro-based economy, is experiencing a significant 
transition in 2025. As the world’s second-largest sugar 
producer and consumer, India plays a pivotal role in the 
global sugar market. The sector supports approximately 
50 million farmers and contributes substantially to rural 
employment and income.​
In the 2024–25 sugar season, the industry faced 
challenges due to adverse weather conditions, including 
droughts and excessive rainfall. This reduced sugarcane 
yields in key producing states like Maharashtra, 
Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. As a result, the Indian 
Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) 
revised its sugar production estimates downward to 
26.2 million metric tons (MMT), an 18% decline from the 
previous year. Furthermore, approximately 3.5 MMT of 
sugar is expected to be diverted for ethanol production, 
aligning the government’s biofuel blending targets.  
Despite the production shortfall, ISMA assures that 
domestic sugar availability remains sufficient to meet the 
country’s consumption needs, projected at 28 MMT for 
the season. This confidence is bolstered by an opening 
stock of 8 MMT and a closing stock forecast of 5.4 MMT 
by September 2025, ensuring more than two months of 
domestic demand coverage.16

Global sugar prices have surged 
by 55% in early 2025, reaching 
their highest levels since 2011.
The International Sugar 
Organisation (ISO) has revised 
its forecast for the 2024/25

Overview
The government’s export policy has also helped stabilise 
the market. In January 2025, the government permitted 
the export of 1 MMT of sugar, a decision based on 
the initial higher production estimates. Subsequent 
downward revisions in production forecasts have raised 
concerns about the adequacy of domestic supplies. 
Nevertheless, the government maintains that the existing 
stock levels are sufficient to meet both domestic 
consumption and ethanol production requirements. 
In a significant move to support sugarcane farmers, 
the Indian government has increased the Fair and 
Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane by 4.41%, setting 
it at `355 per quintal for the 2025–26 season, up from 
`340. Based on a 10.25% sugar recovery rate, this 
adjustment includes a premium of `3.46 for every 0.1% 
increase in recovery and ensures a minimum payment 
of `329.05 per quintal for recoveries below 9.5%. The 
decision is expected to benefit approximately 50 million 
sugarcane farmers and 500,000 workers in the sugar 
industry. This increase in FRP will likely elevate raw 
material costs for sugar mills, potentially impacting their 
margins, especially in a year already marked by lower 
sugarcane yields and restricted export opportunities.17

Sugarcane fair price hiked to ` 355 a quintal, ET, May 01, 2025.
India is poised to significantly enhance its ethanol 
production capacity, targeting an annual output of 
approximately 1050 crore litres by the Ethanol Supply 
Year (ESY) 2025. This ambitious goal is part of a dual 
strategy that leverages grain and sugarcane feedstocks. 
Grain-based ethanol production is expected to rise 
substantially, from 380 crore litres to around 700 
crore litres by the following season. Sugarcane will 
complement this supply, with its substantial processing 
capacity contributing to the remaining demand. This 
approach aims to achieve the 20% ethanol blending 
target in petrol. It helps manage sugar inventories 
effectively, especially considering the high carry-over 
stocks anticipated at the end of the current season 
due to regulatory limits on ethanol production and 
sugar exports. The government’s careful regulation of 
sugarcane allocation for ethanol production, based on 
projected sugar demand-supply balances, plays a critical 
role in balancing market dynamics and ensuring timely 
payments to cane farmers.18

Management Discussion & Analysis
In May 2025, the Government of India introduced the 
Sugar (Control) Order, 2025, aiming to modernise 
and streamline the regulatory framework of the sugar 
sector. Key provisions include integrating sugar mills’ 
enterprise systems with the Department of Food and 
Public Distribution’s digital portal to enhance data 
transparency and operational efficiency. The order also 
brings raw sugar and khandsari units with capacities 
over 500 TCD, ensuring accurate stock assessments 
and fair remuneration to farmers. Additionally, it 
encompasses various by-products like ethanol, enabling 
better regulation of sugar diversion to maintain domestic 
availability. These measures are poised to foster a 
more efficient, transparent, and accountable sugar 
ecosystem, bolstering domestic stability and global 
competitiveness.19
Looking ahead, the industry is optimistic about the 
2025–26 season. Favourable monsoon forecasts and 
improved water availability have encouraged increased 
sugarcane planting, particularly in Maharashtra and 
Karnataka. This anticipated rebound in production could 
enable India to resume sugar exports, potentially ranging 
from 3 to 5 MMT, depending on weather conditions and 
global market dynamics.

Overview of the Indian Biofuel Sector
India has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2070, supported by a comprehensive 
strategy to decarbonise its economy. Interim goals 
include reducing the carbon intensity of GDP by 45% 
from 2005 levels and meeting 50% of energy needs 
from renewables by 2030. As of late 2024, renewable 
capacity surpassed 200 GW, complemented by the 
National Green Hydrogen Mission and increased nuclear 
investments. Legislative backing through the Energy 
Conservation (Amendment) Act and a long-term low-
carbon development strategy demonstrates India’s 
commitment. These efforts provide a strong foundation 
for expanding the biofuel sector as a key pillar in India’s 
energy transition.
India’s biofuel sector is emerging as a cornerstone of the 
nation’s energy transformation, where sustainability, rural 
empowerment, and economic resilience converge. At the 
heart of this shift is ethanol, the green molecule helping 
reduce carbon emissions, cut crude oil imports, and 
provide alternative revenue streams to farmers. 
Driven by the ambitious Ethanol Blending Program (EBP), 
which targets 20% blending by 2025–26, India is rapidly 
scaling up its distillation infrastructure. Sugarcane-
derived ethanol and growing emphasis on grain-
based feedstocks like maise and broken rice transform 
agricultural surplus into strategic energy assets. The 
commissioning of dual-feedstock distilleries across the 
country reflects a maturing sector ready to adapt to 
market and environmental demands.
Management Discussion & Analysis
Policy support has played a pivotal role. From interest 
subvention schemes to assured offtake pricing by oil 
marketing companies (OMCs), the government has 
created a stable and forward-looking environment for 
investment and innovation. These measures have reduced 
cane arrears to farmers and insulated sugar mills from 
the cyclical volatility of global sugar prices.
Beyond economics, the sector carries a strong climate 
narrative. Biofuels significantly lower greenhouse gas 
emissions than fossil fuels, support cleaner air in urban 
centres, and promote energy self-reliance. As the world 
seeks scalable solutions for decarbonisation, India’s 
biofuel journey is a compelling model of how agri-energy 
can drive inclusive, sustainable growth.
In a move to bolster its global leadership in sustainable 
energy, India launched the Global Biofuel Alliance (GBA) 
during the G20 Summit in 2023. The alliance, comprising 
22 countries and 12 international organisations, aims to 
promote the development and adoption of sustainable 
biofuels worldwide. India’s active participation positions 
it as a central hub for biofuel innovation, standard-
setting, and trade facilitation. 
The Indian government has also implemented various 
subsidies and incentives to encourage biofuel 
production. These measures are designed to attract 
investment, enhance energy security, and reduce reliance 
on fossil fuels. ​
Despite these advancements, challenges persist, 
including feedstock availability, infrastructure 
development, and the need for technological innovation. 
Addressing these issues is crucial for India to realise its 
biofuel potential and contribute significantly to global 
sustainability goals.
India’s Cogeneration Sector Overview
India’s cogeneration sector, based on simultaneous 
electricity and heat production, is vital in enhancing 
energy efficiency and supporting decarbonisation efforts. 
With industries like sugar mills leading the way through 
biomass-based cogeneration, the country has developed 
over 10 GW of capacity. Encouraged by favourable 
policies such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), 
concessional financing, and long-term Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs), many mills have transitioned into 
integrated energy producers. Cogeneration systems, 
especially when powered by renewable fuels such as 
biogas or biomass, can deliver 35–40% energy savings 
over traditional methods. Government initiatives, 
including financial support under the National Bioenergy 
Programme, accelerate deployment, though high upfront 
costs and fuel sourcing remain key challenges.
Building on cogeneration, trigeneration adds a cooling 
function—using waste heat to produce chilled water for 
air conditioning or refrigeration, reaching efficiencies 
up to 90%. This makes trigeneration ideal for hospital 
applications, commercial buildings, and data centres. 
The expansion of city gas networks and policy backing 
are encouraging its growth. As India transitions to a low-
carbon future, trigeneration represents the next logical 
step in optimising energy use across sectors, provided 
infrastructure gaps and cost barriers are addressed.
The true strength of cogeneration lies in its decentralised 
nature. It is often located in rural areas, where it 
enhances grid stability, reduces transmission losses, and 
promotes regional development. As India intensifies its 
focus on energy diversification and carbon reduction, 
cogeneration, rooted in agricultural residues, stands out 
as a resilient, scalable, and sustainable solution.

sugar and distillery units and contributes to the revenue 
stream through surplus energy sales to the grid. In a 
year marked by ethanol-related policy headwinds and 
elevated input costs, the cogeneration business 
stabilised by containing operating costs and supporting 
margin resilience.
The Company operates cogeneration units across all six 
sugar plants, with a total installed capacity of 138 MW. A 
significant portion is exported to state electricity boards, 
particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Segmental Strengths
The following key strengths characterise DBSIL’s 
cogeneration business:
	
Operational Efficiency: Cogeneration units are 
embedded within sugar plants, ensuring efficient 
thermal energy utilisation and reducing dependence 
on external power.
	
Revenue Diversification: The ability to export surplus 
power provides an additional and steady revenue 
stream, partially offsetting the sugar segment’s 
seasonality.
	
Tariff Advantage in Maharashtra: DBSIL’s plants in 
Kolhapur and Sangli benefit from relatively favourable 
feed-in tariffs under the state’s renewable energy 
purchase obligations.
	
Sustainability and Compliance: Power generated 
from bagasse is classified as renewable, contributing 
positively to the Company’s ESG profile and carbon 
reduction targets.
Challenges & Mitigation
Cogeneration operates seasonally, constrained by 
bagasse availability and subject to regulatory tariff 
changes across states. This limits scalability and makes 
revenue partially dependent on state utilities. DBSIL 
addresses these limitations by maximising internal 
energy efficiency, reducing reliance on grid power, and 
optimising export volumes during peak season. With 
plants in UP and Maharashtra, the Company benefits 
from geographic diversification in tariff realisations, 
ensuring that the cogeneration business continues 
adding steady, cost-efficient value across cycles.

Analysis of P&L Statement
DBSIL reported a 26% year-on-year increase in total 
income, reaching `3,820 crore in FY2025 compared 
to `3,028 crore in FY2024. This growth was primarily 
driven by higher sugar volumes sold, increased ethanol 
capacity utilisation, and improved realisations. However, 
this topline growth did not translate into proportional 
bottom-line performance due to input cost pressures and 
regulatory headwinds.
Operating EBITDA increased by 13.83% to `469 crore 
from `412 crore in the previous year. EBITDA margin 
compressed by 169 basis points, from 14.21% in FY2024 
to 12.52% in FY2025. The contraction in margins was 
mainly attributable to lower grain ethanol profitability, 
higher cane costs and limited distillery operations during 
the off season on account of limited sugar diversion in 
ESY 24.
Management Discussion & Analysis
As a result, profit before tax (PBT) also declined by 3.58% 
to `350 crore. However Profit after tax (PAT) stood at 
`387 crore, significantly improving from `272 crore in the 
previous year. The PAT margin was modestly enhanced 
to 10.33% from 9.38%. Earnings per share (EPS) also 
showcased exceptional growth by 41.95%, reaching 
`47.78 per share compared to `33.66 in FY2024, 
indicating consistency in net earnings despite sector-
specific headwinds.
Analysis of Balance Sheet
Sources of Funds
Net Worth: As of 31st March 2024, the company’s 
net worth stood at `2,932.16 crore and increased to 
`3234.51 crore as of 31st March 2025, reflecting an 
absolute rise of `302.35 crore, or 10.31%. This growth was 
driven by internal accruals, as the equity share capital 
remained unchanged at `16.19 crore, comprising 8.09 
crore equity shares of `2 each.
Long-term Debt: The Company’s long-term borrowings 
increased from `337.78 crore in FY24 to `513.71 crore as 
on 31st March 2025, resulting in an increase of `175.93 
crore. The long-term debt-to-equity ratio stood at 0.18x 
in FY25 indicating strength of the balance sheet. 
Finance Cost: The Company experienced an increased 
finance cost during the year. However, its interest 
coverage remained healthy, standing at 8.62 times in 
FY25 against 10.79 times in FY4, reflecting continued 
comfort in debt servicing despite a higher interest outgo.
Application of Funds
Fixed Assets: Gross fixed assets rose from 
`3,251 crore in FY24 to `3,326 crore in FY25, 
primarily due to ongoing capacity enhancement 
initiatives, including Baghauli Acquistion and Expansion 
of Nigohi sugarcane crushing capacity from 9250 TCD to 
10500 TCD.
Investments: Non-current investments decreased from 
`629 crore on March 31, 2024, to `583 crore on 
31st March, 2025. The decline was mainly attributable to 
decrease in the marked-to-market value of long-term 
equity holdings.
Working Capital Management
Current Assets: Current assets declined from `2,488 
crore in FY24 to `2228 crore at the end of FY25. The 
current ratio moved from 1.55 to 2.59, due to substantial 
reduction in working capital loans.
Inventories: Inventories, which include raw materials, 
work-in-progress, and finished goods, declined from 
`1,773 crore in FY24 to `1657 crore in FY25, representing 
a decline of `116 crore or 6.56%. 
Cash and Bank Balances
Cash and Bank Balances stood at `530 crore at 
the end of FY24 and decreased to `357 crore in 
FY25. This indicates the sound liquidity maintained 
by the organization.

Management Discussion & Analysis
Financial Controls
DBSIL has instituted strong financial controls over 
critical processes, including procurement, inventory 
management, revenue recognition, and capital 
expenditure. The Company follows a maker-checker-
approver system across transactions, supported by 
enterprise-level SAP automation, ensuring compliance

System of Teamlease Regtech at all its locations to track 
and ensure compliance with all applicable laws, rules 
and regulations.
A centralised risk management committee periodically 
reviews control effectiveness, incident logs, audit 
findings, and emerging threats, enabling prompt 
corrective action. Audit Committee of the Board oversees 
the adequacy and implementation of internal controls, 
drawing insights from internal and statutory audit 
observations.
IT and Cybersecurity Controls

(a)	 the consolidation of business would lead to efficient 
and economical cost management, cost savings, 
pooling of resources, optimum utilisation of resources, 
rationalisation of administrative expenses/services;
(b)	 the single entity, i.e., DBSIL would have increased 
capability for offering products by virtue of its 
enhanced resource base, resulting in better business 
potential and prospects for the merged entity;
(c)	 the 
proposed 
Scheme 
would 
augment 
the 
manufacturing footprint and capabilities of DBSIL, by 
increasing the scale of manufacturing operations;
(d)	 the consolidation of businesses under a single entity 
and brand, i.e. DBSIL, would lead to synergies in 
operational process and logistics alignment, creating 
better synergy, better utilisation of human resources 
and further development and growth;
(e)	 thus, this Scheme, as envisaged, was in the interest 
of the shareholders, creditors, employees, and other 
stakeholders of each of the Companies by pursuing 
a focused business approach under a single entity, 
thereby resulting in overall maximization of value 
creation of all the stakeholders involved.

(i)	 Commodity price risk or foreign exchange risk and hedging activities
	
Commodities form a major part of business of the Company and hence commodity price risk is one of the important 
risks for the Company. The Company has a robust mechanism in place to protect the Company’s interest from risks 
arising out of market volatility. The Company’s forward integration into cogeneration and distillery helped hedge 
revenues and moderate dependence on sugar for profitability.
	
During the year exports were done in foreign currency, hence there was a risk of exchange rate fluctuation especially 
in the current volatile scenario. Hence, the Company hedged 100% foreign currency exposures.
(j)	 Transfer of Unpaid / Unclaimed amounts to Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF)
	
Pursuant to the provisions of Companies Act, 2013, dividends which remain unclaimed / unpaid over a period of 
seven years are required to be transferred by the Company to the IEPF constituted by the Central Government.
	
Following are the details of Dividends paid by the Company and their respective due dates of transfer to the IEPF 
if it remains unclaimed by the Members.

5.	
Specific 
commitments, 
goals 
and targets set by the entity with 
defined timelines, if any.
DBSIL is executing the strategy of becoming water positive and improve 
soil carbon content. Currently, half of the land in the Company’s 
catchment area has low organic carbon content (< 0.5%). The Company 
aims to increase and maintain the soil organic carbon in medium range 
(0.5% - 0.75%) by 2030. The Company aims to increase the soil carbon 
content through recommended doses in organic manures / compost and 
intervention through animal husbandry programme for domestic animals. 
The Company plans to use green manure crops, undertake crop rotation, 
and eliminate the burning of crop residue.
The water table in the Company’s catchment area in Uttar Pradesh has 
depleted by 2 metres in ten years. To address this concern, the Company 
aims to become 10x water positive by 2030. The Company will work with 
200,000 sugarcane cultivators in reducing their annual ground water 
consumption by 500 KL per hectare by 2030, with annual conservation 
potential of 25 billion litres.
Soil carbon content and water are the two most critical elements for 
sustainable sugarcane cultivation. By addressing both critical elements, 
DBSIL is also ensuring sustainable livelihoods and income for farmers.

Union and Works committee develops the measures for securing and preserving amity

their common interest or concern and endeavour to compose any material difference of 
opinion in respect of such matters.
Further, to provide a platform to all stakeholders to voice genuine concerns about any 
breach of the Code of Conduct or the Company’s guidelines or values, we have Whistle 
Blower Policy and Vigil Mechanism. The platform ensures that all complaints are heard, 
recorded and registered with the ethics committee for further action with transparency 
and confidentiality so that it improves confidence in the organisation and also acts as 
a deterrent against deviations from guidelines, values and the DNA. The whistle blower 
complaints/disclosures are recorded and tracked through an independent third party-
monitored ‘Ethics help line’.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1. 	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
	
In this rapidly changing environment, the Company is adapting and responding to issues that matter the most to 
business and stakeholders. It is constantly working on understanding these issues as they help us define strategic 
priorities and report issues of interest to stakeholders. To identify and subsequently validate the material issues, the 
Company first creates a bucket list of potential material aspects by analysing the material issues of peer companies 
through the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Furthermore, 
the Company engages with stakeholder groups to understand views and concerns on identified material issues. 
This helps the Company in defining these material aspects and fabricating a path for long-term value creation. 
The assessment makes it possible to shortlist and prioritize material elements and group them under four pillars: 
empowering people, responsible consumption, responsible growth and business ethics and sustainable business 
practices.
	
Board is apprised on feedback from consultation with stakeholders through presentations during quarterly meetings.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from 
stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, the stakeholder consultation is important to identify the areas of concern in environment and social sectors. 
The Company’s major stakeholder is the farmers/suppliers/community around us. The main concern is soil health 
and water conservation, being an agrarian community. Hence, the Company is working extensively on soil health 
management and efficient water usage with water conservation, while promoting better agricultural practices for 
superior yield through the cane department and corporate social responsibility initiative. The Company considers 
unemployment as a concern and operates skill training centres that provide placement-linked, short-term skill 
training programs to the youth.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
The Company undertakes cane development activities and provides necessary guidance to marginalized cane 
growers with regards to the selection of the right variety of propagation materials, agri-inputs and agronomical 
practices, support in setting-up farmyard manure units, vermicomposting units, provide solar operated sprayers, 
among others. The promotion of energy-efficient cooking methods and the installation of solar lighting has 
particularly benefited the women and children of the communities. Women Self Help Groups are promoted and 
skills development training sessions (stitching and weaving, Moonj craft, among others) are conducted to create 
additional avenues of income generation for them. Also maternal, neonatal and adolescent health camps are run 
periodically. Many school intervention programmes have been implemented and remedial education centres have 
been established for children. The construction of individual sanitary latrines in line with ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’ 
and ‘Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyaan’ benefitted the local community. Skill training centers (ITI and DIKSHa) are being 
run to ensure skill development, enhancing the employability of the local youth.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Our company follows a circular economy approach by ensuring effective utilization and treatment of all major 
waste streams.
	
Fly ash generated from our boilers is repurposed in the manufacturing of fly ash bricks. Press mud, rich in organic 
matter, is distributed to farmers as an effective natural manure.
	
Spent wash from the distillery is utilized as a fuel in incineration boilers, ensuring energy recovery and safe 
disposal.
	
Distillers’ dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a by-product of ethanol production, are used as high-protein feed 
for animals.
	
The environment component ensures that the Company consumes environmentally responsible resources, utilizes an 
optimal quantum of finite fossil fuels, recycles waste, moderates carbon footprint, and builds resistance to climate 
change.
	
DBSIL’s Waste Management Practices:
	
In FY 2024–25, DBSIL improved process efficiency, further reducing raw material waste. Byproducts from sugar 
production continued to generate value through distilleries, co-gen units, and new circular economy initiatives.
	
Recycling Focus: Higher reuse of process water and packaging waste.
	
Boiler Fly ash – making fly ash brick to promote circular economy
•	
Resource Efficiency: The company prioritizes efficient conversion of raw materials into products, minimizing 
waste generation. Distilleries and co-generation units generate additional revenue by transforming sugar 
production byproducts into valuable products.
o	
Zero Liquid Discharge: Reusing liquid waste after treatment. Extended Producer Responsibility: Complying 
with regulations regarding end-of-life product management.
	
Waste-to-Wealth Programs:  Developing projects to convert waste into usable products like bio-compressed 
natural gas (bio-CNG), ash bricks, and bio-manure.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Audit of the Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Financial 
Statements of Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries 
Limited (“the Company”), which comprise the Balance 
Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit 
and Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, the 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of 
Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to 
the Financial Statements including a summary of material 
accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
Financial Statements give the information required by 
the Companies Act, 2013, (“the Act”) in the manner so 
required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of 
affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025 and its 
profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in equity 
and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Financial Statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) 
specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the Financial Statements.
Emphasis of Matter
Attention is drawn to Note No.46 regarding merger of 
Baghauli Sugar and Distillery Limited (100% Subsidiary of 
the company) by the Company. As per National Company 
Law Tribunal “NCLT”, Chennai order dated April 25th 
2025, Baghauli Sugar and Distillery limited gets merged 
with Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited with 
effect from April 01st 2024 i.e. the appointed date as per 
the scheme. The same is considered as “adjusting event” 
as per Ind AS-10 and accordingly financials for the year 
ended March 31st 2025 have been given effect to the 
above scheme.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of above matter.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report.
To the Members of
DALMIA BHARAT SUGAR AND INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
(1)	
Determination of net realizable value of inventory of 
sugar as at the year ended March 31, 2025 (Refer 
note 8 & 35 to the Financial Statements)
	
As on March 31, 2025, the Company has inventory of 
sugar with the carrying value ` 1286.10 Crores. The 
inventory of sugar is valued at the lower of cost and 
net realizable value.
Our procedures included the following:
	• We understood and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of controls as established by the 
management in determination of net realizable value 
of inventory of sugar.
	• Assessing the appropriateness of Company’s 
accounting policy for valuation of finished goods and 
compliance of the policy with the requirements of the 
prevailing accounting standards.
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
	
We considered the inventory valuation of sugar 
as a key audit matter given the relative size of 
the balance in the Financial Statements and 
significant judgment involved in the consideration 
of factors such as minimum sale price, monthly 
quota, fluctuation in selling prices and the related 
notifications of the Government in determination of 
net realizable value.
	• We considered various factors including the actual 
selling price prevailing around and subsequent to 
the year-end, minimum selling price, monthly quota 
and other notifications of the Government of India, 
initiatives taken by the Government with respect to 
sugar industries.
	• Compared the cost of the finished goods with the 
estimated net realizable value and checked if the 
finished goods were recorded at net realizable value 
where the cost was higher than the net realizable 
value.
(2)	 Litigations Matters & Contingent Liabilities 
(Refer note 31 of the Financial Statements)
	
The Company is subject to claims and litigations. 
Major risks identified by the Company in that area 
relate to claims against the Company and taxation 
matters. The amounts of claims and litigations may 
be significant and estimates of the amounts of 
provisions or contingent liabilities are subject to 
significant management judgment.
	
Due to complexity involved in these litigation 
matters, management’s judgment regarding 
recognition and measurement of provisions for these 
legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and might 
change over time as the outcomes of the legal 
cases are determined and it has been considered as 
a key audit matter.
Our procedures included the following:
	• Assessing the procedures implemented by the 
Company to identify and gather the risks it is  
exposed to.
	• Discussion with the management on the  
evelopment in these litigations during the year ended 
March 31, 2025.
	• Obtaining an understanding of the risk analysis 
performed by the Company, with the relating 
supporting documentation and studying written 
statements from internal/ external legal experts, when 
applicable.
	• Verification that the accounting and/ or disclosures 
as the case may be in the Financial Statements is in 
accordance with the assessment of legal counsel/ 
management.
	• Obtaining representation letter from the management 
on the assessment of those matters as per SA 580 
(revised)-written representations.
Information Other than the  
Financial Statements and Auditor’s 
Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Management Discussion and 
Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s 
Report, Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report 
and Report on Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s 
information, but does not include the Financial 
Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover 
the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or 
our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. There is 
no material misstatement observed during the audit by 
us, therefore we have nothing to report in this matter.

Responsibilities of the Management and 
Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with 
respect to the preparation of these Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
loss, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Ind AS specified under 
Section 133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, Management 
and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken based on these Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
	• Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. 
Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also 
responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to the financial statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
	• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
	• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
	• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
Independent Auditor’s Report 
Contd...
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

(Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other 
Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our 
report to the Members of Dalmia Bharat Sugar and 
Industries Limited of even date)
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to the financial statements of Dalmia Bharat 
Sugar and Industries Limited (“the Company”) as of 
March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the 
Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 
on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for 
Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
with reference to the financial statements based on 
the internal control over financial reporting criteria, 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to the financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the 
ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under 
Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls with reference to the 
financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to the financial statements 
was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to the financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls 
with reference to the financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to the Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference 
to the financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of the Financial 
Statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal financial control with reference 
to the financial statements includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) Pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the Company: (2) Provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of the Financial Statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the Company; and (3) 
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the Financial Statements.
Annexure “B” to the  
Independent Auditor’s Report
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to the Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to the financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to the financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the Company 
has, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to the financial statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the criteria for 
internal financial control with reference to the financial 
statements established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

disclosure of contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets at the date of the financial statements 
and the results of operations during the reporting 
period. Although these estimates are based upon 
the Management’s best knowledge of current events 
and actions, actual results could differ from these 
estimates. Difference between the actual results 
and estimates are recognized in the period in which 
the results are known / materialized.
	
The estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognized in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that period, or in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods
a.	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets
	
The useful life and residual value of plant, property 
equipment and intangible assets are determined 
based on technical evaluation made by the 
management of the expected usage of the asset, 
the physical wear and tear and technical or 
commercial obsolescence of the asset. Due to the 
judgements involved in such estimations, the useful 
life and residual value are sensitive to the actual 
usage in future period. The management evaluates 
and reviews the pattern of expected economic 
benefits from the asset along with commensurate 
method of depreciation on periodic basis and 
decides to follow suitable method of charging 
depreciation.
b. 	 Recognition and measurement of defined benefit 
obligations
	
The cost of the leave encashment, defined benefit 
plan and other post-employment benefits and the 
present value of such obligation are determined 
using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation 
involves making various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and 
attrition rate. Due to the complexities involved in 
the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined 
benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are periodically 
reviewed at each reporting date.
c. 	 Fair value measurement of financial instruments
	
When the fair value of the financial assets and 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot 
be measured based on the quoted market price in 
active markets, their fair value is measured using 
valuation technique. The input to these models are 
taken from the observable market wherever possible, 
but where this is not feasible, a review of judgment 
is required in establishing fair values. Changes in 
assumption relating to these assumptions could 
affect the fair value of financial instrument.
d. 	 Provision for litigations and contingencies
	
The provision for litigations and contingencies 
are determined based on evaluation made by the 
management of the present obligation arising from 
past events the settlement of which is expected to 
result in outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits, which involves judgements around 
estimating the ultimate outcome of such past events 
and measurement of the obligation amount.
e. 	 Impairment of financial and non-financial assets
	
The impairment provision for financial assets is 
based on assumptions about risk of default and 
expected losses. The Company uses judgement in 
making these assumptions and selecting the inputs 
to the impairment calculation, based on Company’s 
past history, existing market conditions as well 
as forward looking estimates at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date 
whether there is an indication that a Non-financial 
asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset 
is required, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount which is higher of an asset’s 
or Cash generating unit (CGU) fair value less costs 
of disposal and its value in use. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount.
F.	 Fair value measurement
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place 
either:
	•
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
	•
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole:
	
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets & 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and the risks of the asset or liability and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure 
purposes in these financial statements is determined 
on such a basis as explained above, except for 
share-based payment transactions that are within 
the scope of Ind AS 102, leasing transactions that 
are within the scope of Ind AS 17, and measurements 
that have some similarities to fair value but are not 
fair value, such as net realizable value in Ind AS 2 or 
value in use in Ind AS 36.
G.	 Recent Pronouncement
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. During the year 
ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS 
117- Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind 
AS 116-Leases, relating to sale and lease back 
transactions, applicable from April 1, 2024. The 
Company has assessed that there is no significant 
impact on its financial statements.
	
On May 9, 2025, MCA notified the amendments to 
Ind AS 21- Effects of changes in Foreign Exchange 
Rates. These amendments aim to provide clearer 
guidance on assessing currency exchangeability 
and estimating exchange rates when currencies 
are not readily exchangeable. The amendments are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
April 1, 2025. The company is currently assessing 
the probable impact of these amendments on its 
financial statements.
3.	 Material accounting policies
A.	 Property, plant and equipment and 
Capital work-in-progress
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at 
original cost net of tax/ duty credit availed, less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. The cost of an asset includes 
the purchase cost of materials including import 
duties and non-refundable taxes, and any directly 
attributable costs of bringing an asset to the 
location and condition of its intended use. Interest 
on borrowings used to finance the construction of 
qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of 
the asset until such time that the asset is ready for 
its intended use. The present value of the expected 
cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its 
use is included in the cost of the respective asset if 
the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Overview
Governance
Strategy
	
When significant part of the property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, 
the Company derecognized the replaced part and 
recognized the new parts with its own associated 
useful life and it is depreciated accordingly. 
Likewise when a major inspection is performed, 
its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 
recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and 
maintenance cost are recognized in the statement 
of the profit and loss as incurred.
	
Internally manufactured property, plant and 
equipment are capitalised at factory cost.
	
Capital work in progress include property plant & 
equipment under installation/under development as 
at the balance sheet date and are carried at cost, 
comprising direct cost, related incidental expenses 
and attributable borrowing cost.
	
Property, plant and equipment are derecognised 
from the financial statement, either on disposal 
or when no economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Losses arising in the case of 
retirement of property, plant and equipment and 
gain or losses arising from disposal of property, plant 
and equipment are a recognized in the statement of 
profit and loss in the year of occurrence.
	
For transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to 
continue with the carrying value of all of its property, 
plant and equipment, except Land, recognised as 
of April 1, 2016 (transition date) measured as per 
the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as 
its deemed cost as of the transition date. For Land 
the Company has elected to use Fair Value at the 
transition to Ind AS and use this value as its deemed 
cost.
B.	 Investment Property
	
Investment properties are properties, either land 
or building or both, held to earn rentals and/
or for capital appreciation (including property 
under construction for such purposes). Investment 
properties are measured initially at cost including 
transactions costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are measured in accordance 
with requirement for cost model.
	
An investment property is derecognised upon 
disposal or when the investment property is 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefits are expected from the disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the 
property (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in 
which the property is de-recognised.
C.	 Intangible assets
	
Intangible asset are recognised when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits that are 
attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and 
the cost of asset can be measured reliably.
	
Capital expenditure on purchase and development 
of identifiable assets without physical substance is 
recognized as intangible assets in accordance with 
principles given under Ind AS-38 – Intangible Assets.
	
Internally generated intangible asset, excluding 
capitalized development cost, are not capitalized 
and the related expenditure is reflected in 
statement of profit & loss in the period in which the 
expenditure is incurred.
	
The useful lives of intangible asset are assed as 
either finite or indefinite. The amortization period 
and the amortization method for an intangible 
asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least 
at the end of each reporting period. Changes in 
the expected useful life or the expected pattern 
of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the assets are considered to modify the 
amortization period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are 
not amortised, but are tested for impairment either 
individually or at the cash generating unit level. 
The assessment of indefinite useful life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life 
continues to be supportable. Currently there are no 
intangible assets with indefinite useful life.
	
Gain or losses arising from de-recognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit & loss when the asset is 
derecognised.
D.	 Depreciation and amortization
	
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
and Intangible assets is calculated on the basis of 
useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013. The following methods of 
depreciation are used for PPE and Intangible assets:
A. Plant and machinery
Sugar, Cogeneration 
and Distillery Segment 
(Excluding Sanitizer)
Written down value 
method
Sanitizer 
100% depreciation 
charged in the year of 
purchase
Situated at Salem 
(excluding earth 
moving machinery) 
Wind Farm and MLCC 
division
Straight line method
B. Leasehold land
Amortised over the period 
of lease, i.e., 99 years
C. Computer software
Amortised over a period 
of 3-5 years on a Straight 
line basis.
D. Other intangible 
assets
Amortised over a period 
of maximum 10 years on a 
straight line basis.
E. Capital Spares
Based on technical 
estimates by the 
management depreciated 
on straight line method 
over a period of 10 years.
F. Remaining Property 
Plant and equipment
Straight Line Method
E.	 Leases
	
The determination of whether an arrangement is 
(or contains) a lease is based on the substance of 
the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The 
arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment 
of the arrangement is dependent on the use of 
a specific asset or assets and the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even 
if that right is not explicitly specified in an 
arrangement.
	
Where the Company is the lessee
	
Finance leases are capitalized as assets at the 
commencement of the lease, at an amount equal 
to the fair value of leased asset or present value of 
the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, 
valued at the inception date. Lease payments 
are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance charges are recognized as 
finance costs in the statement of profit and loss, 
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying 
assets, in which case they are capitalized in 
accordance with the Company’s general policy on 
borrowing cost. A leased asset is depreciated over 
the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no 
reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful 
life of the asset and the lease term.
	
Payment made under operating leases are 
recognized as expense in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss on a straight line basis over the lease term, 
unless the receipts are structured to increase in line 
with expected general inflation to compensate for 
the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increase.
	
Where the Company is the lessor
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of an asset are classified as operating leases. Where 
the escalation of lease rentals is in line with the 
expected general inflation so as to compensate the 
lessor for expected inflationary cost, the increases in 
the rentals is not straight lined.
F.	 Government grants
	
Government grants are recognised at fair value 
when there is reasonable assurance that the grant 
would be received and the Company would comply 
with all the conditions attached with them.
	
Government grants whose primary condition is 
that the Company should purchase, construct or 
otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised 
as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and 
transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and 
rational basis over the useful lives of the related 
assets.
	
Government grants that are receivable as 
compensation for expenses or losses already 
incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate 
financial support to the Company with no future 
related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which they become receivable.
	
The benefit of a government loan at a below-market 
rate of interest is treated as a government grant, 
measured as the difference between proceeds 
received and the fair value of the loan based on 
prevailing market interest rates.

G.	 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset are 
capitalized as part of the cost of such asset till such 
time that is required to complete and prepare the 
asset to get ready for its intended use. A qualifying 
asset is one that necessarily takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended use. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs 
that the Company incurs in connection with the 
borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs also include 
exchange differences to the extent regarded as an 
adjustment to the borrowing costs.
	
All other borrowing costs are charged to the 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which 
they are incurred.
H.	 Segment accounting and reporting
	
The chief operational decision maker monitors the 
operating results of its business segments separately 
for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment 
performance is evaluated based on profit and loss 
and is measured consistently with profit and loss in 
the financial statements.
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision maker (CODM).
	
The accounting policies adopted for segment 
reporting are in line with the accounting policies 
adopted for preparing and presenting the financial 
statements of the Company as a whole. In addition, 
the following specific accounting policies have been 
followed for segment reporting:
	•
Segment revenue includes sales and other 
income directly identifiable with / allocable to 
the segment including inter segment transfers.
	•
Inter segment transfers are accounted for 
based on the transaction price agreed to 
between the segments which is at cost in case 
of transfer of Company`s intermediate and final 
products and estimated realisable value in case 
of by-products.
	•
Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are 
identified to segments on the basis of their 
relationship to the operating activities of 
the segment. Revenue, expenses, assets and 
liabilities which relate to the Company as a 
whole and are not allocable to segments on 
direct and/or on a reasonable basis, have been 
disclosed as “Unallocable”
I.	
Employee benefits
	
Expenses and liabilities in respect of employee 
benefits are recorded in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standard (Ind AS)-19 - ‘Employee 
Benefits’.
a.	
Short-term employee benefits
	
Short-term employee benefits in respect of 
salaries and wages, including non-monetary 
benefits are recognised as an expense at 
the undiscounted amount in the statement of 
profit and loss for the year in which the related 
service is rendered.
b.	
Defined contribution plan
	
Retirement benefits in the form of provident 
fund, pension fund, superannuation fund 
and ESI are a defined contribution scheme 
and the contributions are charged to the 
statement of profit and loss of the year when 
the contributions to the respective funds are 
due. There are no other obligations other than 
the contribution payable to the provident fund/
trust.
c.	
Defined benefit plan
	
Retirement benefits in the form of gratuity and 
provident fund contribution to Dalmia Cement 
Provident Fund Trust are defined benefit plans. 
Gratuity is provided for on the basis of an 
actuarial valuation on projected unit credit 
method made at the end of each financial year. 
Contributions to Dalmia Cement Provident Fund 
Trust are charged to the Statement of Profit and 
Loss of the year when the contributions to the 
fund is due.
	
The Company’s liabilities on account of gratuity 
and earned leaves on retirement of employees 
are determined at the end of each financial 
year on the basis of actuarial valuation 
certificates obtained from registered actuary in 
accordance with the measurement procedure 
as per Indian Accounting Standard 19 (Ind 
AS 19) ‘Employee Benefits’. Gratuity liability is 
funded on year-to-year basis by contribution to 
respective fund. The costs of providing benefits 
under these plans are also determined on the 
basis of actuarial valuation at each year end. 
Actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit 
plans are recognized through OCI in the period 
in which they occur. Re-measurements are 
not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent 
periods.
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to 
be utilized within the next 12 months, is 
treated as short-term employee benefit. The 
Company measures the expected cost of 
such absenteeism as the additional amount 
that it expects to pay as a result of the 
unused entitlement that has accumulated 
at the reporting date. The Company treats 
accumulated leave expected to be carried 
forward beyond twelve months, as long-term 
employee benefit for measurement purposes. 
Such long term compensated absences are 
provided for based on actuarial valuation. The 
actuarial valuation is done as per projected unit 
credit method at the year-end.
J.	 Inventories
a.	
Finished goods are valued at lower of cost 
or net realisable value. In case of Dead Burnt 
Magnesite Dust Stocks to the extent these 
are considered saleable, valuation is done at 
raw materials cost plus packing charges or 
net realizable value, whichever is lower. By-
products (including final molasses) are valued at 
net realisable value. B Heavy molasses is valued 
at derived values based on proportionate 
sugar content. Cost includes direct materials 
and labour and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
Cost is determined on a weighted average 
basis.
b.	
Work in progress is valued at lower of cost or 
net realisable value. Cost is determined on a 
weighted average basis.
c.	
Stores, Spares and Raw Materials are valued at 
lower of cost or net realisable value. However 
materials & other items of inventories held for 
use in the production are not written below 
cost if the finished products in which they will 
be incorporated are expected to be sold at or 
above cost. Cost is determined on a weighted 
average basis.
d.	
Net realizable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less 
estimated costs of completion and estimated 
costs necessary to make the sale.
K.	 Assets (or disposal group) held for sale 
and discontinued operation
	
Assets (or disposal group) are classified as held 
for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use and a sale is considered 
highly probable. Assets held for sale are measured 
at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair 
value less costs to sell.
	
An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or 
subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal 
group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is 
recognized for any subsequent increases in fair 
value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal 
group), but not in excess of any cumulative 
impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or 
loss not previously recognized by the date of the 
sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is 
recognized at the date of de-recognition.
	
Assets (including those that are part of a disposal 
group) are not depreciated or amortised while they 
are classified as held for sale. Interest and other 
expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal 
group classified as held for sale continue to be 
recognised.
	
Assets classified as held for sale and the assets 
of a disposal group classified as held for sale are 
presented separately from the other assets in the 
balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group 
classified as held for sale are presented separately 
from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
	
A discontinued operation is a component of an 
entity that either has been disposed of, or is 
classified as held for sale, and:
	•
Represent as separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations,
	•
Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations.
	
Discontinued operations are excluded from the 
results of continuing operations and are presented 
as profit or loss before/ after tax from discontinued 
operations in the statement of profit and loss.

subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair 
value though other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) or fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL) on the basis of its business model for 
managing the financial assets and contractual 
cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
	
ii.	
Initial Recognition and Measurement
	
The financial assets include equity and debt 
securities, trade and other receivables, loans 
and advances, cash and bank balances and 
derivative financial instruments. All financial 
assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, 
in the case of financial assets not recorded 
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs that are attributable to the acquisition of 
the financial asset.
	
iii.	 Subsequent Measurement
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement 
the financial assets are classified in three 
categories:
	•
At amortised cost - For debt instruments 
only.
	•
At fair value through profit & loss  
account
	•
At fair value through other comprehensive 
income
	
iv.	 Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
A Financial Asset i.e. a debt instrument is 
measured at the amortized cost if both the 
following condition are met.
	•
The assets is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for 
collecting contractual cash flow (business 
model test), and
	•
Contractual terms of the assets give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principle and interest 
(SPPI) on the principle amount outstanding 
(contractual cash flow characteristics).
	
After initial measurement (at Fair value minus 
transaction cost), such financial assets are 
subsequently measurement at amortized cost 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount and premium and fee or 
costs that are an integral part of an EIR. The 
EIR amortization is included in finance income 
in the statement of profit and loss. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
v.	
Debt instrument at Fair value through Profit 
or loss
	
Debt instruments included within the fair 
value through profit or loss (FVTPL) category 
are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
	
vi.	 Debt instruments at Fair value through other 
comprehensive income
	
A financial asset should be measured at FVTOCI 
if both the following condition are met:
	•
The assets is held within a business model 
in which asset are managed both in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and for 
sale (business model test), and
	•
Contractual terms of the assets give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principle and interest 
(SPPI) on the principle amount outstanding 
(contractual cash flow characteristics).
	
After initial measurement (at Fair value minus 
transaction cost), such financial assets are 
measured at Fair value with changes in fair 
value recognized in OCI except for:
(a)	 Interest calculated using EIR
(b)	 Foreign exchange gain and losses; and
(c)	 Impairment losses and gains
	
vii.	 Equity investments
	
All equity investments other than investment in 
subsidiaries, joint venture and associates are 
measured at fair value. Equity instruments which 
are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. 
For all other equity instruments, the Company 
decides to classify the same either as at fair 
value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) or FVTPL. The Company makes such 
election on an instrument-by- instrument basis. 
The classification is made on initial recognition 
and is irrevocable.
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity 
instrument at FVTOCI, then fair value change 
on the instrument, excluding dividends, are 
recognised in other compressive income (OCI). 
There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI 
to statement of profit or loss, even on sale of 
such investments.
	
Equity instrument includes within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognised in the Statement of profit 
or loss.
	
viii.	Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part 
of a financial asset) is primarily derecognised 
when:
	•
The right to receive cash flows from the 
assets have expired or
	•
The Company has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the assets, or
	•
The Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the assets, but has transferred 
control of the assets.
(b)	 Financial liabilities & Equity
	
i.	
Classification
	
Debt and equity instruments issued by the 
Company are classified as either financial 
liabilities or as equity in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangements and 
the definitions of a financial liability and an 
equity instrument.
	
ii.	
Initial recognition and measurement of 
Financial Liability
	
The Company recognizes financial liability 
when it becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. All financial liability 
are recognized initially at fair value minus, for 
financial liability not subsequently measured 
at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issue of financial liability.
	
iii.	 Subsequent Measurement of Financial 
Liability
	
All financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method or at FVTPL.
	
However, financial liabilities that arise when a 
transfer of a financial asset does not qualify 
for derecognition or when the continuing 
involvement approach applies, financial 
guarantee contracts issued by the Company, 
and commitments issued by the Company to 
provide a loan at below-market interest rate 
are measured in accordance with the specific 
accounting policies.
	
iv.	 Financial Liability at amortised cost
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate 
(EIR) Method. Gain and losses are recognised in 
statement of profit and loss when the liabilities 
are derecognised.
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and transaction cost. The EIR amortization is 
included as finance cost in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
This category generally applies to loans & 
Borrowings.
	
v.	
Financial Liability at FVTPL
	
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL 
when the financial liability is either contingent 
consideration recognised by the Company as 
an acquirer in a business combination to which 
Ind AS 103 applies or is held for trading or it is 
designated as at FVTPL.
	
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at 
fair value, with any gains or losses arising on 
re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss 
incorporates any interest paid on the financial 
liability
	
vi.	 Equity Instruments
	
An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of 
an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by a Company entity 
are recognised at the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs.
	
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity 
instruments is recognised and deducted 
directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue 
or cancellation of the Company’s own equity 
instruments.

vii.	 Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are, substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amount 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and loss.
	
viii.	Offsetting of financial instrument
	
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is reported in the 
balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable 
legal right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, 
to realize the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
	
ix.	 Derivative financial instruments
	
The Company uses derivative instruments 
as a part of its management of exposure to 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates. The Company does not acquire or issue 
derivative instruments for trading or speculative 
purposes. The Company does not enter into 
complex derivative transactions to manage the 
treasury.
	
All derivative financial instruments are 
recognized as assets or liabilities on the 
balance sheet and measured at fair value, 
generally based on quotation obtained from 
banks/financial institutions. The accounting 
for changes in the fair value of a derivative 
instruments depends on the intended use of the 
derivatives and the resulting designation.
	
The fair values of all derivatives are separately 
recorded in the balance sheet within current 
and non-current assets and liabilities. 
Derivatives that are designated as hedges are 
classified as current and non-current depending 
upon the maturity of the derivatives.
	
The use of derivative can give rise to credit 
and market risk. The Company tries to control 
credit risk as far as possible by only entering 
into the contract with reputable banks/ 
financial institution. The use of derivative 
instrument is subject to limits, authorities 
and regular monitoring by appropriate levels 
of management. The limits, authorities and 
monitoring systems are periodically reviewed 
by the management and board. The market risk 
on derivatives are mitigated by changes in the 
valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or 
transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk 
management purposes.
	
x.	
Cash flow hedge
	
The Company designates certain foreign 
exchange forward as cash flow hedges to 
mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure 
on highly probable forecast cash transactions.
	
When a derivative is designated as a cash 
flow hedge instrument, the effective portion 
of changes in the fair value of the derivative 
is recognized in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the cash flow 
hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of 
changes in the fair value of the derivative is 
recognized immediately in the net profit in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging 
instrument no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognized in cash flow 
hedge reserve till the period the hedge was 
effective remains in cash flow hedge reserve 
until the forecasted transaction occurs. The 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognized 
in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to 
the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted 
transaction. If the forecasted transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, then the amount 
accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve is 
reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
M.	 Investments in subsidiaries, Joint venture 
& Associate
	
Investments in equity shares of Subsidiaries, Joint 
Ventures & Associates are recorded at cost and 
reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet 
date.
N.	 Revenue recognition
	
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the 
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
	
Sale of goods
	
Sale is exclusive of goods and service tax (GST) and 
is accounted for upon dispatch of goods from the 
factory when the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the buyer. Gross sales and net sales 
are disclosed separately in Statement of Profit & 
Loss.
	
Ind AS 115 introduces a new framework of five step 
model for the analysis of Revenue transactions. The 
model specifies that revenue should be recognized 
when (or as) an entity transfer control of goods 
or services to a customer at the amount to which 
the entity expects to be entitled. Further the new 
standard requires enhanced disclosures about the 
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue 
and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts 
with customers.
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of 
promised products or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration we expect to 
receive in exchange for those products or services.
	
The Company has evaluated the requirement of 
the amendment and the impact on the financial 
statements. The effect on adoption of Ind AS 115 was 
insignificant.
	
Sale of Power
	
Revenue from power has been recognized on 
transmission of electricity to Grid. Power generated 
at power plant is consumed at manufacturing 
units and excess power is sold to Grid, which is 
included in sales at power tariff prevailing as per the 
respective Power Purchase Agreements.
	
Inter-unit transfer of power is accounted at the rate 
at which the Company would have purchased power 
from grid. For consolidation purposes these transfers 
are eliminated from respective heads.
	
Revenue from sale of Certified Emission 
Reductions (CERs) and Renewable Energy 
Certificates (REC)
 	
Entitlement to Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) 
owing to generation of power are recognized to the 
extent sold.
	
Dividends
	
Revenue is recognized when the shareholders’ right 
to receive payment is established by the Balance 
Sheet date.
	
Insurance claim
	
Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis 
of claims admitted/ expected to be admitted and 
to the extent that the amount recoverable can be 
measured reliably and it is reasonable to expect 
ultimate collection.
	
Sale of services
	
The Company being a manufacturing entity does not 
generally provide services in the normal course of 
business except the travel related service.
	
Revenue from supply of services if any is recognized 
as and when the services has been provided and 
recoverability accrues.
O.	 Foreign currency translation/conversion
	
Financial statements have been presented in Indian 
Rupees (`), which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
	
•	
Initial recognition
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded on 
initial recognition in the functional currency, 
using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction.
	
•	
Conversion
	
Foreign currency monetary items are 
retranslated using the exchange rate prevailing 
at the reporting date. Non-monetary items, 
which are measured in terms of historical 
cost denominated in a foreign currency, are 
reported using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction. Non-monetary items, which 
are measured at fair value or other similar 
valuation denominated in a foreign currency, 
are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date when such value was determined.
	
•	
Exchange differences
	
The gain or loss arising on translation of non-
monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain 
or loss on the change in fair value of the item 
(i.e., translation differences on items whose fair 
value gain or loss is recognized in OCI or profit 
or loss are also recognized in OCI or profit or 
loss, respectively).
P.	 Taxes
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current income tax is measured at the amount

expected to be paid to the tax authorities in 
accordance with the Income-Tax Act, 1961 enacted 
in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to 
compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date.
	
Current income tax
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities. Current 
income tax relating to items recognized directly 
in equity is recognised in equity and not in the 
statement of profit and loss. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax 
returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet 
approach on temporary differences at the reporting 
date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purpose at reporting date. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are measured using tax 
rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply to taxable income in 
the years in which those temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of 
changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities is recognized as income or expense 
in the period that includes the enactment or the 
substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax 
asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences and tax 
losses can be utilized.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of 
the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting 
date and are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable profits will 
allow deferred tax assets to be recovered.
	
The Company offsets current tax assets and current 
tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable 
right to set off the recognized amounts and where 
it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Q.	 Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit or loss for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders and the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the period 
are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
R.	 Provisions, contingent liabilities and 
contingent assets
	
Provisions
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that the outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settled the obligation in respect of which 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. When the Company expects some or all 
of a provision to be reimbursed, the expense relating 
to provision presented in the statement of profit & 
loss is net of any reimbursement.
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are disclosed using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risk specific to 
the liability. When discounting is used, the increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognized as finance cost.
	
Contingent liability is disclosed in the notes in case 
of:
	•
There is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company.
	•
A present obligation arising from past event, 
when it is not probable that as outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation
	•
A present obligation arises from the past event, 
when no reliable estimate is possible
	•
A present obligation arises from the past event, 
unless the probability of outflow are remote.
	
Commitments include the amount of purchase order 
(net of advances) issued to parties for completion of 
assets.
	
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets 
and commitments are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date.
	
Onerous Contracts
	
A provision for onerous contracts is measured at 
the present value of the lower expected cost of 
terminating the contract and the expected cost 
of continuing with the contract. Before a provision 
is established, the Company recognizes the 
impairment on the assets with the contract.
	
Contingent assets
	
Contingent assets are not recognized in the 
financial statements.
S.	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand 
and at bank, deposits held at call with banks, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, 
cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and short 
term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdraft as they being considered as integral 
part of the Company’s cash management.
T.	 Impairment
	
Non-financial assets
	
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and 
assets classified as investment property with finite 
life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there 
is any indication that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less 
cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on 
an individual asset basis unless the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets. In such cases, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
	
An impairment loss is reversed in the statement 
of profit and loss if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. The carrying amount of the asset is 
increased to its revised recoverable amount, 
provided that this amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been 
determined (net of any accumulated amortization 
or depreciation) had no impairment loss been 
recognized for the asset in prior years.
	
Impairment losses on continuing operations, 
including impairment on inventories are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss, except for 
properties previously revalued with the revaluation 
taken to other comprehensive income. For such 
properties, the impairment is recognized in OCI up 
to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus.
	
Financial assets
	
The Company applies ‘simplified approach’ 
measurement and recognition of impairment loss 
on the following financial assets and credit risk 
exposure:
	•
Financial assets that are debt instrument and 
are measured at amortized cost e.g. loans, debt 
securities, deposits, and bank balance.
	•
Trade receivables
	
The application of simplified approach does not 
require the Company to track changes in credit risk. 
Rather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime expected credit loss at each 
reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

42	 Financial Risk Management
	
Financial risk management objectives and policies:
	
Sugar industry being an industry which is cyclical in nature, the Company’s operational activities are exposed to 
various financial & operational risks, such as economical & political risk, market risk, credit risk and risk of liquidity. 
The Company realizes that risks are inherent and integral aspect of any business. The primary focus is to foresee 
the unpredictability of markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The 
Company’s senior management oversees the management of these risks and devise appropriate risk management 
framework for the Company. The senior management provides assurance that the Company’s financial risk 
activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured 
and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk objectives.
A	
Market Risk:-
	
The Company operates internationally and is transacted in foreign currencies and consequently the Company 
is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales in overseas. The Company holds derivative financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange forward to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign 
currency exposures.

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward contracts 
as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash 
transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in other comprehensive income - cash flow hedge as at 
March 31, 2025 are expected to occur and reclassified to statement of profit and loss within 1 year.
	
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective 
effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging 
instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged 
items.
	
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains 
unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced 
by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge 
ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and 
accounted for in the Statement of Profit or Loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

The Company offsets a financial asset and a financial liability when it currently has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognized amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
B	
Credit Risk:-
	
Credit risk arises when a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations to pay, resulting in financial loss to 
the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities, primarily trade receivables. 
Since there is a blend of institutional & non institutional buyers with the Company and also considering the fact 
that major sales gets effected after receipt of advance from the customers, the credit risks in respect of trade 
receivables is minimized.

Liquidity risk:
	
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use 
of cash credit facilities, short term loans and commercial papers and to reduce debts to be able to meet the 
cyclicalities of the sugar business. Apart from cyclical sugar business, the Company has alternate revenue streams 
in the form of cogeneration and distillery, which, to a large extent, offset the impact of sugar cyclicalities.

In view of seasonal nature of sugar business, which is a dominant business of the Company, there is a peak build-
up of sugar inventories at the year end, resulting in peak working capital requirement. With the liquidation of such 
inventories over the year, the working capital requirement is gradually reduced. Thus, the current ratio computed 
at the year end is not a reflection of average and realistic ratio for the year.

Interest rate risk:
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates. In order to optimize the Company’s position with regard to interest income 
and interest expenses to manage the interest rate risk, treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest 
rate risk management by balancing the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments in its total 
portfolio.
	
Table hereunder provides the sensitivity of interest rate changes:-

E	
Regulatory risk
	
Sugar industry is regulated both by Central Government as well as State Government. Central and State 
Governments policies and regulations affects the Sugar industry and the Company’s operations and profitability. 
Distillery business is also dependent on the Government policy.
F	
Commodity price risk
	
Sugar industry being cyclical in nature, realizations get adversely affected during downturn. Higher cane price 
or higher production than the demand ultimately affect profitability. The Company has mitigated this risk by well 
integrated business model by diversifying into co-generation and distillation, thereby utilizing the by-products.
43	Capital Management
	
For the purpose of capital management, capital includes net debt and total equity of the Company. The primary 
objective of the capital management is to maximize shareholder value along with an objective to keep the 
leverage in check in view of cyclical capital intensive sugar business of the Company.
	
One of the major business of the Company is the sugar business, which is a seasonal industry, where the entire 
production is made in about five to six months and then sold throughout the year. Thus, it necessitates keeping 
high sugar inventory levels requiring high working capital funding. Sugar business being a cyclical business, it is 
prudent to avoid high leverage and the resultant high finance cost. It is the endeavor of the Company to prune 
down debts to acceptable levels based on its financial position.
	
The Company may resorts to further issue of capital when the funds are required to make the Company stronger 
financially or to invest in projects meeting the ROI expectations of the Company.
	
The Company monitors capital structure through gearing ratio represented by debt-equity ratio (debt/total 
equity). The gearing ratios for the Company as at the end of reporting period were as follows:

In addition to the above gearing ratio, the Company also looks at operating profit to total debt ratio (EBIDTA/
Total Debts) which gives an indication of adequacy of earnings to service the debts. The Company carefully 
negotiates the terms and conditions of the loans and ensures adherence to all the financials covenants. With a 
view to arrive at the desired capital structure based on the financial condition of the Company, the Company 
normally incorporates a clause in loan agreements for prepayment of loans without any premium. 
	
Further, no changes were made in the objectives, policies or process for managing capital during the period.
	
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
44.	Fair Value Measurement

47.	Impairment Review
	
Assets are tested for impairment whenever there are any internal or external indicators of impairment. Impairment 
test is performed at the level of each Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) or groups of CGUs within the Company at 
which the assets are monitored for internal management purposes, within an operating segment. The impairment 
assessment is based on higher of value in use and value from sale calculations. During the year, the testing did 
not result in any impairment in the carrying amount of other assets. The measurement of the cash generating 
units’ value in use is determined based on financial plans that have been used by management for internal 
purposes. The planning horizon reflects the assumptions for short to- mid-term market conditions.
	
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations are:-
(i)	
Operating margins (Earnings before interest and taxes), (ii) Discount Rate, (iii) Growth Rates and (iv) Capital 
Expenditure
