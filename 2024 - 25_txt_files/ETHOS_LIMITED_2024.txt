1. 	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Company actively consults with stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics through its various departments, 
ensuring continuous engagement. The Company gathers feedback regularly and integrates it into its strategy, aligning with its mission and 
vision. Material issues are internally reviewed, prioritized, and brought to relevant stakeholders for discussion, considering their impact on both 
the stakeholders and the business. 
	
Given the fact that the primary activity of the Company is retail operations instead of manufacturing operations, environmental concerns are 
minimal. During the quarterly meetings, the Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management Personnel update the Board of Directors on 
stakeholders’ feedback and proposed initiatives for active consideration. 
2. 	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide 
details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and social topics. The Company 
conducted an internal materiality assessment during the ESG reporting process to identify key stakeholders and their concerns. Stakeholder 
consultation is then carried out to understand their perspective on these issues. Inputs received from stakeholders are considered while 
developing policies and activities related to environmental and social topics. Such inputs are appropriately considered, relevant and crucial 
inputs are then implemented by way of a policy formulated by the Board.
3. 	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
The Company has spent the CSR contribution towards Rural Livelihood, Agroforestry and Social Forestry through Sankalp Taru Foundation and 
Say Trees Environmental Trust. The contributions made were utilised for identification and audit of land/villages, mobilisation of farmers, other 
monitoring evaluation and learning initiatives, procurement of sapling, soil testing, capacity building of farmers, geo-tagging and polygon 
mapping of the farms.
