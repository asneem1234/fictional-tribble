to ensure optimal 
resource allocation and 
prevent operational 
bottlenecks that may 
impede growth.
The Company 
continuously invests in 
capacity expansion and 
infrastructure

Identifying the risk of

to production delays, 
increased costs, and

Attracting and retaining 
skilled and talented 
employees is crucial for 
the Company's growth
and success. On the other 
hand, high employee 
turnover can lead to 
increased recruitment 
costs and loss of valuable 
expertise
The Company 
maintains a diversified 
supplier base, conducts 
regular risk 
assessments, and 
establishes contingency 
plans to mitigate 
supply chain

monitoring also 
contribute to timely 
responses to potential 
disruptions.

Proper risk

minimize financial 
losses associated with 
supply chain

production downtime 
and increased 
operational expenses.
Effective talent 
management can result 
in increased
