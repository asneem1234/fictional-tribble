1
Climate change, 
global warming 
and climate 
action
Risk if no 
action taken & 
Opportunity for 
the company to 
take the lead on 
action
Climate change poses both 
physical and transitional risks 
to the company, making it a 
critical area of concern. As 
a manufacturing company 
with operations dependent on 
energy, logistics, and global 
supply chains, the company 
is exposed to climate-related 
disruptions such as extreme 
weather events, which can 
impact production and 
distribution. Additionally, 
increasing regulatory pressures 
may a ect operational costs 
and compliance obligations. 
Therefore, addressing climate 
risks is essential for business 
continuity and market 
competitiveness.
However, focus on climate 
action presents a clear 
opportunity enabling the 
company to actively mitigate 
climate-related risks, lower 
greenhouse gas emissions, 
and achieve cost savings 
through improved energy 
e
ciency and lower electricity 
consumption.
The company has 
implemented several 
initiatives to conserve 
energy and integrate 
alternative energy sources, 
such as roo op solar 
panels and solar and wind 
energy through a Power 
Purchase Agreement 
(PPA), into its operations. 
To further strengthen its 
commitment, the company 
is actively exploring 
additional renewable 
energy sources. Moreover, 
it is at the forefront of 
product innovations 
aimed at reducing 
environmental impact.

Positive
2
Changes in 
consumer 
preferences and 
behaviour
Opportunity to 
di erentiate
Shi ing consumer preferences 
towards energy-e
cient, 
smart, and sustainable 
home appliances present a 
signicant opportunity for 
the company to innovate and 
expand its product portfolio. 
As awareness around 
environmental impact and 
digital convenience grows, 
the company can leverage its 
brand strength and technical 
expertise to meet emerging 
demands, enhance customer 
loyalty, and capture new 
market segments.
The company is 
continuously investing 
in R&D to develop 
products that minimize 
environmental impact, 
such as water- and 
energy-saving washers 
and energy-e
cient air 
conditioners. Additionally, 
its manufacturing 
processes incorporate 
controls to ensure 
environmentally friendly 
operations, including 
measures for e
uent 
discharge management 
and adherence to 
sustainable production 
practices.

the company

Health and 
safety
Risk
Given the intensive nature 
of the companyȂs operations, 
which involve complex 
machinery, electrical systems, 
and manual processes, 
maintaining strong health 
and safety standards is 
crucial. Workplace safety 
remains a key risk area, as 
any lapse in protocols could 
result in workplace accidents, 
employee injuries, operational 
disruptions, and potential legal 
liabilities. The company fosters 
a safety-oriented culture and 
takes every possible measure to 
ensure a secure and motivating 
work environment.
The company's 
plants are certied to 
the ISO 45001:2018 
standard, highlighting 
its commitment to 
occupational health 
and safety. A dedicated 
safety commi ee, 
consisting of unit heads 
and departmental 
leaders, oversees the 
implementation of safety 
protocols. Both permanent 
and contractual employees 
undergo regular safety 
training and skill 
enhancement programs, 
equipping them with 
the necessary expertise 
to identify, mitigate, and 
respond e ectively to 
various safety-related 
risks.
 Negative
4
Water scarcity
Risk
Water is a critical resource 
in several of the companyȂs 
manufacturing processes. With 
rising demand and limited 
availability, water scarcity 
poses a direct risk to business 
continuity and operational 
e
ciency. It can also lead to 
increased regulatory scrutiny 
and necessitate investments 
in alternative sources or 
treatment systems.
To mitigate water 
scarcity risks, the 
company prioritises 
responsible water usage. 
This includes reducing 
water consumption in 
production by installing 
water recycling plants. 
Furthermore, the company 
is investing in innovative 
technologies to develop 
products that require 
less water during the 
consumer-use phase.

Digitisation, 
technological 
advancement, 
Product 
innovation
Opportunity
Embracing digitisation and 
technological advancements 
allows the company to 
streamline operations, enhance 
customer experiences, and 
improve overall e
ciency. 
Innovation in product design 
enables the company to 
cater to evolving consumer 
preferences for smart, energy-
e
cient appliances. Leveraging 
these opportunities can drive 
competitiveness, cost savings, 
and long-term growth.
The company has 
implemented various 
measures to facilitate 
technology absorption. It 
is actively collaborating 
with international partners 
from countries like Italy, 
China, and Korea to 
enhance its knowledge, 
capabilities and 
absorption of advanced 
technologies., Moreover, 
the companyȂs Research 
and Development (R&D) 
team continuously works 
on technology upgrades, 
including testing and 
validating products with 
IoT, wireless controls, 
and app-based appliance 
management.
 Positive
6
Sustainable 
product 
development
Opportunity
Sustainable product 
development is considered 
to be a core component 
of meeting broader 
environmental goals. For 
product-based organisations, 
the greatest opportunities 
extend beyond manufacturing 
and operations processes 
to include the ability to 
mitigate impact through 
consumer use, thereby creating 
transformational change in the 
industry.
The company has 
developed a range of 
products designed to 
reduce environmental 
impact, particularly 
in water and energy 
usage. For example, all 
washing machines now 
carry a 5-star energy 
rating according to 
BEE standards. Moving 
forward, the company 
plans to conduct Life 
Cycle Assessments (LCA) 
and integrate circular 
economy principles 
into product design and 
end-of-life management, 
further enhancing its 
sustainability e orts.

Circular 
economy 
and waste 
management
Opportunity
Adopting circular economy 
practices can reduce costs 
through resource e
ciency 
and recycling, while meeting 
sustainability demands. 
Industry peers are also 
integrating various elements 
of the circular economy across 
the product lifecycle such as 
responsible packaging, o ering 
repair options and take-back 
programs, among other 
circular models. 
The company reclaims 
electrical and electronic 
waste (EEE) and plastic 
waste through exchange 
schemes, customer 
take-back programs, 
and collaborations with 
Producer Responsibility 
Organizations (PROs) and 
recyclers. The Company 
also provides spare parts 
and service support 
beyond the estimated 
product lifespan to extend 
product life, thereby 
reducing the overall 
demand for new products. 
 Positive
8
Diversity and 
inclusion
Opportunity
As global inequalities 
continue to rise, signicant 
investment and focus are 
being dedicated to enhance 
diversity and inclusion at the 
workplace Ȯ a trend that can 
be observed across industries. 
However, the consumer 
electronics industry is still 
at a comparatively nascent 
stage, signalling tremendous 
scope for improvement and 
opportunities for organisations 
to establish themselves as 
industry leaders, se ing best 
practices.
The company has 
an ongoing focus on 
greater representation 
of women at all levels 
of the workforce. The 
establishment of a 
monitoring mechanism 
with specic KPIs to 
assess performance over 
time periods will further 
enhance the organisationȂs 
ability to drive continual 
progress.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, 
targets and achievements.  
 
Over the years, we have consistently published our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), reinforcing 
our commitment to responsible and sustainable business practices. With each reporting cycle, we have strengthened our 
ESG focus, expanded disclosures, and, this year, begun reporting on leadership indicators Ȯ demonstrating our growing 
maturity and transparency in sustainability reporting.
 
While we faced challenges in identifying and tracking the most relevant areas and aligning them with key indicators, 
we recognized the importance of sustainability and took proactive steps to enhance our ESG performance.
 
On the environmental front, we have implemented various initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint, conserve resources, 
and minimize waste. These include using renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, which now account 
for 52% of our electricity requirements, adopting circular economy practices Ȯ such as incorporating recycled materials 
in products Ȯ and installing water recycling units in our manufacturing processes.
