The fiscal year 2025 was a defining year for DreamFolks, as we moved decisively beyond our core to expand both 
the breadth and depth of our offerings. This evolution was not merely about scale — it was about pioneering new 
services, unlocking untapped markets, and embedding the DreamFolks experience into more touchpoints across 
the customer’s journey.
During the year, six new premium services were onboarded — including Highway Dining, Pay & Use, Access 
to members-only recreational facilities, Coffee at Mall, Baggage Wrapping, and Excess Baggage for premium 
customers — taking the total portfolio to over 20 premium service offerings. We have also  deepened our client 
relationships and added marquee clients across industries, welcoming over 30 new partners in the enterprise 
and banking segments. These partnerships expand market reach, enrich service delivery, and create new 
growth avenues.
Recognizing that people are the foundation of sustainable growth, DreamFolks has also invested in expanding 
our skilled employee base as part of our strategic planning. This strengthened our talent pool which ensures that 
we  the Company can respond with agility to evolving market dynamics, deliver exceptional experiences, and drive 
long-term value for customers, partners, and shareholders alike.
Expanding Frontiers
 This year signaled a clear evolution in our approach —from steady enhancement to bold, intentional innovation across our 
offerings and operations. As we expanded beyond traditional lounge services, innovation became the foundation of how we 
deliver differentiated value — not only to end users but also to our enterprise and banking clients.
At the core of this evolution lies our proprietary technology platform designed to scale rapidly, integrate deeply across partner 
ecosystems, and personalize access across diverse customer journeys. In FY2024-25, we used this foundation to build 
smarter access models, enhance loyalty-linked experiences, and introduce six new premium services. These additions have 
broadened engagement opportunities across the new-age discerning customers. This has opened fresh monetization avenues 
through cross-selling opportunities across our network of 3,000+ touchpoints expanding the pay-and-use model across 
loyalty platforms and card networks, and extending paid access to non-card customers.
Driving Innovation
At DreamFolks, we believe that exceptional journeys begin long before take-off and extend well beyond the destination. 
This belief has guided our evolution from enabling access to orchestrating experiences that are intuitive, personal, and 
emotionally resonant. Every interaction across our ecosystem, whether in an airport lounge, on the road, or in a retail space 
is now designed to foster connection, elevate convenience, and enrich everyday moments. This experiential shift is not just a 
differentiator; it’s the foundation of our long-term strategy to build an ecosystem that grows with the evolving needs of next-
generation customers.

Market Growth Catalysts
Translating Market Momentum 
into Scalable Advantage
India’s travel and lifestyle ecosystem is undergoing rapid transformation, 
driven by strong macroeconomic tailwinds, rising affluence, infrastructure 
expansion, digital acceleration, and evolving consumer expectations. These 
structural shifts are unlocking new growth opportunities across aviation, 
fintech, digital experiences, and outbound travel. DreamFolks is strategically 
poised to harness these tailwinds through a focused approach that combines 
service diversification, seamless digital integrations, and strong partnerships 
enabling real-time access to curated travel, lifestyle, and wellness benefits 
across an expanding global network.
How We Are Positioned to Lead the Upswing:
India’s rising disposable income and expanding middle class are reshaping consumer behaviour, particularly in travel 
and lifestyle segments. With a median age of just 28 years, the country is home to one of the youngest populations 
globally, led by Gen Z and Millennials. According to the Ministry of Commerce’s IndBiz platform, this shift in affluence 
and aspiration is set to make India the 4th-largest global travel market by 2030.
DreamFolks has expanded beyond traditional lounge access targeting India’s rising middle class and younger 
consumers. By diversifying our offerings and reaching non-metro cities, we are well-positioned to tap into the surge in 
domestic travel demand driven by rising disposable income and a youthful, experience-seeking population.

Message from the Chairperson 
and Managing Director 
Dear Shareholders, it is my privilege to 
present to you our Annual Report for 
the Financial Year 2024-25. Since the 
inception of DreamFolks, our mission 
has been to redefine travel services. 
Having established ourselves as a 
leader within the industry, we have 
now evolved into a leading aggregator 
of travel and lifestyle services, 
consistently expanding our offerings 
beyond the realm of airport services.
Over the past few years, our core 
principle has been multifaceted 
diversification, and this year we 
have continued on the same path by 
expanding our service portfolio beyond 
lounges and acquiring many new 
enterprise clients in the travel, loyalty-
tech & hospitality industry. Further, 
we have enhanced our integration 
with existing enterprise and banking 
clients, providing them with tailored 
technology solutions through our 
cutting-edge technology platform. This 
approach has further solidified our 
leadership position within a rapidly 
evolving consumer ecosystem.
The Aviation & Credit Card 
Industries
In FY2024-25, the aviation industry 
demonstrated a robust recovery, 
marked by a strong growth in 
passenger traffic and enhanced 
operational efficiencies. Airlines have 
demonstrated improved financial 
performance, fueled by a resurgence 
in both leisure and business travel. 
Notably, domestic air passenger traffic 
in India has witnessed an impressive 
growth of nearly 8%, culminating in 
a record movement of 165.4 million 
passengers during the year. 
Looking ahead, the prospects for the 
aviation sector appear promising. We 
anticipate advancements in technology, 
the implementation of sustainability 
initiatives, and the expansion of air 
travel networks. As the industry adapts 
to evolving consumer preferences 
and regulatory frameworks, it is 
well-positioned for continued growth, 
fostering innovation and enhancing the 
overall travel experience.
Similarly, the credit card industry 
has experienced a notable rebound, 
characterized by increased consumer 
spending and a rise in transaction 
volumes as economic conditions have 
improved. The adoption of digital 
payment solutions and contactless 
transactions has further propelled this 
growth, with consumers increasingly 
favouring the convenience and 
rewards associated with credit card 
usage, including access to airport 
and railway lounges, golf games and 
lessons, and other premium services. 
As of March 31, 2025, the number of 
credit cards in circulation has grown 
to nearly 110 million, reflecting an 
8% increase from the previous year, 
with each cardholder’s spending per 
quarter continuing to show an upward 
trend, which is a positive trend for 
DreamFolks.
Looking forward, the future prospects 
for the credit card industry remain 
optimistic. Ongoing advancements 
in technology, which prioritize 
convenience and personalization, will 
drive further growth. Additionally, the 
growing emphasis on financial inclusion 
and the expansion of credit offerings 
to underserved markets are expected 
to contribute to sustained growth and 
innovation within the sector.
The Year in Review
Dreamfolks is not just growing, it’s also 
evolving. Through our focused scalable 
and integrated delivery model, we are 
laying the groundwork for long-term 
leadership in the travel and lifestyle 
space. We are committed to diversify 
our business model and integrate a 
wider range of services, catering to 
our global clientele’s varied needs and 
aspirations.
We are progressing on our journey of 
transformation, expanding our global 
footprint, strengthening our client 
ecosystem and driving diversification 
with agility and purpose. During the 
year, we added 6 new services taking 
our total premium service offerings 
to more than 20. A notable initiative 
this year was the introduction of 
coffee at malls as a service at premium 
coffee outlets across various metro 
and non-metro cities. Given its low-
ticket nature, this initiative enables 
partner bank to extend this service 
for the lower end cards as well. We 
also continue to enhance value for 
our premium customers by providing 
access to 3,000+ members-only 
recreational facilities across 150 
destinations worldwide. 
Enterprise clients continue be a 
key pillar to our growth strategy. 
Throughout the year, we have added 
marquee enterprise clients belonging 
to different industries. During the 
year, as part of our strategic planning, 
Over the past few 
years, our core principle 
has been multifaceted 
diversification, and 
this year we have 
continued on the same 
path by expanding 
our service portfolio 
beyond lounges and 
acquiring many new 
enterprise clients in the 
travel, loyalty-tech & 
hospitality industry.

we have also expanded our skilled 
employee base which has helped us in 
onboarding more than 30 new clients 
and six new services.
Financial Performance 
In FY2024-25, we continued our 
topline growth journey, with revenue 
from operations growing by 14% Y-O-Y 
to INR 12,919 Million, resulting from 
two of our revenue growth drivers, 
domestic air travel and credit card 
volumes, both of which recorded a 
growth of approximately 8% during the 
year. 
DreamFolks facilitated approximately 
10.9 million passengers during the 
year, which remained almost at par to 
previous year, despite the increased 
implementation of the structural 
changes related to minimum spend 
threshold in credit card industry in 
India. The gross margins of 11.6% and 
the adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.9% in 
FY2024-25,  were within our previous 
communicated guidance. 
Our services other than India Airport 
Lounges now contribute to 6.7% of the 
revenues, as compared to 5.8% in the 
previous year.
Technology and Innovation 
Our ongoing investment in cutting-
edge technology and strategic 
innovation is not only strengthening 
our operational backbone but also 
significantly enhancing the client 
experience. 
We are at a pivotal point where we are 
making major transformation in our 
tech. This strategic transformation is 
powered by a modern, cloud-based 
technology platform, enabling real-time 
collaboration, efficient growth, and 
quick responses to customer feedback. 
This has evolved our system from a 
simple operational tool into a vital 
strategic asset, creating personalized 
and user-friendly experiences for 
our clients’ tech-savvy customers. 
With our in-house tech infrastructure 
adaptability, it helps us to be future 
ready for the impressive expansion in 
enterprise client base and other than 
lounge services.
We are dedicated to harnessing 
the power of cloud infrastructure 
and digital ecosystems to create a 
more transparent, agile, and secure 
environment for our clients. By 
leveraging advanced cloud solutions, 
we have established a robust 
framework that facilitates real-time 
collaboration, seamless scalability, and 
rapid feedback integration.
Our innovative pay-and-use solutions 
empower existing and new clients to 
leverage their traditional customer 
base, providing additional benefits 
at attractive discounts beyond 
their complementary offerings. 
Furthermore, we have made significant 
strides in infrastructure flexibility 
by adopting fungible strategies and 
ensuring real-time visibility, thereby 
unlocking value across a spectrum of 
consumer benefits through traditional 
channels, digital applications, kiosks, 
and online platforms.
We remain committed to being 
the technology partner of choice, 
redefining industry benchmarks 
through innovation, operational 
excellence, and an unwavering focus on 
client success.
Future Outlook 
As we move forward, DreamFolks 
is committed to implementing 
robust strategies and capitalizing 
on the growth opportunities that lie 
ahead. We are optimistic that the 
macroeconomic challenges we have 
encountered are now behind us, and 
we have developed a clear strategy 
to rebound from the pressures 
experienced in the previous year.
Our focus will remain on consolidating 
and scaling services beyond the 
India Airport Lounge, particularly 
emphasizing our recently introduced 
offerings such as Coffee at Malls, 
Access to members-only recreational 
facilities, and Highway Dining. We 
firmly believe that these services 
possess significant untapped potential, 
which will facilitate our advancement 
to the next level. This aligns with our 
objective of a increasing contribution 
from non-lounge services. 
In addition, we will continue to expand 
our clientele by adding enterprise 
clients and travel agents, which will 
further drive our overall growth. Our 
strategy will involve offering bundled 
services to these clients, thereby 
increasing both the ticket size and 
profit margins at the company level.

will leverage our state-of-the-art technology 
to enhance integration with clients and deliver 
innovative solutions tailored to their needs.
This strategic direction will be bolstered by 
favourable industry trends. The Indian travel 
industry is projected to grow at an annual rate of 
12% to 15% over the next five years, particularly 
international travel accelerating at a rate of 
18% to 20%, driven by the rise in short-haul 
destinations.
In conclusion, DreamFolks is at a pivotal stage in 
its evolution, and we are resolutely committed 
to becoming the leading provider of travel 
and lifestyle services. With the support of all 
stakeholders, we are confident in our ability to 
deliver positive and sustainable results in the 
long term.

Expanding Frontiers through Partnership
Strategic Client 
Partnerships
FY2024-25 marked a pivotal phase in DreamFolks’ evolution, 
as we advanced our journey from a service aggregator to an 
integrated global travel and lifestyle platform. Strengthening this 
transformation were several high-impact strategic partnerships 
across banking, travel, and digital ecosystems — reinforcing 
DreamFolks’ role as a key enabler within a rapidly expanding 
mobility landscape.
Throughout FY2024-25, we continued to strengthen our market presence by onboarding 
a wide spectrum of marquee enterprise clients across key industries. We onboarded 30+ 
new clients diversifying beyond banking.
This diversified client acquisition reflects the versatility and scalability of our platform, as 
well as growing confidence in our ability to deliver premium travel and lifestyle solutions. 
From leading card issuers and card networks to new-age enterprises, our client base now 
includes both traditional and modern companies.
Expanding Our Ecosystem with 
Diverse Enterprise Clients
On the banking front, we solidified our alliances through new and expanded programs 
with leading institutions, reinforcing the industry’s trust in our value proposition.

Expanding our 
Service Offerings
With a sharpened focus on sustainable growth, DreamFolks is 
strategically diversifying our service portfolio to unlock new 
revenue streams, reduce dependency on traditional segments, 
and deepen our relevance across evolving customer ecosystems. 
This expansion, with the addition of six new services, reinforces 
our vision of being a holistic enabler of premium travel and 
lifestyle experiences.
In FY2025, we strengthened our position as a comprehensive travel and lifestyle services aggregator by significantly expanding 
our service portfolio. We introduced six new offerings—Highway Dining, Pay & Use facilities, Access to Premium members only 
recreational facilities, Coffee at Malls, Baggage Wrapping, and Excess Baggage services—taking the total premium services to 
over twenty. These additions extend DreamFolks’ value proposition well beyond lounges, covering diverse touchpoints across 
the traveller’s journey and everyday lifestyle needs.
The new services are designed to meet evolving consumer expectations and provide partner banks, enterprises, and card 
networks with differentiated engagement models.
Expanding Horizons with 
New Services
By broadening the service mix, DreamFolks is 
building resilience and unlocking new revenue 
streams. Non-lounge services already contributed 
6.7% of revenues in FY2025, up from 5.8% in 
FY2024, and are projected to scale to nearly 
one-third of the topline in the next five years. This 
strategic expansion reinforces our long-term vision 
of becoming the definitive enabler of premium travel 
and lifestyle experiences across geographies.
Driving Resilience 
through Service 
Diversification
DreamFolks continues to invest in high-caliber talent to drive strategic growth and deepen market penetration. We have actively 
recruited from premier business and engineering institutions, strengthening internal capabilities across technology, product, 
data analysis, and client strategy.
As we evolves into a multi-vertical, enterprise-aligned platform, the demands on our organizational capabilities have grown 
significantly. With expansion into enterprise verticals by onboarding clients from various industries, alongside the onboarding of 
20+ new services, our strategy of expanding the employee base has been very fruitful till now and would deliver higher returns 
in the near future. This strategic shift has also translated into a calibrated increase in operating expenditure— a direct outcome 
of building capability across enterprise sales, service onboarding, and partner support functions. Rather than being a short-term 
margin drag, this investment is a direct enabler of long-term growth, supporting our expansion into new industries, high-volume 
clients, and diversified services.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
GLOBAL ECONOMY
The global economy showed remarkable strength in the face of 
various challenges this past year. Despite ongoing geopolitical 
tensions and a cost-of-living crisis affecting many countries, it 
managed to remain resilient. According to the International 
Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook, global 
GDP growth is now projected at 2.8% for 2025, a moderation 
from the earlier estimate of 3.3%. The downgrade reflects the 
cumulative impact of geopolitical tensions, tighter financial 
conditions, supply chain disruptions, and escalating trade 
barriers, which are increasingly weighing on cross-border 
commerce. Global headline inflation, which averaged 5.9% 
in 2024, is expected to moderate to 4.4% in 2025, as central 
banks adopt a neutral stance fostering a more favorable 
environment for investments and healthcare delivery.
Regionally, the United States is expected to expand at 1.8% 
in 2025, with growth constrained by trade policy uncertainty 
and its ripple effects on consumer sentiment. China, 
meanwhile, is forecast to grow at 4.0%, reflecting continued 
headwinds in real estate and export-linked industries. 
Amidst a challenging global backdrop, India continues 
to chart a strong growth trajectory, with GDP expansion 
pegged at 6.5% in 2025. This momentum is underpinned by 
robust domestic consumption, infrastructure upgrades, and a 
resilient financial ecosystem — all of which are fueling greater 
mobility, rising discretionary spending, and increased demand 
across aviation, tourism, and allied service sectors.
Outlook 
Overall, 2025 is expected to be a year of moderated global 
growth, with advanced economies projected to grow at 
1.4%, compared to 1.8% in 2024. Emerging markets and 
developing economies (EMDEs) are likely to expand at 3.7%, 
down from 4.3% in the prior year. Central banks across 
geographies are expected to adopt a more balanced policy 
stance, gradually normalizing interest rates to support growth 
while managing inflation risks. Despite near-term challenges, 
a more constructive global trade policy environment could 
restore business and investor confidence, setting the stage for 
renewed momentum in the medium term.

INDIAN ECONOMY
Amid a backdrop of persistent global macroeconomic 
challenges 
— 
including 
elevated 
inflation, 
tightening 
monetary policies, geopolitical disruptions, and supply chain 
uncertainties — India has emerged as a beacon of stability and 
momentum in FY2024-25. According to the second revised 
estimates released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme 
Implementation (MOSPI), India’s GDP is estimated to grow 
by 6.5% in FY2024-25, underscoring the country’s solid 
macroeconomic fundamentals and strong policy support.
On the demand side, private final consumption expenditure — a 
key driver of domestic activity — is estimated to grow by 7.3%, 
buoyed by rising discretionary spending and a notable revival 
in rural demand. This resurgence in consumption is particularly 
meaningful for travel, tourism, and aviation, where rising 
affluence and mobility aspirations continue to spur growth.

Retail inflation in India has consistently moderated over the past three years, easing from 6.7% to 4.6% by FY2024-25. This trend, 
driven by calibrated monetary policy and targeted government interventions, has helped stabilise prices and improve household 
purchasing power. In a further boost to demand, the Reserve Bank of India reduced the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50% in June 
2025, lowering borrowing costs across the economy. The resulting credit stimulus is expected to support private consumption and 
investment — particularly in discretionary, experience-driven sectors such as travel, hospitality, and premium services.
policy focus translated into tangible support for tourism and mobility-led consumption. The Union Budget earmarked INR 2,480 
Crores for tourism infrastructure — a 46% hike — complemented by targeted reforms such as MUDRA-backed homestay loans, 
e-visa simplification, visa-fee waivers, and hospitality skill-building programs to empower MSMEs and youth. Flagship schemes like 
Swadesh Darshan 2.0 and SASCI collectively sanctioned over INR 8,500 Crore for 100+ tourism development projects, enhancing 
cultural destinations and visitor experiences. Simultaneously, regional air travel received a major boost under the UDAN scheme, 
connecting over 579 underserved routes and enabling more than 141 Lakh passenger journeys — making air travel more accessible 
and fueling regional tourism.
Outlook
According to forecasts by Morgan Stanley, India will become 
the world’s third-largest economy by 2028, propelled by 
stable macro fundamentals, consumption-driven growth, 
and strategic infrastructure investment. Policy tailwinds, 
and increased budgetary allocations are deepening access 
and capacity across both urban and emerging destinations. 
Additionally, digital transformation and rising consumer 
aspiration are converging to amplify premium, seamless, and 
experience-driven service ecosystems spanning aviation, 
hospitality, retail, wellness, and more.
As India enters a phase of consumption-led growth anchored in 
mobility, convenience, and lifestyle upgrades, the environment 
is highly conducive for platforms that sit at the intersection of 
travel, technology, and service innovation.

the market was valued at approximately USD 2.3 Trillion and 
is projected to expand to USD 3.4 Trillion by 2029, reflecting 
a robust CAGR of 8%. This anticipated growth is driven by 
the resurgence of international travel, rising disposable 
incomes, and the mainstreaming of digital travel platforms. The 
sector’s total contribution to global GDP surged to USD 11.3 
Trillion and is expected to reach USD 15.9 Trillion by 2029 — 
accounting for over 11% of global economic output. According 
to WTTC’s 2025 Economic Impact Research, international 
visitors spending alone is projected to touch a record USD 2.1 
Trillion in 2025, surpassing pre-pandemic peaks.
As the recovery deepens, aviation has reasserted its 
position as the backbone of global mobility, enabling the 
resurgence of long-haul travel, international tourism, and

AIRPORT LOUNGE MARKET IN INDIA
India’s airport lounge segment is undergoing a significant 
transformation, driven by the country’s expanding consumer 
base and growing appetite for premium, value-added 
experiences. Amid this backdrop, airport lounges are fast 
becoming a staple of modern travel. What was once a niche 
luxury has now emerged as a mainstream expectation among 
India’s increasingly aspirational travellers. This evolution is 
fueled by a burgeoning middle class, increasing urbanization, 
and a shift in consumer preferences toward convenience, 
comfort, and lifestyle-centric offerings. For the financial year 
2024–25, private consumption grew at a real rate of 7.2%, 
compared to 5.6% in FY2023-24. As discretionary spending 
surges across travel, hospitality, and wellness segments, 
lounges offer an essential pause point, delivering both comfort 
and status.
India’s airport lounge market is poised for sustained growth, 
projected to surpass USD 900 Million by 2029 with an 
estimated CAGR of 5%. This momentum is further amplified by 
the digitalization of access models, where traditional barriers

airport lounge landscape is being reshaped by the evolving 
preferences of modern travellers, especially the millennial 
demographic. Recent surveys show that nearly half of Indian 
millennials now prioritize travel-related benefits such as 
lounge access when selecting financial products, including 
credit cards. This shift reflects a broader consumer trend 
that values comfort, convenience, and premium experiences 
throughout the journey.
Indian travellers are also among the most frequent lounge 
users globally. Over 75% of travellers from India report 
using lounges when the amenity is available—well above the 
global average of 50%. Furthermore, more than 80% believe 
that wider lounge access would significantly enhance their 
overall airport experience. These findings highlight the strong

undergoing its largest-ever modernization drive. With higher-
paying passengers, longer wait times, and upgraded station 
infrastructure, railway lounges are gaining traction.
Additionally, the increasing use of digital platforms has 
enabled seamless integration of services like travel insurance, 
hotel bookings, and car rentals into the booking journey. 
Travel companies are also leveraging data analytics to offer 
customised options, enhancing passenger satisfaction and 
boosting revenue beyond traditional ticket sales. These 
drivers collectively position India as one of the fastest-growing 
ancillary markets in global aviation.

tier properties. The rise of "bleisure" travel — where business 
and leisure intersect — is reshaping spaces to support flexible 
work-life balance. In tandem, travellers increasingly seek 
authentic, culturally immersive experiences, shifting demand 
from transactional stays to transformative encounters.
The global tourism and hospitality sector shows strong 
momentum in 2025, having nearly achieved full post-pandemic 
recovery. International tourism revenues hit USD 1.9 Trillion 
in 2024, marking a historic rebound. Asia and the Pacific is 
expected to be the key growth engine, supported by China’s 
reopening, improved air connectivity, and visa easing. Countries 
like Japan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives have already exceeded 
pre-pandemic arrival levels. The Middle East continues to gain 
from regional initiatives like the proposed GCC unified visa, 
while Africa is emerging as a promising destination through 
investments in eco-tourism and cultural heritage.
Although geopolitical risks persist, the outlook remains broadly 
positive. Global tourist arrivals are projected to rise by 3–5% in 
2025, underpinned by steady macroeconomic conditions and 
increasing travel confidence. The wellness tourism segment 
is poised for exceptional growth. According to the Global 
Wellness Institute, the market is projected to grow from 
USD 651 Billion in 2022 to USD 1.4 Trillion by 2027 (CAGR 
of 16.6%). This surge reflects increasing consumer focus on 
preventive health, mindfulness, and immersive retreats — a 
trend most prominent in Asia and the Middle East.
Looking ahead, 2025 is poised to be a transformative year. 
Continued integration of AI, machine learning, and automation 
will further enhance guest personalization — from dynamic 
booking experiences to AI-powered concierge services. 
Hospitality brands are increasingly focused on delivering 
curated, meaningful stays, as demand shifts from conventional 
accommodations to experiential travel rooted in authenticity, 
wellness, and sustainability.

INDIAN HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY
The Indian hospitality industry has entered a new phase 
of expansion, buoyed by a strong post-pandemic recovery, 
increased domestic travel, and supportive government policies. 
Leaner cost structures, enhanced operational efficiencies, and 
digital transformation have contributed to stronger balance 
sheets and improved profitability across major hotel chains 
and hospitality enterprises. India currently stands as the sixth-
largest domestic travel market globally, with travel spending 
increasing at an annual rate of approximately 9%. In 2023, 
foreign exchange earnings from tourism reached USD 28.07 
Billion, as foreign tourist arrivals grew by 43.5% year-on-year, 
from 6.4 million to 9.2 million. While this still remains 15.5% 
below pre-pandemic levels, the trajectory indicates a strong 
resurgence in inbound travel. Notably, ongoing geopolitical 
tensions in West Asia and evolving travel preferences in the 
aftermath of China’s prolonged lockdowns have redirected 
global tourist flows toward India, enhancing its appeal as a 
preferred destination.
The government’s proactive stance has further catalysed 
industry growth. Strategic initiatives like the Special Assistance 
to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) and Swadesh Darshan 
2.0 have unlocked significant funding of INR 3,295.7 Crore 
across 40 projects and INR 793.2 Crore across 34 projects 
respectively, for the development of iconic tourist centers 
and sustainable tourism circuits. These policy interventions, 
coupled with improved ease of doing business, are fostering 
a conducive environment for investment and innovation 
in hospitality. Technological integration is emerging as a 
transformative force in the Indian hospitality sector. Hotels 
and resorts are increasingly adopting contactless check-ins, 
digital concierge services, and personalized guest experiences 
to elevate service delivery.
Outlook
India’s hospitality market was valued at USD 29.3 Billion in 
2024 and is expected to grow from USD 30.78 Billion in 2025 
to approximately USD 47.83 Billion by 2034, reflecting a 
CAGR of 5% over the forecast period. This growth is largely 
driven by the steady rise in both domestic and international 
tourism, which continues to expand the demand for travel, 
accommodation, and experiential services across the country. 
The hotel segment alone is expected to grow at a CAGR of 
9.4% during the same period, driven by a robust pipeline of 
new properties and growing demand across both business and 
leisure segments.
The rapid digital transformation of the travel ecosystem 
continues to be a critical driver, with the country’s online 
travel market expected to reach USD 19.05 Billion by 2025 
and projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.5% to USD 31.38 
Billion by 2030. This expansion is fuelled by increasing 
internet penetration, growing smartphone adoption, and the 
proliferation of app-based travel solutions.
Simultaneously, the wellness tourism segment is witnessing 
a robust surge, reflective of a global shift toward health-
conscious and holistic travel experiences. Valued at USD 21.31 
Billion in 2025, this market is anticipated to nearly double 
to USD 41.03 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14%. 
Travellers are increasingly seeking destinations that offer 
preventive healthcare, spa retreats, and immersive wellness 
experiences, positioning India as a preferred hub for such 
offerings.
Adventure tourism is also emerging as a strategic growth 
avenue, with India setting its sights on becoming one of the 
world’s top 10 adventure tourism destinations by 2047. The 
sector is targeting 20 million Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) 
and 80 million Foreign Tourist Visits (FTVs), with an aim to 
generate USD 90 Billion in foreign exchange earnings through 
diversified adventure offerings and ecosystem development. 
The sector’s macroeconomic impact remains significant. The 
tourism industry is projected to contribute USD 512 Billion to 
India’s GDP by 2028 and is expected to support approximately 
53 million jobs by 2029, underscoring its pivotal role in 
employment generation and economic development.

Complementing this momentum are robust government

Content Hub are strategically designed to attract international 
tourists and promote sustainable tourism practices. With a 
long-term vision of building a USD 3 Trillion tourism economy 
by 2047, India is laying a strong foundation for inclusive,

GLOBAL CARD INDUSTRY
The global card industry is undergoing rapid transformation in 
2025, driven by the accelerated shift toward digital payments. 
Non-cash transactions volumes surged to 1,411 Billion in 2023 
and are projected to reach 2,838.2 Billion by 2028, reflecting a 
robust CAGR of 15.0% between 2023 and 2028. 
Regionally, Asia-Pacific (APAC) is set to lead in both volume 
and growth, reaching 1,457.6 billion transactions with a 17.7% 
CAGR. Latin America is emerging as the fastest-growing 
region, boasting the highest CAGR of 20.7%, signaling a rapid 
shift to digital payments. The Middle East and Africa (MEA) 
also show strong progress with a 13.6% CAGR. Meanwhile, 
Europe maintains steady growth at 12%, and North America, 
despite a lower CAGR of 7.3%, continues to be a significant and 
mature market in the digital payments landscape.
While card payments remain a dominant mode, Account-to-
Account (A2A) and instant payments are gaining significant 
traction as cost-effective and faster alternatives, potentially 
diverting 15–25% of future card transaction growth. 
Capgemini forecasts that instant payments will account for 
22% of all global non-cash transactions by 2028, posing a major 
disruption risk to traditional card networks. However, only 
5% of banks are currently equipped to scale instant payment 
infrastructure, creating both a challenge and an opportunity 
for innovation.

INDIAN CARD INDUSTRY
OVERVIEW
According to PwC’s Indian Payments Handbook (2024–29), 
credit cards in force are expected to exceed 101 million by the 
end of FY2024-25, continuing a sustained five-year growth 
trend. Over the next four years, issuance is projected to double 
to approximately 200 million cards by FY2028–29, supported 
by a ~15% CAGR. Credit card transaction volume and value 
are both expected to expand by 21% and 18%, respectively 
resulting in nearly 9 billion transactions and INR 40 Trillion in 
cumulative spend.
In contrast, debit cards show minimal issuance growth, 
remaining near 980–1,000 million cards as of FY2024-25. This 
could be attributed to the rapid rise of mobile-first payment 
solutions and the penetration of QR-based UPI platforms in 
both urban and semi-urban markets.
Amidst these usage trends, innovations in card security and 
transaction efficiency have also gained ground. Contactless 
and tokenised transactions are on the rise, with the RBI 
reporting over 91 crore card-on-file tokens created by the

end of 2024. These enabled more than 320 Crore secure 
transactions amounting to INR 11 Lakhs Crore, replacing 
the need to store actual card data and significantly reducing 
fraud risks. Simultaneously, the Payments Infrastructure 
Development Fund (PIDF) has been instrumental in boosting 
card acceptance infrastructure. As of November 2024, over 
51.5 lakh physical devices and 3.5 crore digital acceptance 
tools, including QR codes, were deployed nationwide. This 
push has been especially impactful in Tier 3 to Tier 6 cities, 
laying the groundwork for broader card adoption.
On the regulatory front, 2024 marked a critical turning point. 
The RBI mandated that credit card issuers provide customers 
with the choice of multiple card networks, ending exclusivity 
agreements and fostering greater competition. Issuers with 
more than 1 million active cards are now required to allow 
customers to select their preferred network, enhancing 
transparency and empowering consumers. The Indian card 
industry is, therefore, poised for robust growth, supported 
by favorable demographics, expanding e-commerce, rising 
disposable incomes, and an increasingly digital-savvy consumer 
base.

Financial Statements
The graphs above depict India‘s changing payment card 
landscape from FY2025 to FY2029 which is expected 
to undergo a significant transformation, with credit card 
transaction volumes projected to more than double from 4.4 
billion to 9.1 billion, while debit card volumes are set to decline 
slightly from 2.1 billion to 1.9 billion. In terms of value, credit 
card transactions are forecasted to rise sharply from INR 22.2 
Trillion to INR 41.2 Trillion, indicating growing usage for high-
value purchases, whereas debit card values show only modest 
growth from INR 6.1 Trillion to INR 7.7 Trillion. These trends 
point to a clear shift in consumer preference toward credit 
cards, driven by urbanization, financing flexibility, rewards 
programs, and integration with platforms like UPI.

Outlook
The Indian card payments industry is poised for substantial 
growth in 2024, with credit and charge card transactions 
expected to rise by 15.5%, reaching INR 22.3 Trillion 
(approximately USD 270.4 Billion), underscoring a pronounced 
shift towards digital, non-cash payment methods. Debit cards 
continue to dominate the landscape, buoyed by an expanding 
banked population and government initiatives such as the 
Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). Overall card 
payments are projected to increase by 11.3%, reaching INR 
28.4 Trillion (USD 344 Billion). Notably, co-branded cards 
are gaining increasing popularity, particularly among younger, 
tech-savvy consumers, fostering enhanced personalisation 
and engagement. The sector is witnessing a structural 
evolution, with issuers transitioning from offering blanket card 
benefits to more targeted, spend-based rewards. According to 
RBI data, the average credit card spend rose to approximately 
INR 1.80 Lakhs in FY2024 from INR 1.68 Lakhs in FY2023, 
marking a 7.1% increase and indicating sustained demand for 
premium credit card privileges such as lounge access. Driving 
this momentum are rapid urbanization and increased internet 
penetration, supported by the proliferation of smartphones, 
laptops, and tablets, which have streamlined access to 
e-commerce platforms. This digital transformation allows 
businesses to operate efficiently without heavy reliance on 
physical storefronts, significantly reducing infrastructure and 
overhead expenses. The Indian e-commerce market is on track 
for robust expansion, with forecasts estimating a market size 
of USD 137.21 Billion by 2025 and a CAGR of 21.5% through 
2030. Key enablers propelling this growth include rising 
internet accessibility, widespread smartphone adoption, and 
government initiatives like the Digital India campaign and the 
Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), all fostering a 
more inclusive and scalable digital commerce ecosystem. 
Additionally, the rapid growth of Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) 
brands — from 2% to 15% market share over the last five years 
and expected to sustain a 40% CAGR further energises the 
sector. Increasing online shopping demand, particularly from 
Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, continues to accelerate digital payment 
adoption and fuels the growing need for payment cards across 
India.

Global Premium LIfestyle services
As global consumer behavior evolves, premium lifestyle 
services — like Coffee at Malls, Highway Dining, and Access 
to members-only recreational facilities — are converging into 
an integrated ecosystem. These sectors collectively tap into 
rising affluence, travel frequency, and demand for convenience 
and exclusivity. Globally, the pay‑per‑use lounge aggregator 
platform market, which includes premium café and lounge 
access across mobility and retail venues, reached an estimated 
USD 1.26 Billion in 2024, and is projected to grow at a robust 
~12.7% CAGR, reaching approximately USD 3.75 Billion by 
2033.
Indian Premium Lifestyle Services
In 2024, India’s cafe market — including branded coffee shops 
and cafe chains — was valued between USD 380–564 million, 
with projected growth at a CAGR of 8–13% through 2025–
2030. This reflects a burgeoning café culture, particularly 
among millennials and Gen Z, with malls becoming preferred 
social and lounge spaces. Convenience-driven formats — dine-
in, takeaway, co-working — all contribute to strong traction, 
especially in urban centers and Tier 2/3 cities. Premium 
highway dining points serving express travellers and club 
memberships are increasingly being integrated into highway 
infrastructure and mall‑cluster formats, led by both standalone 
operators and partnerships with aggregators.
India’s private club segment is witnessing robust growth, with 
over 25 operational clubs spread across nearly 1 million square 
feet with 11,220 registered members. These club provide 
opulent, exclusive, and private spaces to socialize, network, 
and set deals.
The market for private members-only clubs reflects strong 
growth potential. Valued at INR 5,760 million in 2024, it is 
expected to expand to INR 9,410 million  by 2027, registering 
a robust CAGR of 17.8.

During the year, we onboarded six new premium services, 
taking our total lifestyle offerings to over 20 curated 
experiences. These additions included Highway Dining, Pay-
and-Use, Coffee at Malls, Excess Baggage Allowance, Baggage 
Wrapping, and Access to members-only recreational facilities 
globally. These services complement our growing presence 
in Golf Games and Lessons, E-SIMs, Airport Transfers, 
Healthcare, Beauty & Grooming Services, and Gifting, creating 
a holistic travel lifestyle ecosystem for our clients’ end users. 
Extending our lounge access touchpoints beyond airports 
to railway stations, visa application centers, and highways, 
we maintained 100% coverage across both airport and 
railway lounges in India. During the year in review, we 
added 300+ global lounges, 350+ golf courses, significantly 
enhancing service accessibility and footprint, reaching 3000+ 
touchpoints. To support this growing service portfolio, we 
intensified our efforts to diversify our client base, onboarding 
30+ new enterprise and banking clients during the year, 
spanning industries like fintech, e-commerce, and mobility. 
Simultaneously, we deepened engagement with existing clients 
by expanding the range of services offered, thereby increasing 
wallet share and enhancing customer satisfaction. 
Outlook: Scaling Beyond Lounges with Lifestyle-Centric 
Growth
DreamFolks has taken significant steps toward evolving from 
a lounge aggregator into a comprehensive travel and lifestyle 
services platform. While airport lounge access continues 
to anchor the business, its relative contribution is gradually 
moderating. The share of non-lounge services increased from 
5.8% in FY2024 to 6.7% in FY2025, reflecting early success in 
portfolio diversification.
Looking ahead, the Company has articulated a clear five-year 
roadmap to expand the share of these high-potential, premium 
lifestyle services to to be a major contributor of total revenue. 
This shift will be driven by offerings such as Coffee at Malls, 
Access to members-only recreational facilities, Highway 
Dining, Golf Services, and Meet & Assist, alongside deeper 
penetration into enterprise client segments.
With strong execution in FY2025 — including onboarding 
30+ new enterprise clients, launching six new services, and 
expanding presence across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities — DreamFolks 
is well-positioned to capitalize on this diversification strategy.

deeper penetration across banking and enterprise clients, 
and continued global scaling of touchpoints. Despite rising 
operational costs associated with network expansion and 
strategic hiring, EBITDA remained stable at INR 973.0 million, 
reflecting the Company's focus on operational efficiency. 
While the EBITDA margin stood at 7.5% in FY2025, reflecting

Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
One of our key strategic investments this year was in building 
a high-performing workforce to support our growing service 
portfolio. Employee benefit expenses stood at INR 425.7 
million in FY2024-25, largely attributable to our scale-
up across new services, client segments, and operational 
geographies. Notably, employee costs remained well-contained 
at approximately 3.3% of total revenue, highlighting our 
continued emphasis on operational efficiency. The Adjusted 
EBITDA of INR 1,020.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
of 7.9% reaffirm our balanced approach between growth 
investments and margin preservation.
Profitability Trajectory
Over the past two years, DreamFolks has demonstrated 
a remarkable 29.4% CAGR in revenue from operations, 
underscoring the strength of its scalable business model and 
successful diversification beyond lounge access. This robust 
top-line growth reflects consistent expansion across premium 
service verticals and deeper wallet share with banks, card 
networks, and enterprise clients.
While Adjusted EBITDA remained steady in absolute terms, the 
CAGR of (1.2%) reflects a strategic reallocation of resources 
towards scaling operations, enhancing service delivery, and 
investing in long-term enablers such as technology and human 
capital. Despite these calibrated investments, the Company 
preserved its profitability discipline.
The PAT though modestly declining, remains a result of margin 
dilution driven by increased employee and service costs an 
outcome of growth-focused reinvestment. Notably, PAT 
margins remained healthy and reflect the Company's ability to 
sustain earnings while driving scale.

MARKET 
OPPORTUNITIES 
AND 
OUR 
STRATEGIC 
IMPERATIVES
The global travel and lifestyle aggregation ecosystem is 
undergoing a structural transformation, unlocking significant 
growth potential in lounge access, airport services, and 
ancillary offerings. Several macroeconomic and behavioral 
tailwinds are converging to expand the addressable market, 
create new service layers, and raise consumer expectations for 
seamless, personalized travel experiences.
Rising Passenger Volumes & Airport Infrastructure 
Expansion
In FY2024-25, India’s domestic aviation market sustained 
robust momentum, with total passenger traffic climbing to 
~16.1 crore passengers — a 10.3% increase over the previous 
year and markedly above pre-COVID levels. Over the next 
decade, this momentum is expected to continue, driven by an 
expanding middle class, improved connectivity, and growing 
regional air traffic. The government’s push to increase the 
number of operational airports to over 200 by 2035 and 
large-scale infrastructure upgrades create a favorable 
operating environment for airport-based service providers. 
This expansion will not only raise footfalls but also increase 
demand for high-quality airport experiences, including 
lounges, concierge services, and curated retail. We are actively 
positioning ourselves to capitalize on this wave by expanding 
our presence across new airports, railway lounges, and regional 
transport hubs. By aligning our service footprint with these 
infrastructure expansions, we aim to serve a rapidly growing 
base of travellers in emerging and underserved locations.
UDAN & Regional Connectivity
The updated UDAN scheme plans to connect 120 additional 
destinations, including helipads and remote airports, targeting 
40 million new travellers over the next decade. To capture 
this emerging opportunity, we are actively mapping service 
expansion into new regional airports, offering scalable lounge-
like amenities and ancillary benefits tailored for smaller hubs.
Financial Inclusion Unlocking a New User Base
As more users adopt digital payments, the demand for embedded 
travel and lifestyle privileges is expected to grow significantly. We 
are working closely with banks, fintechs, and payment networks to 
introduce tiered incentives and experiential benefits that reward 
first-time and evolving card users. By aligning our offerings with 
India’s financial inclusion goals, we aim to broaden our addressable 
market and deepen customer engagement at scale.
Acceleration in Credit Card–Based Access Models
According to PwC, the number of credit cards in force in India 
surpassed 101 million by the end of FY2024-25, reinforcing the 
country’s accelerating shift toward digital credit instruments. 
This expansion is a result of greater financial inclusion, lifestyle-
driven consumer behavior, and targeted product innovation by 
issuers.
Looking ahead, PwC projects that India’s credit card base will 
double to ~200 million cards by FY2028–29, growing at a 15% 
CAGR. Alongside this, annual credit card transaction volumes 
are expected to increase by 21% and transaction values by 18% 
over the same period — indicative of growing usage intensity 
and spend per user. Recognizing this trend, we strategically 
partner with banks, credit networks, and fintechs to integrate 
premium services like lounge access, concierge, and wellness 
perks into their loyalty offerings. We design flexible programs 
that enhance the perceived value of card products while driving 
engagement.
Advanced Digital & Hybrid Engagement
The industry is shifting toward digital-first, contactless 
experinces such as mobile boarding, QR access, digital check-
ins, and real-time analytics-driven up-sell models. Today’s 
travellers expect convenience, control, and instant access. With 
widespread adoption of QR-based entry, contactless service, 
and mobile-first experiences, the future lies in intelligent, 
integrated platforms.
To meet this expectation, our proprietary omnichannel 
platform delivers seamless digital access across mobile 
apps, issuer platforms, and kiosks. Backed by AI-powered 
chatbots, predictive analytics, and card-linked service bundles 
we personalise offerings, enable real-time decisioning, and 
help clients optimize usage-based models. This data-centric 
approach enhances satisfaction while improving program-level 
ROI for our partners.
Rise in Discretionary Spending
As post-pandemic incomes recover, discretionary travel is 
rebounding. Consumers are prioritizing experiences over 
goods, spending more on leisure, exploration, and premium 
comfort. This shift plays directly to our strengths. Our portfolio 
of premium lifestyle offerings, ranging from airport lounges 
and golf access to wellness, grooming, and gifting services 
positions us to cater to travellers who seek more from every 
journey.
Value-Added Services as Differentiators
To stay ahead in an increasingly competitive landscape, 
aggregation of value-added services (VAS) is critical. Over the 
past year, we have introduced Golf Games & Lessons, Meet & 
Assist, Railway Lounges, Spa & Beauty Services, and Airport 
Transfers — in collaboration with top-tier partners. These 
services not only enhance end-user experience but also unlock

new monetization models and strengthen client relationships. 
By expanding from airport touchpoints into holistic lifestyle 
aggregation, we are evolving from a transactional platform into 
a full-stack experience ecosystem.
Evolving Work-Leisure (Bleisure) Trends
The blending of business and leisure travel (workcations) is 
expanding demand for premium and convenience-led travel 
solutions, with travellers seeking comfort and connectivity. We 
are developing tailored packages that combine lounge, Wi-Fi, 
spa, and transit services designed specifically to support the 
modern bleisure travellers hybrid lifestyle.
Lounge Ecosystem Entering a High-Growth Phase
With the global lounge industry expected to grow at a CAGR of 
7.5% (2023–2033), driven by airport privatisation and rising 
luxury travel demand, the potential for third-party aggregators 
is unprecedented. We are expanding our lounge network 
across international airports while simultaneously onboarding 
value-added services like spa, gourmet dining, and concierge 
experiences. Our scalable platform and strategic tie-ups with 
international aggregators help us unlock new geographies and 
strengthen our global footprint.
Enterprise Partnerships Outside Aviation
Beyond traditional airline and financial services, sectors like 
hospitality, e-commerce, wellness, and corporate travel are 
seeking experiential loyalty programs. We are extending our 
lifestyle aggregation model via API-driven integration, that 
allows enterprise clients across industries to integrate our 
lifestyle service such as grooming, golf, gifting, and spa directly 
into their consumer ecosystems.
OUTLOOK
As we transition from a year of strategic consolidation into 
an era of measured expansion, our focus at DreamFolks is 
firmly anchored in long-term value creation, diversification, 
and globalization. FY2024-25 reaffirmed the resilience of 
our business model despite macroeconomic adjustments, 
particularly the industry-wide shift towards spend-based 
benefit models. These evolving dynamics have not only 
validated the strength of our proprietary platform but also 
shaped the blueprint for our next phase of growth.
With a solid foundation in lounge aggregation and an expanding 
bouquet of over 20 premium travel and lifestyle services — 
including railway lounges, travel dining, spa & wellness, baggage 
wrapping, golf access, and members-only recreational facilities 
— we are poised to elevate our positioning from a travel enabler 
to a holistic lifestyle aggregator. In FY2024-25, services other 
than airport lounges contributed 6.7% to revenue, and we 
expect them to make a major contribution soon.
We have set a clear strategic goal to expand our, non-lounge 
services while continuing to lead in our core aggregation 
business. This ambition is grounded in expanding our presence 
across enterprise clients, forging global partnerships, and 
building a modular platform that can serve diverse user 
cohorts and geographies. Our recently introduced services 
— such as Coffee at Malls and Pay-and-Use programs — are 
specifically designed to target under-penetrated non-metro 
cities, broadening our demographic and geographic footprint. 
Our client acquisition momentum remains robust. We 
onboarded 30+ enterprise clients across travel, loyalty, and 
fintech sectors.
Technological innovation continues to underpin our growth. 
Our omnichannel digital infrastructure — now extended to 
cover real-time voucher issuance, self-check-in kiosks, and 
spend-based dynamic eligibility — positions us to deliver 
personalisation at scale. As banks and enterprises increasingly 
shift towards usage-linked service models, our integrated 
architecture allows for rapid deployment of tailored benefit 
stacks, enhancing both client ROI and end-user satisfaction.
With clear visibility into demand drivers such as rising premium 
travel, increasing credit card penetration, and expanding 
airport infrastructure, we are confident in our ability to lead 
the transformation of travel and lifestyle services in India and 
abroad.
THREATS 
In the rapidly evolving and highly interconnected travel 
ecosystem, we remain acutely aware of the diverse threats that 
could potentially impact our operations, customer experience, 
and stakeholder value. One of the foremost concerns in today’s 
digital age is cybersecurity. Protecting customer and client 
data is not just a compliance necessity — it is a cornerstone 
of our credibility. Accordingly, we have made significant 
investments in strengthening our cybersecurity infrastructure. 
Our systems are fortified with advanced technologies and 
governed by robust protocols to ensure end-to-end data 
security and privacy.
Equally important is our ability to remain agile in the face of 
changing market dynamics. Consumer preferences, technology 
adoption cycles, and global events can shift rapidly, redefining 
expectations almost overnight. To stay ahead, we continuously 
monitor industry trends and customer behavior using deep 
analytics and structured market intelligence. This insight-
driven approach enables us to anticipate shifts, respond swiftly, 
and evolve our offerings to remain relevant and competitive.
We also recognize the importance of being prepared for 
unforeseen disruptions ranging from geopolitical events 
and public health crises to climate-related incidents. As a 
safeguard, we have established comprehensive contingency 
plans and scenario-based response frameworks that enhance 
our organizational resilience. These plans are regularly 
reviewed and tested to ensure operational continuity under 
adverse conditions.
By taking a proactive stance on risk management and investing 
in both strategic foresight and operational readiness, we are 
confident in our ability to navigate uncertainty while delivering 
long-term value to our partners and customers.

renew or successfully renegotiate key contracts can 
adversely affect margins and overall performance.
Robust contract management practices and 
contingency frameworks are in place to ensure quick 
onboarding of alternate partners if required.

partner ecosystem built on long-term, strategic 
collaborations. The Company actively partners with 
multiple operators within each airport and service 
category, ensuring redundancy and continuity in 
service delivery.

large clients may increase exposure to commercial 
or compliance penalties.
Our client base is being continuously diversified. We 
have instituted robust risk evaluation mechanisms to 
proactively mitigate key-client dependencies.

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR ADEQUACY
We have instituted a comprehensive internal control 
framework that is well-aligned with the scale and complexity 
of our operations. This framework reflects our unwavering 
commitment to ethical conduct, governance excellence, and 
operational discipline.
Our internal control systems are structured to support 
the achievement of strategic objectives, drive operational 
efficiency, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. These systems are designed to mitigate risks 
related to errors, fraud, and unauthorized transactions while 
safeguarding assets and enhancing the accuracy and reliability 
of both financial and operational reporting. Regular monitoring 
and evaluation are integral to our approach. The effectiveness, 
adequacy, and relevance of controls are assessed periodically 
to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose in a dynamic operating 
environment. These checks provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the integrity of accounting records, compliance 
with internal policies, and the execution of transactions in 
accordance with management authorization.
Oversight of the internal control environment rests with the 
Audit Committee of the Board, which reviews the annual 
audit plan, examines key audit findings, and ensures timely 
corrective actions are undertaken to reinforce the control 
ecosystem. Our internal audit function plays a pivotal role in 
this process. Through a structured, risk-based audit approach, 
the internal audit team evaluates key business processes and 
internal controls. The Internal Auditor reports independently 
to the Audit Committee, which reviews audit observations 
and monitors the implementation of recommended actions to 
further strengthen the Company’s governance and assurance 
mechanisms.

Company's 
objectives, projections, estimates, and expectations, as 
defined by relevant securities laws and regulations. Actual

Data Security
Risk 
The Company being a benefit 
Management 
Company 
through 
technology-driven 
platform, 
operates in a way that handles 
sensitive client data, the risk of 
unauthorized access, data breaches, 
or leaks are high. The Company acts 
as an intermediary, aggregating data 
and services from various sources to 
deliver value to its clients. However, 
this 
aggregation 
process 
also 
exposes the Company to potential 
data security risks.
The 
Company 
employs 
effective 
legal 
and 
technological 
safeguards 
to 
mitigate 
potential 
risks. It has embraced 
comprehensive 
data 
privacy, 
information 
security, 
and 
backup 
and recovery Policies as 
responsible measures to 
counter these risks as part 
of its proactive approach 
to 
protecting 
sensitive 
information and ensuring 
business continuity and 
effective risk mitigation 
strategies.
Negative
2
Extreme weather 
events
Risk
Extreme weather events such as 
floods, cyclones etc can significantly 
impact the Company and can result 
in operational disruptions such as 
airport closures and lounge damage, 
impairing partner service delivery, 
straining IT systems, and causing 
cash flow issues due to fixed costs 
amid declining revenues. 
Force majeure clauses in 
contracts with partners 
allows 
flexibility 
and 
legal 
protection 
during 
unavoidable 
disruption. 
Maintaining 
appropriate 
insurance cover and robust 
business continuity plan 
also helps in reducing the 
financial risks.

Disease Outbreak
Risk 
Widespread disease outbreak can 
reduce the airport passenger traffic 
and can thus lead to decrease in the 
use of the Company's services by the 
consumers.
Implementing 
and 
regularly updating health 
& sanitization protocols 
at the across lounges and 
other 
service 
locations 
helps reassure customers

focus 
can help the Company tap into 
niche markets of eco-conscious 
consumers who are willing to

attract investors and partners who 
prioritize environmental and social 
responsibility.

focused 
on 
strategic 
expansion 
and 
diversification 
of 
its 
offerings to drive future 
growth and address recent 
challenges.

Geopolitics
Risk and 
Opportunity
Geopolitics can present both risks 
and opportunities for the Company. 
Risks include potential disruptions 
to travel due to political instability, 
conflicts, or trade wars, leading 
to decreased demand or supply 
chain issues. Opportunities arise 
from shifting travel patterns, new 
markets opening up due to political 
realignments, or increased demand 
for travel to specific regions due to 
geopolitical factors.
The 
Company 
needs 
to 
carefully 
monitor 
geopolitical developments, 
assess the potential impact 
on its business, and develop 
strategies 
to 
mitigate 
risks by diversifying its 
operations, 
developing 
contingency 
plans, 
and 
actively 
engaging 
with 
stakeholders 
to 
navigate the complexities 
geopolitical landscape.

Statement by Director Responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG  related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
At DreamFolks, our commitment to sustainability stems from a sense of responsibility toward the people, planet and 
ecosystem. Climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time — a reality shaped by years of unsustainable 
practices — and it demands immediate, consistent, and sincere action.
For us, sustainability is not merely about meeting regulations; it is a way of thinking and operating. Over the past three years, 
we have actively broadened our vision, integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Principles into every aspect 
of our business. We believe that innovation and technology are powerful tools in shaping a greener future, and we continue 
to use them to enhance both our efficiency and our environmental stewardship.
Our initiatives go beyond business — they create real-world impact. Having  completed Project Akshar, we have now launched 
a new CSR initiative named “Saksham” with the same mission of empowering underprivileged girl children through better 
access to education and opportunities. This ensures that our commitment to creating brighter and more inclusive futures 
remains unwavering.
We are proud of the measures we have taken to reduce our environmental footprint. Our technology-driven platform 
has already eliminated the use of paper and plastic in core processes. Taking this commitment a step further, we recently 
introduced Web Access, a digital service that entirely removes the need for physical plastic cards, reducing waste and making 
our services even more convenient and eco-friendly.
These achievements are only possible because of the trust and support of our stakeholders. As we move forward, we will 
remain committed to setting thoughtful targets, measuring our progress, and driving meaningful change — for our business, 
for our people, and for the planet.

During the FY 2024-25 the BSE Limited ("BSE") and

had imposed fine on the Company w.r.t. alleged 
violations of the Regulation 18(1), Regulation 19, 
Regulation 20 and Regulation 21(2) of SEBI LODR 
Regulations. The Company vide its application 
dated March 28, 2025 had applied for waiver of 
fines to BSE and NSE in relation to fines levied by 
them on the grounds that the timeline for filing up 
the vacancy in any Committee was notified by SEBI 
through an amendment in SEBI LODR Regulations 
on December 12, 2024. Therefore, during the 
period of the vacancy i.e. from November 30, 2024 
to December 02, 2024, there was no effective 
provision in SEBI LODR Regulations, which 
specified the time period for filling up of vacancy 
in the Committees, nor specified that in case of 
expiry of term of Director, the resultant vacancy 
arising in Committees shall be filled not later than 
the date it is created. Further, Regulation 17(1E) 
of the SEBI LODR Regulations, prior to the said 
amendment, only specified for the timeline for filling 
in the vacancy in the office of a Director. It did not 
specify the timeline for filing up the vacancy in any 
Committee(s). 
	
Thereafter, the matter was placed before the 
Relevant Authority of the NSE and the request 
for waiver of fines was considered favorably. The 
corresponding communication of the BSE is still 
awaited. 
	
The Secretarial Auditor of the Company has not 
reported any fraud as specified under the second 
proviso of Section 143(12) of the Act.
	
Further, the Board of Directors of the Company 
at their Meeting held on May 23, 2025, (based on

The Company, seeking a waiver of the aforementioned fines has not paid the fines on account of the  applications filed with NSE

This position was also acknowledged by SEBI’s Expert Committee in its report  namely “Recommendations for facilitating ease of 
doing business and harmonization of the provisions of ICDR and LODR Regulations” dated June 26,2024.   Subsequently, the NSE, 
considered the Company’s waiver application and vide its letter dated June 30, 2025, communicated its decision in favour of the 
Company and accordingly  no fines were required to be paid to NSE in this regard . Further, as of the date of this report, the waiver

During the FY 2024-25 the BSE and NSE had imposed fine on the Company w.r.t. alleged violations of the Regulation 
18(1), Regulation 19, Regulation 20 and Regulation 21(2) of SEBI LODR Regulations. The Company vide its application 
dated March 28, 2025 had applied for waiver of fines with the designated Stock Exchange in relation to fines levied 
by them on the grounds that the timeline for filing up the vacancy in any Committee was notified by SEBI through 
an amendment in SEBI LODR Regulations on December 12, 2024. Therefore, during the period of the vacancy i.e. 
from November 30, 2024 to December 02, 2024, there was no effective provision in SEBI LODR Regulations, which 
specified the time period for filling up of vacancy in the Committees, nor specified that in case of expiry of term of 
Director, the resultant vacancy arising in Committees shall be filled not later than the date it is created. Further, 
Regulation 17(1E) of the SEBI LODR Regulations, prior to the said amendment, specified for the timeline for filling in 
the vacancy in the office of a Director. It did not specify the timeline for filing up the vacancy in any Committee(s). 
	
Thereafter, the matter was placed before the Relevant Authority of the NSE and the request for waiver of fines was 
considered favorably. The corresponding communication of the BSE is still awaited.

We have examined the compliance of the conditions of Corporate Governance by DREAMFOLKS SERVICES LIMITED (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Company”) for the financial year ended March 31, 2025, as stipulated under Regulations 17 to 27, clauses (b) 
to (i) and (t) of sub regulation (2) of Regulation 46 and Paragraph C, D  & E of Schedule V of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI LODR Regulations”), as amended from time to 
time.	
The compliance of the conditions of Corporate Governance is the responsibility of the Management of the Company. Our examination 
was limited to the review of procedures and implementation thereof, as adopted by the Company for ensuring compliance with 
conditions of Corporate Governance. It is neither an audit nor an expression of opinion on the financial statements of the Company.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and the representations made by 
the Management, we certify that the Company has complied with the conditions of Corporate Governance as stipulated in the 
SEBI LODR Regulations for the year ended March 31, 2025. However, the constitution of the Audit Committee, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (“NRC”), Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) and Stakeholders Relationship Committee (“SRC”), as 
alleged as per the notices served upon the Company by the BSE Limited (‘BSE’) and National Stock Exchange of India Limited (‘NSE’), 
was not in accordance with Regulations 18(1), 19, 20, and 21(2) of the SEBI LODR Regulations for a period of three days, i.e. from 
November 30, 2024 to December 02, 2024. In respect of the aforesaid alleged non-compliances, NSE and BSE had levied fines of 
`6,000 (excluding 18% GST) each for violation of the respective regulations. 
The Company seeking a waiver of the aforementioned fines had not paid the fines on account of the waiver applications filed with 
NSE and BSE on March 28, 2025, submitting that, prior to the amendment dated December 12, 2024, the SEBI LODR Regulations 
did not prescribe any specific timeline for filling Committee vacancies caused due to the expiration of the term of office of any 
Director. This position was also acknowledged by SEBI’s Expert Committee in its report namely “Recommendations for facilitating 
ease of doing business and harmonization of the provisions of ICDR and LODR Regulations” dated June 26, 2024. Subsequently, 
the NSE considered the Company’s waiver application and vide its letter dated June 30, 2025,  communicated its decision in favour 
of the Company  and accordingly,  no fines were required to be paid to NSE in this regard. Further, as of the date of this report, the 
waiver application with the BSE remains pending. 
We further state that such compliance is neither an assurance as to the future viability of the Company nor of the efficiency or 
effectiveness with which the Management has conducted the affairs of the Company.

To the 
Members of 
Dreamfolks Services Limited 
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of Dreamfolks Services Limited (the “Company”), 
which comprise the standalone balance sheet as at March 
31, 2025, and the standalone statement of profit and loss 
(including other comprehensive income), the standalone 
statement of changes in equity and the standalone statement 
of cash flows for the year then ended on that date and notes 
to the standalone financial statements, including a summary 
of the material accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as the “standalone 
financial statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian 
Accounting standards  prescribed under section 133 of the Act 
(“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 
2025, and its profit (including other comprehensive income), 
changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that 
date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as 
specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) read 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the standalone financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters. We have determined that there are no key audit 
matters to be communicated in our report.
Information 
Other 
than 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s annual 
report but does not include the standalone financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. The above information 
is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
Auditor’s Report. 
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it become available and in doing 
so, consider whether such other information is materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the other information, if we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Management’s and Board of Director’s Responsibilities for 
the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation of the standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the financial 
position, financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
specified under section 133 of the Act read with the relevant 
Rules issued thereunder. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the  Board 
of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing 
the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with the SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control. 
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures in the standalone financial statements 
made by the Management and Board of Directors.
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and 
Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the standalone financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the 
standalone financial statements of Dreamfolks Services Limited 
for the year ended March 31, 2025.
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to 
the aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause 
(i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (the “Act”)
(Referred to in paragraph 2(f) of ‘Report on Other Legal and 
Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report even date)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to the standalone financial statements of Dreamfolks Services 
Limited (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2025, in conjunction 
with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s and Board of Director’s Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls with reference to the standalone financial statements 
based on the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act. 
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to the standalone 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and Standard 
on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to the standalone financial statements. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to the standalone financial 
statements were established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to the standalone financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to the standalone financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements
A Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
the standalone financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of the standalone 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to the standalone 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to the Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to the standalone financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to the 
standalone financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to the  standalone financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the 
internal financial controls with reference to the standalone 
financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal controls 
stated in the Guidance Note.

1.	
Corporate Information
	
Dreamfolks 
Services 
Limited 
(the 
‘Company’) 
is 
incorporated and domiciled in India under the provisions 
of the Companies Act applicable in India. The registered 
office of the Company is located at 26, DDA Flats, 
Panchsheel Park, Shivalik Road, Panchsheel Enclave, New 
Delhi- 110017 India.
	
The Company primarily integrates global card networks 
operating in India, card issuers, and corporate clients 
including airline companies with various airport lounge 
operators, transport operators and other airport 
service providers on a unified technology platform. The 
Company is engaged in providing benefit management 
services through a proprietary technology platform that 
empowers clients such as banks, card networks, airlines, 
and corporations to tailor airport and lifestyle service 
offerings for their end customers.
	
These standalone financial statements are adopted by 
the Board of Directors during the meeting held on May 
23, 2025.
2.1	 Basis of Preparation
	
The financial statements of the Company is prepared to 
comply in all material respects with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (“Ind AS”) notified under the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended 
time to time	  and presentation requirements of Division 
II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS 
compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the financial 
statements and other relevant provisions of the Act. 
	
The financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the 
following assets and liabilities which have been measured 
at fair value or revalued amount:
	
Certain financial assets and liabilities measured 
at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding 
financial instruments), and
	
Contingent 
consideration. 
The 
company 
has 
prepared the financial statements on the basis that 
it will continue to operate as a going concern.
	
The accounting policies as set out in the following 
paragraphs of this note, have been consistently 
applied, by the Company, to all the periods presented 
in the said financial statements.
2.2	 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
	
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with the principles of Ind AS requires the management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that effect 
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and 
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the 
end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are 
based on the management’s best knowledge of current 
events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions 
and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or 
liabilities in future periods. 
	
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised 
if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of 
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods. In particular, information 
about the significant areas of estimation, uncertainty 
and critical judgements in applying accounting policies 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements.
	
There are no assumptions and estimation uncertainties 
that have a significant risk of resulting in a material 
adjustment within the next financial year except for as 
disclosed in these financial statements. 
	
Information about significant areas of estimation /
uncertainty and judgements in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the 
financial statements are as follows: - 
 
Impairment of financial assets 
	
The Company determines the allowance for credit losses 
based on policy for expected loss provision based on 
experiential realisations, current and estimated future 
economic conditions. The Company considered current 
and anticipated future economic conditions relating to 
industries the Company deals with and the countries 
where it operates. 
	
Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the company. The useful 
lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment 
are determined by the management based on technical 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2025
assessment by internal team and external advisor. The 
charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after 
determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life 
and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The 
Company believes that the useful life best represents 
the period over which the Company expects to use these 
assets.
 
Contingent liabilities
	
Management judgment is required for estimating 
the possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Company as it 
is not possible to predict the outcome of pending matters 
with accuracy.  
 
Income taxes
	
Management judgment is required for the calculation of 
provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities. The Company reviews at each balance sheet 
date the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. The 
factors used in estimates may differ from actual outcome 
which could lead to significant adjustment to the amounts 
reported in the financial statements.
	
Leases
	
Judgment required to ascertain lease classification, lease 
term, incremental borrowing rate, lease and non-lease 
component and impairment of ROU
3.	
Summary of material accounting policies
3.1	 Current versus non- current classification
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements of assets and liabilities based on 
current/ non-current classification. An asset is treated as 
current when it is:
	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
It is expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period. All 
other assets are classified as non-current.
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when:
	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period.The Company classifies 
all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are classified as non-current 
assets and liabilities.The operating cycle is the time 
between the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. 
The Company has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
3.2	 Foreign currencies
	
The Company’s financial statements are presented in INR, 
which is also its functional currency. Functional currency 
is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Company operates and is normally the 
currency in which the Company primarily generates and 
expends cash.
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Foreign currency rate fluctuations relating to monetary 
assets and liabilities are restated at the year-end rates. 
The net gain or loss arising on restatement/ settlement is 
recorded in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Non‑monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured at 
historical cost are translated at the exchange rate 
prevalent at the date of the transaction. The related 
revenue and expense are recognized using the same 
exchange rate.
3.3	 Fair value measurement
	
The Company measures financial instruments such as 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date.

Corporate Overview

Financial Statements
Standalone
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the 
liability takes place either:
1.	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
2.	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability The 
principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole:
1.	
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
2.	
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable.
3.	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement is unobservable.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
	
External valuers may be required for valuation of 
significant assets and liabilities. Involvement of 
external valuers is decided on the basis of nature 
of transaction and complexity involved. Selection 
criteria include market knowledge, reputation, 
independence and whether professional standards 
are maintained.
	
At each reporting date, the finance team analyses 
the movements in the values of assets and liabilities 
which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed 
as per the Company’s accounting policies. For this 
analysis, the team verifies the major inputs applied 
in the latest valuation by agreeing the information 
in the valuation computation to contracts and 
other relevant documents. A change in fair value of 
assets and liabilities is also compared with relevant 
external sources to determine whether the change 
is reasonable.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. 
Other fair value related disclosures are given in the 
relevant notes.
3.4	 Property, plant and equipment
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is recognised 
as an asset if it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Company and its 
cost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle 
is applied to costs incurred initially to acquire an item of 
property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred 
subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it. All 
other repair and maintenance costs, including regular 
servicing, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss as incurred. Where an item of property, plant and 
equipment comprises major components having different 
useful lives, these components are accounted for as 
separate items. 
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its 
purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, 
any import duties and other taxes (other than those 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2025
subsequently recoverable from the tax authorities), any 
directly attributable expenditure on making the asset 
ready for its intended use, other incidental expenses 
and interest on borrowings attributable to acquisition of 
qualifying fixed assets up to the date the asset is ready for 
its intended use. Subsequent expenditure on fixed assets 
after its purchase / completion is capitalized only if such 
expenditure results in an increase in the future benefits 
from such asset beyond its previously assessed standard 
of performance. The Company depreciates property, 
plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
using the straight-line method. Depreciation methods 
and useful lives are reviewed periodically at each financial 
year end. The gain or loss arising on disposal of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between sale proceeds and carrying value of 
such item and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
3.5	  Intangible assets
	
Design, development and software costs are included in 
the balance sheet as intangible assets when it is probable 
that associated future economic benefits would flow 
to the Company. All other costs on the aforementioned 
are expensed in the statement of profit and loss as and 
when incurred. Intangible assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. 
The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset 
is based on a number of factors including the effects of 
obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic 
factors (such as the stability of the industry and known 
technological advances). Amortization methods and 
useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each 
financial year end.
	
Amortisation 
method: 
The 
Company 
amortizes 
intangible assets with a future useful life using the 
straight-line method over following period: 
3.6	 Investment property 
	
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
loss, if any.
Class of assets
Useful life 
Computer Software
 3 years
	
The cost includes the cost of replacing parts and 
borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if 
the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts 
of the investment properties are required to be replaced 
at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately 
based on their specific useful lives. All other repair and 
maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
	
The company depreciates building component of 
investment property over 30 years using written down 
value method from the date of original purchase.
	
The company, based on technical assessment made by 
technical expert and management estimate, depreciates 
the building over estimated useful lives which are 
different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to 
the Companies Act, 2013. The management believes that 
these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair 
approximation of the period over which the assets are 
likely to be used.
	
Though the company measures investment properties 
using cost-based measurement, the fair value of 
investment properties are disclosed in the notes. Fair 
values are determined based on an annual evaluation 
performed by an accredited external independent 
valuer applying a valuation model recommended by the 
International Valuation Standards Committee.
	
Investment properties are derecognised either when 
they have been disposed of or when they are permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is 
expected from their disposal. The difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period 
of derecognition. In determining the amount of 
consideration from the derecognition of investment 
properties the Company considers the effects of variable 
consideration, existence of a significant financing 
component, non-cash consideration, and consideration 
payable to the buyer (if any).
	
Transfers are made to (or from) investment properties 
only when there is a change in use. Transfers between 
investment property, owner-occupied property and 
inventories do not change the carrying amount of the 
property transferred and they do not change the cost of 
that property for measurement or disclosure purposes.

3.7	 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
	
Depreciation is provided on the written down value 
method. The estimated useful life of each asset as 
prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 
and based on technical assessment of internal experts

The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period. Lease hold Improvements are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the lease period. 
3.8	 Leases
	
The Company’s leased assets primarily consist of leases 
for office space. The Company assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A 
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
period in exchange for consideration. To assess whether 
a contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Company assesses whether: 
	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset 
	
the Company has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period of 
the lease; and
	
the Company has the right to direct the use of the 
asset.
1.	
Right of use assets
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in 
which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve 
months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. 
For these short-term and low-value leases, the Company 
recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight -line basis over the term of the lease. 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, 
which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the 
commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct 
costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
from the commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset unless the lease transfers ownership of 
the underlying asset to the Company by the end of the 
lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflect 
that the Company exercise a purchase option. The 
Company applies Ind AS 36 to determine whether a right-
of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified 
impairment loss as described in the accounting policy 
below on “Impairment of non- financial assets”.
2.	
Lease liabilities
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at 
the present value of the future lease payments that 
are not paid at the commencement date. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit 
in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the 
Company’s incremental borrowing rates. Lease liabilities 
are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset (or in profit or loss if the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to 
zero) if the Company changes its assessment of whether 
it will exercise an extension or a termination or a purchase 
option. The interest cost on lease liability (computed using 
effective interest method), is expensed in the statement 
of profit and loss. 
	
Lease liability and right-of-use asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have 
been classified as financing cash flows. The Company 
has applied a practical expedient wherein the Company 
has ignored the requirement to separate non- lease 
components (such as maintenance services) from the 
lease components. Instead, the Company has accounted 
for the entire contract as a single lease contract.
3.9	   Revenue recognition
	
The Company has revenue from its clients. The Company 
recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance 
obligations under the terms of its contracts, and control 
of its services is transferred to its client’s users in an 
amount that reflects the consideration the Company 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2025
expects to receive from its client in exchange for those 
services. This process involves identifying the client 
contract, determining the performance obligations in the 
contract, determining the contract price, allocating the 
contract price to the distinct performance obligations 
in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the 
performance obligations have been satisfied. 
	
The Company through its platform allows transactions 
between the customers of its clients and service operators 
enlisted with the platform. The Company earns revenue 
when the customers of its clients utilize services such as 
Lounge Access, Meet and Assist, Airport Transfers, Food 
and Beverages, Door-step Baggage and Spa & Wellness 
either through the DreamFolks App, DreamFolks Card, 
Issuer’s Card, Issuer’s Website, Issuer’s web or mobile 
Application (App) or Interactive voice response (IVR). 
Further it earns revenue by aggregating golf clubs across 
the globe including India to offer golf games and golf 
lessons to the customers of its clients who are primarily 
banks, card networks, and corporate enterprises.
	
Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which 
the services are rendered. A receivable is recognised 
when the services are delivered as this is the point in time 
that the consideration is unconditional because only the 
passage of time is required before the payment is due
	
Amount received before the goods and services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract liability. 
	
Financing Components: The Company does not expect 
to have any contracts where the period between the 
transfer of the promised goods or services to the 
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one 
year. As a consequence, the Company does not adjust any 
of the transaction prices for the time value of money.
	
Other income
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when 
it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the 
Company and the amount of income can be measured 
reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time proportion 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through 
the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount on initial recognition. 
3.10	  Retirement and other employee benefits
	
Employee benefits include provident fund, employee 
state insurance scheme, gratuity and compensated 
absences. 
	
Long-term employee benefits:
	
Defined contribution plans: The Company's contribution 
to provident fund and employee state insurance 
scheme are considered as defined contribution plans 
and are charged as an expense based on the amount of 
contribution required to be made and when services are 
rendered by the employees. 
	
Defined benefit plans: The Company has Defined Benefit 
Plan in the form of Gratuity. Liability for Defined Benefit 
Plans is provided on the basis of valuations, as at the 
balance sheet date, carried out by an independent 
actuary. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuary using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows using discount rate 
(interest rates of government bonds) that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of the gratuity. 
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in 
other comprehensive income. They are included in ‘Other 
comprehensive income’ (net of taxes) in the statement of 
changes in equity and in the balance sheet. Net interest 
is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined benefit liability or asset. The Company presents 
the first two components of defined benefit costs in profit 
or loss in the line item ‘Employee Benefits Expense’. 
	
Short-term employee benefits:
	
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services 
rendered by employees are recognised during the year 
when the employees render the service. These benefits 
include 
performance 
incentive 
and 
compensated 
absences which are expected to occur within twelve 
months after the end of the period in which the employee 
renders the related service. The cost of short-term 
compensated absences is accounted as under: 
	
in case of accumulated compensated absences, when 
employees render the services that increase their 
entitlement of future compensated absences; and
	
in case of non-accumulating compensated absences, 
when the absences occur.

3.11	  Share based payments 
	
Employees (including senior executives) of the Company 
receive remuneration in the form of share based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services as 
consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled 
transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions is 
determined by the fair value at the date when the grant 
is made using an appropriate valuation model. That cost 
is recognised, together with a corresponding increase 
in share Options outstanding reserves in equity, over 
the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
	
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of 
profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense. 
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense recognised is the expense had 
the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of 
the award are met. An additional expense is recognised 
for any modification that increases the total fair value 
of the share-based payment transaction or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of 
modification. Where an award is cancelled by the entity 
or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the 
fair value of the award is expensed immediately through 
profit or loss. 
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
3.12	  Taxes
a.	
Current income tax
	
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before 
tax' as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
because of items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Company's 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of 
the reporting period, in accordance with the Income 
Tax Act, 1961. 
	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside financial statements profit and loss is 
recognised outside financial statements profit 
and loss (either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in 
OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
Advance taxes and provisions for current income 
taxes are presented in the statement of assets 
and liabilities after off-setting advance tax paid 
and income tax provision arising in the same tax 
jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units 
intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
b.	
Deferred taxes
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the future tax consequences of temporary 
differences between the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences and unused tax losses only 
if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be 
available to utilise those temporary differences and 
losses. 
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
	
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, 
based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. 
	
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and 
assets reflects the tax consequences that would 
follow from the manner in which the Company 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities. 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2025
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax 
balances relate to the same taxation authority. 
	
Current tax assets and tax liabilities are off set 
where the entity has a legally enforceable right 
to offset and intends either to settle on a net 
basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. 
	
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit 
or loss, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively.
3.13	  Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are defined as components of an 
entity where discrete financial information is evaluated 
regularly by the chief operating decision maker 
(“CODM”) in deciding allocation of resources and in 
assessing performance. The Company’s Managing 
Director is its CODM. The Company’s CODM reviews 
financial information presented on a consolidated basis 
for the purposes of making operating decisions, allocating 
resources, and evaluating financial performance. Our 
business activity primarily falls within a single business 
and geographical segment, hence, the disclosure of 
segment-wise information is not applicable under Ind AS 
108- 'Operating Segments'. 
3.14	  Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using 
the weighted-average number of equity and dilutive 
equivalent shares outstanding during the period, except 
where the results would be anti-dilutive. 
	
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive 
equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods 
presented for any splits and bonus shares issues including 
for change effected prior to the approval of the financial 
Information by the Board of Directors.
3.15	  Provisions and contingent liabilities
1.  Provisions
	
Provisions are recognised when the Company 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the statement of profit and loss net of 
any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are discounted using a 
current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. When discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
2. 
Contingent liabilities
	
Contingent liability is a possible obligation that 
arises from past events and the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one are more uncertain future events 
not wholly within the control of the Company, or is 
a present obligation that arises from past event but 
is not recognised because either it is not probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or 
a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made. Contingent liabilities are disclosed 
and not recognised.
3.16	  Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity. Transaction costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets 
or financial liabilities at fair value through statement of 
profit and loss are recognised immediately in statement 
of profit and loss.
1. 
Financial assets
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not 
recorded at fair value through statement of profit 
and loss, transaction costs that are attributable

to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within a time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the market-place (regular way 
trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Company commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
a.	
Classification and subsequent measurement: 
	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost less impairment loss (except 
for debt investments that are designated as 
at fair value through profit or loss on initial 
recognition) (i) the asset is held within a 
business model whose objective is to hold 
assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows; and (ii) the contractual terms of the 
instrument give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive 
income (except for debt investments that are 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition) (i) the asset is held within 
a business model whose objective is achieved 
both by collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets; and (ii) the contractual 
terms of the instrument give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. Any debt instrument, which does 
not meet the criteria for categorization as 
at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. Trade receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, other bank balances, loans 
and other financial assets are classified for 
measurement at amortised cost.
	
Financial assets at amortised cost are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using effective interest method. The effective 
interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of an instrument and of 
allocating interest income over the relevant 
period. The effective interest rate is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts (including all fees paid or received that 
form an integral part of the effective interest 
rate, transaction costs and other premiums 
or discounts) through the expected life of 
the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.
b.	
Equity instruments:
	
The Company subsequently measures all 
equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 
at fair value, with net changes in fair value 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
c.	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part 
of a financial asset or part of a group of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognised 
(i.e. removed from the Company’s financial 
statements of assets and liabilities) when: 
i) The rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset have expired, or ii) The Company has 
transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows in full without material 
delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Company 
has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered 
into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates 
if and to what extent it has retained the risks 
and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred 
control of the asset, the Company continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the extent 
of the Company’s continuing involvement. 
In that case, the Company also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and 
the associated liability are measured on a basis 
that reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Company has retained.
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2025
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form 
of a guarantee over the transferred asset is 
measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum amount 
of consideration that the Company could be 
required to repay.
d.	
Impairment of financial assets
	
The Company recognises loss allowances using 
the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for 
the financial assets which are not fair valued 
through profit and loss. Loss allowance for 
trade receivables with no significant financing 
component is measured at an amount equal 
to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, 
expected credit losses are measured at an 
amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless 
there has been a significant increase in credit 
risk from initial recognition, in which case 
those financial assets are measured at lifetime 
ECL. The changes (incremental or reversal) in 
loss allowance computed using ECL model, are 
recognised as an impairment gain or loss in the 
statement of profit and loss. 
	
The Company recognises loss allowances 
for expected credit losses on financial assets 
measured at amortised cost. 
	
At each reporting date, the Company assesses 
whether financial assets carried at amortised 
cost are credit impaired. A financial asset is 
‘credit impaired’ when one or more events that 
have a detrimental impact on the estimated 
future cash flows of the financial asset have 
occurred. 
	
Evidence that a financial asset is credit 
impaired includes the following observable 
data:
	
significant financial difficulty of the 
borrower or issuer;
	
a breach of contract such as a default or 
past dues;
	
the restructuring of a loan or advance 
by the Company on terms that the 
Company would not consider otherwise; 
- it is probable that the borrower will 
enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation; or 
	
the disappearance of an active market for 
a security because of financial difficulties. 
	
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ 
for recognition of impairment loss allowance 
on trade receivables which do not contain 
a 
significant 
financing 
component. 
The 
application of simplified approach does not 
require the Company to track changes in 
credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime impairment 
pattern at each balance sheet date, right from 
its initial recognition. 
	
In all cases, the maximum period considered 
when estimating expected credit losses is the 
maximum contractual period over which the 
Company is exposed to credit risk. 
	
When determining whether the credit risk of 
a financial asset has increased significantly 
since initial recognition and when estimating 
expected credit losses, the Company considers 
reasonable and supportable information that 
is relevant and available without undue cost 
or effort. This includes both quantitative and 
qualitative information and analysis, based 
on the Company’s historical experience and 
informed credit assessment and including 
forward looking information. 
	
The Company considers a financial asset to be 
in default when: 
	
the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit 
obligations to the Company in full, 
without recourse by the Company to 
actions such as realising security (if any is 
held); or 
	
the financial asset is more than past due. 
	
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset 
is written off (either partially or in full) to the 
extent that there is no realistic prospect of 
recovery. This is generally the case when the 
Company determines that the counterparty 
does not have assets or sources of income that 
could generate sufficient cash flows to repay 
the amounts subject to write-off. However, 
financial assets that are written off could still 
be subject to enforcement activities in order 
to comply with the Company's procedures for 
recovery of amounts due.

2. 
Financial liabilities
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit and loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, as appropriate. 
a.	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the case of 
loans and borrowings and payables, net 
of directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Company’s financial liabilities include 
Borrowings, Other Financial Liabilities, 
Trade Payables and Leases.
b.	
Subsequent measurement
	
All financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method or at 
FVTPL. For financial liabilities that are 
denominated in a foreign currency 
and are measured at amortized cost at 
the end of each reporting period, the 
foreign exchange gains and losses are 
determined based on the amortized cost 
of the instruments and are recognized in 
‘Other income’. The fair value of financial 
liabilities denominated in a foreign 
currency is determined in that foreign 
currency and translated at the spot rate 
at the end of the reporting period. For 
financial liabilities that are measured as at 
FVTPL, the foreign exchange component 
forms part of the fair value gains or losses 
and is recognized in profit or loss. 
c.	
Derecognition
	
The Company derecognizes financial 
liabilities when, and only when, the 
Company’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or have expired. The difference 
between the carrying amount of the 
financial 
liability 
derecognized 
and 
the consideration paid and payable is 
recognized in statement of profit and 
loss.
d.	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are offset and the net amount is reported 
in the statement of assets and liabilities 
if there is a currently enforceable legal 
right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
3.17	  Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date. If there is any indication of 
impairment based on internal / external factors, an 
impairment loss is recognised, i.e. wherever the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
	
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows are Companied together into 
cash-generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents the 
smallest Company of assets that generates cash inflows 
that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other 
assets or CGUs. 
	
The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) 
is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash 
flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
CGU (or the asset). 
	
The Company’s corporate assets (e.g., office building 
for providing support to various CGUs) do not generate 
independent cash inflows. To determine impairment of a 
corporate asset, recoverable amount is determined for 
the CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs.
	
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. Impairment loss recognised 
in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, 
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other 
assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. 
	
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which has 
been recognised in prior periods, the Company reviews 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2025
at each reporting date whether there is any indication 
that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An 
impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. 
Such a reversal is made only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or 
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
3.18	 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they 
occur. Borrowing cost consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to 
the borrowing costs.
3.19	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the statement of assets 
and liabilities comprise cash at banks and on hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value. For the purpose of the statement of 
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and 
short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts (if any) as they are considered an integral 
part of the Company’s cash management.
3.20	 Cash flow statement
	
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby loss for the period is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of the 
Company are segregated.
3.21	 Events occurring after the balance sheet date
	
Based on the nature of the event, the Company identifies 
the events occurring between the balance sheet date 
and the date on which the financial statements are 
approved as ‘Adjusting Event’ and ‘Non-adjusting 
event’. Adjustments to assets and liabilities are made 
for events occurring after the balance sheet date that 
provide additional information materially affecting the 
determination of the amounts relating to conditions 
existing at the balance sheet date or because of statutory 
requirements or because of their special nature. For non-
adjusting events, the Company may provide a disclosure 
in the financial statements considering the nature of the 
transaction.
3.22	 Functional and presentation currency 
	
The Company has determined the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates, i.e., the functional currency, to be Indian 
Rupees (INR). The financial statements are presented 
in Indian Rupees, which is the Company's functional and 
presentation currency. All amounts have been rounded 
to the nearest million up to two decimal places, unless 
otherwise stated. Consequent to rounding off, the 
numbers presented throughout the document may not 
add up precisely to the totals and percentages may not 
precisely reflect the absolute amounts. 
3.23	 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the year ended 31 
March 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance 
Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, 
relating to sale and leaseback transactions. The Company 
has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on 
its evaluation has determined that it does not have any 
material impact in its financial statements.
3.24	 Standards notified but not yet effected
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. MCA has notified 
amendments to Ind AS 21 – The Effects of Changes in 
Foreign Exchange Rates with effect from 1 April 2025

Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs 
by transferring services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is 
recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights 
to consideration become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Company issues an invoice to the customers.
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from 
the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers services to the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Company performs under the 
contract.	
	
	
	
	
24.3.  Performance obligation	
Sale of services: The performance obligation in respect of services is satisfied either at a point in time or over time, depending 
on the nature of the service. For services where control is transferred continuously, revenue is recognised over time based 
on progress towards completion. In other cases, performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time upon completion and 
acceptance of the service by the clients. Payment is generally due upon completion or as per agreed contractual terms.	
* Three clients represents 10% or more of the total revenue of the company during the year ended March 2025 and March 
2024.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Company is principally exposed to risk against SGD, USD, THB & AED. Sensitivity of profit or loss arises mainly 
from SGD, USD, THB & AED denominated receivables and payables. 
As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of (+/-) 5% between USD- 
INR, SGD-INR, THB-INR & AED-INR currency pairs, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding SGD, USD, THB 
& AED denominated monetary items at the period end is presented below:

As per management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk 
because the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
(iii)	 Commodity price risk		
	
	
	
	
	
The Company is not involved in the provision and sale of products and hence, the Company is not exposed to 
commodity price risk.
B	
Credit risk:	 	
	
	
	
	
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if client or counterparty to financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from client and investment in mutual funds 
and deposits with banks.
	
To manage credit risk, the Company periodically reviews its receivables from client for any non-recoverability of the 
dues, taking in to account the inputs from business development team and ageing of trade receivables. The management 
establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade and other financial 
assets. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of expected credit loss. While 
computing expected credit loss, the management consider historical credit loss experience adjusted with forward looking 
information.

Employee Stock Option Plan 2021 namely “ESOP 2021” was adopted by the Board of Directors vide its resolution dated 
September 28, 2021 and by the shareholders vide its resolution dated September 29, 2021. Under the ESOP 2021, the 
Company granted stock options (""Grant 1"") to the eligible employees of Company which will vest over a period of 3 years 
from date of Grant and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested.
	
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Company has approved further grants (""Grant 2 and Grant 3"") under 
ESOP 2021 with related vesting conditions. Vesting of the options would be subject to continuous employment and certain 
performance parameters stipulated by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Company. Hence the options 
would vest with the passage of the time on meeting the performance parameters. However, the above performance condition 
is only considered in determining the numbers of instruments that will ultimately vest. Options have been granted with vesting 
period of up to 7 years and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested.  
	
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date using the Black- Scholes option pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted. 
	
There are no cash settlement alternatives. The Company does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these share 
options.

Report on Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Dreamfolks Services Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Company” or “Holding Company”) and 
its subsidiaries, (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as the “Group”), which comprise the 
consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss (including statement 
of other comprehensive income), the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows 
for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, including a summary of the  material accounting 
policies and other explanatory information. (hereinafter 
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration 
of reports of the other auditors on separate financial 
statements of the subsidiaries referred to in the Other 
Matters section below, the aforesaid  consolidated financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies 
Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a 
true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting 
standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act (“Ind AS”) 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of 
the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 
2025, and its consolidated profit (including consolidated other 
comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and its 
consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) read 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained, and the audit evidence 
obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in ‘Other Matters’ paragraph below is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. We have determined that there are no Key 
audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s 
annual report but does not include the consolidated financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The above 
information is expected to be made available to us after the 
date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements does not cover the other information and 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether such other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, or 
our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read other information, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Management’s and Board of Director’s Responsibilities for 
the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of 
the Act with respect to the preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view of the 
consolidated 
financial 
position, 
consolidated 
financial 
performance including consolidated other comprehensive 
income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated 
cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of 
the Act read with relevant Rules issued thereunder. 
The respective Management’s and Board of Director’s of 
the companies included in the Group are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error 
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Management and the Board of Directors of 
the Companies included in the Group are also responsible for 
overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with the SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control. 
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Group has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements made by the Management and Board of 
Directors.
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and 
Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group of which we are the 
independent auditors, to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible

Consolidated
for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
audit of the financial statements of such entities included 
in the consolidated financial statements of which we 
are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, which 
have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
	
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
	
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
	
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Other Matter
We did not audit the financial statements of one subsidiary, 
whose financial statements reflects total assets (before 
consolidation adjustments) of Rs 14.11 million as at March 31, 
2025, total revenues (before consolidation adjustment) of Rs. 
NIL, total net loss after tax (before consolidation adjustments) 
of Rs. 36.87 million, total comprehensive loss of Rs. 36.87 
million and net cash inflow (before consolidation adjustments) 
of Rs. 9.45 million for the year ended on that date, as considered 
in the consolidated financial statements. These financial 
statements and other financial information have been audited 
by other auditor whose financial statements, other financial 
information and auditor’s reports have been furnished to us 
by the Management. Our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures 
included in respect of this subsidiary and our report in terms of 
sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates 
to the aforesaid subsidiary is based solely on the audit report 
of the other auditor. 
The subsidiary is located outside India whose financial 
statements and other financial information have been prepared 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
its country and which have been audited by other auditor under 
generally accepted auditing standard applicable in its country. 
The Holding Company’s management has converted the 
financial statement of such subsidiary to accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. We have audited the conversion 
adjustments made by the Holding Company’s management. 
Our opinion in so far as it relates to the financial information of 
such subsidiary located outside India is based on the report of 
the other auditor and the conversion adjustments prepared by 
the management of the Holding Company and audited by us. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and our 
report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements below is 
not modified in respect of this matter due to our reliance on 
the work done and report of the other auditor.

Limited for the year ended March 31, 2025.
Report on the internal financial controls with reference 
to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
(Referred to in paragraph 2(g) of ‘Report on Other Legal and 
Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report even date)
Our reporting on the internal financial control with reference 
to consolidated financial statement is not applicable in respect 
of one subsidiary incorporated outside India.
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Dreamfolks Services Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Company” or “Holding Company”) as of 
and for the year ended March 31, 2025, we have audited 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
the “Group”), which are companies incorporated in India for 
the year ended on that date.
Management’s and Board of Director’s Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The respective Company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors of Holding Company and its subsidiary company, 
which are companies incorporate in India,  are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
with reference to  consolidated financial statements based 
on the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
criteria established by the respective companies considering 
the essential components of internal controls stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to respective 
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with the Guidance Note and Standard on 
Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements were established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls with 
reference to these consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that 
could have a material effect on the  consolidated financial 
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
company, which are incorporated in India, have in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by Group considering the 
essential components of such internal controls stated in the 
Guidance Note.
Our audit report on the adequacy and operating effectiveness 
of the internal financial controls over financial reporting is not 
modified in respect of above matters.

Corporate Information
	
Dreamfolks Services Limited (the ‘Company’ or the 
'Holding Company') is incorporated and domiciled in 
India under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 
applicable in India. The registered office of the Company 
is located at 26, DDA Flats, Panchsheel Park, Shivalik 
Road, Panchsheel Enclave, New Delhi- 110017 India. 
	
The Company and its subsidiaries Dreamfolks Services 
Pte Limited, Golfklik Private Limited (collectively, the 
'Group') primarily integrates global card networks 
operating in India, card issuers, and corporate clients 
including airline companies with various airport lounge 
operators, transport operators, golf course operators and

platform. The Company is engaged in providing benefit 
management services through a proprietary technology 
platform that empowers clients such as banks, card 
networks, airlines, and corporations to tailor airport and 
lifestyle service offerings for their end customers.
	
These consolidated financial statements are adopted by 
the Board of Directors during the meeting held on May 
23, 2025.
2.	
Basis of preparation
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have 
been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from 
time to time) and presentation requirements of Division 
II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS 
compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the CFS.
	
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on historical cost basis except for certain 
financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are 
measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of 
each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based 
on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange 
for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date.
	
The statement of cash flows have been prepared under 
indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals 
or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and items of income or expense associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of the 
Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value to be cash equivalents.
	
The significant accounting policies used in preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements have been 
discussed in the respective notes
3.	
 Basis of consolidation
	
The Company consolidates all entities which are 
controlled by it. 
	
The Company establishes control when; it has power 
over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power 
over relevant activities of the entity. 
	
Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated 
from the date control commences until the date control 
ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, 
during the year are consolidated from the effective date 
of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. 
	
The financial statements of the Group companies are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated in full on consolidation. 
	
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries 
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the 
Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests 
are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between 
the amount by which the non-controlling interests are 
adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or 
received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to 
shareholders of the Company. 
	
The following subsidiary company has been considered in 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statement:

Summary of Material accounting policies
4.1	 Use of estimates
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial statement 
in conformity with the principles of Ind AS requires 
the management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that effect the reported amounts 
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based 
on the management’s best knowledge of current events 
and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or 
liabilities in future periods.
	
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
	
In particular, information about the significant areas 
of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in 
applying accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated 
Financial Statement.
	
There are no assumptions and estimation uncertainties 
that have a significant risk of resulting in a material 
adjustment within the next financial year except for as 
disclosed in these financial statements. 
4.2	 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
	
Information about significant areas of estimation /
uncertainty and judgements in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the 
financial statements are as follows: - 
 
Impairment of financial assets 
	
The Group determines the allowance for credit losses 
based on policy for expected loss provision based on 
experiencial realisations, current and estimated future 
economic conditions. The Group considered current 
and anticipated future economic conditions relating to 
industries the Group deals with and the countries where 
it operates. 
 
Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the group. The useful 
lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment 
are determined by the management based on technical 
assessment by internal team and external advisor. The 
charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after 
determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life 
and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The 
Group believes that the useful life best represents the 
period over which the Group expects to use these assets.
 
Contingent liabilities
	
Management judgment is required for estimating 
the possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Group as it is 
not possible to predict the outcome of pending matters 
with accuracy.  
 
Income taxes
	
Management judgment is required for the calculation of 
provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities. The Group reviews at each balance sheet date 
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. The factors 
used in estimates may differ from actual outcome which 
could lead to significant adjustment to the amounts 
reported in the financial statements.
 
Leases
	
Judgment required to ascertain lease classification, lease 
term, incremental borrowing rate, lease and non-lease 
component and impairment of ROU
4.3	 Business combinations and goodwill
	
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount 
of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For 
each business combination, the Group elects whether to 
measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at 
fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred. 
	
The Group determines that it has acquired a business 
when the acquired set of activities and assets include 
an input and a substantive process that together 
significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. 
The acquired process is considered substantive if it is 
critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and 
the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with 
the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform 
that process or it significantly contributes to the ability 
to continue producing outputs and is considered unique 
or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant 
cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing 
outputs.
	
At 
the 
acquisition 
date, 
the 
identifiable 
assets 
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they are measured 
at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not 
probable. However, the following assets and liabilities 
acquired in a business combination are measured at the 
basis indicated below: 
	
Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the liabilities 
or assets related to employee benefit arrangements 
are recognised and measured in accordance with 
Ind AS 12 Income Tax and Ind AS 19 Employee 
Benefits respectively.
	
Potential tax effects of temporary differences 
and carry forwards of an acquiree that exist at the 
acquisition date or arise as a result of the acquisition 
are accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12.
	
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 Non-current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
are measured in accordance with that Standard. 
	
Reacquired rights are measured at a value determined on 
the basis of the remaining contractual term of the related 
contract. Such valuation does not consider potential 
renewal of the reacquired right.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by 
the acquiree.
	
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss or OCI, as appropriate. 
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and 
the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, 
and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value 
of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration 
transferred, 
the 
Group 
re-assesses 
whether it has correctly identified all of the assets 
acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews 
the procedures used to measure the amounts to be 
recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment 
still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets 
acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, 
then the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in 
equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear 
evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the 
gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing 
the same through OCI.
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are

expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective 
of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are 
assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for 
goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent 
periods.
	
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating 
unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation 
when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill 
disposed in these circumstances is measured based on 
the relative values of the disposed operation and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
4.4	 Current versus non- current classification
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
Consolidated Financial Statement of assets and liabilities 
based on current/ non-current classification. An asset is 
treated as current when it is:
	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
It is expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period. All 
other assets are classified as non-current.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
	
A liability is current when:
	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period.
	
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-
current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and 
cash equivalents. The group has identified twelve months 
as its operating cycle.
4.5	 Foreign currencies
	
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statement are 
presented in INR (Indian Rupees), which is also the 
Holding Company’s functional currency. For each entity, 
the Group determines the functional currency and items 
included in the summary statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency. Functional 
currency is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entities forming part of Group 
operates and is normally the currency in which the 
entities forming part of Group primarily generates and 
expends cash.
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Foreign currency rate fluctuations relating to monetary 
assets and liabilities are restated at the year-end rates. 
The net gain or loss arising on restatement/ settlement is 
recorded in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Non‑monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured at 
historical cost are translated at the exchange rate 
prevalent at the date of the transaction. The related 
revenue and expense are recognized using the same 
exchange rate.
4.6	 Fair value measurement
	
The Group measures financial instruments such as 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the 
liability takes place either:
1.	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
2.	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability The 
principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes 
into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate 
in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statement are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement as a whole:
1.	
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
2.	
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
3.	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
Consolidated Financial Statement on a recurring 
basis, the Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at 
the end of each reporting period.
	
External valuers may be required for valuation of 
significant assets and liabilities. Involvement of external 
valuers is decided on the basis of nature of transaction 
and complexity involved. Selection criteria include market 
knowledge, reputation, independence and whether 
professional standards are maintained.
	
At each reporting date, the finance team analyses the 
movements in the values of assets and liabilities which 
are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the 
Group’s accounting policies. For this analysis, the team 
verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation 
by agreeing the information in the valuation computation 
to contracts and other relevant documents. A change in 
fair value of assets and liabilities is also compared with 
relevant external sources to determine whether the 
change is reasonable.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset 
or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.
	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. 
Other fair value related disclosures are given in the 
relevant notes.
4.7	 Property, plant and equipment
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is recognised 
as an asset if it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and its 
cost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle 
is applied to costs incurred initially to acquire an item of 
property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred 
subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it. All 
other repair and maintenance costs, including regular 
servicing, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss as incurred. Where an item of property, plant and 
equipment comprises major components having different 
useful lives, these components are accounted for as 
separate items. 
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its 
purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, 
any import duties and other taxes (other than those 
subsequently recoverable from the tax authorities), any 
directly attributable expenditure on making the asset 
ready for its intended use, other incidental expenses 
and interest on borrowings attributable to acquisition of 
qualifying fixed assets up to the date the asset is ready for 
its intended use. Subsequent expenditure on fixed assets 
after its purchase / completion is capitalized only if such 
expenditure results in an increase in the future benefits 
from such asset beyond its previously assessed standard 
of performance. The Group depreciates property, plant 
and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the

straight-line method. Depreciation methods and useful 
lives are reviewed periodically at each financial year end. 
The gain or loss arising on disposal of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between sale proceeds and carrying value of such item, 
and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
4.8 Intangible assets
	
Design, development and software costs are included in 
the balance sheet as intangible assets when it is probable 
that associated future economic benefits would flow 
to the Group. All other costs on the aforementioned 
are expensed in the statement of profit and loss as and 
when incurred. Intangible assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. 
The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset 
is based on a number of factors including the effects of 
obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic 
factors (such as the stability of the industry and known 
technological advances). Amortization methods and 
useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each 
financial year end.
	
Amortisation method: The Group amortizes intangible 
assets with a future useful life using the straight-line 
method over following period:
4.9	 Investment property
	
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
loss, if any.
	
The cost includes the cost of replacing parts and 
borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if 
the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts 
of the investment properties are required to be replaced 
at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately 
based on their specific useful lives. All other repair and 
maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
Class of assets
Useful life 
Computer Software
 3 years
	
The Group depreciates building component of investment 
property over 30 years using written down menthod 
from the date of original purchase.
	
The Group, based on technical assessment made by 
technical expert and management estimate, depreciates 
the building over estimated useful lives which are 
different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to 
the Companies Act, 2013. The management believes that 
these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair 
approximation of the period over which the assets are 
likely to be used.
	
Though the Group measures investment properties using 
cost-based measurement, the fair value of investment 
properties are disclosed in the notes. Fair values are 
determined based on an annual evaluation performed 
by an accredited external independent valuer applying 
a valuation model recommended by the International 
Valuation Standards Committee.
	
Investment 
properties 
are 
derecognised 
either 
when they have been disposed of or when they are 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or 
loss in the period of derecognition. In determining the 
amount of consideration from the derecognition of 
investment properties the Group considers the effects of 
variable consideration, existence of a significant financing 
component, non-cash consideration, and consideration 
payable to the buyer (if any).
	
Transfers are made to (or from) investment properties 
only when there is a change in use. Transfers between 
investment property, owner-occupied property and 
inventories do not change the carrying amount of the 
property transferred and they do not change the cost of 
that property for measurement or disclosure purposes.
4.10 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
	
Depreciation is provided on the written down value 
method. The estimated useful life of each asset as 
prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 
and based on technical assessment of internal experts 
(after considering the expected usage of the asset, 
expected physical wear and tear, technical and commercial 
	
hold Improvements are amortised on a straight line basis 
over the lease period. 
4.11 Leases
	
The Group’s leased assets primarily consist of leases for 
office space. The Group assesses whether a contract 
contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period in 
exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, 
the Group assesses whether: 
	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset 
	
the Group has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period of 
the lease; and
	
the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
a.	
Right of use assets
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these short-
term and low-value leases, the Group recognizes 
the lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight -line basis over the term of the lease. 
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
prior to the commencement date of the lease plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated from the commencement 
date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the lease term and useful life of the underlying 
asset unless the lease transfers ownership of the 
underlying asset to the Group by the end of the 
lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset 
reflect that the Group exercise a purchase option. 
The Group applies Ind AS 36 to determine whether 
a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for 
any identified impairment loss as described in the 
accounting policy below on “Impairment of non- 
financial assets”.
b.	
Lease liabilities
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease 
payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date. The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the Group’s incremental 
borrowing rates. Lease liabilities are remeasured 
with a corresponding adjustment to the related right 
of use asset (or in profit or loss if the carrying amount 
of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero) if 
the Group changes its assessment of whether it will 
exercise an extension or a termination or a purchase 
option. The interest cost on lease liability (computed 
using effective interest method), is expensed in the 
statement of profit and loss. 
	
Lease liability and right-of-use asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as financing cash 
flows. The Group has applied a practical expedient 
wherein the Group has ignored the requirement 
to separate non- lease components (such as 
maintenance services) from the lease components. 
Instead, the Group has accounted for the entire 
contract as a single lease contract.
4.12 Revenue recognition
	
The Group has revenue from its clients. The Group 
recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance 
obligations under the terms of its contracts, and control 
of its services is transferred to its clients’s users in an 
amount that reflects the consideration the Group expects 
to receive from its client in exchange for those services. 
This process involves identifying the client contract, 
determining the performance obligations in the contract, 
determining the contract price, allocating the contract 
price to the distinct performance obligations in the 
contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance 
obligations have been satisfied.

The Group through its platform allows transactions 
between the consumers of its clients and service 
operators enlisted with the platform. The Group earns 
revenue when the consumers of its clients utilize services 
such as lounge access, meet and assist, airport transfers, 
food and beverages, door step baggage and spa & wellness 
either through the DreamFolks App, DreamFolks Card, 
Issuer’s Card, Issuer’s Website, Issuer’s web or mobile 
Application (App) or Interactive voice response (IVR). 
Further it earns revenue by aggregating golf clubs across 
the globe including India to offer golf games and golf 
lessons to the consumers of its clients who are primarily 
banks, card networks, and corporate enterprises.
	
Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which 
the services are rendered. A receivable is recognised 
when the services are delivered as this is the point in 
time that the consideration is unconditional because 
only the passage of time is required before the payment 
is due. Cash received before the goods and services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract liability. 
	
Financing Components: The Group does not expect 
to have any contracts where the period between the 
transfer of the promised goods or services to the 
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one 
year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of 
the transaction prices for the time value of money.
	
Other income
	
Interest income from a financial assets is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow 
to the Group and the amount of income can be measured 
reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time proportion 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through 
the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount on initial recognition. 
4.13 Retirement and other employee benefits
	
Employee benefits include provident fund, employee 
state insurance scheme, gratuity and compensated 
absences. 
	
Long-term employee benefits:
	
Defined contribution plans: The Group's contribution to 
provident fund and employee state insurance scheme are 
considered as defined contribution plans and are charged 
as an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are rendered by 
the employees. 
	
Defined benefit plans: The Group has Defined Benefit 
Plan in the form of Gratuity. Liability for Defined Benefit 
Plans is provided on the basis of valuations, as at the 
balance sheet date, carried out by an independent 
actuary. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuary using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows using discount rate 
(interest rates of government bonds) that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of the gratuity. 
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in 
other comprehensive income. They are included in ‘Other 
Comprehensive Income’ (net of taxes) in the statement of 
changes in equity and in the balance sheet. Net interest 
is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined benefit liability or asset. 
	
The Goup presents the first two components of defined 
benefit costs in profit or loss in the line item ‘Employee 
Benefits Expense’. 
	
Short-term employee benefits:
	
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services 
rendered by employees are recognised during the year 
when the employees render the service. These benefits 
include 
performance 
incentive 
and 
compensated 
absences which are expected to occur within twelve 
months after the end of the period in which the employee 
renders the related service. The cost of short-term 
compensated absences is accounted as under: 
	
in case of accumulated compensated absences, 
when employees render the services that increase 
their entitlement of future compensated absences; 
and
	
in case of non-accumulating compensated absences, 
when the absences occur.
4.14 Share based payments 
	
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group 
receive remuneration in the form of share based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services as 
consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled 
transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions is 
determined by the fair value at the date when the grant 
is made using an appropriate valuation model. That cost 
is recognised, together with a corresponding increase 
in share Options outstanding reserves in equity, over 
the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
	
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of 
profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense. 
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense recognised is the expense had 
the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of 
the award are met. An additional expense is recognised 
for any modification that increases the total fair value 
of the share-based payment transaction or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of 
modification. Where an award is cancelled by the entity 
or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the 
fair value of the award is expensed immediately through 
profit or loss. 
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
4.15 Taxes
a.	
Current income tax
	
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before 
tax' as reported in the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss because of items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group's current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the end of the reporting period, in accordance with 
the Income Tax Act, 1961. 
	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside Consolidated Financial Statement profit 
and loss is recognised outside Consolidated 
Financial Statement profit and loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax 
items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management 
periodically 
evaluates 
positions 
taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate.
	
Advance taxes and provisions for current income 
taxes are presented in the consolidated statement 
of assets and liabilities after off-setting advance tax 
paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax 
jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units 
intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis
b.	
Deferred taxes
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the future tax consequences of temporary 
differences between the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences and unused tax losses only 
if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be 
available to utilise those temporary differences and 
losses. 
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
	
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, 
based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. 
	
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and 
assets reflects the tax consequences that would 
follow from the manner in which the Group expects, 
at the end of the reporting period, to recover or 
settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax 
balances relate to the same taxation authority. 
	
Current tax assets and tax liabilities are off set 
where the entity has a legally enforceable right 
to offset and intends either to settle on a net 
basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit 
or loss, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively.
4.16 Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are defined as components of an 
entity where discrete financial information is evaluated 
regularly by the chief operating decision marke 
(“CODM”) in deciding allocation of resources and in 
assessing performance. The Group’s Managing Director 
is its CODM. The Group’s CODM reviews financial 
information presented on a consolidated basis for the 
purposes of making operating decisions, allocating 
resources, and evaluating financial performance. Our 
business activity primarily falls within a single business 
and geographical segment, hence, the disclosure of 
segment-wise information is not applicable under Ind AS 
108- 'Operating Segments'. 
4.17 Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using 
the weighted-average number of equity and dilutive 
equivalent shares outstanding during the period, except 
where the results would be anti-dilutive. 
	
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive 
equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods 
presented for any splits and bonus shares issues including 
for change effected prior to the approval of the financial 
Information by the Board of Directors.
4.18	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
a.	
Provisions
	
Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.If the effect of 
the time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 
a finance cost.
b.	
Contingent liabilities
	
Contingent liability is a possible obligation that 
arises from past events and the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one are more uncertain future events 
not wholly within the control of the Group, or is a 
present obligation that arises from past event but 
is not recognised because either it is not probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or 
a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made. Contingent liabilities are disclosed 
and not recognised
4.19 Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity. Transaction costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets 
or financial liabilities at fair value through consolidated 
statement of profit and loss are recognised immediately 
in consolidated statement of profit and loss.
1.	
Financial assets
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at 
fair value through consolidated statement of profit 
and loss, transaction costs that are attributable 
to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within a time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the market place (regular way 
trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
asset.
a.	
Classification and subsequent measurement: 
	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost less impairment loss (except 
for debt investments that are designated as 
at fair value through profit or loss on initial 
recognition) (i) the asset is held within a 
business model whose objective is to hold 
assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows; and (ii) the contractual terms of the 
instrument give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive 
income (except for debt investments that are 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition) (i) the asset is held within 
a business model whose objective is achieved 
both by collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets; and (ii) the contractual 
terms of the instrument give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. Any debt instrument, which does 
not meet the criteria for categorization as 
at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. Trade receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, other bank balances, loans 
and other financial assets are classified for 
measurement at amortised cost.
	
Financial assets at amortised cost are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using effective interest method. The effective 
interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of an instrument and of 
allocating interest income over the relevant 
period. The effective interest rate is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts (including all fees paid or received that 
form an integral part of the effective interest 
rate, transaction costs and other premiums 
or discounts) through the expected life of 
the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.
b.	
Equity instruments:
	
The Group subsequently measures all equity 
investments in scope of Ind AS 109 at fair 
value, with net changes in fair value recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss.
c.	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part 
of a financial asset or part of a group of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognised 
(i.e. removed from the Group’s Consolidated 
Financial Statement of assets and liabilities) 
when: i) The rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset have expired, or ii) The group has 
transferred its rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-
through’ arrangement; and either (a) the group 
has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the group has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
When the group has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered 
into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates 
if and to what extent it has retained the risks 
and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred 
control of the asset, the group continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the extent 
of the Group’s continuing involvement. In that 
case, the group also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis 
that reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Group has retained.
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form 
of a guarantee over the transferred asset is 
measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum amount 
of consideration that the group could be 
required to repay.
d.	
Impairment of financial assets
	
The Group recognises loss allowances using 
the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for 
the financial assets which are not fair valued 
through profit and loss. Loss allowance for 
trade receivables with no significant financing 
component is measured at an amount equal

Consolidated
to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, 
expected credit losses are measured at an 
amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless 
there has been a significant increase in credit 
risk from initial recognition, in which case 
those financial assets are measured at lifetime 
ECL. The changes (incremental or reversal) in 
loss allowance computed using ECL model, are 
recognised as an impairment gain or loss in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
	
The Group recognises loss allowances for 
expected credit losses on financial assets 
measured at amortised cost. 
	
At each reporting date, the Group assesses 
whether financial assets carried at amortised 
cost are credit impaired. A financial asset is 
‘credit impaired’ when one or more events that 
have a detrimental impact on the estimated 
future cash flows of the financial asset have 
occurred. 
	
Evidence that a financial asset is credit 
impaired includes the following observable 
data:
	
significant financial difficulty of the 
borrower or issuer;
	
a breach of contract such as a default or 
past dues;
	
the restructuring of a loan or advance by 
the Group on terms that the Group would 
not consider otherwise; - it is probable 
that the borrower will enter bankruptcy 
or other financial reorganisation; or 
	
the disappearance of an active market for 
a security because of financial difficulties. 
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance 
on trade receivables which do not contain 
a 
significant 
financing 
component. 
The 
application of simplified approach does not 
require the Group to track changes in credit 
risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss 
allowance based on lifetime impairment 
pattern at each balance sheet date, right from 
its initial recognition. 
	
In all cases, the maximum period considered 
when estimating expected credit losses is the 
maximum contractual period over which the 
Group is exposed to credit risk. 
	
When determining whether the credit risk of 
a financial asset has increased significantly 
since initial recognition and when estimating 
expected credit losses, the Group considers 
reasonable and supportable information that 
is relevant and available without undue cost 
or effort. This includes both quantitative and 
qualitative information and analysis, based 
on the Group’s historical experience and 
informed credit assessment and including 
forward looking information. 
	
The Group considers a financial asset to be in 
default when: 
	
the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit 
obligations to the Group in full, without 
recourse by the Group to actions such as 
realising security (if any is held); or 
	
the financial asset is more than past due. 
	
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset 
is written off (either partially or in full) to the 
extent that there is no realistic prospect of 
recovery. This is generally the case when the 
Group determines that the counterparty does 
not have assets or sources of income that 
could generate sufficient cash flows to repay 
the amounts subject to write-off. However, 
financial assets that are written off could still 
be subject to enforcement activities in order 
to comply with the Group's procedures for 
recovery of amounts due.
2.	
Financial liabilities
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and 
loss, loans and borrowings, payables, as appropriate. 
a.	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially 
at fair value and, in the case of loans and 
borrowings and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. The Group’s 
financial liabilities include Borrowings, Other 
Financial Liabilities, Trade Payables and Leases.
b.	
Subsequent measurement
	
All 
financial 
liabilities 
are 
subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method or at FVTPL. For financial 
liabilities that are denominated in a foreign 
currency and are measured at amortized cost 
at the end of each reporting period, the foreign 
exchange gains and losses are determined 
based on the amortized cost of the instruments 
and are recognized in ‘Other income’. The fair 
value of financial liabilities denominated in a 
foreign currency is determined in that foreign 
currency and translated at the spot rate at 
the end of the reporting period. For financial 
liabilities that are measured as at FVTPL, the 
foreign exchange component forms part of the 
fair value gains or losses and is recognized in 
profit or loss. 
c.	
Derecognition
	
The Group derecognizes financial liabilities 
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations 
are discharged, cancelled or have expired. 
The difference between the carrying amount 
of the financial liability derecognized and the 
consideration paid and payable is recognized 
in statement of profit and loss.
3.	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the 
net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of 
assets and liabilities if there is a currently enforceable 
legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is 
an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
4.20	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date. If there is any indication of impairment 
based on internal / external factors, an impairment loss is 
recognised, i.e. wherever the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount. 
	
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows are grouped together into 
cash-generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows 
that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other 
assets or CGUs. 
	
The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) 
is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash 
flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU 
(or the asset). 
	
The Group’s corporate assets (e.g., office building for 
providing support to various CGUs) do not generate 
independent cash inflows. To determine impairment of 
a corporate asset, recoverable amount is determined for 
the CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs.
	
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. Impairment loss recognised 
in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to 
reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets of the 
CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. 
	
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which has 
been recognised in prior periods, the Group reviews 
at each reporting date whether there is any indication 
that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An 
impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. 
Such a reversal is made only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or 
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

4.21	 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they 
occur. Borrowing cost consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of 
funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences 
to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing 
costs.
4.22	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the consolidated statement 
of assets and liabilities comprise cash at banks and 
on hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of 
the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts (if any) 
as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management.
4.23	 Cash flow statement
	
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby loss for the period is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of the 
group are segregated.
4.24	 Events occurring after the balance sheet date
	
Based on the nature of the event, the group identifies the 
events occurring between the balance sheet date and 
the date on which the Consolidated Financial Statement 
are approved as ‘Adjusting Event’ and ‘Non-adjusting 
event’. Adjustments to assets and liabilities are made 
for events occurring after the balance sheet date that 
provide additional information materially affecting the 
determination of the amounts relating to conditions 
existing at the balance sheet date or because of statutory 
requirements or because of their special nature. For non-
adjusting events, the group may provide a disclosure in 
the Consolidated Financial Statement considering the 
nature of the transaction.
4.25 Functional and presentation currency 
	
The Group has determined the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates, i.e., 
the functional currency, to be Indian Rupees (INR). The 
financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, 
which is the Group's functional and presentation 
currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest 
million up to two decimal places, unless otherwise stated. 
Consequent to rounding off, the numbers presented 
throughout the document may not add up precisely to 
the totals and percentages may not precisely reflect the 
absolute amounts.
4.26	 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the year ended 31 March 
2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance Contracts 
and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, relating to sale 
and leaseback transactions. The Group has reviewed the 
new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has 
determined that it does not have any material impact in 
its financial statements
4.27	Standards notified but not yet effected
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new

* During the year, the Company shifted to a new office premises. In accordance with the lease agreement, the previous office space was returned to the lessor in its original condition, 
resulting in the scrapping of all leasehold improvements made therein. Consequently, the Company has recognised a loss on disposal of these assets in the financial statements.

Estimation of fair value
The Company's investment properties consist of two commercial properties in India.
As at 31 March 2025, the fair values of the investment properties are INR 24.94 million (March 31, 2024: INR 24.55 Million). 
These valuations are based on valuations performed by Ajay Kumar Sharma (B.E.), an accredited independent valuer. Ajay 
Kumar Sharma (B.E.). is a specialist in valuing these types of investment properties and is a registered valuer as defined under 
rule 2 of Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017. A valuation model in accordance with that recommended 
by the International Valuation Standards Committee has been applied.
The Company has no restrictions on the realisability of its investment properties and no contractual obligations to purchase, 
construct or develop investment properties or for repairs, maintenance and enhancements.

Impairment of goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the cash generating unit – 'Golf CGU'. The recoverable 
amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value in use calculation which uses cash flow projections based on 
financial forecasts covering a five-year period, and a adjusted the weighted average cost of Capital (“WACC”) of 25% per annum. 
 
Cash flow projections during the forecast period are based on the same expected gross margins and inflation throughout the 
forecast period. The cash flows beyond that five-year period have been extrapolated using a steady growth rate of 5% per 
annum, which is the projected long-term average growth rate for Golf CGU. The directors believe that any reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions on which recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to 
exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. Based on impairment testing as above, the management 
believes that the recoverable amounts of goodwill are higher than their respective carrying amounts and hence no amounts are 
required to be recorded for impairment in the carrying amounts of goodwill.

Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs 
by transferring services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is 
recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights 
to consideration become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group issues an invoice to the customers.
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration from 
the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers services to the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Group performs under the 
contract.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is principally exposed to risk against SGD, USD, THB & AED. Sensitivity of profit or loss arises mainly 
from SGD, USD, THB & AED denominated receivables and payables. 
As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of (+/-) 5% between USD- 
INR, SGD-INR, THB-INR & AED-INR currency pairs, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding SGD, USD, THB 
& AED denominated monetary items at the period end is presented below:

D	
Price risk:	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Group is exposed to price risk mainly related to procurement of services such as Lounge access, Meet and 
Assist, Golf course access etc. which can affect the direct cost of the Group. To manage this risk, the Group take 
steps to pursue longer term and fixed contracts, where considered necessary. Additionally, processes related to 
such risks are reviewed and controlled by management.
As per management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk 
because the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
iii.	
Commodity price risk
	
The Group is not involved in the provision and sale of products and hence the group is not exposed to commodity 
price risk.
B	
Credit risk:
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if client or counterparty to financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from client and investment in mutual funds 
and deposits with banks.
	
To manage credit risk, the Company periodically reviews its receivables from client for any non-recoverability of the 
dues, taking in to account the inputs from business development team and ageing of trade receivables. The management 
establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade and other financial 
assets. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of expected credit loss. While 
computing expected credit loss, the management consider historical credit loss experience adjusted with forward looking 
information.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
* The carrying amounts are considered to approximate their fair values largely due to short term maturities of these 
instruments.

Gratuity	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Group have an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit plan covering eligible employees as per the Payment 
of Gratuity Act, 1972. However, other companies in the group are not making any provision in relation to gratuity as 
these companies have number of employee less than the number prescribed under Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 for 
apllicability. The plan provides for a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment 
or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 days salary payable for each completed year of service. 
Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of service. The gratuity benefits are unfunded.
	
Gratuity liability is provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on projected unit credit method made at the end 
of each financial year. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting year on government bonds that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation.	
	
	
	
	
	
III.	
Leave plan and compensated absences
	
The Group has a leave encashment scheme with defined benefits for its employees. The Group makes provision for such 
liability in the books of accounts on the basis of year end actuarial valuation. No fund has been created for this scheme.

Employee Stock Option Plan 2021 namely “ESOP 2021” was adopted by the Board of Directors vide its resolution dated 
September 28, 2021 and by the shareholders vide its resolution dated September 29, 2021. Under the ESOP 2021, the Group 
granted stock options (""Grant 1"") to the eligible employees of Group which will vest over a period of 3 years from date of 
Grant and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested. 
	
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Group has approved further grants (""Grant 2 and Grant 3"") under 
ESOP 2021 with related vesting conditions. Vesting of the options would be subject to continous employment and certain 
performance parameters stipulated by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Group. Hence the options would 
vest with the passage of the time on meeting the performance parameters. However, the above performace condition is only 
considered in determining the numbers of instruments that will ultimately vest. Options have been granted with vesting period 
of upto 7 years and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested. 
	
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date using the Black- Scholes option pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted.
	
There are no cash settlement alternatives. The Group does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these share options.
