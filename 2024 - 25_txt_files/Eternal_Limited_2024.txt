Climate change 
and GHG 
emissions
Risk
Risk- Climate 
change and GHG 
emissions from 
last-mile deliveries 
pose a significant 
risk to business 
due to changing 
temperature and 
precipitation 
patterns, extreme 
weather events and 
evolving regulatory 
requirements.
Our climate risk management measures-
∙	
Climate risk assessment- In FY24, 
we had undertaken climate risk 
assessment exercise for our food 
ordering and delivery business. We 
assessed the impact of physical climate 
risks such as cyclones, storms, heavy 
precipitation, increasing/ decreasing 
temperature, flooding and heat/ cold 
waves and transitional risks across our 
top 15 cities under IPCC RCP 2.6 and 
RCP 8.5 scenarios. The outcome of 
this exercise is integrated into Eternal 
Limited’s Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) process.
Negative implications-
Ignoring climate 
change risks or 
failing to comply with 
applicable regulations 
can result in 
increased operational 
costs, supply chain 
disruptions, regulatory 
fines, declining 
customer preference, 
and reputational 
damage, resulting 
in negative financial 
impact.

∙	
EV-based food deliveries- To reduce 
last-mile delivery emissions, we 
are assisting our delivery partners 
in adopting EVs through digital 
communication, on-ground events & EV 
partnerships.
	
In FY25, Delivery Partners were made 
aware of the benefits of transitioning 
to EVs through engaging videos on 
the YouTube channel resulting in more 
than 77,111 views and also through 
notifications, etc.
	
We organised an EV bazaar in Delhi 
to bridge the gap between delivery 
partners and EV ecosystem providers. 
The event was attended by more than 
1,000 delivery partners which helped 
enhance their awareness about the EV 
ecosystem.
	
We have partnered with over 40+  
players in the EV ecosystem to facilitate 
EV transition, with the aim to achieve 
100% EV-based deliveries by 2030.
	
As a result, the monthly active EV-
based delivery partner fleet reached 
37,077 vehicles by March 2025, which 
is ~1.3x the number of active EV-based 
delivery partners in March 2024. In FY25 
our last-mile delivery emissions on a 
per km basis reduced by 10.53% since 
FY22.
∙	
Use of carbon offsets- In FY25, we 
maintained net GHG emissions from 
our operations (classified as Scope 1 & 
Scope 2) at zero by procuring verified 
carbon removal offsets equivalent 
to 100% of our Scope 1 emissions 
and International Renewable Energy 
Certificates (IRECs) for Scope 2 
emissions. In addition, we also used 
advance purchases of carbon offsets 
from renewable energy projects to 
cover 100% of our Scope 3 emissions.
∙	
Support for Delivery Partners- We 
have expanded our Automated Weather 
Stations (AWS) to 850 devices across 
70 cities to predict and communicate 
weather conditions to our delivery 
partners. Additionally, Eternal has 
extended its shelter project to 2719 
resting points to provide shelter for 
delivery partners during extreme 
weather. We continue to provide 
delivery partners high quality apparel, 
protecting them from varied weather 
conditions.

Risk
Risk-  Lack of talent 
availability with 
required skills, 
high attrition, 
and inadequate 
human capital 
development, along 
with challenges 
in attracting, 
retaining top talent, 
and fostering 
diversity, could 
impede innovation, 
the ability to meet 
market demands, 
and sustain growth 
in a competitive 
landscape, resulting 
in business 
disruptions, 
reputation damage, 
and limit company’s 
ability to achieve its 
business goals.
∙	
Talent Discovery- Our company 
employs a structured approach in 
identifying exceptional talent, leveraging 
campus hiring, job fairs, employee 
referrals, targeted recruitment drives, 
and collaborations with external 
organizations. We proactively reach out 
to a wide range of talent pools, attracting 
high quality and diverse talent. We 
ensure that our team leads are trained 
on different types of biases and that 
we have built community through our 
Employee Resource Groups (ERG) for our 
diverse workforce to stay engaged.
∙	
Benchmarking of employee benefits- 
We consistently review and align 
our employee benefits and salaries 
with industry benchmarks, fostering 
an environment where growth and 
development are paramount. Training 
sessions and workshops are conducted 
to ensure employees thrive and excel in 
their roles.
∙	
Grievance redressal mechanism- 
Eternal is committed to extend 
transparency in the grievance redressal 
mechanism for addressing employee 
concerns related to sexual harassment, 
whistleblower complaints, and human 
rights issues.
∙	
Diversity- Embracing diversity and 
inclusion is central to our ethos. Our 
Equal opportunity, diversity, and 
inclusion policy ensures fair treatment 
for all employees, with initiatives like 
equal parental leave, period leaves, 
and inclusive healthcare coverage. By 
endorsing global standards such as the 
UN Women’s Empowerment Principles 
(UN WEPs) and the UN Standards 
of Conduct for Business Tackling 
Discrimination against LGBTIQ+ people, 
we affirm our dedication to fostering 
an inclusive workplace. We have been 
awarded first position in Asia Pacific by 
UN WEPs for our commitment to gender 
inclusion in our business practices and 
have been recognized by India Workplace 
Equality Index as an inclusive workplace.
∙	
Succession Plan- We have a succession 
plan in place to ensure seamless 
leadership transitions, safeguarding 
operational continuity and preserving 
legacy of excellence. There is a culture 
in the company to nurture talent, 
wherein senior leaders mentor high-
potential employees to cultivate future 
leaders. Additionally, the company 
has an awards program to recognize 
exceptional individuals and teams.
Negative implications- 
Shortage of talent, 
coupled with high 
attrition, skills 
obsolescence, and 
a lack of diversity, 
may stifle product 
innovation, disrupt 
business operations, 
deplete intellectual 
capital and undermine 
the company’s ability 
to attract and retain 
talent. This could 
impair operational 
efficiency and 
productivity, leading to 
reputational damage 
and negative financial 
impact.

∙	
SOS Service- SOS service is available 
to provide immediate support to 
all delivery partners in case of

insurance plan to cover all pregnancy-
related costs for female delivery 
partners.
Negative implications-
Failure to provide a 
safe and healthy work 
environment to our 
delivery partners may 
lead to work-related 
injuries or casualties, 
dissatisfaction, 
higher attrition, and 
hamper our ability 
to attract and retain 
delivery partners. 
This may also expose 
the company to legal 
liabilities, reputational 
damage, and business 
disruptions, resulting 
in negative financial 
impact.

Emergency Heroes Program- Through 
our Emergency Heroes Program, 
we equipped delivery partners 
with essential first aid and CPR 
(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) skills, 
enabling them to respond swiftly to 
emergencies in case of accidents 
and extend assistance to the public, 
fostering a community-driven culture 
of support. As the fleet continues to 
be on the road, they are of tremendous 
help to respond to emergencies. Till 31st 
March 2025, we have equipped ~52,000 
delivery partners with these skills.
∙	
Zero Tolerance for DP Discrimination 
and Harassment- We enforce a strict 
zero-tolerance policy against any 
form of discrimination or harassment, 
including sexual harassment, of our 
delivery partners. This policy applies 
to all stakeholders, including fellow 
delivery partners, restaurant partners, 
customers, and Zomato employees. 
Our policy aims to prevent such acts 
and provide a clear procedure for 
addressing such complaints.
∙	
Others- In continuation to the ‘Support 
for Delivery Partners’ highlighted 
above, these measures also help us in 
ensuring that our delivery partners dress 
appropriately according to the weather 
conditions, stay hydrated, plan breaks, 
and prioritize their health and safety.

which may result 
in data breaches, 
service disruptions, 
and the loss of 
confidential or 
sensitive data of 
key stakeholder 
including  Personally 
Identifiable 
Information (PII) 
which may lead to 
loss of stakeholder 
trust.
∙	
Information security framework- The 
company has formulated an information 
security framework to protect Eternal’s  
information from unauthorised access 
and external threats and has put in 
place a dedicated security team to 
monitor the same.
∙	
ISO Certification- Eternal is committed

for data protection and continues to 
hold ISO 27001 certification for the 
management of information security.
∙	
Periodic assessment- Eternal 
prioritizes continuous improvement 
in the security posture of the 
company by implementing a thorough 
review mechanism. This includes 
independent assessments such as 
audits, Vulnerability Assessment and 
Penetration Testing (VAPT) evaluations, 
third party reviews, and bug bounty 
programs. Through these initiatives, 
we stay vigilant and proactive in 
safeguarding our systems and data 
against evolving cyber threats.
Negative implications-
Ineffective 
cybersecurity 
measures may lead to 
data breaches, service 
disruptions, and the 
loss of confidential 
or sensitive data 
including PII of key 
stakeholders. This 
may result in loss of

Management 
of key 
stakeholders 
(end-user,

Risk
Risk- Non-
availability, 
interruptions, 
and service 
discrepancies from 
key stakeholders 
such as delivery 
partners and 
restaurant 
partners, which 
are essential for 
business may lead 
to disruptions 
in business 
operations, 
reputational 
damage and 
poor customer 
experience.
∙	
Pre-Booking Model- The company has 
implemented a pre-booking model, 
allowing delivery partners to book 
their preferred slots. This helps ensure 
their availability during peak hours 
while ensuring they receive orders 
during their respective slots. This has 
helped enhance efficiency for both the 
company and our delivery partners.
∙	
Collaborative Partnerships- In select 
cities, Zomato has collaborated with 
third party logistics vendors to ensure 
the availability of delivery partners 
when needed, ensuring the continuity of 
business operations.
∙	
Incentives for Delivery Partners- 
Zomato regularly reviews its incentive 
programs to attract delivery partners 
and offers performance-based 
incentives to foster a supportive and 
rewarding environment.
∙	
Attract new restaurant- Zomato has 
a dashboard in place through which 
restaurants can onboard themselves 
on the platform. We have a dedicated 
team in place which scouts for new 
restaurants and assists them with the 
onboarding process. Various incentive 
programs are extended on a periodic 
basis to attract new restaurants and 
support in their growth.
∙	
Resolution channels- Multiple channels 
are available for restaurant and delivery 
partners to voice their concerns, which 
are promptly addressed and resolved 
by dedicated teams at both city and 
central levels, ensuring uninterrupted 
operations.
∙	
Feedback sharing mechanisms- To 
enhance the services provided by 
the restaurant and delivery partners, 
customer feedback and grievances 
are transparently shared with them, 
enabling continuous improvement and 
superior service quality.
Negative implications-
Ineffective 
management of 
key stakeholders 
essential to the 
business, such as 
delivery and restaurant 
partners, may lead to 
business disruptions, 
reputational damage, 
legal liabilities, and 
negative financial 
impact.

governance
Opportunity Opportunity- 
Robust governance 
practices, 
promoting 
transparency, 
accountability, 
ethical conduct, 
and compliance 
with laws, leads to 
minimizing risks, 
preventing financial 
mismanagement, 
enhancing investor 
confidence, and 
fostering long-term 
sustainable growth.
∙	
Policy framework- Company has 
formulated a policy framework to 
promote ethical conduct among 
employees across all levels of the 
organization.
∙	
Governance Oversight- The company 
has instituted an Audit Committee 
and Risk Management Committee to 
provide oversight and ensure effective 
governance practices.
∙	
Compliance- The company has a 
compliance tool in place, which helps in 
the timely identification of applicable 
laws and regulations, streamlines 
compliance processes, aids in 
monitoring and managing compliance 
activities, and provides a structured 
reporting process to uphold regulatory 
standards, thereby facilitating better 
decision-making.
∙	
Whistleblower Mechanism- The 
company has implemented a 
whistleblower mechanism to encourage 
the reporting of concerns and potential 
wrongdoing, ensuring confidentiality 
and protection against retaliation.
∙	
Risk Management- The company 
has implemented an Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) framework to 
identify strategic risks that may impact 
the organization, enabling proactive 
monitoring and mitigation efforts.
Positive implication-
Effective governance 
and responsible 
business practices 
ensure enhanced and 
structured decision 
making, improved 
risk management, 
a competitive edge, 
reduced risk of 
financial irregularities 
or leaks, and minimized 
risk of regulatory 
noncompliance, etc.

Governance 
Macroeconomic 
and Geopolitical 
Risk
Risk
Risk- Fluctuations 
in global and 
domestic 
macroeconomic 
conditions, 
including 
geopolitical 
volatility, may 
impact interest 
rates, inflation, 
and economic 
stability. This can 
alter purchasing 
behavior, reduce 
demand, increase 
costs, and heighten 
market uncertainty, 
thereby affecting 
the company’s 
revenue and 
sustained growth.
∙	
Business Diversification- Eternal has 
strategically diversified its portfolio 
across multiple verticals, catering to 
a broad spectrum of customer needs, 
price points, and spending capacities. 
This reduces reliance on any single 
customer segment, helping cushion the 
impact of macroeconomic fluctuations.
∙	
Strategy and Resource Allocation- 
Eternal actively monitors 
macroeconomic trends—both short- 
and long-term—and adjusts its strategy 
accordingly. This includes launching or 
modifying product offerings based on 
economic indicators and reallocating 
resources to better align with changing 
consumer behavior and preferences 
during volatile periods.
Negative Implication-
Ineffective 
management of 
macroeconomic and 
geopolitical volatility 
may lead to rising 
inflation and input 
costs, compressing 
margins. Heightened 
uncertainty could 
also delay strategic 
investments and 
expansion plans, 
ultimately impacting 
profitability, cash 
flows, and long-term 
growth prospects.

7. 	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding 
the placement of this disclosure)
	
FY25 marked a breakthrough for Eternal Limited (formerly known as Zomato Limited) as we climbed into the top five global ESG performers within the Restaurant and Leisure 
Facilities (REX) category of S&P Global’s ESG Score 2024. We were also recognized as an Industry Mover and included in the Sustainability Yearbook 2025.
	
Eternal maintained its Low-Risk rating by Sustainalytics in FY25, with a score of 17.3, making us the lowest ESG risk food delivery company globally.
	
We continue to maintain an “AA” Sustainability Leader rating from MSCI.
	
In terms of programs, we continue to reduce last-mile delivery emissions by adopting more EV-based riders into both the food delivery and quick commerce fleets, under our Climate 
Conscious Deliveries set of commitments. We’ve launched several new initiatives to address waste from food delivery operations, including the Plastic-free Future Program (for 
restaurants) and the Food Rescue initiative.  As part of our zero hunger efforts, the Daily feeding program by Feeding India has reached a milestone of 200 million meals and launched 
a new effort to bring attention to early child nutrition through the ‘Anganwadi initiative’. On health and safety, we have successfully built systems to ensure thousands of workers in 
our stores, warehouses and fleets are regularly trained, and improved processes to ensure their safety.  On the diversity front, we aim to train 10,000 women for roles in delivery and 
logistics through initiatives such as our Women Riding Centres initiative.
	
These are some of the highlights of FY25 that are covered in greater detail in the ESG section of our Annual report on page 31 to 36. But as we always say, we are only 1% done.

10. 	Health and safety management system:
	
a. 	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes. At Eternal, our Health and Safety Policy includes nine pillars that outline how we effectively manage 
critical Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) aspects. Additionally, we hold the ISO 45001:2018 
certification for our OH&S Management System.
	
	
The Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) team upholds high levels of safety standards. Our offices 
are equipped with essential safety systems such as fire detection, fire fighting mechanisms, public 
address systems, safety signage, etc,. to ensure the safety of employees and workers. Additionally, 
there is a Safety Reporting System (SRS) that enables employees and workers to report OH&S incidents 
and hazards actively. The system ensures seamless tracking, analysis and resolution thereby building 
a proactive safety culture and enabling continuous improvement of our OH&S management system.
	
	
We recently celebrated National Safety Week (NSW) 2025 by launching the Safety@Work Campaign, 
a key event promoting safety awareness and engagement to reinforce the importance of workplace 
safety. In FY25, we launched mandatory, comprehensive EHS training for all employees, covering key 
areas like fire safety, emergency evacuation and ergonomics. Additionally, we conduct regular training 
for workers on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), chemical, and electrical safety and other job-
specific safety aspects. The Workplace & Facilities Team oversees adherence to safety protocols by 
regularly inspecting and ensuring the functionality of safety systems.
	
b. 	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
Risk identification and mitigation continue to be pivotal aspects of our Health and safety policy, and 
we maintain a proactive stance towards identifying, assessing, and mitigating hazards in all our 
routine and non-routine processes. We also have an integrated action plan to respond to emergency 
situations. As part of our ISO 45001:2018-certified Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System, we have documented procedures for evaluating work-related hazards and risks across all 
activities conducted at our offices. Employees and workers are actively encouraged to report work-
related hazards through our Safety Reporting System (SRS). We also have procedures in place to 
investigate work-related injuries and incidents through SRS.
	
	
During the current financial year, Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) from the previous 
year was reviewed and updated to ensure alignment with any changes in operations, and incorporating

learnings from incidents and near-misses. Based on this review, relevant control measures have been 
re-evaluated and enhanced where necessary.
	
	
We continue to prioritize the integration of action plans with quantified targets to mitigate identified 
hazards and risks effectively. Regular internal inspections and audits are conducted to proactively 
identify and address health and safety risks within the organization.
	
c. 	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we have established a process for workers to report work-related hazards and to protect 
themselves from such risks. In FY24, we introduced the Safety Reporting System (SRS), enabling 
employees and workers to report health and safety hazards and incidents.
	
	
Building on our commitment to workplace safety, we further strengthened the SRS throughout FY

Zomato Plastic-Free Future Program: In response 
to several customer suggestions around usage 
of sustainable packaging by restaurants, we 
introduced the ‘Zomato Plastic-Free Future 
Program’ in December 2024. The program 
recognizes restaurant partners making active 
efforts to adopt sustainable packaging solutions 
for their food deliveries. More than 200 pioneering 
restaurant brands, with 7,500+ restaurants 
across 400+ cities listed on the Zomato app have 
already joined the program by submitting detailed 
evidence of their packaging, including photos and 
certificates, confirming their main menu items 
are being packed in sustainable alternatives. To 
recognize their efforts, these restaurants now carry 
tags (low plastic packaging), banners on their menu 
page and a clear mention in the order summary on 
the Zomato app to make it easy for customers to 
identify them.

schemes. In FY25, we trained 13,000 delivery 
partners on financial literacy through partnerships 
with NSE.
	
Additionally, we started fixed deposit bookings for

to facilitate and solve for access to basic financial 
instruments. This feature is expected to help 
delivery partners augment their earnings and make 
safe investments.

set the following targets:
	
Our targets
	
• 	
Maintain Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions at zero from FY23 onwards
	
• 	
Reduce last-mile delivery emissions by 70% on a per km basis by FY30 from the base year of FY22
	
These targets are aligned with our commitment to facilitate 100% EV-based deliveries by 2030 (our 
flagship GHG reduction project).
	
Performance against targets
	
• 	
We have maintained 100% of our Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions at zero through use of an equivalent 
amount of verified carbon removal offsets and International Renewable Energy Certificates (IRECs).
	
• 	
Our last-mile delivery emissions on a per km basis reduced by 10.53% in FY25 when compared to FY22.
	
The reduction in last-mile delivery emissions was facilitated by an expansion of our EV program. In FY25, 
our total EV-based food deliveries increased by 1.4x from the previous year, totaling to 87.6 million orders, 
representing 10.3% of total orders.
	
During the reporting year, we organized an EV Bazaar to educate the delivery partners on the benefits of 
EVs and to support the transition from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs. We launched a 
customer-facing EV campaign on ‘World Environment Day’ to highlight that EVs are the most effective 
and eco-friendly delivery solutions available, while also emphasizing our company’s commitment towards 
transitioning to 100% EV-based food deliveries.
	
To facilitate easier access to EVs, we established 40+ partnerships with EV rental agencies, EV battery 
swapping companies and EV-based logistics service providers.

To promote segregation at source, we utilize appropriately colored and labelled dustbins to facilitate 
easy and efficient separation of various types of waste, ensuring that recyclable, organic and non-
recyclables materials are appropriately sorted by our own housekeeping teams.
	
For e-waste, biomedical waste and hazardous waste streams, we take responsibility for appointing 
authorized waste management vendors and collect recycling certificates from them.
	
For plastic waste, wet waste and paper and cardboard waste streams, we collect details of disposal and 
recycling from vendors appointed by our landlords or owners of the premises.
	
Gurugram and Bengaluru offices have achieved and continue to hold ISO 14001 certification, demonstrating 
our commitment to effective environmental management
	
Since, we are a technology platform in the services business, our generation of hazardous waste is minimal 
and toxic waste is nil.
	
To further reduce the impact of waste generated by orders placed by users from restaurants on Zomato’s 
platform, we have implemented a number of voluntary initiatives within our value chain.
	
One of our key voluntary waste reduction initiatives is the ‘Don’t send cutlery’ initiative on the food delivery 
app. This initiative has resulted in a reduction of restaurant orders sent with cutlery by more than 80%. 
preventing the usage of single-use material for cutlery and reducing ~1050 MT  of cutlery waste for FY25. 
This initiative has helped reduce ~2,983 MT of cutlery waste from FY22 to FY25.
	
In FY23, we launched the 100% plastic neutral deliveries initiative. While the choice of packaging used 
for food deliveries rests with our restaurant partners, we are committed to mitigating the impact of this 
packaging on the environment through voluntary recycling within our value chain. To this end, we have 
voluntarily recycled 45,000 MT of plastic waste to date which is equal to the amount restaurants use for 
packing their food delivery orders, fully meeting the target of 100% plastic neutral deliveries in FY25.

Climate 
conscious 
deliveries 
initiative*
EVs are a relatively new technology in 
India and awareness on the benefits of 
using EVs for delivery is relatively low. 
This is why we invest in introducing this 
technology to our delivery partners 
through digital communication, on-
ground events & EV partnerships.
EV awareness:
∙	
YouTube channel ‘Zomato Delivery 
Partners’-  we have released 
engaging videos to generate 
awareness among delivery partners 
about the benefits of using EVs 
for deliveries. This channel is very 
popular among delivery partners.
EV awareness:
∙	
In FY25, Delivery Partners were 
made aware about the benefits 
of transitioning to EVs through 
engaging videos on the YouTube 
channel resulting in more than 
77,111 views and also through 
notifications etc.
Policy advocacy:
∙	
The EV bazaar event was 
attended by more than 1,000 
delivery partners which helped 
enhance their awareness about 
the EV ecosystem.

offers for owning an EV bike.
Policy advocacy:
Bridged the gaps between delivery 
partners and EV ecosystem providers, 
through on-ground events like EV melas 
and bazaars.
∙	
In September 2024, we organised 
an EV bazaar in Delhi. The event 
aligned with the Delhi government’s 
goal of making Delhi - the EV Capital, 
supporting initiatives like the Delhi 
EV Policy and the 2023 Motor Vehicle 
Aggregator and Delivery Service 
Provider Scheme.
EV partnerships:
∙	
Our partnerships with rental 
agencies, battery swapping 
companies and EV-based logistic 
service providers helps in seamless 
access to EVs on rent for delivery 
partners.
EV partnerships:
∙	
We’ve partnered with 40+ EV 
ecosystem providers as on 
March 31st 2025. It enabled 
delivery partners to view and 
book EVs to rent through the 
‘Rent an EV’ feature on their 
app. They are also able to view 
conveniently located charging 
and swapping points that fall 
in their zone directly on the 
delivery partner app.
	
25,851 DPs have rented EVs via 
the Rent an EV feature in FY25
These EV initiatives reinforce our 
commitment to achieve our targets 
through focused policy advocacy 
and collaborative stakeholder 
engagement. As a result of our 
efforts:
∙	
Our monthly active EV-based 
delivery fleet as on March 2025 
stood at 37,077 which is 1.3x the 
number of EV-based partners 
in our fleet compared to March 
2024.
∙	
10.3% of our food delivery orders 
were delivered by EVs in FY25, 
helping avoid 4,981 tCO2e (scope 
3) emissions.
∙	
In FY25 our last-mile delivery 
emissions on a per km basis 
reduced by 10.53% since FY22
∙	
Our EV program was awarded 
“FE Green Sarathi Award- Green 
Mobility” from The Financial 
Express in December 2024

100% Plastic 
Neutral 
Deliveries
In FY23, Zomato app launched the 100% 
Plastic Neutral Deliveries initiative. 
While the choice of packaging used for 
food deliveries rests with our restaurant 
partners, we are committed to mitigating 
of this packaging on the environment 
through voluntary recycling. To estimate 
the volume of plastic used by restaurants 
for packaging we engaged an expert 
third party to review data from orders 
by cuisine type, restaurant location 
and price of meals. This data was 
supplemented by an independent survey 
of the packaging practices of over 600 
restaurants. Zomato then engaged 
an authorized waste management 
agency to undertake recycling of plastic 
waste equal to the volume estimated 
by the third party study of restaurant 
packaging.
(Link: 100% plastic neutral deliveries)
Under this initiative, we have 
voluntarily recycled 45,000 MT of 
plastic waste from FY23-FY25, 
fully meeting the target of 100% 
plastic neutral deliveries as per 
independent estimates. Of this total 
volume, 15,000 MT was recycled in 
FY25 alone.

Don’t Send 
Cutlery 
initiative
The ‘Don’t send cutlery’ was launched on 
the Zomato app in FY22. This initiative 
is designed to reduce cutlery waste 
as customers (end-users) often have 
access to cutlery in their homes or 
offices.
This initiative has resulted in a 
reduction of restaurant orders sent 
with cutlery by 80%, preventing 
the usage of single-use materials 
and reducing an estimated ~1050 
MT of cutlery waste in FY25 alone. 
This initiative has helped reduce an 
estimated volume of ~2,900 MT of 
cutlery waste from FY22 to FY25.

Plastic-
Free Future 
Program
Restaurant partners choose and procure 
their own packaging for food delivery 
based on cuisine type, brand and budget. 
We introduced the Zomato Plastic-Free 
Future Program in December 2024 to 
recognize restaurant partners making 
active efforts to adopt sustainable 
packaging solutions for their food 
deliveries.
To recognize their efforts, these 
restaurants now carry tags (low plastic 
packaging), banners on their menu 
page and a clear mention in the order 
summary on the Zomato app to make it 
easy for customers to identify them.
More than 200 pioneering restaurant 
brands, with 7,500+ restaurants 
across 400+ cities listed on the 
Zomato app have already joined 
the program by submitting detailed 
evidence of their packaging, 
including photos and certificates, 
confirming their main menu items 
are being packed in sustainable 
alternatives.

Food rescue 
initiative
Food wastage is a significant challenge, 
given that every month, around 4,00,000 
perfectly good orders already on their 
way to customers are canceled on 
the Zomato app. To reduce this food 
wastage, we have introduced ‘Food 
Rescue’, an initiative that makes 
canceled orders available for nearby 
customers in their original untampered 
packaging at unbeatable prices within 
minutes.
Since its inception in November 
2024, the Food Rescue initiative is 
estimated to have prevented food 
waste close to 190,000 kg till March 
2025 (assuming each order weighs 
approximately 400g).
	
*Our emissions profile is dominated by last-mile deliveries undertaken by our delivery partners, who largely use traditional petrol-
based vehicles. To achieve the goal of Net Zero emissions by 2033, we implement various initiatives to facilitate 100% EV-based 
food deliveries by 2030.
	
Our strategy to achieve Net Zero emissions is focused on facilitating delivery partners’ transition to using EVs. To prepare our 
business for a low-carbon future, we have adopted a holistic approach included in the table above.
6. 	 Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of  the

Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 
Regulations, 2015 as amended;
	
•	
Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Reporting Requirements for listed entities 
per Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/
CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024 (the 
“SEBI Master Circular”);
	
•	
SEBI Press Release PR No.36/2024 dated 
December 18, 2024;

4.	 Management’s Responsibility
	
The Company’s management is responsible 
for selecting or establishing suitable criteria 
for preparing the Sustainability Information 
including the reporting of the Report, taking 
into account applicable laws and regulations, if 
any, related to reporting on the Sustainability 
Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, 
preparation and presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes 
design, implementation and maintenance of 
internal controls relevant to the preparation of 
the Report and the measurement of Identified 
Sustainability Information, which is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
5.	 Inherent limitations
	
The absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure non-financial information allows 
for different, but acceptable, measures and 
measurement techniques and can affect 
comparability between companies.
6.	 Our Independence and Quality Control
	
We have maintained our independence and 
confirm that we have met the requirements 
of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and 
the SEBI Master Circular and its clarifications

thereto and have the required competencies 
and experience to conduct this assurance 
engagement.
	
We apply Standard on Quality Control (“SQC”) 1, 
“Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits 
and Reviews of Historical Financial Information, 
and Other Assurance and Related Services 
Engagements”, and accordingly maintain 
a comprehensive system of quality control 
including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 
professional standards, and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
7.	 Our Responsibility
	
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable 
assurance opinion and limited assurance 
conclusion on the Identified Sustainability 
Information listed in Appendix I and Appendix II 
respectively based on the procedures we have 
performed and evidence we have obtained.
	
We conducted our engagement in accordance 
with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance 
Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “Assurance 
Engagements on Sustainability Information”, 
and Standard on Assurance Engagements (SAE) 
3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse 
Gas Statements (together the “Standards”), both 
issued by the Sustainability Reporting Standards 
Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.
	
These standards require that we plan and perform 
our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Identified Sustainability 
Information listed in Appendix I and included in 
the Report are prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the Criteria; and obtain 
limited assurance about whether the Identified 
Sustainability Information listed in Appendix II 
and included in the Report is free from material 
misstatement.
	
As part of both reasonable and limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with the Standards, 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the 
engagement.
8.	 Reasonable Assurance
	
A reasonable assurance engagement involves 
identifying and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
Information whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary 
in the circumstances.
	
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection 
of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, 
analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling 
with underlying records.
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in 
performing the procedures listed above, we:
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Identified 
Sustainability Information and related 
disclosures;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the 
assessment criteria and their suitability for 
the evaluation and/or measurements of the 
Identified Sustainability Information;
	
•	
Made inquiries of Company’s management, 
including the corporate sustainability team, 
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) team, 
the compliance team, the human resource 
team, the finance team amongst others and 
those with the responsibility for preparation 
of the Report;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding and performed an 
evaluation of the design of the key systems, 
processes and controls for recording, 
processing and reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information at the corporate 
office and other offices on a sample basis. 
This included evaluating the design of 
those controls relevant to the engagement 
and determining whether they have been 
implemented by performing procedures 
in addition to inquiry of the personnel 
responsible for the Identified Sustainability 
Information;
Financial Statements
Statutory Reports: BRSR
Company Overview
135
	
•	
Based on the above understanding and 
the risks that the Identified Sustainability 
Information may be materially misstated, 
determined the nature, timing and extent of 
further procedures;
	
•	
Tested the key assumptions, emission factors 
and methodologies used for calculation of 
Green House Gas (GHG) emissions;
	
•	
Tested the Company’s process for 
collating the  sustainability information 
through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with 
the underlying records on a sample basis; 
and
	
•	
Tested the consolidation for various offices 
on sample basis under the reporting 
boundary for ensuring the completeness and 
accuracy of data being reported.
	
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our reasonable assurance opinion.
9.	 Limited Assurance
	
A limited assurance engagement involves 
assessing the suitability in the circumstances of 
the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for 
the preparation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information as listed in Appendix II, assessing the 
risks of material misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information whether due to fraud 
or error, responding to the assessed risks as 
necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating 
the overall presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information.
	
A 
limited 
assurance 
engagement 
is 
substantially less in scope than a reasonable 
assurance engagement in relation to both 
the risk assessment procedures, including 
an understanding of internal controls, and 
the procedures performed in response to the 
assessed risks.
	
The procedures we performed were based 
on our professional judgment and included 
inquiries, observation of processes performed, 
inspection of documents and evaluating the 
appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies and agreeing with underlying 
records.
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in 
performing the procedures listed above, we:
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Identified 
Sustainability Information and related 
disclosures;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding of the 
assessment criteria and their suitability for 
the evaluation and/or measurements of the 
Identified Sustainability Information;
	
•	
Made inquiries of Company’s management, 
including the Corporate Sustainability team, 
Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) team, 
the compliance team, the human resource 
team, the finance team amongst others and 
those with the responsibility for preparation 
of the Report;
	
•	
Obtained an understanding and performed an 
evaluation of the design of the key systems, 
processes and controls for recording, 
processing and reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information at the corporate 
office and other offices on a sample basis. 
This included evaluating the design of 
those controls relevant to the engagement 
and determining whether they have been 
implemented by performing procedures 
in addition to inquiry of the personnel 
responsible for the Identified Sustainability 
Information;
	
•	
Based on the above understanding and 
the risks that the Identified Sustainability 
Information may be materially misstated, 
determined the nature, timing, and extent 
of further procedures;
	
•	
Reviewed the key assumptions, emission 
factors and methodologies used for 
calculation of GHG emissions; and

•	
Reviewed the Company’s process for 
collating the  sustainability information 
through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with 
the underlying records on a sample basis.
	
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our limited assurance conclusion.
10.	Exclusions
	
Our assurance scope excludes the following and 
therefore we do not express opinion/conclusion 
on:
	
•	
Aspects of the Report and the data/
information (qualitative or quantitative) 
other than the Identified Sustainability 
Information; and
	
•	
The statements that describe expression 
of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, 
aim, or future intentions provided by the 
Company.
11.	 Other information
	
The Company’s management is responsible for 
the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included within 
the BRSR, other than Identified Sustainability 
Information and our independent assurance 
report dated July 21, 2025, thereon.
	
Our opinion on the Identified Sustainability 
Information does not cover the other information 
and we do not express any form of assurance 
thereon.
	
In connection with our assurance engagement 
of the Identified Sustainability Information, our 
responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the 
Identified Sustainability Information or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
	
If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this 
regard.
12.	Reasonable Assurance Opinion and 
Limited Assurance Conclusion
	
Reasonable Assurance Opinion
	
Based on the procedures we have performed and 
the evidence we have obtained, the Identified 
Sustainability Information for the year ended 
March 31, 2025, listed in Appendix I are prepared 
in all material respects, in accordance with the 
Criteria as stated in paragraph 3 above.
	
Limited Assurance Conclusion
	
Based on the procedures we have performed and 
the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come 
to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
Identified Sustainability Information listed in 
Appendix II for year ended March 31, 2025, are not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the Criteria as stated in paragraph 3 above.
13.	Restriction on use
	
Our Assurance report has been prepared and 
addressed to the Board of Directors of the 
Company at the request of the Company solely, 
to assist the Company in reporting on Company’s 
sustainability performance and activities. 
Accordingly, we accept no liability to anyone, 
other than the Company. Our Assurance report 
should not be used for any other purpose or by 
any person other than the addressees of our 
report. We neither accept nor assume any duty 
of care or liability for any other purpose or to 
any other party to whom our report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come without our prior 
consent in writing.
