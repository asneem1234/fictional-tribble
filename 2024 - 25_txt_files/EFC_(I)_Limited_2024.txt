1 
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
The 
Company 
faces 
prominent 
risk from the possibility of falling 
behind on fast-changing regulatory 
standards as per our service sector. 
As 
environmental 
and 
social 
regulations 
continue 
to 
evolve 
at a rapid pace, the likelihood of 
unintentional noncompliance might 
arise. This may expose the Company 
to 
potential 
financial 
sanctions 
but also risks damaging brand 
reputation and effecting stakeholder 
confidence.
To effectively manage the risks associated with rapidly 
evolving environmental and social regulations company 
has taken up the following approaches- 
1.	
The Company has implemented a comprehensive 
compliance strategy. This includes comprehensive 
policy framework and its implementation. The 
company aims to further enhance pre-existing 
resources to introduce real-time monitoring tools to 
avoid any non-compliance. 
2.	
We conduct regular training to keep our teams 
informed and foster a culture of accountability and 
awareness. Our internal policies and controls are 
continuously updated to align with current standards, 
supported by advanced compliance management 
systems that enhance accuracy and efficiency. 
3.	
Regular audits and assessments further reinforce 
our commitment to compliance, allowing us to 
identify potential gaps and implement timely 
corrective actions.  
Through these proactive measures, the Company aims 
to protect its reputation, maintain stakeholder trust, and 
uphold the highest standards of environmental and 
social responsibility.

2 
GHG Emission 
Management 
Risk
The Company’s operations including 
co-working spaces, turnkey interior 
projects, and furniture manufacturing 
contribute to emissions through 
energy consumption and material 
waste. Without effective emission 
management, the Company faces 
increasing 
regulatory 
risks 
as 
authorities implement stricter climate 
regulations 
and 
carbon 
pricing 
mechanisms aimed at reducing 
environmental impact.
To effectively manage and reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, the Company is prioritizing the adoption 
of renewable energy sources across its operations, 
including co-working spaces, turnkey projects, and 
manufacturing units. Energy-efficient technologies such 
as smart lighting systems, advanced HVAC solutions, 
and automation tools are being implemented to optimize 
consumption 
and 
reduce 
operational 
emissions. 
Accurate and transparent tracking of emissions through 
regular GHG inventories and reporting frameworks 
ensures data-driven decisions, regulatory compliance, 
and continuous improvement in achieving long-term 
climate goals.
Negative
3 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste management poses a significant 
risk to the Company’s operations 
across co-working spaces, turnkey 
projects, and furniture manufacturing. 
These activities generate considerable 
waste during construction, renovation, 
and production. As environmental 
regulations tighten and stakeholder 
expectations 
rise, 
ineffective 
waste handling could lead to non- 
compliance, reputational harm, and 
increased costs. Sustainable waste 
practices are essential to minimize 
landfill use, reduce environmental 
impact, and uphold the Company’s 
commitment 
to 
sustainable 
and 
responsible operations.
The Company recognizes the need for stronger 
waste management practices across its operations. 
While some measures are already in place, such as 
regular training programs for staff and contractors to 
strengthen adherence to waste protocols, further steps 
are being taken to enhance sustainability. These include 
implementing project-specific waste management plans, 
expanding the use of modular and eco-friendly materials, 
and deploying digital tools to track and monitor waste 
generation more effectively. The Company also plans 
to roll out partnering with certified waste handlers and 
integrating recyclable materials into select projects.  
In line with circular economy principles, initiatives such 
as material reuse, furniture refurbishment, and product 
take-back programs are being explored to reduce landfill 
impact and extend product life cycles. 
Negative
4 
Occupational 
Health and safety
Risk
Given the nature of its operations, 
the Company acknowledges health 
and safety as a critical operational 
risk across its various businesses and 
subsidiaries. Ensuring occupational 
health and safety (OHS) is vital to 
safeguard employees, contractors, 
and nearby communities, particularly 
in construction, on-site installations, 
and 
manufacturing 
activities, 
customers and tenants occupying 
its co-working and leased spaces. 
OHS performance directly impacts 
productivity, 
reputation, 
and 
stakeholder trust.
The Company is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of occupational health and safety across its co-
working spaces, leased properties, turnkey projects, and 
furniture manufacturing units. To mitigate related risks, it 
aims to implement robust OHS policies, conduct regular 
risk assessments, and ensure mandatory safety training 
for employees and contractors. Trained safety officers 
and routine audits will reinforce on-site compliance, while 
safe, ergonomic environments will be prioritized for both 
workers and tenants. The Company also emphasizes 
strict adherence to safety standards by all vendors 
and contractors, supported by a transparent incident 
reporting system to drive continuous improvement and 
ensure the well-being of all stakeholders.
Negative
5 
Product & Service 
Quality
Opportunity
The Company is committed to 
delivering high-quality products and 
services. Quality is embedded at 
every stage, from thoughtful design 
and durable materials to precision 
in 
execution 
and 
post-delivery 
support. The Company prioritizes 
functionality, aesthetics, and user 
comfort, ensuring that spaces and 
products meet the evolving needs 
of clients while adhering to safety, 
sustainability, 
and 
performance 
standards. 
Continuous 
feedback 
loops, strict quality control processes, 
and a focus on innovation drive 
our mission to consistently exceed 
customer 
expectations 
and 
set 
benchmarks in service excellence.

Opportunity
The 
Company 
recognizes 
environmental 
sustainability 
as 
an

particularly in its manufacturing 
and construction activities. The 
potential 
for 
environmental 
degradation, resource depletion, 
and regulatory non-compliances 
may impact the Company’s acclaim 
and operational costs.
To address these opportunity , the Company is 
committed to implementing sustainable practices, such 
as reducing waste, optimizing energy use, and sourcing 
eco-friendly materials. Regular environmental audits 
and compliance checks will be conducted to ensure 
adherence to environmental standards and regulations. 
The Company also aims to engage with stakeholders 
to promote sustainability initiatives and enhance its 
environmental performance.

Supply Chain 
Resilience
Opportunity
Enhancing supply chain resilience 
can lead to cost savings and 
improved 
delivery 
times. 
By 
diversifying 
suppliers, 
adopting 
advanced forecasting technologies, 
and implementing real-time tracking 
systems, the company can reduce 
dependency 
on 
single 
sources 
and respond more effectively to 
unexpected challenges. Additionally, 
investing in local sourcing and 
nearshoring strategies can shorten 
lead times, reduce transportation 
costs, 
and 
improve 
adaptability 
to 
regional 
market 
demands. 
Proactive supply chain management 
not only mitigates risks but also 
enhances customer satisfaction and

efficiency.

the 
company 
can

Talent Retention 
and Workforce 
Development
Risk
In 
a 
rapidly 
evolving 
business 
landscape, the ability to attract, 
retain, and upskill talent is critical to 
sustaining competitive advantage 
and operational excellence. Non-
fulfilment in doing so may lead to 
increased turnover rates, loss of 
institutional proprietary knowledge, 
higher 
recruitment 
costs, 
and 
reduced 
productivity. 
Moreover, 
as younger generations prioritize 
purpose-driven work and flexibility, 
companies that do not adapt to 
evolving employee expectations risk 
disengagement 
and 
reputational 
damage as an employer.
To mitigate the risk of talent and workforce attrition 
company aims to focus on following approaches-

Practices
Risk
Dependence on third-party vendors 
/ Suppliers for essential services 
such as cleaning, security, and 
maintenance introduces ESG-related 
compliance risks. If vendors engage 
in illegal labor practices, underpay 
workers, or fail to meet safety and 
welfare standards, it can lead to 
reputational damage, legal liabilities, 
and investor scrutiny. 
To avoid these risks in compliance the company 
is committed to taking the following measures- 
Comprehensive ESG due diligence during third party 
supplier/vendor/consultant selection involving assessing 
potential suppliers based on their environmental, 
social, and governance practices, ensuring they align 
with sustainability, ethical labor standards, and legal 
compliance. Developing and enforcing a supplier code 
of conduct, based on National labor standards and ILO 
conventions which ensures vendors follow established 
ESG guidelines. Regular audits, both scheduled and 
random, help monitor vendor compliance, while 
providing ESG training and support foster continuous 
improvement. By integrating these practices, businesses 
can ensure their supply chains are ethical, sustainable, 
and compliant with global standards, mitigating risks and 
enhancing long-term value for all stakeholders.

conduct and corporate governance. To enhance compliance awareness, a quarterly Ethics Bulletin was introduced, and an internal digital 
grievance portal was implemented to streamline reporting and resolution of workplace grievances.
