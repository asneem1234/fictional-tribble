(Indicate positive or negative 
implications) 
1
 Climate risk
Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate 
change 
is 
increasingly 
acknowledged as a significant source 
of financial risk on a global scale. The 
inherent uncertainty surrounding the 
timing, scope, and intensity of climate-
related and environmental risks poses 
a direct threat to the safety, resilience, 
and operational soundness of individual 
regulated 
entities, 
with 
potential 
implications for the broader financial 
system’s stability.
Risk 
considerations, 
potential 
disruptions 
in 
loan 
repayment 
schedules, 
project 
viability, 
and 
collateral/property valuations.
Elevated credit risk due to increased 
defaults and depreciating asset values.
Broader 
systemic 
vulnerabilities 
are potentially leading to financial 
instability.
Opportunity Considerations:
Advancing green financing initiatives 
to attract environmentally conscious 
borrowers.
Enabling 
increased 
investment 
in 
sustainable 
and 
climate-resilient 
projects. 
Strengthening 
brand 
value and stakeholder trust through 
responsible financial practices. Driving
Establishing 
a 
robust 
ESG 
framework for long-term value 
creation and risk mitigation. 
Capri’s ESG policy ensures 
that environmental, social, and 
governance 
considerations 
are 
embedded 
across 
the 
organisation’s core functions.
Key Focus Areas:
Embedding 
ESG 
principles 
across 
business 
strategy, 
operational 
processes, 
risk 
management frameworks, and 
governance structures.
Proactively managing climate 
and sustainability-related risks 
through responsible and ethical 
lending practices.
Continuously assessing ESG 
performance 
metrics 
and 
monitoring 
exposure 
to 
emerging risks.
Collaborating with stakeholders 
to strengthen organisational 
resilience and drive sustainable 
value creation.
Implications of Climate and 
Environmental 
Management 
Practices
Adverse Implications:
-	
Escalation in operational 
expenditures 
due 
to 
inefficiencies 
or 
non-
compliance.
-	
Exposure 
to 
regulatory 
penalties and sanctions.
-	
Potential erosion of brand 
reputation and stakeholder 
trust.
Favourable Implications:
-	
Transition 
towards 
sustainable 
energy 
management 
and 
low-
carbon operations.
-	
Realisation of cost savings 
through improved energy 
efficiency.
-	
Enhanced productivity and 
operational optimisation.
-	
Emerging 
revenue 
opportunities 
in 
the 
renewable and clean energy 
sectors.

 Compliance
Opportunity
Compliance is crucial for avoiding 
legal penalties and maintaining the 
company’s reputation. Adhering to 
regulatory 
requirements 
enhances 
trust and credibility with stakeholders. 
Treating compliance as a key priority 
helps streamline operations and fosters 
a culture of integrity, positioning Capri 
as a reliable and responsible player in 
the market.
 NA
Positive
Effective compliance reduces 
the risk of costly fines and 
legal issues. It also improves 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
attracts investment by ensuring 
adherence to regulations. This 
proactive 
approach 
builds 
investor confidence, supporting 
long-term financial stability and 
growth.
3
Data security and 
privacy
Opportunity and 
Risk
Data 
privacy 
and 
protection 
are 
essential for maintaining customer 
trust and complying with regulations. 
Prioritizing 
this 
area 
demonstrates 
Capri’s commitment to safeguarding 
sensitive information, reducing the risk 
of breaches and associated reputational 
damage. 
This 
proactive 
stance 
enhances the Capri’s credibility and 
competitive advantage
To 
ensure 
data 
protection 
& privacy, there are internal 
policies 
and 
guidelines 
to 
ensure the collection, use and 
storage of data is secure.
Positive and Negative
Investing in data privacy and 
protection mitigates the risk 
of costly data breaches and 
regulatory 
fines. 
It 
fosters 
customer loyalty and attracts 
new clients, driving revenue 
growth. 
Enhanced 
data 
security practices also improve 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
reduce 
potential 
financial 
losses, contributing to long-
term profitability and stability.

As a financial services organisation, Capri Global operates in a low-hazard environment; however, ensuring the safety and

Inhouse real time TAT 
management system 
- IP Rights (patent 
pending)
Provisional Patent 
filed on: 2025/03/15
Yes: The improvements 
in TAT (Turnaround 
Time) lead to enhanced 
customer satisfaction, as 
they experience quicker 
processing times for loans 
and services. Additionally, 
the more efficient workflow 
reduces operational costs, 
which could be reflected in 
more competitive interest 
rates or reduced fees passed 
on to customers. Moreover, 
the enhanced system allows 
for a smoother customer 
journey, leading to a better 
overall experience and 
loyalty.
Based on customer satisfaction 
improvements, increased 
disbursement rates, and operational 
cost savings:
Revenue Growth: The system’s 
improvement in TAT has led to a 
measurable increase in new disbursal 
interest income for Home Loans (HL) 
and MSME sectors, which directly 
contributes to higher revenue 
generation.
Operational Savings: The 
automation and monitoring 
mechanisms have resulted in a 
reduction of time spent on manual 
processes, thereby reducing 
operational costs and allowing for 
the reallocation of resources to other 
strategic areas.
Customer Loyalty: Faster processing 
and service delivery improve 
customer retention and brand 
reputation, which indirectly translates 
into long-term revenue and growth.
