Integrated model – 
a byproduct from 
one product used 
as input material for 
other products
• Salt is electrolyzed to create 
caustic soda. Hydrogen and 
chlorine are caustic soda’s 
byproducts. 
• Hydrochloric acid, which is 
created when hydrogen and 
chlorine are synthesized, is 
utilized to leach ilmenite ore to 
manufacture synthetic rutile. 
• Leach liquor is a by-product 
of synthetic rutile. Ammonium 
chloride is the byproduct of 
the leach liquor’s neutralization 
with iron scrap and subsequent 
synthesis with ammonia to 
create synthetic iron oxide 
pigment. This mixture then 
reacts with quick lime to form 
calcium chloride. 
• Trichloroethylene is created 
when chlorine combines with 
acetylene, which is created 
by the synthesis of calcium 
carbide and water. 
• Through the polymerization 
of vinyl chloride monomer, 
poly vinyl chloride is created. 
Chlorination is then used to 
produce CPVC.
