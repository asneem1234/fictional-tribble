A brief on types of customers
 
 
 
Sammaan Capital Limited (SCL) serves a broad and evolving customer base across its core verticals. 
 
 
 
The Company’s retail operations cater to a wide spectrum of customers, including salaried individuals, self-employed 
professionals, and micro and small enterprises, with a strong presence across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Many of 
these borrowers are either first-time credit users or belong to informal income segments, reflecting the Company’s 
deep focus on financial inclusion. SCL’s retail lending also supports borrowers in under-served geographies through 
a combination of physical presence and digital distribution, often enabled through structured programs and co-
lending models.
 
 
 
In its wholesale business, SCL focuses on developers and enterprises across sectors such as real estate, logistics, and 
infrastructure. It offers structured financing and resolution-led lending, with a particular emphasis on affordable 
housing and small developer finance—supporting credit needs in lower-income housing projects and semi-urban 
markets. The Company also extends credit to corporate clients and MSMEs for project-specific and working capital 
needs.

Having well-defined policies

a board of directors and 
executive 
managers 
who 
uphold a culture of compliance, 
directly 
contributes 
to 
improved outcomes. 
Organizations 
with 
strong 
corporate 
governance 
can 
secure funds at lower interest 
rates compared to those with 
weaker governance, as they are 
perceived as stable, reliable, 
and capable of mitigating 
potential risks.

A robust Board and transparent

Priority Sector 
Lending
Opportunity
Priority sector lending within 
home 
loans 
focuses 
on 
affordable housing, assisting 
families in purchasing their 
first home and addressing the 
country's housing gap.
Lending to small businesses 
and micro, small, and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs) is also 
part of priority sector lending, 
with MSMEs being a vital 
sector, contributing 30% of 
India’s GDP.
-
Positive: 
By 
addressing 
the 
housing 
shortage in smaller towns, 
Sammaan Capital aids the credit 
underserved population and 
contributes to the Government’s 
'Housing for All' goal. Serving the 
credit needs of the crucial MSME 
sector 
supports 
economic 
growth 
and 
employment 
generation.
3.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk and Opportunity
Opportunities: At the core of 
Sammaan Capital’s operations 
is a 'customer first' approach. 
In 
addition 
to 
prioritizing 
customer 
experience, 
the 
company strives to maintain 
transparency in its operations 
and communication. 
Risk: As a provider of housing 
and 
mortgage-backed 
loan 
products 
and 
services 
to 
a large customer base, a 
negative customer experience 
could lead to customer loss or 
reputational damage.
Sammaan Capital uses a 
centralized system to track 
and 
resolve 
customer 
complaints promptly. Regular 
feedback helps identify and 
fix service issues, while staff 
training ensures consistent 
customer service. This helps 
us to adapt to customer 
needs 
and 
also 
protect 
Company’s reputation. 
Positive: 
Satisfied 
customers 
play 
a 
pivotal role in reducing churn 
and strengthening brand loyalty 
– positively impacting revenue 
and profitability. Additionally, 
satisfied customers are more 
likely to refer other, supporting 
organic growth and enhancing 
revenue 
streams. 
A 
strong 
reputation built on service 
quality can improve access to 
capital by boosting investor and 
lender confidence. 
Negative: 
On the other side, negative 
customer experiences can result 
in higher complaint resolution 
costs, increased reputational 
risk, and potential regulatory 
scrutiny. 
Customer 
attrition 
due to poor service can lead to 
decline in revenue and increased 
costs to regain market trust and 
rebuild the customer base. It 
may affect credit worthiness, 
valuation, and the ability to scale 
sustainably.

At SCL our firm commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles 
continues to play a key role in our business strategy. We recognize that sustainability is vital for 
generating long-term value for our stakeholders and the communities we serve. As a responsible 
organization, we are focused on promoting renewable energy lowering our carbon emissions, 
advancing diversity and inclusion, and supporting community development.
To support these efforts, we have set an ambitious goal of becoming Carbon Neutral by FY32. By

while also reducing our environmental footprint. Our governance framework upholds the highest 
standards of ethics, transparency, and accountability. ESG objectives have been integrated into 
management performance indicators to ensure measurable progress and impact. Our overarching 
goal is to pursue sustainable growth that aligns with our ESG vision.
The entity has taken few focused preparatory steps including: 
• 
Rigorous tracking of electricity consumption across facilities, with specific targets set for 
energy reduction in the upcoming years. 
• 
Complete transition to 100% LED lighting contributing to energy efficiency. 
• 
Collaboration with third-party agency to manage and recycle sanitary pad waste in a 
responsible and hygienic manner. 
Furthermore, we’ve rolled out thorough training programs for all our staff levels, including our 
board of directors. Our continued investment to IT infrastructure helps minimize our social and 
environmental footprint. All employees are covered under our comprehensive insurance policies, 
and we uphold rigorous health and safety standards, along with established grievance redressal 
mechanisms. We prioritize stakeholder engagement and enforce a zero-tolerance policy for 
human rights violations and harassment. Our efforts have resulted in reduction in energy, water, 
and emission intensity, supported by waste recycling  measures and solar panel installation at our 
facilities. Our active involvement in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reflects our dedication 
to community welfare, while our focus on customer satisfaction drives our journey toward 
sustainable growth.

The primary business function of SCL is to provide mortgage loans. The loan onboarding process is sequential, encompassing 
loan sourcing, processing, disbursement, servicing, and repayment. Below is a summary of each stage:
a) 
Sourcing of Loan:
 
At SCL, loans are sourced through digital channels, branches, and Direct Sale Agents (DSA). Applications are processed via 
our comprehensive digital platform, which offers a seamless home loan experience from application to disbursement. This 
platform integrates the 4E’s: e-APPLY, e-SANCTION, e-DISBURSE, and e-ENGAGE. .
b) 
Loan Processing:
 
• 
Document Submission: The application form, assisted by SCL’s Relationship Manager, is uploaded to the digital portal 
along with various documents. These are then processed by an analytics-driven underwriting engine for a real-time 
preliminary sanction. 
 
• 
Credit Underwriting: Submitted documents undergo multiple checks to verify their authenticity and ensure regulatory 
compliance. 
 
• 
Legal Appraisal: Property title documents are examined to confirm that the title is clear and marketable. 
c. 
Technical Appraisal:
 
Both an in-house and an external technical team perform dual appraisals of project documents and verify the construction 
stage to determine the appropriate disbursement amount.
d. 
Disbursement:
 
Upon approval, the disbursement process is handled digitally, offering significant convenience to both the Company and its 
customers by reducing paperwork and processing time.
e. 
Servicing:
 
The loan servicing process manages the administrative tasks from the disbursement of proceeds until the loan is fully repaid. 
Customers can request changes to personal information, add or update nominees, or file grievances.
f. 
Repayment Θ Closure:
 
Upon full repayment or prepayment of the loan, the customer receives a mortgage release letter and No Objection Certificate 
(NOC), confirming that all loan dues have been settled. Original or copies of title documents and any other documents 
obtained during the legal process are then returned. 
2.  If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your
