Data security 
and privacy 
compliance
Risk
Large volumes of 
high-resolution 
aerial, terrestrial, 
street panoramic 
imagery and 
infrastructure 
data.
ISO 27001-aligned ISMS
Positive:
Avoidance of Costly Fines and 
Penalties: Compliance helps 
organizations 
evade 
severe 
fines imposed by regulatory 
bodies
Increases Shareholder Value: 
Investors 
prefer 
companies 
with solid privacy programs, 
associating them with reduced 
risk and sustainable financial 
performance, 
thus 
boosting 
shareholder confidence and 
value
Negative: 
Compliance Costs: Achieving 
compliance requires significant 
investment 
in 
technologies, 
legal consultation, employee 
training, audits, and ongoing 
management.
Stricter global 
privacy laws 
(DPDP Act 2023, 
GDPR, etc.).

Positive:
Economic Gains from Energy 
Efficiency and Carbon Pricing:
Measures 
such 
as 
carbon 
pricing 
and 
energy-saving 
technologies 
can 
stimulate 
innovation and drive economic 
benefits.
Investment 
and 
Innovation 
Opportunities: 
This 
creates 
significant 
opportunities 
for 
financial institutions, investors, 
and 
companies 
focused 
on green technologies and 
sustainable business models.
Negative:
Asset and Property Damage: 
Climate 
change 
increases 
the frequency and severity of 
extreme weather events such 
as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, 
and droughts. These events 
directly 
damage 
physical 
assets 
and 
infrastructure, 
reducing 
their 
value 
and 
causing substantial losses for 
owners.
Impact 
on 
Corporate 
and 
Economic Performance:
Firms 
in 
climate-vulnerable 
areas, 
especially 
those 
in 
coastal 
regions, 
often 
experience reduced financial 
returns and profitability due 
to direct exposure to climate 
hazards.

bias or misuse 
of datasets

emerging AI and

regulations.

Positive:
Competitive Advantage 
and 
Brand Reputation: Companies 
adopting ethical AI are viewed 
more favorably by consumers, 
partners, 
and 
investors, 
enhancing 
brand 
reputation 
and 
facilitating 
strategic 
partnerships and market growth
Negative: 
High Implementation Costs: 
Developing and maintaining 
ethical AI systems involves 
significant 
investment 
in 
governance 
frameworks, 
transparency mechanisms, and 
continuous monitoring, which 
can 
be 
resource-intensive, 
especially for small and medium 
enterprises.
“Responsible

becoming a key 
differentiator in 
smart governance 
and public-sector
