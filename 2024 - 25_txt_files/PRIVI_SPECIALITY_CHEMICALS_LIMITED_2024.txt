Water 
Conservation
Risk and 
Opportunity
Water is a vital and irreplaceable 
natural resource, and its scarcity 
poses a significant risk to industrial 
operations. At Privi, we acknowledge 
our dependency on water and 
recognise water conservation as 
a strategic opportunity, not only to 
reduce operational risks but also to 
enhance long-term sustainability 
and regulatory compliance. Effective 
water management contributes to 
cost savings, improves resource 
efficiency, and strengthens our water 
stewardship program, aligning with 
stakeholder expectations and global 
sustainability goals.
To address water-related 
risks and seize conservation 
opportunities, Privi has 
adopted key measures:
i)	
Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) across all running 
plants ensures no 
wastewater is released.
ii)	
RO and MEE 
systems further treat 
wastewater, with 
recovered water reused 
for non-potable needs.
iii) 	
Rainwater harvesting 
systems support water 
supply and recharge.
iv) 	 Internal reuse of treated 
water, especially for 
cooling and utilities, 
reduces freshwater 
dependency.

Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate change presents both 
a challenge and an opportunity 
for responsible businesses. Privi 
recognises the urgency to transition 
toward a low-carbon economy and 
views this transition as a strategic 
opportunity to build resilience, improve 
operational efficiency, and align with 
global climate expectations.
By adopting science-based emission 
reduction targets (validated by the 
SBTi), the Company is committed to

Energy 
Management 
and Efficiency
Risk and 
Opportunity
Energy efficiency is central to Privi’s 
operational strategy, offering both 
environmental and financial benefits. 
Rising energy costs and regulatory 
expectations present a risk, but 
also an opportunity to innovate, 
reduce emissions, and improve 
competitiveness. Efficient energy use 
lowers greenhouse gas emissions, 
reduces operational costs, and 
strengthens climate resilience.
By embedding energy 
efficiency into our operational 
strategy, Privi not only 
mitigates risks associated 
with energy costs and 
regulation but also leverages 
opportunities to innovate, 
reduce environmental 
impact, and enhance market 
competitiveness. Its a three 
pronged approach. first is 
to get energy audits done 
& implement improvement 
actions. second is to replace 
old equipments with new 
energy efficient ones & this is 
to improve the processes to 
consume less energy.

Waste 
Management 
and Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
Inefficient waste handling can become 
a liability, Increasing environmental 
risks and compliance costs. At Privi, 
we embrace a circular economy 
approach viewing waste as a 
resource to be repurposed rather 
than discarded. By designing out 
waste, keeping materials in use, and 
supporting the regeneration of natural 
systems, we turn environmental 
challenges into opportunities 
for innovation, cost savings, and 
sustainability leadership.
This approach enhances resource 
efficiency, reduces operational waste, 
and aligns with global sustainability 
goals, strengthening our reputation 
and resilience.
We create economic value 
by keeping materials in use 
and regenerating natural 
systems.
i)	
Waste Valorisation: 
Converting waste into 
useful by-products.
ii)	
Circular Design: 
Designing processes to 
minimise waste from 
each step.
iii)	
Reuse : Extending 
material life through 
reuse in operations.
iv) 	 Recycling: 
Implementing systems 
to recover and recycle 
waste responsibly.
V) 	
Process Efficiency: 
Reducing waste

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) is a critical material topic for 
the Company, given its direct impact 
on employee well-being, operational 
continuity, and regulatory compliance. 
The Company’s commitment to OHS 
is reflected through its ongoing efforts 
to promote a strong safety culture by 
conducting periodic training and mock 
drill sessions across all employee and 
worker levels. These initiatives aim to 
build awareness, preparedness, and 
capability to effectively prevent and 
respond to potential safety incidents.
Trained safety professionals are 
deployed on-site to monitor accident 
statistics and ensure proactive risk 
identification and mitigation. The 
systematic tracking and analysis 
of safety data enable the Company 
to detect patterns, uncover root 
causes, and implement corrective 
measures. Regular reporting of safety 
performance and incidents to senior 
management, including the Board of 
Directors, ensures accountability and 
supports strategic oversight.
At Privi, a robust OHS 
framework positions the 
Company as a responsible 
employer and business 
partner, strengthening its 
reputation and stakeholder 
trust. It also creates a 
foundation for continuous 
improvement through data-
driven decision-making 
and feedback loops. In an 
evolving regulatory and 
societal landscape, such 
proactive OHS practices 
provide a competitive 
advantage by aligning with 
expectations for ethical, 
sustainable business 
conduct.
The Company’s focus on 
Occupational Health and 
Safety not only safeguards 
its workforce and operations 
but also creates long-
term value through 
enhanced compliance, 
stakeholder confidence, and 
organisational performance.
It can be seen from the 
awards & recognition the 
Company has received 
from National Safety 
Council, Maharashtra for its 
meritorious performance in 
Safety.
The practice of Behavior 
Based Safety followed by 
the Company indicates 
the culture of preventing 
unsafe behavior itself. Safe 
behavior is part of individual 
employee’s KPI’s.

as well as those of its suppliers.
The Company continually 
strives to procure materials 
from alternative and 
sustainable sources 
(including biomass) and to 
diversify its energy portfolio, 
contributing to the nation’s 
energy security

Product 
Innovation 
and 
Sustainable 
Design
Risk and 
Opportunity
Product Innovation and Sustainable 
Design is a key material topic that 
supports the Company’s long-term 
competitiveness, environmental 
responsibility, and alignment with 
evolving customer expectations. As 
markets and regulatory landscapes 
shift toward sustainability and 
circular economy principles, the 
ability to innovate products with 
reduced environmental impact is 
both a strategic imperative and an 
opportunity for differentiation.
The Company integrates sustainability 
considerations early in the product 
development lifecycle by adopting 
principles such as resource efficiency, 
recyclability, and eco-friendly material 
selection. This proactive approach 
reduces the environmental footprint of 
its products while meeting stringent 
environmental regulations and 
standards. Innovation efforts are also 
geared towards enhancing product 
performance, longevity, and usability, 
thereby delivering greater value to 
customers while minimising waste 
and emissions across the product 
lifecycle.
From a risk perspective, 
failure to innovate 
sustainably may lead to 
product obsolescence, 
regulatory non-compliance, 
and loss of market 
relevance. Additionally, 
stakeholders including 
investors, customers, and 
supply chain partners are 
increasingly evaluating 
companies based on their 
sustainability credentials. 
Lagging in this area can 
result in reputational damage 
and reduced access to key

Conversely, there are

Diversity, 
Equity, and 
Inclusion 
(DEI)
Risk and 
Opportunity
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is 
a critical material topic that influences 
the Company’s organisational culture, 
talent acquisition, innovation capacity, 
and stakeholder relationships. A 
commitment to DEI reflects the 
Company’s dedication to fostering 
an environment where all employees, 
regardless of their background, feel 
valued, respected, and empowered to 
contribute their unique perspectives.
Implementing DEI initiatives enhances 
creativity and problem-solving by 
bringing together individuals with 
diverse experiences and viewpoints. 
Research indicates that diverse 
teams are more innovative and 
make better decisions, leading to 
improved business performance and 
competitiveness.
From a risk perspective, neglecting DEI 
can result in a work environment that 
stifles creativity and innovation. It may 
also lead to higher employee turnover, 
particularly among underrepresented 
groups, and potential reputational 
damage as stakeholders increasingly 
prioritise diversity and inclusion in 
their evaluations.
Embracing DEI presents 
significant opportunities. 
It enables the Company 
to attract and retain top 
talent from a broader pool, 
enhancing organisational 
performance and 
adaptability. Inclusive 
workplaces foster higher 
employee engagement and 
satisfaction, which are linked 
to increased productivity 
and reduced turnover. Thus, 
prioritising Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion not only 
mitigates risks associated 
with talent retention and 
innovation but also unlocks 
opportunities for enhanced 
organisational performance, 
stakeholder trust, and long-
term success.
The Company identifies & 
grooms talent pool for future 
leadership positions. it also 
has developed infrastructure 
which can help differently 
abled persons to work at its 
facilities by providing equal 
opportunities.

Community 
Engagement 
and 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Community Engagement and 
Development is a material topic 
because it directly influences an 
organisation’s social acceptability to 
operate, long-term viability, and its 
role as a responsible corporate citizen. 
At Privi, we contribute to the well-
being of the communities in which we 
operate, not only to mitigate risks but 
also to unlock new opportunities for 
shared value creation.
Failure to engage effectively with 
local communities poses significant 
strategic, operational, and reputational 
risks. Poor engagement can lead 
to community dissatisfaction, 
protests, project delays, or even 
shutdowns. These disruptions can 
incur direct financial losses and cause 
reputational harm that affects investor 
confidence and stakeholder trust. 
Furthermore, neglecting community 
concerns may result in heightened 
regulatory scrutiny or the revocation 
of permits, particularly in industries 
with high environmental or social 
footprints. Inaction or superficial 
engagement increases the risk of 
being perceived as exploitative or 
disconnected, undermining long-term 
business sustainability.
Conversely, meaningful community 
engagement presents an opportunity 
to build strong, trust-based 
relationships that foster mutual benefit. 
By supporting local development 
through employment, education, 
infrastructure, or entrepreneurship 
initiatives, organisations can 
strengthen their social capital, secure 
long-term community support, 
and create resilient operational 
environments. Active collaboration with 
communities can also drive innovation, 
generate local knowledge, and open 
new markets or partnerships. Beyond 
direct benefits, strong community ties 
contribute to a positive brand image, 
improved employee morale, and 
stronger ESG performance all of which 
enhance competitiveness and long-
term value creation.
The Company’s approach 
to community engagement 
is guided by its CSR 
policy, which emphasises 
impact-driven initiatives 
to uplift communities in its 
operational areas. Aligned 
with Schedule VII of the 
Companies Act, 2013, 
and the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), 
our CSR efforts focus on 
three core areas: Education, 
Health & Hygiene, and 
Environmental Sustainability. 
Programs are implemented 
in collaboration with local 
stakeholders to ensure 
relevance, transparency, and 
measurable social impact. 
Through these initiatives, 
the Company aims to foster 
inclusive growth, strengthen 
community relations, and 
contribute to long-term 
sustainable development.

Sustainable 
Land Use 
and Habitat 
Preservation
Risk and 
Opportunity
Biodiversity is a critical aspect of 
environmental sustainability and is 
essential for maintaining healthy 
ecosystems that support business 
operations and community well-being. 
Recognising the potential impact of 
its activities on local flora and fauna, 
the Company prioritises biodiversity 
conservation as a material topic.
Biodiversity loss poses significant 
risks to the Company’s operational 
sustainability, reputation, and 
regulatory compliance. Direct 
impacts, such as habitat destruction 
or ecosystem degradation around 
operational sites, can lead to conflicts 
with local communities, increased 
regulatory scrutiny, and operational 
disruptions. Indirect risks arise 
through the supply chain, where 
sourcing natural raw materials from 
non-certified, unsustainable sources 
may contribute to deforestation, 
ecosystem damage, and exposure to 
reputational and compliance risks. 
Failure to address biodiversity impacts 
can result in financial losses, legal 
penalties, and erosion of stakeholder 
trust.
Conversely, proactive biodiversity 
conservation offers substantial 
opportunities to strengthen the 
Company’s environmental leadership 
and social license to operate.
Initiatives like Miyawaki 
forest development and 
crocodile conservation 
demonstrate tangible 
commitment to ecosystem 
restoration and species 
protection, which can 
enhance community 
relations and improve 
biodiversity outcomes. 
Additionally, sourcing natural 
raw materials from RSPO 
and FSC certified suppliers 
helps ensure sustainable 
supply chains, reduces risk 
of deforestation, and aligns 
the Company with global 
best practices and investor 
expectations. These efforts 
contribute to positive brand 
value, long-term resilience, 
and compliance with evolving 
environmental regulations.
By integrating biodiversity 
conservation into operational 
and supply chain strategies, 
the Company effectively 
mitigates environmental 
and reputational risks while 
unlocking opportunities 
for sustainable growth, 
compliance, and stakeholder 
engagement.

The R&D investments are directed toward sustainable technologies aimed 
at improving environmental and social outcomes. Our R&D focuses on green 
chemistry, the use of renewable raw materials, safer formulations, and process 
innovations that enhance yield and reduce waste. These initiatives help reduce 
emissions, improve material efficiency, minimise by-product generation, and 
lower overall resource consumption, while also ensuring better worker safety. In 
2024-25, we invested a total of ` 300 Lakhs in R&D, including ` 124 Lakhs for 
new sustainable developement, ` 117 Lakhs for process improvements, and ` 59 
Lakhs for yield enhancement. These efforts contribute not only to environmental 
protection but also to operational efficiency and long-term value creation. Through 
these innovations, Privi continues to drive progress toward a more responsible, 
health-conscious, and sustainable fragrance industry.

` 3,326.56 Our 
organisation 
strategically 
allocates 
capital 
expenditure 
(capex) 
to 
projects that drive environmental sustainability, reflecting our commitment to 
sustainable development beyond regulatory obligations. In 2024-25, we invested 
approximately ` 599.5 Lakhs in various environmental sustainability initiatives. 
This includes ` 11.5 Lakhs for acid concentration control to enhance process 
safety, minimise waste generation and increase the reuse of purified acid, and 
` 69.92 Lakhs toward improving coal handling systems and establishing a dust-
free atmosphere, thereby reducing particulate emissions and ensuring a safer 
working environment. A significant investment of ` 212.23 Lakhs was made in 
controlling emissions from diesel generator sets through the installation of Retrofit 
Emission Control Devices (RECDs), supporting our air quality improvement goals. 
In alignment with our transition to cleaner energy, ` 264 Lakhs were directed 
toward solar power installations, reducing dependency on fossil fuels and lowering 
our carbon footprint. Additionally, ` 13.14 Lakhs were invested in advanced energy 
monitoring software to enable real-time tracking and optimisation of energy 
consumption, thereby enhancing energy efficiency across operations.
These capex investments align with our broader ESG goals of pollution control, energy 
efficiency, emission reduction, and climate resilience. In addition, we have made 
significant strides in water stewardship through the adoption of Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) systems, ensuring that all wastewater is treated and reused internally. We are 
also actively pursuing zero waste to landfill, reinforcing our commitment to circular 
economy principles. Investments in effluent treatment plants (ETPs), air scrubbers, 
and fire protection systems safeguard human health and the environment.
Furthermore, Privi supports ethical supply chain practices through certifications 
that ensure responsible procurement and the use of sustainable raw materials. As 
part of this commitment, an investment of ` 28.7 lakhs has been made towards 
certifications that strengthen supply chain transparency and promote the sourcing 
of sustainable inputs
