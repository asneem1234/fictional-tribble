Climate Change
Risk
Opportunity
Credit risk can arise from 
exposure to businesses 
with significant carbon 
emissions, as well as units 
that use technology that 
fail to shift and comply 
with ESG criteria. Further 
fall of real estate prices 
due to natural disasters 
will have a significant 
impact, resulting in larger 
LGD when impairment 
occurs.
The Bank offers a wide 
range of lending money 
to the development and 
application of developing 
technologies such as 
renewable energy, battery 
storage, energy efficiency, 
making breakthroughs in 
LED lighting technology, 
industrial motor 
technology, and electrical 
vehicles.
To lessen the greenhouse 
impact, the Bank does not 
fund borrowers to establish 
new units producing/
consuming Ozone Depleting 
Substances (ODS) or 
small/medium scale units 
involved in the fabrication 
of aerosol units utilising 
Chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFC), which reduces the 
greenhouse effect.

Capex
The Bank’s capital investments in information technology for digital services, viz. Mobile banking, internet 
banking, various ATMs and CRMs, and other digital initiatives, reduce the impact on environmental and social 
issues, thereby indirectly reducing carbon footprints. Further, the Bank’s newly implemented Core Banking 
Solution, ‘Oracle Flexcube’, is expected to further strengthen its ability to mitigate environmental and social 
impacts. Recognised globally as a top-tier platform, ‘Oracle Flexcube’ complies with internationally accepted 
standards and supports the Bank in reinforcing its ongoing commitment to sustainable and responsible 
banking practices in line with ESG principles.
The Bank has made significant advances in Digital Transformation, leading to the successful execution of 
various key projects. By embracing digital innovation, the Bank has prioritised delivering customer-centric 
solutions and operational excellence during a period of rapid technological change in the banking sector. 
Notable initiatives include the launch of diverse customer journeys and improvements to loan origination 
systems for gold, two-wheeler, and corporate loans.
The Bank’s core focus remains on the swift implementation of a comprehensive plan for its core banking 
system and related surrounding systems, while maintaining sustainable compliance with cybersecurity 
controls and strengthening digital payment security.
The Bank has invested significantly in infrastructure transformation to be at the forefront to prevent, 
detect and act in situations arising from it. The technology platforms used by the Bank have adequate level 
of component / system level redundancy built into the production systems. Critical technology platforms / 
systems have a disaster recovery set up at a Disaster Recovery (“DR”) site which can be utilised in the case of 
any major outages in the corresponding production system. Assurance of the DR set up is provided through 
Disaster Recovery drills carried out as per an annualised drill calendar and measurement of Recovery Point 
Objective and Recovery Time Objective parameters of the DR set up on an ongoing basis.
The Bank’s commitment to technological advancement is further demonstrated through strategic efforts 
aimed at enhancing both customer experience and operational efficiency. Additionally, the Bank has invested 
in and successfully implemented an enterprise service management tool for asset & inventory management 
and change management, underscoring its dedication to continuous improvement.

 The Project Dialysis conducted by Fairfax India Charitable Foundation aims in providing affordable, quality dialysis 
services to patients in various parts of India where the services are limited/non-existent for dialysis infrastructure. The 
project was initially approved by the Board as a onetime arrangement with a contribution of `  6.00 Crore, however, 
there was a delay in execution of the project due to delays in the readiness of dialysis centres that resulted in centres 
not being ready for installations of dialysis machines and these resulted in impeding the progress of the completion of 
the project as committed by the foundation at the time of sanctioning the fund. The Bank, hence, on request of the 
foundation, decided to classify the project as an ongoing project with an additional contribution of `  1.79 Crores, which 
is expected to be completed on or before March 31, 2026.
 
 The unspent amount of `  7.79 Crores pertaining to the said ongoing projects were transferred to Unspent CSR account 
on April 17, 2025 which will be released in a phased manner up on receipt of request from the foundation or based on the 
progress of the project on or before March 31, 2026.
