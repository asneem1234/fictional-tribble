conducted to assess the validity of the complaint. For complaints falling under the purview of the Code of Conduct Committee, 
a more in-depth investigation is initiated. The investigation is carried out either internally or externally, depending on the 
severity of the issue. The designated investigator gathers relevant data, validates the information, analyzes the findings, and 
provides observations and recommendations. The investigation report is subsequently reviewed by the CEO, who ensures that 
appropriate actions are taken based on the recommendations. All actions taken are documented and filed for record-keeping 
purposes. Additionally, the Audit Committee conducts periodic reviews to ensure the effectiveness and compliance of the 
grievance redressal process.
