Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.  
	
1)	
Solarization:
	
	
ATGL commissioned its first solar plant in its city gas station situated in Ramol, Ahmedabad (Gujarat, India) 
which yields 89kw of renewable energy every single day. Till date 54 sites of ATGL have the provision of 
PV panels yielding 943.16 kw which will extended to more than 2.0 Mw in the coming year. The aim of the 
initiative is to minimize emissions. Apart from that 7.0 MW – Renewable Captive Green Power procurement 
under final stages of Roll out.
	
2)	
Energy Audit:
	
	
72 Electrical Energy Audit has been performed across sites of ATGL (CNG stations, City Gas Stations 
and Offices). Each site was evaluated with an objective to conserve electricity. Several energy saving 
recommendations like Installation of LED lights, AC energy saver, Occupancy sensors, Timer etc are being 
implanted, based on their viability and feasibility. This initiative is being promoted to ATGL customers as well.
	
3)	
Decarbonization of Fleets:
	
	
All ATGL owned and contracted transport including Transport LCV/HCV cascade, office, Area Emergency 
Office Vehicles have been converted from HSD to CNG. More than 630 of LCVs are now CNG powered. 
ATGL is exploring low carbon alternatives like E-Vehicles and Hydrogen powered trucks to substitute fossil 
fuels. This leap of ATGL is to minimize the predominant emissions.
	
4)	
Methane Leak Detection & Repair:
	
	
The Leak Detention and Repair (LDAR) program was implemented to comply with environmental regulations 
for reducing the methane emissions into the environment. More than 7200 km of leak detection conducted 
study at Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Khurja, Vadodara, Bhiwani,Charkhi Dadri & Mahendragarh, Kheda District 
(EAAA) & Mahisagar, Nuh & Palwal, Porbandar, Surendranagar  by Area Emergency office staffs and by an 
external Third party. The identified leaks are being fixed as Methane is 25 times higher in GHG emissions 
compared to CO2. This initiative was implemented to reduce minimize business’s emissions.

and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
ATGL is having well established Environment Management System in place which is certified as per 
ISO 14001:2015. We have waste management procedures in place to address safe disposal of hazardous waste, 
e-waste and other waste. We do have a policy on resource conservation which makes sure we comply with all 
applicable regulation on natural resources, waste and land along with implementation of technologies to reduce 
specific waste generation and toxicity.
	
The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound 
manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation.
	
We have replaced hazardous odorant Ethyl Mercaptant to less hazardous chemical Scentinel S20 as an Odorant 
We have adopted milkman concept (delivery through tanker on need basis) for delivery of our odorant chemical 
which reduced the storage, handling & disposal of hazardous drums.
	
ATGL is working on prevention of single use plastic in its offices. Five of our offices at Ahmedabad were certified 
by CII, as offices not using Single use plastic items.
