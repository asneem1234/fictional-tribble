Our R&D department is not only focused on upgrading our

sustainable. To reduce the environment and social impact of 
our products the department works on projects considering 
reduction of weight of our product and optimal use of oil 
in operations, improvising safety features and operational 
efficiency.
Our R&D/Manufacturing department created a process for 
producing higher quality class gears to reduce meshing losses, 
which increases gearbox efficiency and reduces power loss. 
Furthermore, higher quality gears minimise noise levels, which 
is critical for the environment.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes 
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
Around 80% of inputs were sourced sustainably, the  Company has formulated an operating procedure to approve 
vendors. Materials are procured from approved vendors both, local and international. The quality assurance team 
of the Company conducts periodic audit of the vendors, especially those who supply key materials and there is 
very specific focus towards the conservation of energy, water & environment at their end.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Our product line comprises products predominantly made of metals, accounting for around 99% of the composition. This 
metal content renders our products highly recyclable. The materials used, including ferrous and non-ferrous elements, 
contribute to a robust and sustainable life cycle lasting approximately 20-25 years. As a result, direct reclamation of 
our products for recycling post their life cycle is currently unviable.
	
Our product manual serves as a tool to raise awareness among customers, advocating for the recycling of used 
products through designated recyclers. At the end of their life cycle, our products do not generate plastic, e-waste, 
hazardous waste, or any other form of waste, aligning with our commitment to environmental sustainability.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, we are disposing the waste in line with the EPR requirement to registered recyclers.

Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N) 
	
Yes, We have a structured risk management approach in place to ensure safety across our offices and manufacturing 
facility. This involves engineers, production supervisors, and EHS team members actively participating in risk 
assessments and managing identified risks. Documenting, approving, and communicating risk mitigation plans 
to stakeholders is crucial. Our operations are guided by safety observations, rectification plans, and procedures 
covering Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment, contractor safety management, and routine external audits for 
workplace safety compliance.

programs conducted by experts on various topics such as good health habits, heart attack, varicose veins, 
orthopedic pain, and more to educate and empower our employees and their families.
	
Furthermore, all our employees are covered under a group health insurance policy that ensures access to a 
wide range of non-occupational medical and healthcare services. This coverage reinforces our commitment to 
supporting the well-being and health needs of our workforce and their loved ones.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, this year we have set up a 2 MW capacity of solar rooftop, significantly contributing to our organisation’s 
sustainability efforts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, to achieve net-zero emissions in our 
operations, we’ve established our own wind farm, which generates electricity supplied to the grid. We receive credits 
for the units contributed, effectively reducing our electricity bills. Our renewable energy infrastructure boasts a total 
installed capacity of 5.5 MW in solar rooftops and 13.25 MW in windfarms. Through the utilisation of these renewable 
sources, we’ve successfully avoided CO2 emissions.
	
We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the Science-Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), target validation will get done this year. Our emission reduction target will be established based on identified 
decarbonisation strategies, including the adoption of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, and implementing 
fuel-switching measures.

We closely monitor waste management techniques. Automated machining of gear parts addresses this issue by 
minimising the amount of metal scrap generated. We generate a substantial amount of metal scrap, which is then 
reused in our foundry shop to make castings. Hazardous waste (used oil) contaminated empty containers (carboys, 
tins, cans, etc.) are disposed of to an approved recycler in accordance with regulatory requirements. Our foundry 
produces a substantial volume of burnt sand, which is used by recyclers in the infrastructure and building industries.

INDEPENDENT REASONABLE AND LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT ON BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY SUSTAINABILITY 
REPORT OF ELECON ENGINEERING COMPANY LIMITED
To,
The Board of Directors, 
Elecon Engineering Company Limited 
Gujarat, India. 
We have undertaken to perform a Reasonable Assurance for 
Business Responsibility Sustainability Report [hereinafter 
“BRSR”] ‘Core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)’ and 
Limited Assurance for ‘Essential Indicators’ for Elecon 
Engineering Company Limited vide Engagement Letter 
dated December 27, 2024 in respect of the agreed BRSR in 
accordance with the criteria stated below. This is included 
in BRSR of the company for the financial year ended March 
31, 2025.
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified 
Sustainability Information is as per the guidelines issued by 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in accordance 
with the circulars:
-    SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/2023/120 dated July 11, 2023
-    SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023 
and clarifications issued for the same.
This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary 
team including assurance practitioners, social, governance 
and environmental experts.
Identified Sustainability Information
The identified Sustainability Information for the financial 
year ended March 31, 2025 is summarised below as per 
Appendix 1;
The areas for which Reasonable and Limited assurance is 
undertaken are also given in Appendix 1 to the report; and
Our Reasonable and Limited assurance engagement was 
with respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information 
only unless otherwise stated and we have not performed 
any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any 
other elements included in the BRSR and, therefore, do not 
express any conclusion thereon.
Management’s Responsibility
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or 
establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability 
Information, considering applicable laws and regulations, 
if any, related to reporting on Sustainability Information, 
Identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, 
content, preparation and presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. 
This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation 
of BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability 
Information, which is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent Limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have maintained our independence and confirm that 
we have met the requirements of Code of Ethics issued by 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and have 
the required competencies and experience to conduct this 
assurance engagement and
The firm applies Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, 
“Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance 
and Related Services Engagements” issued by the ICAI and 
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding 
compliance 
with 
ethical 
requirements, 
professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a Reasonable and Limited 
assurance conclusion, as applicable and given in the 
Appendix 1 to this report on the Identified Sustainability 
Information based on the procedures we have performed 
and evidence we have obtained;
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 
Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements 
(SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability 
Information”, issued by the ICAI. This standard requires that 
we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability 
ANNEXURE – E TO BOARD’S REPORT (CONTD.)
65th Annual Report 2024-25
92
Information are prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Reporting Criteria. A reasonable 
assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of 
material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the 
assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances;
For the purpose of limited assurance, this standard requires 
that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited 
assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability 
Information is free from material misstatement;
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the 
suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of 
the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information 
whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed 
risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating 
the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information;
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less 
in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including 
an understanding of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks; and
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, 
evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing 
or reconciling with underlying records.
