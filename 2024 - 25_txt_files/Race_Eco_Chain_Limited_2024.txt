A brief on type of customers 
Waste Trading: Our key customers comprise recyclers, fibre 
manufacturers, granule producers, and organizations focused 
on renewable resources to meet their energy objectives. We 
serve as a bridge between suppliers of recyclable and 
renewable materials and industries striving to minimize their 
environmental footprint. By enabling efficient waste-to-
resource exchanges, we support businesses in advancing a 
circular economy and fostering sustainable industrial 
practices. 
 
Restore Division: In this division, we procure recycled fabric 
from recyclers and transform it into value-added products 
such as curtains, bags, upholstery, apparel, and more. The 
Restore Division of RACE has played a pivotal role in fulfilling 
orders for domestic customers.

Opportunity 
Innovation in waste management presents a 
strategic opportunity for RACE to enhance 
sustainability, achieve regulatory 
compliance, and drive economic value. By 
leveraging advanced technologies and 
waste-to-energy solutions, we reduce 
environmental impact, optimize resource 
use, and gain a competitive edge. 
 
The company has identified a significant 
opportunity in streamlining and organizing 
its currently unstructured supply chain. By 
undertaking this transformation, the 
company aims to strengthen its position as 
both a leader and a catalyst for structural 
change within the industry. The 
Procurement process has been defined as 
below stated-  
Supplier Network & Collection 
• 
Procurement has established a 
network of suppliers across India 
who are responsible for 
continuously collecting PET bottles. 
• 
Before on-boarding, each supplier 
undergoes a proper KYC verification 
and site visit by the Race team.  
Segregation & Baling Process 
• 
Collected PET bottles are segregated 
into Natural, White, Green, and 
Multi categories before baling 
process begins. 
• 
The bottles are then compressed in 
baling machines to form bales 
(150–350 kgs each), with deliveries

to-energy initiatives and 
enhancing access to green 
financing. 
ranging from a minimum of 5–20 
tonns to an average of 10–15 tonns. 
Purchase Order & Demand Cycle 
• 
Recyclers issue Purchase Orders 
(POs) with rates and demand in 
tons, which are subject to change 
every 2–3 days. 
• 
These rates are communicated to 
the Procurement Team, and 
interested suppliers coordinate 
based on their ability to fulfill the 
demand. 
• 
Post the order, a vendor code is 
generated for the respective 
procurement member with their 
respective suppliers 
Delivery & Documentation 
• 
Suppliers are given specific timelines 
to deliver material to recyclers. 
• 
At dispatch, documentation is 
verified by the Accounts Team, 
including E- way Bill, Geo-tagged 
truck photo, Invoice, Weighing Slip, 
and LR. 
Quality Check & Debit Notes 
• 
Recyclers conduct random sampling 
to check for moisture, dust, 
contamination, or material 
mixing. 
• 
In case of defects, a Debit Note 
(DN) is issued and shared with the 
supplier; deductions are made upon 
acceptance as per agreement. 
Payment & Compliance 
• 
Before releasing payments, the 
Operations Team verifies pending 
GST liabilities for each supplier. 
• 
Payments are released only after 
compliance is confirmed. If goods 
are rejected during quality checks, 
the material is returned to the 
supplier. 
Continuous Operations 
 This procurement and recycling cycle is 
ongoing for both Biofuel and PET plastic, 
ensuring continuous supply chain efficiency. 
 
An organized supply chain will foster greater 
transparency, improve supplier 
accountability, and ensure long-term 
resilience. Through this approach, the 
company aspires to set industry benchmarks 
in responsible sourcing while aligning with 
global ESG standards and supporting its 
broader commitment to sustainable growth.

Pollution prevention and control is a pivotal 
opportunity for RACE to enhance 
environmental stewardship, comply with 
stringent regulations, and safeguard public 
health. By adopting advanced technologies 
and responsible practices, we minimize 
emissions, reduce waste, and fortify our 
market position. This commitment also 
fosters innovation and drives long-term 
sustainability, ensuring we meet stakeholder

By investing in educational initiatives and 
awareness campaigns on waste 
management for employees and value chain 
partners, the organization reinforces its role 
as a responsible corporate citizen, creates 
positive social impact, and strengthens 
stakeholder relationships.  
Over the years, Race has consistently 
supported underprivileged communities—
providing monthly food distribution to 
nearly 300 laborers, ragpickers and 
marginalized groups each month for many 
years, while also sponsoring the education of 
six children of the same marginalized groups. 
The company also places continuous 
emphasis on enhancing health and safety 
standards across its offices, ensuring a 
secure, healthy, and productive work 
environment.  
These initiatives demonstrate Race’s 
commitment to holistic employee well-being 
and sustainable organizational growth. By 
prioritizing employee experience and 
workplace safety, the company further 
strengthens its reputation as an employer of

ESG 
Governanc
e 
Risk 
ESG governance is integral to maintaining 
stakeholder trust and achieving sustainable 
growth. Inadequate governance in 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
practices can expose the organization to 
reputational damage, regulatory penalties, 
and operational inefficiencies. Moreover, 
failure to effectively manage ESG risks may 
lead to decreased investor confidence and 
hinder long-term strategic objectives. 
Regular audits and 
assessments ensure 
adherence to ESG 
standards and identify 
areas for improvement. 
Additionally, engaging 
stakeholders and 
integrating their feedback 
into ESG strategies help 
enhance transparency 
and effectiveness. 
Negative 
 
Failure to address ESG 
governance gaps can lead 
to regulatory penalties and 
reputational damage. This 
may also increase 
compliance costs and raise 
the bank’s cost of capital.

Specific commitments, goals and targets set 
by the entity with defined timelines, if any. 
Below are our ESG Targets to be achieved within the next 4-5 Years by taking 2023 as the base year :- 
Target 1: ESG assessment of 10 suppliers and continue to give our consistent efforts for more suppliers. 
Target 2: Training & Education of 10 suppliers on sustainable business practices continue to give our consistent 
efforts. 
Target 3: Supporting 5* beneficiaries through our intended CSR initiatives. 
Target 4: Improving our employee coverage to 100% in our health, training & development (prepare long term plan) 
Target 5: Improving our workforce gender diversity year on year. 
Target 6: Improving our Board composition & diversity year on year. 
Target 7: Setting up ESG Committee for decision-making on sustainability-related issues, implementing & overseeing 
the business responsibility. 
 
Our company, RACE ECO Chain (Formerly Anisha Impex), was incorporated in the year 1999, marking almost 24 
years of operations (considering year 2023 as base year). As we align this goal with our tenure, our target will 
correspond to each year of our successful journey. 
6 
Performance of the entity against the specific 
commitments, goals and targets along-with 
reasons in case the same are not met 
As our base year of 2023, following are targets we achieved with the reasons mentioned below. 
1. For Target 1 & 2- We have recognized and prioritized our value chain partners based on their level of engagement 
with RACE and accordingly refined our ESG assessment targets to ensure more effective implementation. To 
strengthen this process, sustainability checks for our suppliers have been developed, and ESG assessments will be 
progressively extended to cover a larger segment of our value chain partners over the next 3–4 years. While 
independent third-party assessments will continue to play a key role, we also plan to initiate internal ESG 
assessments in the near future, thereby creating a robust framework for continuous improvement and long-term 
sustainability. 
3. For Target 2 & 3- By investing in educational initiatives and awareness campaigns on waste management for 
employees and value chain partners, the organization reinforces its role as a responsible corporate citizen, creates 
positive social impact, and strengthens stakeholder relationships.  
Over the years, Race has consistently supported underprivileged communities—providing monthly food distribution 
to nearly 300 labourers, ragpickers and marginalized groups each month for many years, while also sponsoring the 
education of six children of the same marginalized groups. 
The company also places continuous emphasis on enhancing health and safety standards across its offices, ensuring 
a secure, healthy, and productive work environment.  
4. All our employees are 100% covered under insurance, and we are committed to maintaining this achievement. 
Ongoing efforts are focused on strengthening accessibility and ensuring continued comprehensive coverage for our 
workforce. 
5. Our female workforce representation has increased significantly from 14% to 58% over the past year. We remain 
committed to strengthening workforce diversity through inclusive hiring practices and by fostering equal 
opportunities for all employees. 
6. The minimum requirement is to have at least one woman director on the Board. We are pleased to confirm that 
this requirement is duly met, ensuring compliance with statutory obligations. While our board diversity remains 
consistent with last year, we maintain a well-balanced composition that reflects varied expertise and experience. 
Our Board comprises a Chartered Accountant who is actively engaged in overseeing day-to-day financial operations, 
including regular review and monitoring of financial transactions for accuracy and compliance. We also benefit from 
the perspective of a Non-Executive Director with extensive experience in sales, general management, and strategies 
within the software and technology domain. In addition, one of our Directors is a seasoned entrepreneur and a 
recognized Quality Control Expert, leading a state-of-the-art export house catering to global markets in fabrics and 
related segments. 
This diverse mix of professionals, along with an appropriate balance of Executive, Non-Executive, and a majority of

Before onboarding, each supplier undergoes a proper KYC verification and site visit by the Race team.  
Segregation & Baling Process 
• 
Collected PET bottles are segregated into Natural, White, Green, and Multi categories before baling process 
begins. 
• 
The bottles are then compressed in baling machines to form bales (150–350 kgs each), with deliveries 
ranging from a minimum of 5–15 tons to an average of 10–20 tons. 
Purchase Order & Demand Cycle 
• 
Recyclers issue Purchase Orders (POs) with rates and demand in tons, which are subject to change every 2–
3 days. 
• 
These rates are communicated to the Procurement Team, and interested suppliers coordinate based on 
their ability to fulfill the demand. 
• 
Post the order, a vendor code is generated for the respective procurement member with their respective 
suppliers

• 
At dispatch, documentation is verified by the Accounts Team, including E-way Bill, Geo-tagged truck photo, 
Invoice, Weighing Slip, and LR. 
Quality Check & Debit Notes 
• 
Recyclers conduct random sampling to check for moisture, dust, contamination, or material mixing. 
• 
In case of defects, a Debit Note (DN) is issued and shared with the supplier; deductions are made upon 
acceptance as per agreement. 
Payment & Compliance 
• 
Before releasing payments, the Operations Team verifies pending GST liabilities for each supplier. 
• 
Payments are released only after compliance is confirmed. If goods are rejected during quality checks, the 
material is returned to the supplier. 
Continuous Operations 
 This procurement and recycling cycle is ongoing for both Biofuel and PET plastic, ensuring continuous supply chain.

Leadership Indicators

Provide the processes for consultation 
between stakeholders and the Board 
on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is

At RACE, our approach for consultation begins with proactive stakeholder engagement, involving consultation 
rounds where stakeholders provide valuable feedback on key issues. This feedback is compiled and reported to 
our ESG Coordinating Group, led by senior executives and including site heads across various locations. This 
group plays a crucial role in facilitating ESG governance and ensuring that stakeholder perspectives meets our 
strategic decisions. 
The ESG Coordinating Group works closely with relevant functions to align Company's approach with critical 
ESG topics. 
It develops and approves annual ESG work-plans, reviews policy proposals related to ESG matters, and ensures 
ongoing communication with the Board regarding ESG activities and performance. 
At the Board level, RACE provides essential oversight on ESG matters, integrating ESG risks and opportunities 
into our long-term strategy. They monitor progress against set milestones, ensuring that our ESG initiatives are 
aligned with Company policies, purposes, and stakeholder interests.

used to support the identification and 
management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No).  
If so, provide details of instances as to 
how the inputs received from 
stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and 
activities of the entity.  
Yes; RACE actively engages various stakeholders to shape its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
strategies, ensuring transparency and sustainable practices across our operations. We consult regularly with 
communities, customers, employees, and regulators to gather valuable insights on environmental and social 
impacts. 
These inputs drive improvements in waste management, renewable energy adoption, and corporate social 
responsibility initiatives. Our ESG Coordinating Group integrates these perspectives into strategic decisions, 
aligning with evolving expectations and regulatory requirements. By fostering open dialogue, RACE reinforces 
its commitment to ethical governance, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility.

to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder 
groups.  
RACE conducts regular consultations with local communities in areas of operation, particularly focusing on 
vulnerable and marginalized groups to understand their environmental, social, and economic concerns. 
Through these engagements, issues such as waste management, access to clean energy, and community 
development needs were identified. 
 
In response, RACE implemented community-focused waste management initiatives, promoted renewable 
energy solutions to reduce environmental impact, and enhanced CSR programs targeting education, skill 
development, and healthcare for underprivileged groups. These actions ensure that stakeholder feedback 
directly informs ESG strategies, reinforcing inclusivity and long-term positive impact.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details.  
To strengthen our sustainability practices, we have 
introduced Electric Vehicles (EVs) into our operations. We 
started this initiative with the deployment of a Tata Ace 1-
ton EV at one of our centers, dedicated to the collection of 
plastic PET bottles. This marks our first step in transitioning 
to low-emission logistics solutions. The use of EVs reduces 
our carbon footprint, lowers dependency on fossil fuels, and 
contributes to a cleaner urban environment. By integrating 
EVs into plastic waste collection, we are aligning waste 
management with green mobility. The initiative has also 
improved operational efficiency and reduced collection costs 
compared to conventional vehicles. The PET bottles collected 
through this program are processed for recycling, supporting 
our circular economy efforts. While this is a pilot 
deployment, it provides valuable insights for scaling EV 
adoption across more centers. In the coming years, we plan 
to expand this model, gradually building a larger EV fleet to 
maximize environmental and social benefits. This initiative 
reflects our commitment to responsible business, climate-
conscious operations, and long-term sustainable growth.
