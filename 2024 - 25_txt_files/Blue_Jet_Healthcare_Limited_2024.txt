implementation 
of 
energy 
management 
systems 
can lead to more efficient 
use of resources, reducing 
waste and lowering energy 
consumption. By prioritizing 
energy 
management, 
the 
company is able to meet 
regulatory requirements while 
also reducing the operational 
cost and its carbon footprint
2
Waste 
and Water 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
The 
company’s 
operations 
require 
substantial 
water 
input 
and 
generate 
significant 
waste, both of which present 
material environmental and 
regulatory risks. Inadequate 
management 
of 
these 
resources may also result 
in 
non-compliance 
with 
environmental 
regulations. 
Effective waste and water 
management 
is 
critical 
to 
support 
operational 
continuity, 
cost 
efficiency, 
and the company’s broader 
environmental 
and 
social 
responsibilities.
Opportunity: 
As 
the 
company 
continues 
to 
scale, 
effective 
waste 
and 
water 
management 
will play a crucial role in 
controlling 
operational 
costs, 
ensuring 
regulatory 
compliance, 
and 
meeting 
sustainability 
objectives. 
By 
adopting 
innovative 
solutions such as waste-to-
energy 
technologies 
and 
water 
recycling 
systems, 
the company can reduce 
expenses, improve resource 
efficiency, and strengthen its 
reputation.
The 
Company 
regularly 
evaluates 
environmentally friendly 
materials and processes 
to minimize reliance on 
hazardous 
substances, 
while 
enforcing 
strict 
controls 
for 
the 
safe 
handling, storage, and 
disposal of chemicals in 
its operations.
Waste Management:
•	 The 
Company 
collaborates 
with 
authorized 
vendors 
specializing 
in 
recycling and disposal 
services 
to 
ensure 
waste 
is 
collected, 
segregated, 
and 
properly disposed of.
•	 Strict 
waste 
m a n a g e m e n t 
practices 
are 
implemented 
across 
all business operations, 
with recyclable waste 
directed to certified 
recycling vendors.
Negative: 
legal 
penalties, reputational 
damage, 
non-
compliance.
Positive: 
reduced 
w a s t e - r e l a t e d 
expenses, 
reduced 
operational 
cost 
through 
optimize 
water usage

•	 Hazardous 
waste 
is 
managed 
and 
disposed 
of 
in 
compliance 
with 
regulatory 
requirements 
to 
prevent environmental 
and public harm.
•	 A focus on reducing 
chemical waste has 
led to the adoption 
of 
environmentally 
friendly 
materials 
and a reduction in 
the use of harmful 
chemicals in products 
and 
manufacturing 
processes.
Water Management:
•	 The 
Company 
has 
installed 
a 
high-
capacity 
Effluent 
Treatment 
Plant 
(ETP), 
Multi-Effect 
Evaporation 
(MEE) 
plant, 
and 
Reverse 
Osmosis (RO) plants 
at its facilities.
•	 The 
majority 
of 
wastewater 
undergoes 
rigorous 
treatment 
before 
being 
recycled 
for 
use in utility processes 
such as cooling towers 
and boilers, minimizing 
water 
discharge 
quantities.

GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions 
pose 
several 
significant 
risks 
to 
the 
company. As energy costs 
rise 
and 
carbon 
pricing 
mechanisms become more 
prevalent the company may 
face increased operational 
expenses 
impacting 
profitability.
To mitigate greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions, 
the 
company 
has 
implemented several key 
measures:
•	 Commissioned on-site 
solar and wind power 
plants 
to 
reduce 
reliance 
on 
non-
renewable 
energy 
sources
Negative: 
Increased 
operational 
cost,

Climate 
change 
also 
heightens the risk of extreme 
weather events, which can 
damage 
infrastructure, 
disrupt supply chains, and 
delay 
product 
delivery. 
Stricter emissions regulations 
pose 
legal 
and 
financial 
risks for non-compliance. By 
proactively addressing these 
challenges, the company can 
reduce operational, physical 
and regulatory risk.
•	 Implemented 
a 
system for monitoring 
boiler 
efficiency 
and 
introduced 
an 
automatic 
coal 
combustion 
control 
mechanism. Resulting 
in a 5–8% reduction in 
emissions.

Product 
Quality and 
safety
Risk
Product quality and safety 
represent 
a 
critical 
area 
of risk due to the direct 
impact these factors have 
on patient health, regulatory 
compliance, and business 
continuity. Any deviation from 
established quality standards 
can result in serious health 
consequences, 
triggering 
product recalls, regulatory 
sanctions, and legal liabilities. 
Incidents involving product 
defects or safety concerns 
can severely damage the 
company’s 
reputation, 
erode 
stakeholder 
trust, 
and attract adverse media 
attention. 
Non-compliance 
with 
stringent 
regulatory 
requirements can also restrict 
market 
access, 
limiting 
growth 
opportunities 
and 
threatening the long-term 
sustainability of the business. 
Therefore, maintaining the 
highest standards of product 
quality and safety is essential 
to protect patients, uphold 
regulatory compliance, and 
preserve 
the 
company’s 
operational and reputational 
integrity.
The 
Company 
has 
adopted 
the 
following 
mitigation measures to 
address product quality 
and safety risks:
•	 Commitment 
to 
maintaining 
the 
highest standards of 
product quality and 
safety in all operations.
•	 Implementation 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
Quality Management 
System 
(QMS) 
to 
ensure 
consistent 
quality. The company 
has also achieved ISO 
9001 certification
•	 The company has also 
achieved USFDA and 
Good 
Management 
Practices certification 
to ensure that product 
quality is as per the 
expected standards.

By 
embracing 
a 
diverse 
workforce, 
the 
Company 
taps into a broad range of 
perspectives, 
experiences, 
and 
ideas 
that 
foster 
creativity

innovation. 
This 
inclusive 
approach 
is 
essential

and 
also contributes to improved 
decision-making processes. 
Prioritizing D&I initiatives has 
been 
shown 
to 
enhance 
employee 
engagement 
and 
satisfaction, 
as 
individuals feel valued and 
respected 
regardless 
of 
their background. This, in 
turn, leads to lower turnover 
rates, reduced recruitment 
costs, and a more stable 
workforce. The Company’s

resilience and alignment with 
corporate values.
•	 The

Permanent workers
A dedicated channel for employees and workers to promptly address and 
resolve their grievances is established. Concerns raised through these channels 
are managed by the appropriate authority within specified timelines.
The Company has instituted a grievance redressal policy to facilitate the 
reporting of grievances. The process involves several key steps:
•	
Grievance Identification: Grievances are received and acknowledged by 
the designated authority.
•	
Preliminary Assessment: An initial assessment is conducted to determine 
the nature and severity of the grievance.
•	
Redressal Procedure Initiation: An informal discussion or mediation is 
attempted to resolve the grievance at the earliest stage. If unresolved, a 
formal grievance procedure is initiated.
•	
Decision Making and Implementation of Actions: A review of the grievance 
is conducted by a designated committee or panel, and an action plan is 
decided based on the findings.
•	
Follow-up and Monitoring: The implementation of actions is monitored, 
and follow-up is done to ensure all steps are taken, decisions made, and 
outcomes achieved. The case is closed after these are ensured.
Employees and stakeholders can submit their grievances through dedicated 
channels, including phone, email, or postal address. Designated Points of Contact 
(PoCs) assess the grievances and determine the need for further inquiry or 
investigation within one week. Anonymous complaints are handled with respect 
for anonymity, and frivolous grievances are promptly rejected with reasons 
provided. Validated complaints are officially registered and documented, 
maintaining transparency and accountability. Efforts are made to resolve 
grievances within 60 days, with regular updates provided to complainants to 
ensure transparency and maintain stakeholder confidence.
For effective grievance handling, the Company has established a grievance 
redressal committee and also offers direct meetings with HR, an anonymous 
online submission portal, and a dedicated hotline, ensuring prompt and private 
communication.

any) and on significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and 
working conditions.
	
In the event of any safety-related incidents, thorough investigations are conducted, and corrective 
measures are promptly implemented through updates to the SOP.
	
To proactively identify and evaluate potential risks associated with its operations, the Company utilizes 
industry-standard tools such as Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Hazard and Operability 
Study (Hazop), and maintains an Aspect-Impact Register. These tools help in identifying potential hazards 
and assessing risks systematically, ensuring a proactive approach to safety management.
	
The Company conducts periodic safety drills to raise awareness of health and safety practices among 
employees, enhancing their preparedness for emergency situations. The implementation of Corrective 
Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) procedures is central to addressing safety-related incidents and 
mitigating significant risks identified through health and safety assessments:
	
1.	
CAPA Reports for Safety Incidents: In response to safety-related incidents, the Company promptly 
initiates CAPA reports. These reports document incident details, perform root cause analysis, 
and outline corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence. The Company emphasizes thorough 
investigation and implementation of corrective measures to enhance workplace safety.
	
2.	
Addressing Significant Risks and Concerns: Health and safety assessments conducted by the 
Company’s internal safety team and external auditors identify significant risks and concerns. 
Upon assessment findings, the Company prioritizes addressing critical areas requiring improvement 
to enhance health and safety practices and working conditions.
	
3.	
Ongoing Corrective Actions: The Company is committed to continuous improvement in health 
and safety. It systematically reviews CAPA reports and assesses outcomes to implement ongoing 
corrective actions. This proactive approach ensures that safety-related incidents are addressed 
comprehensively, and risks are mitigated effectively.
	
A corrective action has been initiated to strengthen the work permit system. This involves implementing 
a clear and standardized work permit procedure, ensuring that all high-risk tasks are properly assessed 
and authorized before work begins. Additionally, all personnel responsible for issuing and receiving 
permits will undergo certification to confirm their understanding of the process and associated safety 
requirements. This measure aims to improve hazard control, enhance communication, and prevent 
future incidents by ensuring that only trained and competent individuals manage permit-to-work

the accused are respected. The goal is to establish facts and arrive at a fair outcome, free from bias or 
undue influence.

confidentiality. Information is shared only with individuals who are directly involved in the resolution 
process, and strict safeguards are in place to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. This protects

50
Blue Jet Healthcare Ltd.  |  Annual Report 2024-25
	
Mechanisms to Receive and Redress Grievances
	
The grievance redressal procedure involves several steps to ensure that each complaint is handled 
efficiently and fairly:
	
1.	
Grievance Identification: Stakeholders are encouraged to submit their grievances through 
dedicated channels, including phone, email, and post. Once a grievance is received, it is promptly 
acknowledged by the designated authority.
	
2.	
Preliminary Assessment: Upon receipt of the grievance, the designated Point of Contact (PoC) 
assesses its nature and severity to determine the appropriate course of action. This helps in identifying 
whether the grievance requires an immediate resolution or further investigation.
	
3.	
Redressal Procedure Initiation: At the initial stage, Blue Jet Healthcare attempts to resolve grievances 
through informal discussions or mediation. If the issue remains unresolved, a formal grievance procedure is 
initiated, involving further investigation and assessment by the designated committee.
	
4.	
Decision Making and Implementation of Actions: The grievance is reviewed by a designated 
panel, which determines an action plan based on the findings. Any necessary corrective actions or 
resolutions are then implemented in a timely manner.
	
5.	
Follow-up and Monitoring: Once actions have been implemented, regular follow-up is conducted 
to ensure that all decisions are being carried out and that the desired outcomes are achieved. 
The case is only closed once all necessary actions have been completed and the stakeholder’s 
concerns have been satisfactorily addressed.
	
6.	
Regular Updates to Complainants: Throughout the process, stakeholders receive regular updates 
on the status of their complaints. These updates are crucial to maintaining transparency, ensuring that 
complainants are aware of the steps being taken and the progress of their case. This ongoing communication 
helps build trust and confidence in the grievance redressal system.
	
7.	
Anonymity and Rejection of Frivolous Grievances: Blue Jet Healthcare respects the anonymity of
