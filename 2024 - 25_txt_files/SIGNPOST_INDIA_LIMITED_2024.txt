1
Billboard 
Size 
Optimization
O
Our focus is primarily on transit-
based advertising formats, 
including buses, metro areas, 
and bus stops. Unlike traditional 
large-scale billboards, which 
pose potential risks of 
structural failure, our limited use 
of only small to medium-sized 
displays significantly reduces 
such hazards.
NA
Positive
2
Eco-friendly 
Printing 
Practices
O
Sustainability is embedded 
in our operations through the 
adoption of environmentally 
safe inks in printing. This 
ensures that each visual 
communication reinforces our 
commitment to responsible 
practices, benefiting both 
audiences and the planet.
NA
Positive
3
Disposal of 
Electronic 
Waste
R
With digital media forming 
the core of our asset 
portfolio, e-waste generation 
is an unavoidable concern. 
Inadequate disposal practices 
can result in ecological 
damage due to the presence 
of toxic substances, potential 
regulatory non-compliance, 
and reputational harm. A well-
defined, compliant e-waste 
management plan is essential 
to minimize these threats.
We ensure responsible disposal 
of electronic components 
and promote reuse of digital 
billboards wherever possible 
to minimise e-waste. By 
prioritising asset reuse we aim 
to manage the environmental 
impact associated with our 
digital media infrastructure.

Protection 
of  
Consumer 
Data
R
Given our use of data analytics 
to understand market dynamics 
and consumer patterns, 
safeguarding personal data is 
critical. Large-scale collection 
and processing of sensitive 
information, if mishandled, 
could expose the business 
to regulatory fines, erosion of 
brand credibility, and diminished 
consumer trust.
To address these vulnerabilities, 
we’ve instituted robust 
privacy governance, aligning 
all data handling procedures 
with applicable regulations. 
Comprehensive monitoring, 
breach prevention mechanisms, 
and policy updates are in place 
to ensure legal compliance and 
protect user information.

no negative

Ethical 
Standards in 
Advertising
R
Preserving integrity in 
advertising is key to long-
term stakeholder confidence. 
Deceptive or unethical 
campaigns can result in 
consumer backlash, penalties 
from authorities, and sustained 
reputational damage. As 
regulatory and consumer 
demands for transparency 
rise, upholding ethical 
communication becomes 
imperative.
We adhere strictly to ethical 
norms across all promotional 
activities. Periodic reviews 
and realignment of advertising 
strategies are carried out 
to comply with changing 
regulations and maintain 
consumer confidence through 
truthful and clear messaging.

Workforce 
Diversity & 
Inclusion
O
A diverse and inclusive 
workforce positions us to 
innovate better, solve problems 
more effectively, and cater 
to a broader customer base. 
Promoting inclusion helps in 
attracting high-calibre talent, 
boosting morale, and creating a 
workplace culture that mirrors 
our customer demographics, 
ultimately leading to 
competitive advantage.

2.	 Whether the entity has translated 
the policy into procedures.  
(Yes/No)
Yes
3.	 Do the enlisted policies extend to 
their value chain partners? (Yes/No)
The Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) Policy (P1, P7), Vigil mechanism/
Whistleblower policy (P1, P5) and the Policy on prevention of sexual harassment 
of women (P5) extend to value chain partners as well. 
4.	 Name of the national and 
international codes/certifications/
labels/standards (e.g. Forest 
Stewardship Council, Fairtrade, 
Rainforest Alliance, Trustea) 
standards (e.g. SA 8000, OHSAS, 
ISO, BIS) adopted by your entity and 
mapped to each principle.
Our organization follows the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System 
standard, a globally recognized benchmark for maintaining consistent quality 
in products and services. This certification underscores the importance of 
strong management practices and a customer-focused approach, aiming to 
improve customer satisfaction by fulfilling requirements and driving continuous 
process improvement. (P1, P3, P5, P9)
5.	 Specific commitments, goals and 
targets set by the entity with defined 
timelines, if any.
As part of our ESG journey, we are committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 
2040. To realize this goal, we have made strategic investments in sustainable 
technologies and practices. A major milestone in this journey has been the 
conversion of 95% of our illuminated media assets to energy-efficient LED 
technology. The Company has also adopted smart timers and digital display 
screens in place of traditional flex and solvent-based signage. This transition 
has supported greater energy efficiency and helped reduce e-waste, contributing 
to an estimated annual savings of 280,000 kg of CO2e. This transition not 
only reflects our dedication to minimizing environmental impact but has also 
significantly enhanced energy efficiency and contributed to a measurable 
reduction in our carbon footprint.
6.	 Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals 
and targets along-with reasons in

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
	
At Signpost, we continue to grow with the understanding that our success is most meaningful when it creates value 
beyond business. Our work is guided by a sense of responsibility toward the communities we engage with and the 
environment we operate in. Whether through environmental measures or social impact efforts, our goal has always 
been to ensure that our actions leave a positive and lasting impression. The impact we have seen so far reinforces 
our belief that even thoughtful, incremental steps can create real change.
	
Looking ahead, we remain focused on building with purpose. We believe that integrity, care, and awareness must be 
at the core of everything we do. As the world continues to evolve, we see an opportunity to contribute in ways that 
are relevant, responsible, and aligned with long-term progress. Our approach will continue to be shaped by the values

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
Yes, the Company has undertaken several initiatives aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Smart meters
have been installed to monitor and optimize lighting and service hours, reducing unnecessary electricity consumption and
lowering associated indirect emissions. Additionally, water dispensers have replaced single-use packaged water bottles,
helping to reduce plastic waste and emissions linked to the production and transport of bottled water.
The Company also uses smart timers and digital display screens instead of traditional flex or solvent-based media, resulting
in an estimated annual savings of 2,80,000 kg CO2e (280 tonnes CO2e per year). This shift not only contributes to lower
emissions but also significantly reduces plastic waste and the use of hazardous inks and dyes.
