c. A brief on types of customers:
The Company’s market segment has been identified based on broad segments which are in line with the long-
term strategic objectives of the Company and majority of sales from the operations are made within India. 
The Company operates within a Business to Business (B2B) framework, serving industrial customers who utilize its 
manganese and iron ores. These customers are primarily involved in the manufacturing of steel products and other 
allied products for end consumers. 
The main types of customers include:
Steel manufacturers: These are industrial companies, such as steel mills, that use the Company’s iron and 
manganese ores as raw materials to produce steel products. They range from integrated steel plants to other 
producers creating steel for various applications.
Ferroalloy producers: These customers rely on the Company’s manganese ore to manufacture ferroalloys, which 
are critical additives used in steel production to enhance properties like strength and durability.
While steel manufacturers and ferroalloy producers form the core customer base, the Company may also cater to 
other industrial manufacturers who use manganese or iron ores in their processes, though the primary focus remains 
on the steel production sector.

awareness 
sessions 
on 
responsible supply chain practices, engaging 
approximately 125 suppliers in the Financial Year 
2024-25.  This effort reflects a strong commitment 
to sustainability and accountability throughout 
the supply chain.
The 
Company’s 
initiatives 
demonstrate 
a 
proactive stance in aligning with the NGRBC 
principles, ensuring that safety, ethical practices, 
and supply chain responsibility are prioritized 
across its value chain.
2. Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of 
the Board? (Yes/No). If Yes, provide details of the same.

2. a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? 
Yes. The Company is committed to responsible and sustainable procurement practices that align with the 
Company’s sustainability framework. The Company prioritize sourcing from vendors with recognized sustainability 
programs and establish a Chain of Custody to ensure traceability and responsible sourcing of input materials.
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
Mining operations do not require sourcing of any raw material. The Company practices sustainable procurement 
in line with all suppliers, vendors and input materials. In the case of ferroalloys production, the major portion (about 
85%) of strategic raw material like manganese ore is from captive mines and is transported through road. In the 
case of coke production, 100% of strategic raw material which is coking coal is sourced through importing from 
different countries. The sustainable sourcing procedure adopted for coking coal procurement is by placing orders 
well in advance to schedule discharge of shipments and transportation through trucks/trains to meet consumption 
requirements. Sourcing of materials other than raw materials are from various sources.

3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste.
Hazardous Waste:
The Company has obtained authorization from Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) under the 
Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 for generation, storage 
and safe disposal of the following type of hazardous wastes:
•	
Category 5.1 used waste oil and
•	
Category 5.2 oil-soaked cotton waste.
Used waste oil and oil-soaked cotton waste generated during maintenance of machinery and vehicles is 
flammable. Hence, these wastes are hazardous in nature.
The Company has well defined SOPs for generation, storage and safe disposal of hazardous waste. All waste oil 
generated in the manufacturing process is collected through drain ports and stored in leak proof drum before 
being disposed off to agencies duly authorized for recycling.

yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan

into the organization’s medium and long-term strategy and planning exercises. This also enables the Company to 
promote the idea of shared growth and a common prosperous future for the society at large. The Company has 
formal mechanisms in place to engage key stakeholder groups in a constructive manner and collect valuable 
feedback, including on areas that are under the purview of the NGRBC Principles. This proves to be a valuable
