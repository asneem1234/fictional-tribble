6. Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
worker?
Yes/No
(If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
Yes 
The Company has a grievance policy so that employees have a way to convey 
issues related to their employment. The Policy makes sure that these complaints are 
resolved swiftly, fairly, and impartially in accordance with the Organization's policies. 
This comprises employee concerns about a supervisor's, another employee's, or 
Management's behaviour, inaction, or proposed action in relation to them. According 
to the policy's grievance redress mechanism, the first step in addressing any 
problem is to speak directly to the other party about the grievance. If consultation 
is unsatisfactory or impossible for whatever reason, the employee may speak to 
their next-level supervisor. If the grievance is still not resolved at the Department 
or Second Level, the HR Head of the Site will speak directly with the other party 
to try to address the situation. Even if the issue goes unresolved, the director will 
be involved to settle the complaints and will try every option at his command. The 
policy can be access at https://www.heranba.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/
