Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social

S. No Material issue

whether

Opportunity
Rationale for identifying

In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate
Financial implications 
of the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive & negative 
implications)
1.
Affordable 
Housing- 
Lending to 
Lower and 
middle income 
customers with 
undocumented 
income.
Opportunity & 
Risk
Opportunity: Affordable 
housing has become a 
pressing need of the hour. 
The government has taken 
on the role of a facilitator, 
making this sector an 
attractive opportunity 
for private developers 
by introducing various 
incentives and schemes 
over the years.
Risk:
The Company primarily 
focuses on serving 
lower and middle-
level customers from 
underserved and 
unserved regions, where 
a significant portion 
of the population has 
unrecorded income.
The Company employs robust 
customer assessment standards 
to effectively manage risks. Risk 
mitigation strategies include 
verifying credit histories through 
credit risk information bureaus and 
assessing the probability of default, 
among other measures. 
The Company has consistently 
maintained a delinquency 
percentage lower than the industry 
average, particularly within the 
affordable segment. Additionally, 
the use of conservative loan-to-
value parameters, combined with 
rigorous customer assessment 
standards, further strengthens its 
ability to mitigate credit risk.
Positive: India’s urban 
population is projected to 
double between 2018 and 
2050, accompanied by 
an increase in per capita 
income and the growing 
trend of nuclear families. 
These factors create 
significant opportunities 
for the Company within the 
Affordable Housing sector.
Negative: However, the 
absence of documented 
income history poses 
challenges in assessing 
customers’ ability to maintain 
stable income in the future.

Financial implications

(Indicate positive & negative

2.
Financial 
and Digital 
Inclusion
Opportunity
The Company views 
financial and digital 
inclusion as a significant 
opportunity to broaden 
its reach, improve 
customer engagement, 
and make its services 
accessible to underserved 
communities, thereby 
promoting social equity.
The Company is steadily extending 
its reach, making deeper inroads 
into semi-urban and rural areas 
across India. It has also initiated a 
digital transformation by integrating 
Salesforce and Oracle into its 
systems. Additionally, the launch 
of the ‘Go Green Initiative’ marks 
a pivotal step towards adopting 
advanced technology to reduce 
paper usage in the loan processing 
workflow. The Company has 
initiated a pilot phase for E-signing 
in its loan documentation process.
Positive: Emphasizing 
financial and digital inclusion 
not only democratizes access 
to finance, enabling wider 
sections of the population 
to engage in the economy, 
but also fosters personalized 
and efficient service delivery, 
ultimately enhancing 
customer satisfaction.
3.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion (DEI)
Opportunity
The Company is 
distinctively poised 
to lead in DEI, as its 
commitment to fostering 
a diverse and inclusive 
work culture reflects 
the diversity of its 
clientele. This alignment 
positions the Company 
for greater relevance in 
the affordable market 
and supports long-term 
growth.
The Company has implemented 
inclusive hiring strategies to 
recruit talent from various 
genders, cultural backgrounds, 
qualifications, and age groups. It 
also provides tailored mentorship 
programs, guarantees equal pay 
for equal work, and enforces fair 
promotion policies to retain and 
support its diverse workforce.
Positive: A workplace 
centered on DEI fosters a 
strong sense of belonging 
and mutual respect, boosting 
employee morale and 
satisfaction. Additionally, 
diverse teams contribute a 
wide range of perspectives 
and ideas, driving innovative 
solutions to complex financial 
challenges.
4.
Climate 
Change
Risk
Organizations involved in providing affordable housing finance face diverse risks associated 
with climate change. The Company acknowledges the environmental challenges linked to its 
lending and underwriting practices, while also identifying opportunities to address climate 
change by supporting sustainable projects and home loans.
(a)
Physical Risk
Risk
Occurrence of extreme 
weather events like 
rising sea levels, floods, 
cyclones, tsunami etc.
The Company boasts a well-
diversified portfolio spanning 
various geographies and segments, 
complemented by the digitization 
of its loan process and the 
adoption of a Business Continuity 
Management Policy (BCMP).
Negative: The potential 
erosion of capital, coupled 
with damage to infrastructure 
and assets, could result in 
financial losses for both the 
Company and its clients.
(b)
Transition Risk
 Risk
Evolving regulatory 
frameworks and climate 
change policies may 
impose restrictions on 
business and financing 
activities that have 
either direct or indirect 
negative effects on the 
environment.
The Company is actively working 
to minimize its direct and indirect 
environmental impacts by 
optimizing resource consumption, 
promoting sustainable and 
digitized operations through the ‘Go 
Green Initiative,’ fostering Green 
Offices/Branches, and building an 
ecosystem to support financing 
Green Affordable Housing.
Negative: The risk of asset 
devaluation for properties 
that fail to meet sustainable 
standards.
Rising operational expenses 
due to the need to adjust 
investment strategies in 
response to evolving market 
demands and regulatory 
requirements.
Higher compliance costs as 
environmental regulations 
become increasingly 
stringent.

5.
Green Self-
Built Housing
Opportunity
The Company offers loans 
for the construction of 
eco-friendly homes and 
assists its customers in 
creating housing solutions 
that are both sustainable 
and affordable.
The Company is actively fostering 
the development of a Green Home 
ecosystem by engaging with 
employees, customers, masons, 
contractors, and others. It raises 
awareness about the advantages 
of green homes through various 
channels, including direct calls, 
SMS, WhatsApp messages, 
workshops, training sessions, 
social media platforms, brochures, 
and educational short films. The 
Company has conducted three 
Green samvaad during the financial 
year.
Positive: Loans for self-built 
housing have brought a 
sustainability aspect to our 
value chain, positioning us 
as trailblazers in promoting 
the concept of sustainable 
construction for self-built 
homes within the Indian 
Housing Finance sector.
6.
Community 
Wellbeing and 
Social Impact
Opportunity
Participating in social 
welfare initiatives not only 
strengthens a Company’s 
corporate goodwill and 
social reputation but 
also fosters a deeper 
connection with the 
community’s sentiments 
and aspirations. This bond 
ultimately supports the 
Company’s long-term 
sustainable growth.
The Company recognizes the 
importance of social responsibility 
and its potential to create a 
positive impact on people’s lives. 
To implement its Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, it 
partners with Aavas Foundation 
and other implementing 
organizations.
Positive: Engaging in social 
activities fosters a positive 
reputation and cultivates 
public trust.

the International Auditing and Assurance Standards 
Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan and 
perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about 
whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free 
from material misstatement.
12.	 A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance 
with ISAE 3000 involves assessing the suitability in the 
circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as 
the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information, identifying areas where material misstatement 
is likely to arise in the Identified Sustainability Information 
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing 
procedures to address identified risk areas as necessary in 
the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation 
of the Identified Sustainability Information.
13.	 A limited assurance engagement is substantially less 
in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including 
an understanding of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.

14.	 The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, 
evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing 
or reconciling with underlying records.
15.	 Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures listed above, we:
	
•	
Performed walkthrough and discussion with individual 
data owners for understanding business processes, 
data management processes, and to verify data 
and documents;
	
•	
Carried out discussions at the corporate office for 
data and document verification;
	
•	
Interviewed senior executives to understand the 
reporting process, governance, systems and controls 
in place during the reporting period.
	
•	
Reviewed the records and relevant documentation 
including information from audited financial 
statements or statutory reports submitted by 
the Company to support relevant performance 
disclosures within our scope.
	
•	
Evaluated the suitability and application of the Criteria 
and that the Criteria have been applied appropriately 
to the subject matter.
	
•	
Selected key parameters and representative 
sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables 
and agreeing claims to source information to check 
accuracy and completeness of claims such as source 
data, meter data, etc.
	
•	
Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of 
claims,
	
•	
Reviewed data from independent sources, wherever 
available,
	
•	
Reviewed data, information about sustainability 
performance indicators and statements in the report.
	
•	
Reviewed and verified information/ data as per 
the Criteria;
	
•	
Reviewed accuracy, transparency and completeness 
of the information/ data provided;
16.	 The procedures performed in a limited assurance 
engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less 
in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a 
limited assurance engagement is substantially lower 
than the assurance that would have been obtained had 
we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance 
opinion about whether the Identified Sustainability 
Information have been prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the Criteria.
EXCLUSIONS:
17.	 Our limited assurance engagement scope excludes the 
following and therefore we do not express an opinion on 
the same:
	
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and data/information 
(qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information.
	
•	
Operations of the Company other than those 
mentioned in the Identified Sustainability Information 
section above
	
•	
Data and information outside the defined 
reporting period
	
•	
Data related to Company’s financial performance, 
strategy and other related linkages expressed in the 
Identified Sustainability Information.
	
•	
The Company’s statements that describe expression 
of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward 
looking statements provided by the Company and 
assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and 
other competitive issues.
	
•	
Mapping of the Identified Sustainability Information 
with reporting frameworks other than those 
mentioned in Criteria above.
	
•	
While we considered the effectiveness of 
management’s internal controls when determining 
the nature and extent of our procedures, our 
assurance engagement was not designed to provide 
assurance on internal controls.
	
•	
The procedures did not include testing controls 
or performing procedures relating to checking 
aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.
CONCLUSION
18.	 Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained and the information and 
explanations given to us along with the representation 
provided by the management, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Identified 
Sustainability Information included in the BRSR for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2025, is not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
