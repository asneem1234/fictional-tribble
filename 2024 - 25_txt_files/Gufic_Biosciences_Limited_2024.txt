DIRECTORS MESSAGE:
Dear Stakeholders,
It gives us great pleasure to present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for FY 2024–25, which reflects 
our continued commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles and the progress we have achieved in 
these areas.
We recognize the urgency of addressing climate change, resource efficiency and pollution control. To this end, we have set clear 
goals to reduce carbon emissions, conserve water, minimize waste and promote energy efficiency. All expired or defective 
products are disposed of responsibly at government-approved facilities, underscoring our focus on sustainable operations.
At Gufic, we are committed to leveraging innovation and manufacturing excellence to deliver safe, affordable and high-quality 
medicines, thereby serving the needs of patients and contributing to public health. Alongside this, we continue to build 
resilience by adopting green technologies, strengthening supply chain sustainability and aligning our practices with global 
sustainability standards.
Our governance framework emphasizes transparency, accountability and ethical conduct. We have strong mechanisms for 
grievance redressal and whistleblower protection and ESG performance is regularly reviewed at the Board level, ensuring 
alignment with regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations.
We also believe that business success must go hand in hand with social responsibility. This year, our CSR programs continued to 
support healthcare, education, rural development and animal welfare, while within the organization, we advanced employee 
welfare, diversity, inclusion and upskilling initiatives to foster a motivated and future-ready workforce.
Looking ahead, we will continue to formalize climate targets, strengthen social impact measures and integrate sustainability 
across business functions. Collaboration with stakeholders, regulators and industry peers will remain vital as we strive to create 
enduring value for society and the environment.

pertaining to environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to
 
adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its nancial implications, as per the following format:
Risk: 
Operating in the pharmaceutical industry 
requires strict compliance with regulations 
like cGMP, cGLP and other statutory 
requirements. Failure to meet these standards 
can result in reputational damage, business 
losses and potential legal consequences, 
including recalls and penalties. Non-
compliance with evolving regulations can also 
delay market approvals.
Opportunity: 
Adhering to regulatory standards not only
The Company maintains a robust quality 
assurance system and compliance monitoring 
framework to ensure strict adherence to 
regulations at every level. Regular employee 
training keeps the team updated on new 
developments, while well-dened Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and protocols 
must be followed consistently. Compliance 
processes are regularly reviewed and 
updated to align with evolving regulations and 
industry best practices. Given the high 
regulatory scrutiny in the pharmaceutical 
sector, which directly impacts public health, 
timely and accurate compliance is crucial for
Positive: 
Regulatory compliance not only strengthens 
the company’s reputation but also builds trust 
with customers, stakeholders and regulatory 
bodies. It facilitates entry into new markets 
and regions, accelerates approval processes 
and fosters stronger investor relationships by 
minimizing disruptions.
Negative: 
Non-compliance can severely damage the 
company’s reputation and threaten business 
continuity. Navigating complex and ever-
Risk: 
Non-compliance with strict pharmaceutical 
regulations and product defects can lead to 
regulatory recalls, legal actions and signicant 
reputational damage. As the pharmaceutical 
industry is highly regulated, failure to meet 
quality and safety standards could harm the 
company’s credibility. 
Opportunity: 
Maintaining rigorous quality and safety 
standards can bolster the company’s 
reputation, foster customer trust and give it a 
competitive edge. A proven track record of 
high-quality products not only builds brand 
loyalty but also enhances market standing. 
Additionally, implementing effective recall 
management processes can reduce risks and 
mitigate the impact of adverse events
The Company has implemented a robust 
quality management system in line with Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP), including the 
establishment of Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), regular audits, and strict 
adherence to relevant regulations. A 
comprehensive pharmacovigilance system is 
in place to monitor and assess adverse events 
and safety concerns after the product reaches 
the market. Timely reporting and analysis of 
these events allow for swift actions, including 
potential recalls when necessary. Ongoing 
employee training at all levels reinforces the 
importance of quality and safety protocols, 
fostering a culture of compliance. Employees 
are kept up-to-date on evolving regulatory 
standards related to product quality, safety and 
recalls, ensuring full compliance. In the 
pharmaceutical industry, maintaining product 
integrity is crucial to patient safety and 
effective quality controls and recall systems 
help mitigate both health and legal risks.
Positive: 
Delivering high-quality and safe products 
not only strengthens the company's reputation 
among stakeholders but also drives customer 
loyalty and trust, providing a competitive 
advantage. Strict adherence to regulatory 
requirements fosters condence with 
authorities, minimizing the risk of legal 
penalties, nes or product recalls. This 
commitment enhances brand value, market 
share and access to premium markets.
Negative: 
Failing to meet quality and safety standards can 
expose the company to regulatory sanctions, 
litigation, nes and product recalls. These 
lapses may result in nancial losses, 
operational disruptions and signicant damage 
to the company’s reputation.

Risk: 
Exposure to unsafe or hazardous working 
conditions can signicantly impact the physical 
and mental health of employees, leading to 
reduced productivity and increased risk of 
workplace injuries, chemical exposure and 
long-term illnesses. These incidents also pose 
regulatory, reputational & business continuity 
risks.
Opportunity: 
The Company shows its commitment to 
workforce well-being by implementing a 
comprehensive Environment, Health and 
Safety (EHS) management system. This 
includes thorough hazard identication, risk 
mitigation strategies, root cause analysis of 
incidents and corrective actions. Such an 
approach not only improves employee morale 
but also enhances productivity, reduces 
absenteeism and boosts the company's 
reputation as a responsible employer.
The Company prioritizes workplace safety 
through a robust Health & Safety Management 
system, including PPE guidelines, safety audits, 
hazard identication and health programs at its 
Navsari and Indore facilities. Regular safety 
infrastructure reviews, automated incident 
tracking and employee safety committees help 
monitor and improve daily practices, ensuring 
compliance and quick response to safety 
issues.
Positive: 
The company’s strong focus on Occupational 
Health and Safety Management helps prevent 
incidents, boosting employee morale and 
resulting in higher efciency and productivity. 
Additionally, it leads to reduced insurance 
premiums, lower absenteeism, and improved 
employee retention.
Negative:

Opportunity: 
The company is dedicated to improving 
operational efciency through continuous 
energy transition and efciency initiatives, 
aiming for long-term cost savings. The growth 
of renewable energy, supported by signicant 
government backing and ongoing R&D, has 
notably lowered its costs. By prioritizing 
energy efciency, the company seeks to 
reduce operational expenses while using this 
strategy as a key driver for decarbonization 
efforts.
Positive: 
Efcient energy management results in 
substantial cost savings, a smaller carbon 
footprint and better regulatory compliance. It 
also boosts the company's reputation, 
enhances operational efciency, fosters 
innovation & increases employee satisfaction, 
all while strengthening energy security.

Risk: 
Climate change and increasing water scarcity 
pose signicant risks to our operations, 
especially at key manufacturing and R&D sites. 
These challenges can disrupt business 
continuity, reduce operational efciency and 
threaten regulatory compliance. Additionally, 
the discharge of untreated wastewater can 
contaminate local water sources, harming 
ecosystems and public health. The reliance on 
high-quality water for pharmaceutical 
manufacturing further amplies these risks, as 
poor water availability could compromise 
product standards.
Opportunity:
Efcient water use and improved management 
strategies can enhance operational 
sustainability, drive cost savings and mitigate 
these risks, ensuring both environmental and 
business resilience.
Positive: 
Reuse and conservation measures lead to 
signicant cost savings while improving 
relationships with stakeholders by 
demonstrating environmental responsibility.
Negative: 
The nancial burden of implementing water-
efcient technologies, such as ZLD systems, 
can be substantial. Additionally, addressing 
water shortages or poor-quality water may 
strain resources, negatively impacting nearby 
communities and reducing manufacturing site 
productivity, which could result in regulatory 
challenges and nancial consequences.

Improvements in efciency for Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) systems have been 
implemented at our Navsari & Indore facilities. 
At the Navsari plant, we have reduced efuent 
load and saved energy in the ZLD system by 
reusing condensate from the Multiple Effect 
Evaporator (MEE) process and optimizing the 
treatment of domestic efuent streams. At the 
Indore plant, our system features an Efuent 
Treatment Plant (ETP), Ultraltration (UF) 
and Reverse Osmosis (RO) units. The RO 
permeate water is repurposed for gardening, 
green belt development, cooling towers and 
ushing wash areas, while RO reject water is 
also used for green belt development. This 
process recovers approximately 40 to 50 KL 
of water for cooling towers, thereby 
conserving soft water & reducing fresh water 
consumption.
Risk: 
Human Capital Development, which includes 
talent acquisition, retention, employee 
development and overall well-being, is crucial 
to the company's success. Failing to meet 
employee expectations can negatively impact 
retention, productivity & business continuity, 
as the company’s performance heavily relies 
on the well-being of its workforce.
Positive: 
Effective human capital management boosts 
employee engagement, job satisfaction and 
motivation, resulting in higher productivity and 
performance. A strong focus on development 
attracts top talent, increases retention and 
reduces recruitment costs. A positive work 
environment fosters innovation and creativity, 
driving the company’s competitiveness and 
long-term growth.

social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
 
The Company recognizes the importance of structured and focused stakeholder engagement for the timely identification of
 
material environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. An effective stakeholder engagement mechanism not only
 
strengthens and diversifies stakeholder relationships but also plays a critical role in identifying key concerns that may
 
influence the Company’s long-term growth and sustainability.
 
Stakeholders can express concerns about economic, environmental and social matters through a designated grievance
 
redressal email. Upon receipt, the Company promptly acknowledges the communication and provides an initial response to
 
address any immediate issues. Where necessary, the Company Secretary escalates specific queries to the Board or
 
Management for further review and resolution.
 
The Board or Management carefully examines such matters and takes informed decisions, with the outcome
 
communicated to the concerned stakeholder via email. In addition, the Board or Management regularly reviews all
 
complaints to ensure timely and appropriate resolution.

stakeholder engagement, ensuring that all concerns are addressed effectively and that strong, mutually beneficial
 
relationships are maintained.

local communities, the Company takes into account and addresses stakeholder concerns. By engaging with key
