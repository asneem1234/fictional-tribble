The Company has systems, policies, and procedures in place for sustainable sourcing. We are guided by our 
Sustainable Procurement Policies (sustainable procurement policy:https://www.adaniports.com/-/media/
Project/Ports/Investor/corporate-governance/Policies/Sustainable-Procurement-Policy.pdf & supplier code 
of 
conduct:https://www.adaniports.com/-/media/Project/Ports/Investor/corporate-governance/Policies/
Supplier-Code-of-Conduct.pdf) which covers sustainable sourcing requirement related to development of 
systems & process, products, and services (including office products). Additionally, APSEZL has established 
key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets for supply chain management sustainability that apply to Tier 
1 suppliers. These suppliers are deemed highly dependent, as they are the direct vendors with whom the 
Company engages in large volume transactions. 
	
	
Our system records and verifies all suppliers’ Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) parameters, and we 
provide them with the necessary knowledge to improve their ESG metrics.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Being a service provider company, APSEZL doesn’t have any products to reclaim for re-use and recycle. 
However, the Company complies with all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to waste management. 
The Company has defined processes in place for managing waste at each of its operational sites/locations. 
	
Plastic Waste: As per the statutory guidelines, for obtaining Environmental Clearance (EC) from MoEF&CC, 
we are required to have Single Use Plastic (SUP) free ports. Accordingly, all our operating ports are SUP free. 
Other than SUP, plastic waste is being disposed to authorized vendors for reuse and recycle appropriately. 
	
E-waste: All e-waste generated in-house is handed over to certified vendors for safe disposal.
	
Hazardous waste: Hazardous waste is handled, segregated, stored, and transported in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and best industry practices. Hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally 
sound manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation. Hazardous waste (chemicals, 
sludge, oil etc.) collected from incoming vessels are channelized through a separate line, which is handed over to 
authorized third-party dealers. 
	
Other Waste: APSEZL has initiated ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ (ZWL) initiative for non-hazardous waste as we are 
committed towards responsible waste disposal practices, and we have implemented the 5R approach (Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle, Recover, and Reprocess) across all our facilities. As part of the ZWL initiative Mundra, Kattupalli, 
Ennore, Dhamra, Goa, and Tuna sites have achieved Zero Waste to Landfill certification. Essential measures taken 
towards effective waste management are: 
	
i.	
We have implemented a sustainable waste management practice by recycling bio-degradable waste and 
using it as manure. 
	
ii.	
Non-biodegradable waste such as paper, plastic, and scrap is sent to recyclers. 
	
iii.	
Non-recyclable and non-recoverable dry waste (loose refused derived fuel) was sent to cement plants for 
co-processing. 
	
iv.	
STP sludge was used as a soil conditioner/manure.
	
v.	
Under the International Maritime Organization’s MARPOL 73/78 convention, vessels that call at our port 
deliver their waste safely to our facility at a nominal charge, in alignment with the ‘polluter pays’ principle’. 
	
vi.	
We continuously impart training to our employees on responsible waste disposal practices to ensure that 
they are aware of their roles in implementing sustainable waste management practices. In addition, we work 
with our customers to manage their waste through appropriate channels.

whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted 
to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.

Yes, we have implemented an online Grievance Redressal system called “Speak-Up,” which is exclusively for its 
workforce (permanent employees, permanent workers and other than permanent) to raise any concerns they may 
have. The system allows them to bring their concerns to the attention of the Grievance Redressal Committee 
(GRC), which resolves these issues within 14 working days. The grievances are resolved in a fair and time bound 
manner maintaining utmost confidentiality. In addition, grievance registers and complaint boxes are available 
at sites/locations wherein grievances/complaints can be registered/ submitted. Workers that are engaged on 
a contract basis can also report their grievances to their respective contractor representative or the company 
supervisor. The contractor is expected to take the required action to address the worker grievances, and if 
required, can raise the grievance to HR and respective functional heads.
	
Apart from the on-line grievance redressal platform, the Company also has a policy on prevention, prohibition 
and redressal of sexual harassment of women at the workplace and has Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)
in compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) 
Act,2013. Members of the ICCs are responsible for conducting inquiries pertaining to such complaints.
	
The Company has also adopted a Whistle Blower Policy and has established the necessary vigil mechanism for 
employees to report concerns about unethical behavior and financial irregularities. The Company, on a regular 
basis, sensitizes its employees on the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace through workshops,

including employees, associates, and contract workforce. The Company recognizes that the dynamic risks 
need to be managed and mitigated as per the Hierarchy of Control to protect its stakeholders and achieve 
the objective of Zero Harm with enablement of Sustainable Growth. These interventions bring together an

Governance: Safety Management Committee is responsible for implementing process safety by 
conducting risk assessment {i.e., HAZOP study, PHA, HIRA etc.} for existing system and implementation of 
recommendations of assessment. 
	
	
Capacity Building: Many drives are taken across units to create awareness on identification of high-risk 
activities such as work at height, Confined Space, Lock Out Tag Out Try Out (LOTOTO) etc. and training on 
its standards. We acknowledge the fact that operations free from health risks have the potential to escalate 
productivity also. Hence, we have processes in place to manage and monitor health risks of employees, right 
from the time of their first interaction with the company. We are having OH&S management system (as per 
the requirement of OHSAS 45001/ ISO 18001) for managing OH&S risks related to our activities, with HIRA 
in place for all activities and for every significant risk, appropriate control measure is implemented as per 
control measures hierarchy i.e., elimination, substitution, engineering, administration & Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE). Also refer to the OHS section of Integrated report for details of OHS governance, system/ 
process, training, performance, and related details.

Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks.
	
	
Yes, The Company uses the well-established Incident Management and Investigation System for fair and 
transparent reporting of work-related hazards and risks as unsafe acts/ unsafe conditions, near misses, 
injuries and illness and serious incidents. This is followed by a comprehensive Root Cause Failure Analysis 
(Investigation), formulation of corrective actions as per Hierarchy of Controls, its tracking and monitoring 
and subsequent closure. The outcome and learnings from these events and incidents are deployed 
horizontally across the Group through a systemic process of ‘Critical Vulnerable Factor’ (CVF) as a part 
of Safety Governance Process. The progress on CVF is reviewed during Adani Apex Group Safety Steering 
Council Meetings as well as during their Business Safety Council Meetings. To facilitate this, an advanced 
digital platform (GENSUITE) on OH&S Reporting has been deployed by APSEZL. The Company accesses 
this platform through its machines as well as native and lite Mobile App version Moreover, each site has 
suggestion boxes where employees, workers and business partners can report grievances, and suggestions 
for improving the safety performance.  Employees and workers can also report incidents and inaction on the 
safety incident through a formal whistle blower portal, the details of which are displayed at each site.

To make our stakeholders aware of relevant guidelines pertaining to human rights, we upload these on our 
Company website for easy access to all employees and stakeholders. Awareness and familiarization sessions for 
different sets of employee population are also conducted. 
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, all the suppliers and vendors are required to adhere to APSEZ’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights 
guidelines which provides comprehensive guiding principles and embodies our commitment to internationally 
recognized standards, including UN Global Compact, the core conventions of the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) and United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and prevalent industry standards for our 
vendors and suppliers. APSEZL has zero tolerance towards violation of human rights and keeps a strict vigil on 
the policies and practices followed by the suppliers. Also, we try to enforce the best practices on human rights in 
our supply chain using the influence we have on our suppliers. Our expectation of respect for human rights from 
all our business partners is unambiguously conveyed at multiple levels of engagement. During the on-boarding 
process and later, the suppliers undergo third party audit of their operations for compliance with safe working 
condition requirements, avoidance of child and forced labour, environmental and social impacts, and human 
rights due diligence. The human rights aspects are also covered in-depth in our annual survey of the vendors 
and the training programs organized for them. In the survey, the suppliers are required to disclose their policy to 
avoid child labour, forced labour, workplace harassment, gender & ethnic discrimination and their human rights 
due diligence process. The suppliers are assessed on whether their policy is aligned with the requirements set by 
APSEZL for their suppliers and business partners. 
	
Human right due diligence is carried out for mergers and before acquisitions which includes due diligence of 
country reputation in term of respecting human rights, ongoing controversy pertaining to human rights violation 
including child labour/forced labour/bonded labour, diversity, human trafficking, wages, sexual exploitation, 
racial /gender discrimination etc.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
APSEZL, being in the service industry (i.e., provides services for cargo handling & logistics, operations & 
maintenance of port sector) does not produce any products using hazardous and toxic chemicals. As such, 
we don’t have potential to recycle generated waste in our operations. However, APSEZL complies with all the 
applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to waste management. Achieving Zero Waste to Landfill at all our 
sites by FY 2024-25 is an ambitious sustainability goal that aims to divert all waste from landfills and eliminate 
the need for traditional waste disposal practices.
	
We dispose of our waste in an environmentally friendly manner through CPCB / SPCB registered CHWIF/ TSDF or 
authorized recyclers. As we move towards our vision of Zero Waste to landfill at all sites, several initiatives have 
been implemented in the handling and management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at all operating 
port locations by focusing on 5R principles of waste management i.e., Reduce, Reuse, Reprocess, Recycle and 
Recover. Essential measures we take towards effective waste management:
	
a.	
We have implemented a sustainable waste management practice by recycling bio-degradable waste and 
using it as manure.
	
b.	
Non-biodegradable waste such as paper, plastic, and scrap are sent to recyclers. 
	
c.	
Non-recyclable and non-recoverable dry waste (loose refused derived fuel) was sent to cement plants for 
co-processing. 
	
d.	
STP sludge was used as soil conditioner/manure.
	
e.	
APSEZL has successfully accomplished its objective of establishing a single-use plastic-free port across its 
sites as part of its commitment to the 5R’s principle. 
	
f.	
We continuously educate and train our employees on responsible waste disposal practices to ensure that 
they are aware of their roles in implementing sustainable waste management practices.
