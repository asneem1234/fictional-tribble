none of the resolution proposals were considered by the lenders. Due to non-receipt of the rental amounts from the discontinuing operators as 
per contractual arrangement, pending approval of payment requests of the Company with the Monitoring Institution and non-resolution of issue 
of unpaid liabilities towards unoccupied towers, the rentals to landlords for those unoccupied sites remained unpaid. As a result, such landlords 
initiated legal actions against the Company and its directors / officials. The total number of legal notices received by the Company from various 
landlords for the FY 2024 - 2025 are 1235. The Company has responded to majority of such legal notices and as on March 31, 2025; 626 number

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
	
	
Yes, the company integrates sustainability into its procurement strategy by prioritizing environmentally responsible 
sourcing in all purchasing decisions. Capital investments in Class A products—such as diesel generators, battery 
banks, and SMPS units—are rigorously evaluated based on their lifecycle performance, energy efficiency, emissions 
profile, and end-of-life waste management practices.
	
	
-	
Vendor Selection Based on ESG Compliance
	
	
	
Procurement of critical infrastructure components like batteries, SMPS, and generators is conducted through vendors 
who demonstrate strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) commitments. These commitments are verified 
through publicly available ESG disclosures, including Business Responsibility Reports and other sustainability-related 
documentation. Vendor assessment and prioritization are therefore closely aligned with ESG performance indicators.
	
	
-  Energy Efficiency Monitoring
	
	
	
The company conducts regular evaluations of product efficiency, with a particular focus on energy consumption metrics. 
This ongoing monitoring ensures optimal performance and supports the organization’s broader sustainability goals.
	
	
-  Support for Local Enterprises
	
	
	
In line with its commitment to inclusive growth, the company actively engages local service providers, including 
medium and small-scale enterprises and regional entrepreneurs. This approach not only fosters community 
development but also strengthens the local supply chain ecosystem.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
Nearly 95% of CAPEX procured is continuously assessed on periodical basis
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging), (b) E-waste, (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
	
As part of our business operations, we utilize batteries and various electronic products. Batteries are classified as hazardous 
waste due to their chemical composition, while components such as SMPS units are categorized as non-hazardous waste. 
Needful actions are performed for handling E-waste disposal, efforts are taken to increase the life span of SMPS, etc. to 
reduce waste. Vendors are also required to do safe disposal of used batteries.
	
-	
Material Movement and Tracking
	
	
Deployment of materials from the warehouse to operational sites is governed by the Material Request Note (MRN) 
process. Upon completion of the product’s shelf life, retrieval from sites is initiated through a Site Return Note (SRN), 
raised by the end user. Once returned to the warehouse, materials undergo a structured Health Assessment conducted 
by our in-house Testing & Repair Centre (TRC).
	
-	
Repair and Redeployment Workflow
	
	
Following TRC’s assessment, each item is validated by a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to determine its condition. Items 
deemed repairable are sent to the SME Workshop for refurbishment and subsequently redeployed. Materials identified 
as scrap are further reviewed by the respective Circle Team for final classification.
	
-	
Responsible Disposal and Compliance
	
	
Disposal of assets—especially those falling under Pollution Control Board norms, including e-waste, hazardous waste, 
and general waste—is carried out in strict compliance with regulatory guidelines. Disposal activities are publicly 
advertised, and only authorized and approved recyclers are permitted to participate in inspections and scrap collection 
from designated warehouse locations.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The Company follows a structured and strategic approach to identify and classify its key stakeholder groups. This process 
is essential for fostering meaningful engagement, aligning business objectives with stakeholder expectations, and ensuring 
long-term sustainability. The identification process is guided by the following principles:
	
-	
Mapping Interdependence and Influence
	
	
Stakeholders are first assessed based on their interdependence with the Company’s services—whether they rely on 
our offerings for their own operations or well-being.
	
	
Simultaneously, the Company evaluates its own dependence on these stakeholders for critical aspects of its operations, 
such as supply chain continuity, regulatory compliance, market access, and community support.
	
-	
Classification Based on Relationship Type
	
	
Stakeholders are then classified into priority groups based on the nature of their relationship with the Company:
	
Contractual Stakeholders: Entities bound by formal agreements, including customers, suppliers, service providers, and employees.
	
Operational Stakeholders: Groups that directly influence or are influenced by day-to-day business activities, such as 
regulators, local authorities, and logistics partners.
	
Moral and Social Stakeholders: Communities, NGOs, and advocacy groups with whom the Company shares a social 
responsibility or ethical obligation, even in the absence of formal contracts.
	
-  Strategic Prioritization
	
Each stakeholder group is evaluated for its level of influence, interest, and impact on the Company’s strategic goals. This 
prioritization helps determine the depth and frequency of engagement, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively and 
that stakeholder concerns are addressed proactively.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
The Company is committed to minimizing environmental impact by reducing the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in its 
operations and adopting systematic, responsible waste management practices.
	
-	
Responsible Handling of Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste: Our operations involve the consumption of 
batteries—classified as hazardous waste—and electronic components such as SMPS (Switched Mode Power 
Supplies), which are categorized as non-hazardous waste. The Company follows a structured lifecycle approach to 
manage these materials efficiently and sustainably.
	
-	
Material Lifecycle Management: A robust framework governs the deployment, retrieval, assessment, and disposal of 
operational materials:
	
	
Deployment - Materials are dispatched from warehouses to operational sites through a controlled process using 
Material Request Notes (MRNs).
	
	
Retrieval - Upon completion of their shelf life, materials are returned to the warehouse via Site Return Notes (SRNs) 
for further evaluation.
	
	
Health Assessment - Returned items undergo rigorous testing at our In-house Testing & Repair Centre. Each item is 
validated by a Subject Matter Expert to determine its condition and classify it as either:
	
	
-	
Repairable/Reusable: Items meeting performance standards are refurbished and redeployed, extending their 
useful life and reducing waste generation.
	
	
-	
Scrap: Items deemed non-repairable are responsibly disposed of through authorized recyclers or returned to 
OEMs undertake back programs, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.
	
-	
Reduction of Hazardous Chemical Usage: By prioritizing reuse and refurbishment, the Company significantly 
reduces the need for new material procurement, thereby limiting the introduction of hazardous substances into the 
supply chain. This approach not only curbs environmental risks but also promotes circular economy principles.
