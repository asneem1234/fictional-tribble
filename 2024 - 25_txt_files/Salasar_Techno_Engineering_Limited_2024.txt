Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure). 
        Salasar Techno Engineering Limited remains firmly committed to embedding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles 
across its operations and value chain. During the reporting period, the company made measurable progress towards its defined commit­
ments while continuing to address the evolving challenges of climate change, resource efficiency, and stakeholder expectations.
          In FY 2024–25, the company achieved a 2.94% reduction in Scope 1 emissions over the previous year, reflecting continuous improvements 
in operational efficiency and emission management. A stakeholder engagement exercise was undertaken through a structured materiality 
assessment, strengthening the alignment of business practices with stakeholder priorities. The company also advanced its sustainable 
sourcing journey, achieving 51.36% adoption of sustainable materials, thereby moving closer to the commitment of implementing sustain­
able sourcing practices across the supply chain by 2028.
         Water stewardship continues to be a critical focus area. Salasar has already implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) at one of its plants 
and remains on track to extend this across all facilities by 2029. Parallel efforts in energy transition, including investment in solar power 
systems and energy efficiency initiatives, further demonstrate the company’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and 
advancing towards its GHG reduction targets.
        While challenges remain, the company is proactively addressing them through process optimisation, technology adoption, and adher­
ence to global standards such as ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018. The overall approach continues to emphasise long-term sustainable 
growth, ensuring value creation for all stakeholders while safeguarding the environment and society.

topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Salasar engages with stakeholders on economic, environmental, and social matters through a well-defined consultation 
framework. This process begins with a materiality assessment and peer benchmarking to identify key stakeholder groups. 
Salasar uses structured questionnaires to collect feedback on ESG-related issues, which are then thoroughly analyzed. The 
summarized insights are reported to the Board of Directors for strategic consideration and decision-making. Subsequently, 
the actions and outcomes derived from the consultation are communicated publicly to ensure transparency and build 
stakeholder trust. 
        Stakeholder Consultation Process:
1.	 Stakeholder Identification:
	
 Identification of key stakeholders is conducted through peer analysis and internal assessments to determine    relevance 
and influence.

healthcare benefits, recognizing the critical nature of this issue due to the operational profile of Salasar Techno Engineering.
          To further align with stakeholder expectations, the company has updated its internal policies to promote greater transparency 
and accountability. Climate change has also emerged as a high-priority issue for both Salasar and its stakeholders. In

5.	 Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation. 
     	 Yes, Salasar has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism across its manufacturing plants located in Hapur, 
Uttar Pradesh. Each of the three plants employs a distinct approach to achieve ZLD:
1.	 Plant-I: Utilizes a flux regeneration system to attain Zero Liquid Discharge by treating and recycling waste water within 
the process.
2.	 Plant-II and Plant-III: Operate Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) to treat the wastewater generated. The treated water is 
then reused within the Galvanizing Plant operations and ensuring no liquid effluent is discharged externally.
	
These measures reflect Salasar’s commitment to sustainable water management and environmental responsibility.

8.	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, as an environmentally responsible organization, has undertaken several initiatives to minimize emissions resulting from 
fuel consumption. The company is progressively replacing conventional lighting systems with energy-efficient LED fittings 
across its offices and manufacturing facilities. Additionally, High-Speed Diesel (HSD) has been replaced with Liquefied 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) as a cleaner alternative to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To further its commitment to 
sustainable energy, Salasar has installed a solar power plant to harness renewable energy in place of conventional fuel-based 
sources. The company has also adopted dual-fuel generators that operate on both diesel and LPG, thereby optimizing fuel 
efficiency and lowering environmental impact.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
      Salasar has adopted robust waste management practices to ensure the environmentally responsible handling and disposal 
of all waste generated at its manufacturing facilities. Waste is systematically segregated and collected at the source within 
the premises. Effluents are treated through Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), and the resulting sludge is safely disposed of 
at authorized Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs). E-waste is handled by certified and authorized recyclers to 
ensure environmentally sound disposal. Additionally, metallic waste—including structural steel, mild steel, stainless steel, and 
zinc ash—is sold to licensed recyclers for reuse and recycling.
	
To minimize the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in products and processes, Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd. has 
implemented a proactive strategy emphasizing process optimization and the replacement of hazardous materials with safer, 
more sustainable alternatives. The company continuously monitors and enhances its operational processes to minimize 
environmental impact and uphold sustainability throughout its value chain.
