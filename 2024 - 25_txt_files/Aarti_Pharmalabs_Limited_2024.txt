cost efficiency 
programs, 
and revenue 
diversification.
Positive
8.
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity

operating costs and emissions. 
Inefficiency increases exposure 
to volatile energy prices and 
regulatory scrutiny.

automation, and 
renewable energy 
installations.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
APL integrates the 3R principle—Reduce, Reuse, Recycle—into its core waste management strategy, ensuring its application 
across all operations and waste streams. This approach reflects the company’s commitment to resource conservation and 
sustainable practices. Advanced waste management systems are in place at all facilities to support efficient handling, with 
a focus on minimizing waste generation, maximizing reuse opportunities, and facilitating responsible recycling.

Plastic Waste: All plastic waste is systematically routed to authorized recyclers for environmentally sound processing.

environmental standards.
	
C.	
Hazardous Waste: Managed in strict adherence to applicable regulations, hazardous waste is disposed of at Common 
Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (CHWTSDFs) through landfill or incineration. Select 
categories are also sent to authorized recyclers in accordance with consent conditions under the Hazardous and Other

contributing to a circular, sustainable economy.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
APL has implemented a comprehensive and environmentally responsible waste management system that reflects its strong 
commitment to sustainability. Recognizing the importance of minimizing environmental impact, the company has developed 
a strategy that aligns with the highest industry standards and regulatory frameworks. APL’s approach is structured and 
systematic covering the identification, segregation, handling, treatment, and safe disposal of all types of waste. The core 
objectives of this strategy include minimizing waste generation, maximizing opportunities for recycling and reuse, and 
ensuring the environmentally sound disposal of hazardous materials.
Aarti Pharmalabs Limited

As part of its ongoing efforts to reduce the use of hazardous and toxic substances and minimize waste generation at the 
source, APL has undertaken the following key initiatives:
	
n	
Green Chemistry Integration: APL has embedded green chemistry principles into its product design phase by 
incorporating hazard checklists. To date, over 60 newly designed stages have been assessed, with 58 meeting 
satisfactory criteria for the use of safer materials. Where risks were identified in 2 processes were revised to substitute 
hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives.
	
n	
Innovative By-Product Utilization: Within the Xanthine product chain, APL has developed a novel process to treat and 
convert by-products into valuable resources. This innovation not only reduces waste but also supports circularity and 
sustainable resource use.
	
n	
Emission Management: APL facilities are equipped with advanced scrubbing systems that effectively capture and 
control emissions, thereby preventing the release of harmful substances into the atmosphere and supporting cleaner 
air quality.
	
n	
Wastewater Management: APL has invested in cutting-edge wastewater treatment technologies, including Reverse 
Osmosis (RO), Multiple-Effect Evaporators (MEEs), and Agitated Thin Film Dryers (ATFD), to recover and reuse water 
from industrial streams. The company has also adopted Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR) systems for 
treating industrial effluents and installed Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) to manage domestic wastewater.
	
n	
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) Policy: Reinforcing its environmental stewardship, APL has adopted a Zero Liquid 
Discharge policy across all operational units. This ensures that all wastewater is treated and reused internally, with no 
liquid effluents being released into the environment.
	
	
Through these measures, APL continues to enhance its environmental performance, reduce ecological footprint, and 
contribute to the development of a more sustainable and circular manufacturing ecosystem.
