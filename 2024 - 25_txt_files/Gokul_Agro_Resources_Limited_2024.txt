1.
Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions
Opportunity
Entities in the Agricultural Products 
sector primarily contribute to 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
through the processing and 
transportation of goods via land 
and sea freight. As emissions 
regulations become more 
stringent, these entities may face 
higher capital and operational 
costs, potentially impacting 
their efficiency. However, by 
adopting innovative technologies 
that utilize alternative fuels and 
energy sources—such as biomass 
waste generated from their own 
operations—and enhancing fuel 
efficiency, they can effectively 
mitigate risks related to fuel price 
volatility, supply chain disruptions, 
regulatory expenses, and other 
GHG-related challenges. Gokul 
Agro has turned this potential risk 
into an opportunity by substantially 
reducing air emissions and Scope 
1 GHG emissions, as detailed under 
Principle 6.

2.
Energy 
Management
Risk
Processing and milling of 
agricultural products require 
substantial energy input. While 
some entities in this sector 
generate energy on-site using 
fossil fuels or biomass, the majority 
depend on electricity supplied by 
the grid. This energy consumption 
has environmental consequences, 
including contributions to climate 
change and pollution. Efficient 
energy management is essential, 
as it directly affects both current 
and future operational costs. With 
evolving climate regulations and 
sustainability considerations, 
electricity and fuel prices may 
become higher or more volatile, 
thereby raising operating expenses. 
Enhancing energy efficiency 
through process improvements 
can help mitigate these costs. 
Furthermore, the choice between 
on-site and grid-based electricity, 
along with the adoption of 
alternative energy sources, can 
have a significant impact on long-
term energy costs, supply reliability, 
and the degree of regulatory 
exposure from both direct and 
indirect emissions.
To mitigate risks associated 
with energy management, 
the Company has adopted 
a comprehensive strategy 
that includes the use of an 
automatic thermometer 
cut-off system, solar panels, 
and windmills. The cut-off 
system conserves energy by 
automatically switching off 
cooling equipment once the 
target temperature is achieved. 
By integrating solar panels and 
windmills, the Company has 
diversified its energy sources, 
thereby reducing dependence 
on conventional energy and 
minimizing the impact of 
supply disruptions and rising 
costs. This initiative not only 
improves energy efficiency but 
also promotes environmental 
sustainability by lowering the 
carbon footprint.
The Company’s ISO 9001:2015 
certification underscores its 
dedication to maintaining 
robust and high-quality 
management systems.
Negative
3.
Workforce
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Industrial processes in the 
Agricultural Products industry 
involve considerable occupational 
hazards. Employees frequently 
perform labor-intensive tasks 
that carry risks such as falls, 
transportation-related incidents, 
equipment injuries, and heat-
related illnesses. Non-compliance 
with health and safety standards 
can result in regulatory penalties 
and the financial burden of 
implementing corrective measures. 
Elevated injury and fatality rates 
may reflect inadequate governance 
and a deficient safety culture, 
potentially leading to significant 
reputational harm.
The Company has established 
a robust Environmental, Health, 
and Safety (EHS) management 
system across all its operations 
and is ISO 45001:2018 
certified. Comprehensive 
training programs on safe 
working practices have been 
implemented for all employees 
and workers. Additionally, the 
Company provides health and 
accidental insurance policies 
and benefits to its workforce.

4.
Water
Management
Risk
The Agricultural Products 
industry relies heavily on water 
for its processing activities and 
generally generates wastewater 
or effluent as a by-product. The 
availability of water—whether 
limited by physical scarcity or 
regulatory constraints—has a direct 
impact on the industry’s ability 
to operate processing facilities 
efficiently. With growing global 
water scarcity, entities in this 
sector are increasingly exposed to 
water-related risks and regulatory 
pressures, potentially resulting 
in higher capital investments, 
increased operating costs, and 
additional remediation expenses.
To effectively manage effluent 
at the site, water sourced from 
various channels, including 
GWIL and bore wells, is 
subjected to a thorough 
treatment process. Post usage, 
wastewater generated from 
operations is collected and 
treated in the Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP), which removes 
contaminants and renders the 
water suitable for reuse. The 
site also operates a Multiple 
Effect Evaporation (MEE) plant 
that further concentrates 
and reduces the volume of 
waste, enhancing overall water 
management efficiency. The 
treated water is then reused for 
non-potable purposes, such 
as gardening and in cooling 
towers, thereby reducing the 
reliance on fresh water.
Negative
5.
Food safety
Risk
Agricultural products are either 
sold in their raw form directly to 
consumers or processed before 
reaching the market. Maintaining 
product quality and safety is 
essential, as contamination from 
pathogens, chemicals, or spoilage 
can pose significant health risks 
to both humans and animals. 
Such contamination may result 
from poor practices in farming, 
transportation, storage, or handling. 
Concerns over food quality and 
safety can lead to changes in 
consumer demand and trigger 
regulatory actions. Product recalls 
not only harm brand reputation 
but can also lead to revenue losses 
and significant financial penalties.
Our Company upholds the 
highest standards of food safety 
and quality through stringent 
procedures. The quality of raw 
materials is verified before 
unloading, with solid materials 
undergoing cleaning and 
destoning, and liquid cargo 
being filtered through magnetic 
strainers. The refining process 
is carried out using suitable 
aids and steam, in strict 
accordance with established 
protocols. All employees are 
medically certified to prevent 
human contamination, and the 
production area is maintained 
with rigorous hygiene practices, 
including regular cleaning. Pest 
control services are routinely 
engaged to ensure a pest-
free environment. A well-
equipped laboratory conducts 
comprehensive quality checks 
in line with FSSAI regulations, 
including biannual testing for 
pesticides, Naturally Occurring 
Toxins (NOTs), and heavy metals. 
The Company’s ISO 9001:2015 
certification further reinforces its 
commitment to product quality.

Environmental
& Social
Impacts of
Ingredient
Supply Chain
Risk
Entities in the Agricultural 
Products industry rely on a wide 
network of suppliers for their 
inputs. The way these entities 
address environmental and social 
concerns within their supply 
chains can significantly impact 
consumer demand, reputational 
risks, and their ability to manage 
crop supply and respond to 
price volatility. Supply chain 
issues related to labor practices, 
environmental compliance, 
ethics, or corruption can result in 
regulatory penalties and increased 
long-term operational costs. 
Moreover, poor environmental or 
social performance by suppliers 
can negatively affect the entity’s 
reputation. By engaging with key 
suppliers to promote sustainable 
agricultural practices or sourcing 
from certified suppliers, entities 
can reduce these risks, enhance 
consumer trust, and tap into new 
market opportunities.
To address the environmental 
and social impacts of its 
ingredient supply chain, 
the Company incorporates 
the principles of circularity 
across its supply chain 
and product lifecycle. This 
approach emphasizes resource 
optimization by minimizing 
waste through efficient 
processes and advanced 
technologies. The Company 
is dedicated to using recycled 
materials in its packaging, 
thereby reducing dependence 
on virgin resources and 
lowering its environmental 
footprint. Furthermore, the 
Company designs products 
with reuse and repurposing in 
mind, extending their lifecycle 
and limiting waste generation. 
Together, these initiatives 
support the development of 
a sustainable and responsible 
supply chain that tackles 
environmental and social 
challenges while advancing a 
circular economy.
Negative
7.
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Establishing a well-defined and 
robust governance structure is 
fundamental to ensuring effective 
decision-making and efficient 
operational management within 
an organization. This framework 
provides clear and transparent 
guidelines for decision-making, 
aligning the Company’s actions 
with its strategic goals. Our 
Company is firmly committed 
to maintaining accountability to 
its stakeholders and consistently 
promotes fair, transparent, and 
ethical corporate governance 
practices. Understanding that 
strong corporate governance 
is crucial for sustained growth, 
profitability, and stability, the 
Company places significant 
emphasis on maintaining 
a transparent and resilient 
governance framework to build 
and strengthen stakeholder trust.
