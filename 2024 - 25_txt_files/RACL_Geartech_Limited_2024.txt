1
Raw Material 
Sourcing
Risk: Environmental 
degradation 
from mining and 
extraction processes.
Opportunity: 
Sustainable sourcing 
can enhance brand 
reputation and 
compliance with 
regulations.
Ethical and 
sustainable 
sourcing of raw 
materials minimizes 
environmental 
impact and aligns 
with increasing 
regulatory and 
consumer demand 
for sustainable 
products.
1- Conduct due 
diligence on 
suppliers.
2- Source materials 
from certified 
and responsible 
suppliers.
3- Implement a 
traceability system to 
ensure transparency.
Cost: Potential 
increase in material 
costs due to 
premium pricing of 
sustainably sourced 
materials.
Benefit: Long-
term savings from 
avoiding regulatory 
fines and enhancing 
brand value.
2
Energy 
Consumption
Risk: High energy 
consumption 
leading to increased 
operational costs and 
carbon footprint.
Opportunity: 
Adopting renewable 
energy can reduce 
costs and emissions.
Energy efficiency 
and renewable 
energy adoption can 
significantly reduce 
greenhouse gas 
emissions and cost.
RACL mitigates 
energy-related risks 
by adopting 100% 
green energy at 
its Gajraula plant 
through a mix of 
rooftop solar (9%), 
offsite solar via PPA 
(24%), and green 
grid power, reducing 
emissions and 
stabilizing energy 
costs.
Cost: Initial 
investment in 
renewable energy 
infrastructure and 
energy-efficient 
technologies.
Benefit: Reduced 
energy costs 
and potential 
tax incentives 
or subsidies for 
renewable energy 
use.
3
Water 
Usage and 
Management
Risk: Overuse and 
contamination of 
water resources.
Opportunity: 
Water recycling and 
conservation can 
reduce costs and 
regulatory risks.
Efficient water 
management is 
crucial for reducing 
environmental 
impact and ensuring 
compliance with 
environmental 
regulations.
1- Implement water 
recycling and 
rainwater harvesting 
systems.
2- Use water-efficient 
processes and 
equipment.
3- Monitor and 
manage water usage.
Cost: Investment 
in water recycling 
and conservation 
technologies.
Benefit: Lower 
water usage costs 
and reduced risk of 
regulatory penalties.
4
Waste 
Management
Risk: Improper waste 
disposal leading 
to pollution and 
regulatory fines.
Opportunity: 
Recycling and waste 
reduction can lower 
disposal costs and 
environmental impact.
Ensuring fair 
labor practices 
and good working 
conditions is crucial 
for compliance, 
employee retention, 
and brand 
reputation.
1- Adhere to labor 
laws and standards.
2- Provide fair 
wages, benefits, 
and safe working 
conditions.
3- Offer training 
and development 
opportunities.
Cost: Increased 
costs related to 
wages, benefits, and 
workplace safety 
improvements.
Benefit: Higher 
productivity, lower 
turnover, and 
enhanced reputation.

8. 	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details.	
	
RACL has made significant strides in its transition toward clean and sustainable energy, marking a major 
milestone with its primary manufacturing facility in Gajraula now operating entirely on 100% green energy. 
This achievement underscores the Company’s steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship and 
decarbonizing its operations.
	
This transformation has been made possible through a diversified and integrated approach combining 
on-site and off-site renewable energy generation, as well as strategic procurement through green energy 
agreements. The key components of this green energy model include:
	
•	
1.4 MW Rooftop Solar Plant: Installed at the Gajraula facility, this on-site solar infrastructure currently 
contributes approximately 9% of the plant’s total electricity requirement, reflecting RACL’s early and 
proactive investment in solar energy.
	
•	
4 MW Off-site Solar Plant (Sunsure): Operated under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), this 
off-site facility now supplies 24% of the total electricity consumption. This partnership ensures reliable 
access to clean energy and further expands RACL’s renewable portfolio.
	
•	
Green Power Procurement from the Grid: To meet the remaining energy needs, RACL procures certified 
green electricity from the grid by paying a green energy premium. This enables the Company to ensure 
that 100% of its electricity consumption at the Gajraula facility is sourced from renewable means, even 
when not directly generated on-site.
	
Through this comprehensive approach, RACL’s Gajraula (mother) plant has become a fully green energy-
powered facility-demonstrating industry leadership and alignment with both national renewable energy 
targets and global climate action commitments.
	
Looking ahead, RACL remains focused on further scaling its renewable energy footprint across all operational 
locations, reinforcing its vision for a sustainable, energy-resilient future.
