of our employees and 
to our surrounding 
environment
Adherence to standards 
pertaining to Occupational 
Health and Safety, the 
Company’s Environment, 
Health and Safety (“EHS”) 
Policy and highest 
operational standards 
for handling hazardous 
materials;
• It actively collaborates

• Regular quantitative 
risk assessments 
are conducted, with 
action plans promptly 
implemented and closed.
• A robust Emergency

established to ensure swift 
action during incidents.
• Additionally, plant 
infrastructure is designed

Safety risk
Risk and 
Opportunity
The Company’s 
manufacturing 
activities involve 
employees operating 
plant systems, 
machinery, and 
material handling 
equipment—each 
of which inherently 
carries a risk of 
injury. To address 
this, the Company 
prioritizes stringent 
safety protocols and 
continuous training 
to minimize potential 
hazards and ensure 
a safe working 
environment.
Compliance with 
safety regulations, 
strict adherence to the 
Company’s Environment, 
Health and Safety 
(EHS) Policy, and the 
implementation of best-in-
class operational practices 
for managing hazardous 
materials at plant facilities
• Negative Implications: 
Safety risks can 
lead to workplace 
injuries, resulting in 
medical expenses, 
compensation claims, 
legal liabilities, and 
potential regulatory 
penalties. Additionally, 
incidents may disrupt 
operations, reduce 
productivity, and 
damage the Company’s 
reputation.
• Positive Implications: 
Proactively managing 
safety through 
robust protocols and 
continuous training 
can reduce incident 
rates, lower insurance 
premiums, and 
enhance employee 
morale and retention. 
A strong safety 
culture also reinforces 
stakeholder trust and 
supports long-term 
operational efficiency 
and compliance

Company for sustained 
competitiveness.

Technological
Risk and 
Opportunity
Technology continues 
to evolve rapidly and 
remains integral to 
our operations—
enhancing everything 
from process 
automation and quality 
assurance to supply 
chain efficiency and 
customer interaction. 
Falling behind 
on technological 
advancements could 
hinder the Company’s 
competitiveness and 
its capacity to fulfill 
customer expectations. 
Additionally, in today’s 
digital landscape, 
cyber threats such 
as data breaches 
and attacks pose 
significant risks, 
potentially leading 
to financial loss and 
reputational harm that 
could adversely affect 
the Company’s brand 
image
The Company proactively 
invests in Research and 
Development to address 
technology-related risks, 
supported by an in-house, 
approved R&D facility. 
This dedicated unit 
focuses on enhancing 
processes and products 
while driving innovation 
to meet the evolving 
needs of customers. In 
parallel, the Company 
is reinforcing its 
cybersecurity framework 
to safeguard critical 
data and infrastructure. 
Embracing technological 
advancements also 
enables the Company to 
deliver more sustainable 
and future-ready solutions 
to its customers.
• Negative 
Implications: 
Failure to keep pace 
with technological 
advancements or to 
adequately protect 
against cyber threats 
could result in loss 
of market share, 
increased operational 
costs, regulatory 
penalties, and 
reputational damage. 
Cyber incidents, in 
particular, may lead to 
direct financial losses 
due to data breaches, 
legal liabilities, and 
business disruptions.
• Positive 
Implications: On the 
other hand, proactive 
investment in R&D 
and cybersecurity 
can lead to enhanced 
operational efficiency, 
product innovation, 
and stronger customer 
trust. These efforts can 
open up new revenue 
streams, improve 
cost-effectiveness, and 
position the Company 
as a technological 
leader, ultimately 
contributing to long-
term financial growth 
and resilience.

relevant discussions or decisions. These measures are reinforced through the Company’s Code of Conduct and periodic 
declarations to uphold transparency, integrity, and good governance.

Reply: As a manufacturer in the metal industry, producing bimetal, trimetal, and shunt components used in OEM products, 
the company integrates sustainability throughout its operations. Capital investments include ₹217.91 Lakhs in energy 
conservation equipment, installation of 400 KWh solar panels, and a shift to renewable hydroelectric power across 
facilities. Additional measures such as replacing conventional lighting with LEDs, upgrading to energy-efficient motors 
and drives, and adopting sustainable packaging further reinforce this commitment. On the R&D front, efforts include 
automation in inspection systems for precision and waste reduction, research into resistive alloys, and development of 
indigenous bi-metal components. Continuous monitoring of carbon footprints and plans for offsetting emissions highlight 
the company’s strategic focus on sustainability. These initiatives reflect a substantial allocation of resources toward 
environmentally and socially responsible innovation within the manufacturing process.
2.	 a.	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)

Reply: The Company specializes in manufacturing alloy-based thermostatic bimetal and electron beam-based shunt 
resistors, which play a crucial role as components in the electrical and electronics industry. As these products are 
designed to integrate into final applications, they do not require reclaiming, recycling, or disposal at the end of their 
lifecycle. Therefore, this consideration is not applicable to the product.
4.	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same. 
	
Reply: While Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) does not directly apply to the entity’s activities, the company 
recognizes its role in responsible packaging practices. Given the minimal plastic content in imported raw material 
packaging, the company has proactively registered as both a Brand Owner and an Importer. The waste collection plan 
is fully aligned with EPR guidelines, ensuring compliance and sustainability. Additionally, the final product is dispatched 
with a protective thin layer of flexible plastic, and certain components are supplied in plastic boxes to ensure safe 
application.
