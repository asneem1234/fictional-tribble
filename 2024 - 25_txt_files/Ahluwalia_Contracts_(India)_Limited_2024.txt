Conduct etc.
During the year, the Company introduced a dedicated training module to enhance employee awareness of human rights. 
Additionally, various awareness sessions are conducted for workers, covering human rights aspects. For instance, induction 
and toolbox talks are mandatory for all workers joining any site, location, or project. The process includes, but is not limited 
to, topics such as wage breakdown, PF deduction, health and safety, account creation for wage deposits and KYC procedures.
Furthermore, systems are in place to ensure compliance with child labour laws (e.g. submission of Aadhar card as proof of age) 
and to prevent forced labour through proof of employment (e.g. wage slips, issuance of gate passes/ID cards).
Daily toolbox talks also address some of these aspects, in addition to job-specific roles. Other covering elements are such as 
child labour, forced labour, discrimination, working hours, wages and grievance redressal mechanisms.
