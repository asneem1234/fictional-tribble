negatively impact 
employee well-being.
The Company remains committed 
to complying with existing water 
management regulations and has 
set clear goals for reducing water 
consumption. Efforts are also 
underway to continuously explore 
better methods for monitoring

targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As the Director responsible for Balmer Lawrie’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report, I’m pleased to share the Company’s progress and continued commitment to responsible 
and inclusive growth. Over the past year, Balmer Lawrie has made significant strides in 
integrating sustainability into its business operations. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
to strengthening workplace well-being and governance practices, our efforts are driven by a long-
term vision of creating shared value for all stakeholders. On the social front, we continue to 
focus on employee well-being, inclusive hiring, and skill development. Our grievance redressal 
mechanisms and CSR initiatives have helped strengthen both internal trust and community impact.

phases due to technical and external constraints, we remain committed to scaling them steadily. 
Strong governance and ethical practices continue to guide our ESG approach, and we are 
integrating sustainability deeper into strategic decision-making. We view this as an ongoing 
journey and are committed to making consistent progress, responsibly and transparently.

Does the entity have an 
anti-corruption or anti-
bribery policy? If yes, 
provide details in brief and 
if available, provide a web-
link to the policy. 
Yes, Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery clauses are incorporated in Balmer Lawrie’s Fraud 
Prevention Policy.
The Company has a Fraud Prevention Policy which covers all aspects of anti-bribery. The 
policy is in place for the detection, reporting and prevention of fraud. This policy covers all 
types of fraud irrespective of their nature. The Fraud Prevention Policy applies to all frauds 
committed or suspected, linked to the business of the Company, involving any employee, 
including the whole- time Directors (employed in any capacity including those deputed 
by other agencies to carry out any work for and on behalf of the Company) and other 
stakeholders such as vendors, suppliers, contractors, service providers, consultants or 
any other external agency / person having business relationship and / or associated with 
the Company in any manner, as well as their representatives.
The clause “Actions constituting fraud” under the sub-clause (x) of the Fraud Prevention 
Policy talks about what constitutes bribery and corruption:
“Bribery or corruption, including inappropriate relationship with third parties causing conflict 
of interest and accepting or seeking anything of material value from contractors, vendors 
or any other person supplying material or providing services to the Company”
The objective of the “Fraud Prevention Policy” is to provide a system for the detection, 
reporting and prevention of fraud, whether committed or suspected. The policy strives to:
• Promote a culture of zero tolerance for fraud or fraudulent conduct
• Communicate to employees and other stakeholders the Company’s approach to dealing 
with fraud and fraudulent action
• Provide a framework and lay down a procedure for the detection, reporting and
prevention of fraud or suspected fraud
Balmer Lawrie also has the Whistle Blower Policy in place. The Whistle Blower Policy 
provides employees a framework to report to the Management instances of unethical 
behaviour, and actual or suspected fraud.
While contracting, one has to deal with various vendors / suppliers / contractors / 
consultants who are expected to adopt and maintain the highest standards and a high 
degree of ethics and integrity, commitment and sincerity towards the work undertaken 
by them. Any aberration, deviation or violation from the expected standards of supplies / 
services / behaviour of the contracting agencies is dealt in line with the policy framed on 
Blacklisting so that it becomes a deterrent for all. This policy is aimed at blacklisting the 
errant vendors and service providers by following the laid-down procedure.

enhance the efficiency of the Vigilance system, technology was leveraged to launch a

Provide 
the 
processes 
for 
consultation 
between stakeholders and the Board on 
economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from 
such consultations provided to the Board.
The Board of Directors places their outlook on the business of the 
Company vis-à-vis the industry / the national and the world economy 
through the Annual Report, which is circulated to the Shareholders. 
The Annual General Meeting of the Company is called and conducted 
every year and the same essentially involves an interactive session 
between the shareholders and the Chairman. The shareholders can 
always send e-mails / letters directly to the Management which will 
be duly responded to.
2
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to 
support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). 
If so, provide details of instances as to how the 
inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and 
activities of the entity. 
Stakeholder consultation plays a vital role in shaping our policies 
and initiatives related to social and environmental matters, 
helping us align our business goals with our responsibilities to 
stakeholders, society and the environment. For instance, based 
on such engagement, a policy was introduced to source products 
from marginalised communities. In areas with a significant tribal 
population, efforts were made to support the formation of Self-Help 
Groups (SHGs), enabling local enterprises to develop and supply 
goods to the Company.

Provide details of instances of engagement 
with, and actions taken to, address the concerns 
of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups. 
While no stakeholder group has been formally identified as vulnerable 
or marginalised, the Company actively engages with certain groups 
to understand their needs and extend support wherever feasible. For 
example, in line with a policy to procure products from marginalised 
sections of society, the Silvassa unit—located in a tribal-dominated 
region—facilitated the formation of stakeholder groups to encourage 
local enterprise development, enabling the Company to source 
goods from these groups.

business? (Yes/No)
Currently, we do not have a focal point responsible for human rights impacts 
or issues caused or contributed to by the business. However, across the 
Company, systems and processes are in place to ensure there are no human 
rights violations. Across the Company the human right issues are addressed by 
the relevant department and division heads.

Describe the internal mechanisms in 
place to redress grievances related to 
human rights issues.
The Company has grievance redressal committees at each region in line with the 
statutory requirements, which duly follow the principle of natural justice. Further, 
the Company believes in the empowerment of all sections of employees and 
has nurtured an open-door policy towards redressing grievances proactively. 
Reliance on open-door policy and time-bound redressal of employee grievances 
has been a cornerstone in not only having a committed workforce, but it has also 
contributed to and reflected in the active participative culture in the Company.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House 
Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
Yes, the entity has projects related to reducing 
Green House Gas Emission.
Installed 1346 kWp Solar Power Plant, which is 
in operation to date.  This reduces reliance on 
fossil fuel-based energy and meets our energy 
needs through renewable sources.
SBU IP:
1.	 The unit has installed the 300 kWp Solar 
Power Generation Project, which reduces 
greenhouse gas emissions. A 300 kWp solar 
power system can offset a significant amount 
of carbon emissions annually. Assuming an 
average of 1.25 kWh of electricity generation 
per kWp per day, a 300 kWp system would 
generate roughly 136,875 kWh per year. This 
translates to a reduction of approximately 
116.4 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year, 
based on an average of 0.846 Kg of CO2 
generation per kWh. 
2.	 Centralised Capacitor hybrid panel installed- 
improving power factor and reducing MSEB 
power consumption.
3.	 Planning to switchover from LDO to PNG. 
Discussion ongoing with Vadodara Gas Ltd.
4.	 The entity has successfully completed the 
burner conversion project—from LDO to 
LPG—in all its paint and lacquer ovens, 
resulting in a substantial reduction of SOx 
and NOx emissions, thereby contributing to a 
cleaner and more sustainable environment.
5.	 Installation of 5 nos. 60W Solar Street Lights.
6.	 Installation of 100kvar No-Load compensator 
for optimum utilisation of electrical power.
7.	 Conversion of fuel, from HSD to PNG in 
Baking ovens.
8.	 Installation of Dual Fuel Kit on 750 KVA DG 
set. 
SBU Chemicals: Yes.
We are in the process of Conversion of Fuel 
used in Boiler from LDO (Light Diesel Oil) / FO 
(Furnace Oil) to LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas). 
This will reduce the NOx emission. 
Existing emission of NOx is 0.3053 g/s, which 
will be reduced to 0.0884 g/s.
We have also installed solar plant capacity of 200 
kWp, which in turn reduces the Co2 Emission, 
by drawing equivalent power made in Thermal 
power plant.

Briefly 
describe 
the 
waste 
management 
practices 
adopted 
in 
your 
establishments. 
Describe the strategy 
adopted 
by 
your 
company 
to 
reduce 
usage of hazardous and 
toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes 
and 
the 
practices 
adopted 
to 
manage 
such wastes
SBU LI: A service-oriented facility and does not engage in any manufacturing or 
production activity that generates industrial waste. The only waste generated at the CFS 
/ Warehouse consists of packaging materials, which are disposed of through appropriate 
and authorised channels in compliance with applicable waste management regulations. 
Also, no hazardous or toxic chemicals are used in any process or activity at the CFS.
SBU G&L: Waste generated at the plant is segregated into hazardous and non-hazardous 
categories. Hazardous waste is disposed of through authorised agencies, in compliance 
with local Pollution Control Board (PCB) guidelines. Additionally, a dust collector system 
has been installed to prevent contamination of breathing air by hazardous particles during 
the batch processing of greases.
SBU Chemicals: We are producing Sulphochlorination intermediate, where Sulphur 
dioxide gas is used. There is a limitation in this reaction, where only 50% only gets reacted 
and the balance is vented and scrubbed out, resulting in the generation of salt (Basic 
Chromium Sulphate / Sodium Sulphate). 
Hence, we have adopted a series reaction, by connecting the reactors in series (Vent from 
one reactor will be connected as input to the next Reactor). Due to this, the SO2 utilisation 
is increased up to 62%. 
Now, efforts are being made to  further increase the efficiency of SO2 utilisation from 62% 
to 79%.
SBU IP: 
1.	The paint sludge generated is stored in the drums and disposed of through Government-
authorised re-processors / co-processors.
2.	Effluent Treatment Plant and Sewage Treatment Plant are installed for the treatment 
of processed water.
3.	Rules followed for Hazardous and other Wastes are carried out by the authorised 
agencies of HSPCB, GEPIL.
4.	The water used for barrel degreasing is treated as effluent and routed to the Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant for effective recovery and treatment. Measures such as 
the use of low-oil steel coils and optimisation of the degreasing chemical formulation 
(achieving effective cleaning with reduced dosage) have led to a reduction in water 
consumption, from 5 litres per barrel to 3.5 litres per barrel
5.	2 nos. Belt-type Oil skimmers are installed in the barrel washing line, to remove oil 
contents from the chemical mixed water bath chamber.
6.	Hazardous waste is generated from application of paint spray, same is collected and 
disposed through MPCB authorised agency.
7.	To reduce the hazardous waste - implementation of Heavy metal free paint and 
improving paint and lacquer yield.
8.	MOU with Bharuch Enviro Infrastructure Ltd. approved by GPCB for Waste Disposal. 
Maintaining Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) Plant inhouse.

SBU Chemicals: Fat liquors are produced from Paraffin wax, which is a derivative 
of Fossil Fuel. Now we have replaced close to 15% of Paraffin wax with Renewable 
Vegetable sources in production of High-Performance Fat liquors. These Fat liquors 
are more Biodegradable, leading less load to the effluent generated at the Tanneries.
SBU IP:
• Value chain emissions, also known as Scope 3 emissions, refer to the greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. We also improved our transportation utilising Green Fuel 
Trucks i.e CNG.
• By changing the lacquer application process, consumption of fuel was reduced 
which in turn reduced the Carbin Dioxide emission. In FY 24-25 about 34 MT of 
carbon dioxide emission was reduced.

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
There are multiple mechanisms for separate SBUs for receiving and responding to consumer complaints. The same 
are listed below. 
SBU - Chemicals: On receipt of complaint at Sales Office, if any, same is recorded in SAP. Customer site is visited 
to collect sample. Sample is sent to QC for analysis against counter sample of same batch. If any quality deviation 
is found, correction will be done at customer site itself, if possible. Otherwise, the material will be collected back for 
reprocessing and re-use. Also, corrective action will be taken to avoid recurrence. 
SBU - G&L: On receipt of complaints at Sales Office, the same is recorded in SAP. A visit to customer site is made if 
found necessary otherwise the personnel speaks over phone with the customer to understand the problem. Sample 
is collected for evaluation in our QA laboratory or R&D centre and is compared with counter sample. We do elemental 
analysis of greases and lubricants with sophisticated instruments, if found necessary, to find contamination if occurred 
at customer end. In case we find that customer is not following correct procedure to maintain the lubricants or failure of 
mechanical components, we guide them to rectify the same. In some cases, we send additives to correct the products 
during usage as rectification, if possible, at site. If any other kind of defect in products is observed, we replace the 
material at the earliest. We communicate the laboratory report to the sales team to forward the same to the customers. 
SBU - IP: Customer complaints received by Marketing / Field Officer / Sales Admin, are recorded in specified format. 
Joint inspection by Field Officer and Quality Representative at Customer site is done within 48 hours. If any quality 
deviation is found, efforts are made to correct at customer premises itself, otherwise, the material is returned for 
further corrections. RCA & CAPA are carried out and submitted to customer to avoid recurrence. 
SBU-CC: Escalation matrix provided to customers. 
SBU - LI: On receipt of any customer complaint pertaining to any of the 3 Container Freight Stations on email, the 
same is attended immediately by the Department concerned (Accounts or Sales or Operations) as the case may be. 
The medium of receipt of complaints as well as the responses from our end is over email only. As per our SOP, we 
are supposed to resolve all our customer complaints across all locations within 3 working days and the same has also 
been made a part of the KPTs of employees concerned for timely compliance. 
SBU- Travel & Vacations: For any kind of customer feedback/compliant, BL has dedicated email id (also available 
in BL Website), where the customer can give the feedback/ complaints. Even the customer may complain directly in 
concerned Branch Manager email id. BL take necessary action to resolve the issues within 48 hrs after receipt of the 
same.
