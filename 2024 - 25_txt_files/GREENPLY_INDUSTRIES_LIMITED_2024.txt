1
Climate 
Change 
and GHG 
Emissions
Risk
The escalating impacts 
of climate change pose a 
significant threat to business 
operations, particularly in 
global supply chains. The 
unpredictability of these 
effects, such as disruptions 
caused by extreme weather 
events, increased GHG 
emissions underscores the 
importance of recognizing 
climate change as a critical 
risk factor.
Although our company operates 
with relatively low emissions, 
we actively participate in 
climate change mitigation 
efforts. Our strategy includes 
sustainable forest management 
and plantation initiatives, which 
not only contribute to reducing 
our carbon footprint but also 
enhance our resilience against 
climaterelated risks.
Climate change introduces 
financial uncertainty, particularly 
through the potential volatility 
of seasonal cash flows due 
to more frequent and severe 
extreme weather events, such as 
cyclones, floods, and wildfires. 
This risk is further compounded 
by increased GHG emissions 
and the possibility of higher 
insurance premiums and the 
reduced availability of insurance 
coverage for assets located in 
high-risk areas.

2
Energy Usage Risk and 
Opportunity
Managing energy usage is 
essential for minimizing 
our carbon footprint and 
controlling operational 
costs. Efficient energy 
use and a shift towards 
renewable energy sources 
can significantly impact both 
environmental and financial 
performance.
Implement technology solutions 
and plant optimizations to 
lower energy consumption. 
Invest in renewable energy 
sources to enhance the share 
of renewable electricity. Manage 
dust emissions by improving 
processes across log handling, 
chipping, screening, and 
veneer trimming. Monitor and 
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from our operations.
Inadequate efforts to reduce 
energy use coupled with a lack 
of renewable energy adoption, 
can lead to higher operational 
costs and potential penalties.
3
Sustainable 
Forest 
Management
Opportunity
Sustainable sourcing of 
raw materials is crucial for 
addressing environmental 
issues like deforestation 
and habitat destruction. 
By adopting responsible 
practices, we can reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions 
and enhance our ESG 
performance.
GIL engages in sustainable 
forest management and 
plantation activities, sourcing 
all timber through agroforestry. 
This approach ensures no 
deforestation and supports the 
creation of a sustainable raw 
material supply while fostering 
strong community relationships.
Sustainable sourcing practices 
can reduce environmental risks, 
potentially lower operational 
costs, and improve ESG 
performance, which may lead 
to favorable market positioning 
and stronger stakeholder 
relationships.
4
Water 
Footprint 
and Related 
Risks
Risk
Effective management of 
natural resources, particularly 
water, is essential to prevent 
overextraction in local and 
waterstressed regions. For a 
plywood manufacturing entity 
like GIL, controlling water use 
and disposal is crucial.
Implement technology solutions 
and plant optimizations to 
reduce water consumption. 
Recycle wastewater from the 
RO system into reservoirs for 
use in sprinklers, which helps 
replenish the groundwater 
table and improves local water 
availability
Operations in waterstressed 
areas can lead to higher costs 
for water procurement, whether 
from tankers or municipal 
sources. Enhanced water 
management practices can help 
mitigate these costs and improve 
overall resource efficiency.
5
Waste 
Generation & 
Disposal
Opportunity
Effective waste management 
is crucial to prevent pollution 
and contamination of 
earth, water, and air. Proper 
handling of waste can 
mitigate environmental 
impacts and align with 
regulatory requirements.
Reuse wood waste as fuel and 
modify processes to minimize 
operational waste. Implement 
welldefined waste management 
procedures. Ensure appropriate 
disposal of hazardous waste 
in compliance with regulatory 
standards through authorized 
vendors.
Implementing robust waste 
management practices can lead 
to cost savings through the 
reuse of materials and avoid 
fines and penalties. Additionally, 
reducing waste improves the 
environmental footprint and 
enhances operational efficiency.

Safety and 
Health for 
Workers and 
Contractors
Risk and 
Opportunity
Safety and Health for 
workers and contractors is 
central to our strategy due 
to its significant impact 
on staff safety and overall 
productivity. Addressing 
workrelated injuries and 
focusing on employee 
wellbeing is essential for 
maintaining a productive 
workforce and reducing 
health hazards across our 
operations.
At GIL, we emphasize 
a comprehensive OHS 
management system, including 
training and awareness for 
all stakeholders. Our goal 
is to minimize workplace 
incidents through a robust 
safety management system and 
continuous improvement in 
safety practices.
A strong focus on occupational 
health and safety not only 
enhances our brand image but 
also promotes worker morale, 
potentially leading to increased 
productivity, lower turnover, and 
better community relations. 
Furthermore, maintaining a safe 
working environment reduces 
compensation expenses and 
minimizes downtime associated 
with safety inquiries.
7
Community 
Relationship
Opportunity
Community relationship 
is crucial for the wood-
based industry as it fosters 
measurable and positive 
changes within the local 
communities where the 
company operates. This 
engagement helps in 
building trust and creating a 
supportive work environment.
GIL actively participates in 
community development 
programs, engagement 
exercises, and regular impact 
assessments. These efforts 
are designed to foster strong 
relationships with local 
communities and address their 
needs effectively.
Effective community engagement 
can establish trust and create 
a favourable work environment, 
leading to smoother operations 
and operational benefits. This 
positive relationship with local 
communities can contribute to 
long-term stability and support 
for the company’s activities
8
Training and 
Education
Opportunity
Investing in the skill 
development of employees 
and fostering a healthy 
working environment is 
crucial for enhancing 
workforce capabilities 
and ensuring a productive 
workplace.
GIL is committed to upgrading 
employees and management 
through training in the latest 
technologies and industry 
best practices. This focus 
on continuous learning 
helps maintain a skilled and 
motivated workforce.
Effective skill development and 
a positive work environment 
are key to attracting, retaining, 
and motivating talent, which is 
essential for achieving business 
success in a competitive 
industry. These practices can 
lead to higher productivity, 
reduced turnover, and a stronger 
competitive position.
9
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Promoting a diverse 
workforce and providing 
equal opportunities are vital 
for fostering effective human 
capital development and 
engaging local communities 
in manufacturing operations. 
This approach contributes 
to a more inclusive and 
supportive work environment.
GIL is committed to diversity 
and inclusion, exemplified by 
initiatives such as employing 
women carpenters and 
architects. By ensuring equal 
opportunities and addressing 
discriminatory practices, we 
aim to build a comprehensive 
and equitable organizational 
culture.
A diverse workplace enhances 
talent retention, improves 
customer orientation, and 
boosts employee satisfaction 
and decision-making. These 
benefits contribute to increased 
organizational returns and 
create a positive feedback 
loop for continued growth and 
success

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding theplacement of this disclosure)
	
As India’s one of the largest plywood and wood-based manufacturing Company, we recognize the pressing need for bold 
corporate actions and transformative measures in response to the climate crisis. Throughout the year, we have made significant 
progress in integrating sustainability into our core business practices. Our first sustainability report, “”Growing Together,”” served 
as a valuable tool to assess our non-financial performance and identify areas for improvement. Also, last year we published 2nd 
ESG report. Which provided a roadmap till FY 2025, integrating sustainability into our business operations covering aspects of 
environment, social and governance. We acknowledge that there is immense potential to prioritize and embed sustainability 
throughout our entire value chain, starting from the strategy stage.
	
Sustainability principles and practices have been an integral part of our business right from the start and the idea of sustainability 
is not new to GIL, our business relies on natural resource as key raw material, and we understand that it is an imperative that we 
replenish what we take from the natural ecosystem. Our fundamental values as a business unit have ensured that we foster the 
well-being of the communities in which we operate. At GIL, we recognize the importance of preserving nature and giving back 
more than we take. All our manufactured products are sourced from plantation timber, and through our plantation activities, we 
actively collaborate with local communities to support livelihoods.Our efforts have resulted in improved biodiversity, increased 
green cover around our plant locations, and enhanced social conditions for the communities we work with. We remain steadfast 
in maintaining ecological harmony and continue to collaborate with all stakeholders in this pursuit. Moreover, we have focused 
on stakeholder engagement, compliance & ethics, people, environment, and communities as our key focal points in the pursuit 
of sustainability. We firmly believe that the goodwill we earn in the industry and among our customers plays a vital role in 
sustainable business achievement.With our strategic initiative, ‘ESG360,’ we are already cultivating a business strategy that 
embraces sustainability and respects both people and the planet. Looking ahead, we are committed to objectively considering 
all potential sustainability impacts that may affect our business and stakeholders. Our sustainability agenda will encompass 
a comprehensive assessment of risks and opportunities beyond the traditional financial and strategic aspects.We are proud 
of our progress towards becoming a more sustainable and inclusive company, but we know that there is still more work to be 
done. Together, we can build a future that not only brings success to our business but also leaves a positive and lasting impact 
on society and the environment

10	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments.
Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
As Greenply targets to be a zero-waste company, here waste generated from operations is monitored very closely. We 
focus on both hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated for its proper reuse as well as disposal. Our hazardous 
waste mainly comes from the formaldehyde-based resin, which is used as adhesive in plywood manufacturing. This 
manufacturing process is monitored continuously through quality checks to ensure structural integrity of the end product. 
Wood chips formed during the plywood manufacturing process are used for energy generation, thus no wood waste is 
generated. The Company consumes waste products (side cutting, dust etc.) as fuel in the boilers. The water exiting the 
production system is cleaned and recirculated for boiling water strains. Another use of this water is to maintain the 
humidity of the production area where small sprinklers are provided at each operation site. We have waste management 
system in place to comply with the requirements of Pollution Control Board’s standards in air and water quality. All 
hazardous waste is disposed through registered waste management services. All waste data is reviewed monthly by the 
department head to create action points on the gaps identified.
