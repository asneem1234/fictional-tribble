CORPORATE OVERVIEW
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 The entity has established a structured and inclusive approach to engage with its key stakeholders on economic, 
environmental, and social matters. Consultations are conducted through a variety of channels such as formal meetings, 
feedback mechanisms, investor interactions, community outreach, employee surveys, supplier discussions, and regulatory 
engagements. These interactions enable the organization to capture stakeholder perspectives on ESG-related concerns, 
emerging risks, and expectations.
 
 The responsibility for conducting these engagements lies primarily with the senior management team and functional 
heads. Insights and concerns gathered through these consultations are synthesized into actionable feedback and reported 
to the Board at regular intervals-either as part of strategic review meetings or through dedicated sustainability updates. 
This two-way communication ensures that stakeholder expectations are factored into high-level decision-making, while 
reinforcing the organization’s commitment to transparency, responsiveness, and sustainable value creation.
 
 Yes. Stakeholder consultations are a key input mechanism for identifying, prioritizing, and addressing environmental and 
social topics relevant to the entity’s operations and value chain. Through regular interactions with employees, suppliers, 
customers, investors, regulatory bodies, and local communities, the organization captures emerging expectations and 
concerns related to areas such as energy use, waste management, workplace safety, and community development.
 
 These inputs are reviewed by functional heads and senior management and are considered in the design and review of 
ESG-linked policies and programs. For example, feedback from internal safety committees and worker representatives 
has helped enhance workplace health and safety protocols across manufacturing locations. Similarly, engagement 
with suppliers has led to the strengthening of procurement guidelines around environmental compliance and social 
performance. All such recommendations are periodically escalated to the Board or relevant sub-committees for 
integration into policy updates and operational improvements, thereby reinforcing a stakeholder-informed approach to 
sustainable growth.
 
 The Company actively engages with vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups through structured community 
interactions, social baseline assessments, and targeted outreach initiatives conducted prior to the implementation of 
basic amenities, education, health services, and livelihood opportunities.
 
 Based on the insights gathered, the Company has designed and implemented community development initiatives that 
directly respond to the needs expressed - including health awareness camps, skill-building sessions, and infrastructure 
economically disadvantaged groups in these programs. Engagement outcomes are reviewed periodically to ensure 
that the actions taken are meaningful, sustainable, and aligned with the Company’s broader ESG and CSR objectives. 
This ongoing dialogue reinforces the Company’s commitment to inclusive development and stakeholder well-being.
