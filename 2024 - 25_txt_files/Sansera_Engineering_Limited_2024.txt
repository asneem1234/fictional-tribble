GHG Emissions 
Risk 
Automotive 
parts 
manufacturing 
is 
a 
high-emission activity 
subject 
to 
scrutiny 
from key stakeholders 
including customers, 
investors, 
and 
governments. 
Customers 
may 
require commitments 
to lower greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions 
GHG emissions can 
be mitigated by (1) 
Conducting energy 
audits 
and 
identifying areas of 
energy 
reduction 
(2) 
Increased 
sourcing 
of 
renewable energy. 
In 
the 
current 
financial 
year, 
a 
total of 60% of 
Failure to mitigate GHG emissions 
could lead to potential business 
loss, disinterest from specific 
groups of investors, and increased 
costs to comply with regulatory 
requirements. 
Positive 
Implications are savings from RE 
transition. Our product may fall 
under competitive premiums such 
as “Green products”. This shall be 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
sustainability linked loan.

invest 
only in companies that 
achieve 
GHG

targets. 
Additionally, 
the 
government 
is 
working 
on 
implementing a cap-
and-trade

2 
Waste Management 
Risk/Opportunity 
Improper handling of 
hazardous waste by 
waste 
management 
contractors presents 
risks to land, water 
bodies, 
and 
biodiversity. Adopting 
circular 
economy 
principles for waste 
recycling 
could 
provide Sansera with a 
valuable opportunity 
to 
minimise 
waste 
generation.  
 
Ensuring 
that 
hazardous waste is 
handled 
and 
disposed of only by 
contractors 
authorised by the 
State 
Pollution 
Control Board.  
Circular 
economy 
initiatives include  
(1) 
recycling 
of 
discarded 
scrap 
steel and  
(2) achieving zero 
waste to landfill.  
Negative financial implications 
may arise as capital expenditure 
for recycling discarded scrap steel. 
Additionally, financial costs could 
result from compensation due to 
improper handling of hazardous 
waste. Positive implications may 
include reduced compliance costs, 
lowered GHG emissions, and 
better 
alignment 
with 
the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDG).

Energy management 
Opportunity 
Sansera’s 
manufacturing 
process consumes a 
substantial amount of 
energy, 
and 
conserving energy not 
only 
improves 
our 
financial performance 
but 
also 
supports 
achieving 
our 
emissions 
reduction 
goals.  
 
Identifying areas for 
energy 
reduction 
and implementing 
appropriate 
measures 
— 
all 
Sansera plants are 
certified under ISO 
50001 (2018) for 
Energy 
Management 
Systems.  
 
Negative financial implications 
could result in the form of capital 
expenditure for implementation 
of energy reduction initiatives

implications 
to 
the 
company's business could result 
from initiatives taken around 
energy management attracting 
customers aligned to sustainable 
businesses

Sustainable Supply Chain 
Risk 
Failure to ensure 
sustainable practices 
throughout the supply 
chain, such as 
responsible sourcing 
of raw materials, 
waste management, 
and compliance with

regulations, can result 
in reputational 
damage and potential 
legal consequences. 
Ethical and social 
responsibility risks 
include issues such as 
labour rights 
violations, human 
rights abuses, child 
labour, or unsafe 
working conditions 
within supplier 
facilities.  
Sansera has taken 
various measures 
to mitigate risks 
arising in the supply 
chain including: 
1. Adopting policies 
for responsible 
sourcing namely, 
Supplier 
Responsible 
Sourcing of Natural 
RM Policy, 
Sustainable 
Procurement 
Policy, and Sansera 
Principles to 
Enhance 
Sustainability 
Performance in the 
Supply Chain and 
Sansera policy on

2. Sansera's 
suppliers are 
required to sign 
commitments to 
the policies (except

sustainability 
assessments are 
conducted before 
onboarding

suppliers may lack resources for 
compliance. Positive Implications 
lead to reduce waste & energy 
cost. It helps in maintaining 
regulatory compliance.

lead to exploitation of 
vulnerabilities 
in 
networks, or software, 
to gain unauthorized 
access 
to 
the 
company's 
sensitive 
data or disrupt critical 
systems. 
Data 
breaches 
can 
occur due to external 
attacks, 
insider 
threats, or inadequate 
security 
measures, 
leading 
to 
unauthorized access, 
theft, or exposure of 
confidential 
information. 
Sansera has 
deployed and 
implemented 
various technical 
tools and controls

Performance of 
the entity against 
the specific 
commitments, 
goals and targets 
along-with 
reasons in case 
the same are not 
met. 
Sansera is actively advancing its sustainability objectives through a focussed and structured approach to sustainability across various fronts. 
Significant achievements include achieving 100% training on the code of conduct and policies under Ethics & Compliance. In Waste Management, 
Sansera has successfully eliminated 95% of waste to landfill, as the waste is being used as alternate fuel raw material for other industries such as 
cement, among others. Efforts in Occupational Safety and Health are focussed on implementing safety protocols to achieve a reduction in recordable 
injuries by 2030. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion initiatives are underway, with current progress showing more than 5.4% women in the workforce, 
towards a target of 10% by 2030. The Sustainable Supply Chain initiative has been completed for 65% of suppliers, with plans to cover 75% by 2027. 
Transparency & Disclosure efforts include ongoing implementation of an ESG data management system to enhance reporting and transparency 
across operations. Sansera has sourced 60% of its electricity from renewable sources such as Solar, Wind and GC Hybrid. Considering the electricity 
and fuel consumption such as diesel and natural gas, Sansera’s Clean energy accounts to 48% and intends to achieve 80% by 2030. These efforts 
underscore Sansera’s commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices, aligning its operations with global ESG standards while 
continuously striving to meet and exceed its set targets

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  
b 
What are the processes used to 
identify work-related hazards and 
assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity? 
The Company has implemented a Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) system for identifying workplace 
hazards, undertaking risk assessments, implementing 
necessary controls to mitigate and address risks.  
SEL identifies possible workplace incidents using a hazard 
identification process, followed by a likelihood assessment 
to estimate their frequency or probability. Measures are 
then implemented to either prevent these incidents by 
reducing their likelihood or control them to limit their extent 
and duration, thereby mitigating adverse effects or 
consequences. In addition to this, the Company has 
prepared an Emergency Preparedness Plan, and OCP - 
Operation control procedure/Standards to minimise work-
related hazards, among others. SEL ensures HIRA for all 
activities and products and conducts HIRA studies on an 
annual basis or as and when required. The necessary 
guidelines are implemented in line with ISO 45001.  
c 
Whether you have processes for 
workers to report the work-related 
hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N) 
Yes, several methods have been put in place to report work-
related hazards in accordance with ISO 45001, including 
safety patrols, risk assessments, and near-miss reporting 
etc.  
Work-related hazards are reported using the respective 
formats to the Plant EHS Officer, who in turn reports to the 
Plant head and maintenance team.  
Corrective measures, if any, are then identified and 
implemented by the Plant EHS and maintenance team. To 
mitigate work-related hazards, SEL conducts emergency 
mock drills and awareness sessions to prepare its employees 
and workers. 
d 
Do the employees/ worker of the 
entity have access to non-
occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No) 
Yes, employees/workers of the entity have access to non-
occupational medical and healthcare services. These include 
services for issues such as road accidents, medical insurance 
for employees and provision of Company ambulance 
facilities in case of any emergency (extended to families of 
the employees).  
The Company ensures overall well-being of its employees 
and workers by providing health insurance, term insurance, 
accident insurance, regular health check-ups and workshops 
for the mental well-being.

Previously, GHG emissions data was not 
captured; however, it is now actively 
monitored and submitted to customers as 
needed. Initially, carbon reduction goals 
were not included in the EHS objectives, 
but these goals are now clearly defined. 
Treated effluent was not considered in 
environmental 
aspects 
and 
hazard

but 
has 
since 
been 
incorporated into the assessment of 
aspects, impacts, hazards, risks, control 
measures, opportunities, and impact

previously unaddressed but is now in 
place and managed by human resources 
and the management team. Based on 
recommendations, smoke detectors have 
been installed in the goods storage area. 
Additionally, first aid cases are now 
analysed to better understand their root 
causes.

pit and septic tank. The treated water from these systems 
is repurposed for gardening. Specifically, Plant 4 in 
Manesar and Plant 6 in Rudrapur have wastewater 
treatment systems, with the treated water subsequently 
sent to the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP).

Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our 
engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information 
included in the integrated reporting, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this 
information. It was not part of our engagement to review product- or service-related 
information, references to external information sources, expert opinions and future-related 
statements in the Report. 
Responsibility of the Company 
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the 
sustainability information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This responsibility includes 
in particular the selection and use of appropriate methods for sustainability reporting, the 
collection and compilation of information and the making of appropriate assumptions or, 
where appropriate, the making of appropriate estimates. Furthermore, the legal 
representatives are responsible for necessary internal controls to enable the preparation of a 
sustainability report that is free of material - intentional or unintentional - erroneous information. 
Verification methodology and procedures performed 
The verification engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the 
verification methodology developed by the TÜV SÜD Group, which is based upon the ISAE 
3000 (Revised), and ISO 17029. The applied level of assurance was “limited assurance”. 
Because the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance, the engagement is lower than 
in a reasonable assurance engagement, the procedures the verification team performs in a 
limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, 
a reasonable assurance engagement. A limited assurance engagement consists of making 
inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability information 
and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures.  
The verification was based on a systematic and evidence-based assurance process limited as 
stated above. The selection of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgment. 
The procedures included amongst others: 
- 
Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for the stakeholder engagement und materiality 
analysis to understand the reporting boundaries. 
- 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for compiling, 
analysing, and aggregating sustainability information as well as for internal controls 
- 
Inquiries of company’s representatives responsible for collecting, preparing and 
consolidating sustainability information and performing internal controls
