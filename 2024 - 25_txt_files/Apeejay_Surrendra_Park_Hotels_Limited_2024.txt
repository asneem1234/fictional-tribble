EXPERIENCES.  
EXCEPTIONAL 
VALUE.
We have always believed that hospitality is more 
than a service; it is a carefully crafted experience that 
delights, surprises, and stays with you. This belief 
comes to life at our properties – where elegant design 
meets vibrant energy, and every touchpoint is curated 
to embody modern luxury, cultural richness, and our 
unique individuality.
As we evolve, our belief continues to find fresh 
expressions – through thoughtfully designed hotels 
in emerging locations, formats that speak to new-age 
travellers, and deeper investments in food, music, 
art, and community. Every venture we undertake 
is not just about expanding presence but about 
enriching our purpose – to infuse new energy into the 
hospitality landscape while staying closely attuned to 
evolving guest expectations. Our entry into the luxury 
heritage segment, our commitment to deepening our 
presence in South India, and our foray into the highly 
competitive Mumbai market are all guided by  
this purpose.
Our purpose has shaped our progress – seen in 
our sustained expansion, rooted in environmental 
responsibility, and in our operational excellence, 
strengthened by a culture of innovation.  
Our measured yet robust growth reflects this 
balanced approach – one that has led to resounding 
success over the years. We have delivered bold and 
joyful experiences, established our leadership in key 
segments, and created enduring value for all our 
stakeholders for over six decades.
We continue to create a distinctive hospitality 
experience for our guests, one that is carefully 
designed and consistently delivered.
The Exceptional Value we Deliver 
Embody our Success. Growth. 
Progress.

SUCCESS –  
ETCHED IN  
REGAL HERITAGE
At Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels, 
success is not measured by scale 
alone; it is defined by our ability to 
shape culture, elevate experiences, 
and stay true to our belief in design, 
innovation, and purpose. As a brand 
that pioneered the luxury boutique 
segment, we continue to make bold 
strategic choices to strengthen our 
leadership in the premium hospitality 
space and reimagine what luxury 
means in a modern, Indian context.
Ran Baas, The Palace, Patiala
INTRODUCTION
06     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Palace Properties: A Symbol of 
Strategic Evolution
Among the most defining actions during the year 
was our entry into the heritage luxury segment with 
the launch of THE Lotus Palace in Chettinad and Ran 
Baas, The Palace in Patiala, under THE Park Collection 
brand. This foray marks an inflection point for  
us – reaffirming our commitment to experiential 
luxury, rooted in culture. These palaces offer guests 
the rare privilege of co-living with history,  
with tradition woven into every frame, with every 
moment evoking a sense of timelessness.
•	 THE Lotus Palace delivered a strong debut with 
its 15 rooms. Recording an ARR of INR 14,699, the 
property validated the demand for curated  
heritage experiences.
•	 Ran Baas, The Palace, achieved a occupancy 
of 42% at an ARR of INR 24,000 in Q4. With 35 
suites, the property holds significant ramp-up 
potential. Its inclusion in the prestigious Relais & 
Châteaux network marked a new chapter, placing 
us among the world’s finest hospitality destinations 
and unlocking global visibility, pricing power,  
and prestige.
Looking Ahead: Expanding the Legacy
Building on the momentum we achieved during the year, we are set to deepen our presence in the luxury 
heritage segment. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to acquire Malabar House in 
Fort Kochi (17 rooms), a distinguished Relais & Châteaux property known for its artistic soul, heritage charm, 
and high ARR performance. This signals our intent to thoughtfully scale what we have begun: luxury that is 
intimate, experiential, and steeped in legacy.
A Year of Many Wins
Apart from our entry into the luxury heritage segment, several other wins showcased our success during the year.
A Historic Dividend Milestone
The Board approved our maiden 50% dividend,  
a reflection of robust financial performance and  
long-term value creation for shareholders.
Culinary Excellence as a Brand Driver
Our signature F&B destinations remained key to our 
appeal, reinforcing our status as trendsetters  
in design-led dining and nightlife.
Market Leadership Reaffirmed
We sustained our position as a leader in the  
upper-upscale segment, with national occupancy  
at 92% and 100% occupancy at our flagship Kolkata 
properties. 
Clarity of Direction through the 3Gs
Our Growth, Governance, and Green strategy 
continued to serve as a strong basis of our onwards 
journey, guiding decision-making and differentiation 
in a dynamic market.

GROWTH – 
ANCHORED IN 
A LEGACY OF 
DISTINCTION AND 
DELIGHT
Growth, for us, has always meant 
more than numbers – it has been 
about deepening our leadership 
through differentiation. This belief 
finds its fullest expression in  
Flurys — a century-old icon that 
continues to expand with soul,  
style, and substance.
Now, with a refreshed identity captured in its new 
logo and a new central production hub in Delhi NCR, 
together with its entry into new regions, Flurys best 
represents our blueprint for identity-led, scalable 
growth. Flurys is a brand that is expanding not by 
chasing trends, but by deepening – and showcasing  
as part of its enduring brand appeal – its century 
-old legacy.
This standout spirit defined our broader performance 
during the year. We delivered record profitability, 
market-leading occupancy at 92%, a continued uplift 
in ARR and RevPAR – clear signs of the growing 
preference for curated, premium hospitality – and our 
best-ever results. Our hotels in Kolkata, Chennai,  
and Navi Mumbai outperformed expectations while, 
we continued to strengthen our presence in  
other metros.
We advanced on multiple growth vectors – from 
entering strategic new markets like Mumbai and 
Kochi to growing the Zone and Zone Connect 
formats. Alongside, we reimagined several F&B 
venues and refreshed  brand stories to connect with 
modern travellers. Across it all, our differentiation 
through design, service, and crafting of joyful guest 
experiences remained our hallmark.
Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth by 
blending strategy, soul, performance and purpose. Be 
it through a heritage icon like Flurys or our expanding 
hotel portfolio, we are growing not to be the largest 
hotel chain but to nurture our legacy  
of being timeless yet contemporary, being distinctive  
yet deeply familiar.

A Century is Just the Beginning...
Flurys, the charming tearoom that first opened its 
doors on Kolkata’s Park Street in 1927, has just crossed 
a remarkable milestone – 100 outlets across India. For 
Flurys, which began life as a colonial-era patisserie, 
this is more than a number. Not many establishments 
survive the tide of time. And only a handful transcend 
geography, nostalgia, and generations.
In an era of rapid change, Flurys has grown with 
intent and poise – a growth bolstered by brand trust, 
emotional recall, and a refusal to be just another name 
in the crowd. 
But nostalgia alone cannot fuel growth. The real story 
of Flurys’ growth from a single-location heritage café 
to a 100-outlet national brand lies in its ability to retain 
its soul. Its expansion into airports, malls, and modern 
retail locations hasn’t diluted its character; rather, it 
has brought its legacy to a wider, younger, and more 
mobile India.
At a time when authenticity is often sacrificed at 
the altar of scale, Flurys shows that heritage, when 
nurtured with care and modernised with intelligence, 
can remain relevant — and even aspirational — in an 
age of instant gratification. The 100-outlet milestone 
is just an inflection point in its extraordinary journey.

CHAIRPERSON’S STATEMENT 
LEADING WITH 
DISTINCTION, 
GROWING WITH 
PURPOSE
Dear Shareholders,
It gives me immense pride to present to you the 
second Annual Report of Apeejay Surrendra Park 
Hotels Limited. FY 2024-25 has truly been a defining 
year in our journey, one that showcased strong 
operational performance, strategic momentum, and 
our ultimate commitment to curating Anything But 
Ordinary™ experiences across India.
This was also our first full year as a publicly listed 
company, a milestone made even more special by the 
overwhelming response to our IPO. The confidence 
shown by our investors reinforces our belief in the 
path we have chosen – one of bold yet elegant design, 
differentiated hospitality, and sustainable growth. 
Backed by a strong balance sheet, we are  
well-positioned to accelerate our next phase of 
expansion with financial prudence and focused intent.
A Tailwind for Travel
The world might still be navigating economic and 
political uncertainties, but human wanderlust remains 
as strong as ever. According to International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) forecasts, global air 
passenger traffic is likely to surpass 5 billion for the 
first time in 2025. Meanwhile, emerging trends such as 
the shift towards sustainable and ethical tourism, the 
rise of digital technology, and the pushback against 
overtourism are reshaping global travel preferences. 
Luxury travel continues to thrive, though increasingly 
shaped by evolving consumer expectations, 
environmental consciousness, and the changing 
geopolitical dynamics.
India is aligned with this global resurgence in 
travel and tourism. In 2024, it welcomed 20 million 
international visitors, 2.3 million more than in 2019, 
reaffirming its status as a premier global destination. 
The country’s hospitality sector is stepping up in 
alignment with the World Travel & Tourism Council 
(WTTC), calling for investments and a rethink on 
recent cuts to overseas tourism promotion. 
PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC POSITIONING
22     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Backed by pro-investment reforms such as 100% FDI 
through the automatic route, tax holidays for hotels 
near UNESCO sites, streamlined approvals via the 
Hospitality Development and Promotion Board, and 
INR 2 billion allocation for pilgrimage circuits, the 
sector is well-positioned to meet rising demand and 
boost infrastructure readiness. With the Union Budget 
allocating over INR 2,541 crores toward tourism 
infrastructure, skills development, and destination 
readiness, India’s capital expenditure roadmap is set  
to further shore up connectivity, amenities, and  
world-class experiences.
Playing from a Position of Strength
Luxury leisure hospitality – catering across segments, 
from aspiring travellers to the high net worth – is 
projected to grow over 42% by 2028, generating  
USD 391 million. This surge presents both an 
opportunity and a responsibility for the sector: to 
grow inclusively, sustainably, and with deep respect 
for local communities and ecosystems. 
At ASPHL, we are well-aligned to this evolving 
landscape. In keeping with the growing preference of 
discerning travellers for experiential, design-led, and 
culturally rooted stays, we have continued to build 
on our leadership in the upper-upscale and boutique 
luxury segments. The launch of The Lotus Palace 
Chettinad and Ran Baas – The Palace at Patiala during 
the year marks our entry into heritage and high-end 
hospitality, elevating our luxury credentials while 
earning critical acclaim and industry recognition.
The year also saw us advance on several upcoming 
projects – in Juhu, Kochi, Navi Mumbai, Pune, 
Vishakhapatnam, and Kolkata – reinforcing a robust 
pipeline of iconic, aesthetically curated destinations. 
Zone by The Park continues to scale across Tier II and 
III cities, offering smart, spirited, and contemporary 
hospitality, while Flurys, now at 100 outlets, reaffirms 
its place as a household name in India’s evolving 
culinary landscape. From culinary innovation in our 
signature restaurants to a refreshed Flurys experience 
on the horizon, F&B remains one of our  
key differentiators. 
For ASPHL, FY 2024-25 was a year not merely of 
expansion but also consolidation, outperformance, 
and impact. Strong topline and bottom-line growth, 
driven by exceptional teams, immersive guest 
experiences, and a culture of innovation, culminated 
in a maiden dividend of 50%, a clear reflection of 
the long-term value we continue to create for all 
stakeholders. Through a blend of brand equity, 
culturally rooted design, and thoughtfully curated 
spaces, we remain bold in expression, nimble in 
execution, and firmly grounded in purpose.
Growth with Intent
India’s hospitality sector is undergoing a structural 
shift in ownership and operating models. Franchise 
and lease arrangements are increasingly replacing 
traditional owned-hotel structures, driven by the rise 
of asset-light strategies focused on management 
contracts rather than property ownership. This trend is 
particularly visible in the organised segment, centred in 
urban, affluent markets. Hotel conversions have nearly 
doubled, with domestic players gaining an edge over 
international brands.
Aligning with this trend, we are also focusing on 
an asset-light growth strategy and scaling through 
management contracts and flexible operating models. 
Our expanding pipeline reflects this approach, 
positioning us to grow efficiently while staying agile, 
capital-light, and responsive to dynamic market needs.
Over the next five years, we aim to double our room 
inventory to 4,780 keys across 56 new hotels, with over 
1,500 rooms coming through management contracts. 
From palatial heritage destinations to design-forward 
city hotels, our portfolio will reflect both our ambition 
and our ethos while catering to the varied needs of our 
diverse guest segments.
Sustainability and our People — At the Core of 
our Future
We believe that responsible growth must balance 
ambition with accountability — across environmental 
impact, social equity, and stakeholder engagement. 
India’s hospitality industry is increasingly embracing 
sustainability, with many hotel chains targeting 100% 
green certifications and integrating renewable energy, 
waste reduction protocols, and water efficiency systems 
into operations. At ASPHL, we are setting benchmarks 
in our pursuit of emission reduction and circular 
economy principles, driving industry standards through 
responsible innovation and action.
We are committed to embedding eco-conscious 
practices across our properties — from energy-efficient 
fixtures and waste recycling to water conservation 
strategies and greener F&B operations. More importantly, 
our sustainability efforts are powered by people: from 
frontline colleagues to local vendors and artisans, 
whose passion and care shape everything from guest 
touchpoints to community engagement.
As we step into the future, I remain deeply grateful 
to our people, guests, partners, and shareholders 
for their trust and belief. Together, we are shaping a 
hospitality brand that is not just relevant but responsibly 
inspirational – a brand that welcomes the world with 
warmth and originality.
Warm regards,
Priya Paul

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT 
DRIVING SCALE. 
DEEPENING 
IMPACT.
Dear Stakeholders,
FY 2024-25 has been a standout year for Apeejay 
Surrendra Park Hotels Limited in terms of growth, 
progress, and success, made possible by the 
commitment and dedication of our teams. 
It gives me great pleasure to share that we closed the 
financial year on a strong note, backed by consistent 
performance across both our hospitality and F&B 
verticals. Over the course of the year, we deepened 
our presence in key business markets, maintained 
leadership in occupancy and RevPAR, and advanced 
several growth initiatives across the breadth and depth 
of our portfolio.
Seizing the Momentum 
India remains among the best economies in the world. 
S&P Global Ratings has upgraded its assessment of 
India to BBB from BBB-, with a stable outlook – the 
first upgrade in 18 years. The growth dynamics are 
expected to continue at the rate of 6.5 to 7% over the 
next five years.
India is already on the path to economic greatness, 
having surpassed Japan to become the 4th largest 
economy in 2025. And that is just the beginning. 
By 2028, India is expected to go past Germany to 
become the 3rd largest economy.
In FY 2024-25, India’s Travel and Tourism sector 
contributed USD 231.6 billion to the country’s GDP, 
making it the 8th largest tourism economy globally. 
According to WTTC, the sector’s contribution to GDP 
would grow to USD 511 billion by CY 2034 supporting 
~63 million jobs.
ICRA forecasts that India’s domestic air passenger 
traffic will increase by 7-10% in FY 2025-26, reaching 
175-181 million travellers from the current level of  
165 million.
The hospitality sector is expected to maintain its 
double-digit growth in the ongoing super-cycle. 
Demand is expected to remain strong at 10.6% 
against a supply of less than 8% on an all-India level. 
The sector will witness accelerated expansion, driven 
by rising demand from spiritual, wellness, wildlife, 
business, wedding, and MICE tourism.
Aligned with these trends, we are expanding with 
focus and discipline. Our growing presence in Tier II 
and Tier III markets complements our flagship city 
hotels, helping us secure India’s evolving traveller 
demographic more holistically.
Elevating the Portfolio
Our operational performance continues to set new 
benchmarks. We achieved India’s highest occupancy 
of 92% and retained our leadership in RevPAR in the 
upper-upscale segment. This exceptional performance 
was mirrored across our flagship properties, with 
Kolkata achieving full occupancy (100%), Navi Mumbai 
(95%), and Chennai (93%) delivering standout results. 
These figures reflect the strength of our guest-centric  
approach and the consistency of our service 
excellence across geographies.
FY 2024-25 also saw the successful launch of two new 
palace hotels — The Lotus Palace Chettinad and Ran 
Baas The Palace at Patiala, marking our formal entry 
into the luxury heritage space. Ran Baas The Palace is 
the new jewel in the crown of The Park Hotels. It is a 
bridge between history and modernity, offering global 
travellers a window into Punjab’s rich culture, infused 
with THE Park’s signature Anything But Ordinary 
Experiences. Ran Baas The Palace, effective February 
2025, is a member of Relais & Chateaux, a  
world-leading collection of  luxury hotels and 
restaurants. Early traction has been promising, with 
ARR levels in these properties reflecting the premium 
positioning and long-term potential they carry. 
PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC POSITIONING
24     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Both hotels are expected to contribute significantly to 
the overall portfolio ARR uplift as they stabilise.
We also reinvested in our existing portfolio through 
widespread room renovations and F&B relaunches, 
with over 100 rooms refurbished and four venues 
reopened. These enhancements are already 
translating into higher guest satisfaction scores, 
stronger brand equity, and improved pricing power 
across our portfolio.
Delivering Record Results
FY 2024-25 was our strongest financial year to date. 
We reported a 9.1% increase in revenue, reaching  
INR 653 crores, and a 10.2% growth in EBITDA,  
which stood at INR 226 crores. Profit Before Tax rose 
sharply by 67.1%, while Profit After Tax touched  
INR 84 crores — the highest in our history. These 
results were driven by buoyant demand across both 
business and leisure segments.
In a landmark move, we announced our first-ever 
dividend, a 50% payout, demonstrating the strength of 
our balance sheet and our commitment to shareholder 
value creation. These outcomes reflect the resilience of 
our strategy and the operational rigour that supports it.
Accelerating Strategic Growth
We continue to grow from strength to strength under 
a clear and ambitious strategy. Our total number of 
rooms will increase from 35 hotels with 2,394 keys 
to 50 hotels with 3,000 keys in line with our vision of 
50 hotels by FY 2025-26. The accelerated expansion, 
aided by organic growth, will position us to deliver 
sustained double-digit growth in both revenues  
and EBITDA. 
Our balance sheet is extremely strong, with a net 
worth of INR 1,297 crores. ICRA has reaffirmed the 
Company’s credit rating as [ICRA] A+ stable indicating 
a strong degree of safety. With deposits close to  
INR 70 crores, the liquidity situation is extremely 
comfortable to propel future expansion.
We believe FY 2025-26 will see the completion of two 
strategic acquisitions. 80 rooms at Zillion Hotels and 
Resorts at Juhu for a 90% stake at INR 206 crores, 
and 31 rooms at Cochin to be concluded by the end of 
September 2025. These two strategic acquisitions will 
strengthen our position in both the business and luxury 
segments.
Meanwhile, greenfield developments in Pune, Kolkata 
EM Bypass, Vizag, Navi Mumbai, and Jaipur are 
progressing on schedule. The EM Bypass project 
alone is expected to generate significant free cash 
flow through apartment sales, supporting our strategy 
of remaining net cash positive throughout the 
development cycle.
Our iconic bakery and confectionery brand, Flurys, 
continues to expand its footprint steadily. We presently 
operate 100 outlets across formats, including flagship 
tea rooms, cafés and kiosks. Our most recent openings 
have been in Darjeeling and Gangtok.  
We plan to accelerate store additions, targeting 200 
stores by FY 2026-27 to coincide with the centenary 
year of Flurys. This expansion remains a strategic 
priority, aimed at broadening market presence and 
catering to a diverse customer base, while blending 
contemporary amenities with rich cultural heritage. 
People and Culture First
For us, our culture is our brand, and our brand is 
our culture. We have a result-oriented culture based 
on the values of excellence, innovation, teamwork, 
commitment, integrity, empowerment, and respect. 
We strongly believe that only highly engaged people 
lead to highly engaged customers, and that alone 
leads to higher profits and higher shareholder value.
Our people remain our biggest strength, and we 
remain committed to their development. During the 
course of the year, many domestic and international 
programmes were undertaken for our leadership 
teams to understand and create the next best 
practices in business and customer management,  
and we are proud of this.
Growing Responsibly
Our future is anchored in our 3G framework — Growth, 
Governance, and Green. Sustainability remains integral 
to our progress. We are committed to responsible 
business practices across water, energy, and waste 
management. We are proud that four of our hotels are 
now IGBC Green Certified, reflecting steady progress 
towards industry-leading green standards.
We are focused on moving ahead towards technology. 
The process of implementing the most advanced ERP 
and Opera PMS on the cloud has begun, fully backed 
by AI initiatives. These will lead to superior group- and 
unit-level financial reporting, cash flow management, 
efficiency improvement, revenue enhancement, guest 
satisfaction management, and automation of  
many tasks. 
Forging Ahead
As India’s hospitality sector enters a long-term 
supercycle, driven by rising domestic travel, the 
growth outlook remains highly promising.  
Backed by resilient demand, improved pricing power, 
steady portfolio expansion in the premium luxury 
segment, and continued leadership in the  
upper-upscale segment, we are well-placed to  
capture the opportunities ahead.
As I look forward, I am excited about our accelerated 
momentum. I believe we have the best engaged 
and most capable teams and a powerful and proven 
strategy to deliver the best results.
My deepest gratitude to our shareholders, guests, 
team members and partners for their continued trust 
and support.

The unveiling of The Lotus Palace Chettinad and 
Ran Baas – The Palace at Patiala marked more than 
portfolio additions—they signalled our commitment 
to preserving heritage while delivering contemporary 
luxury. Strategic acquisitions in Kochi and Juhu, 
including the transformation of 60 service apartments 
into a future luxury address, open new chapters in 
our story. Across Pune, Vizag, EM Bypass–Kolkata, 
Navi Mumbai, and Jaipur, greenfield developments 
are advancing—conceived from inception to meet the 
standards of a more responsible tomorrow.
Within our existing portfolio, purposeful refinements 
have elevated the guest journey. From the meticulous 
refurbishment of 100 rooms to the reimagining of 
four signature F&B destinations, each enhancement 
reflects our pursuit of excellence. The forthcoming 
central production hub for Flurys in NCR will extend 
our craft with consistency and quality across  
North India.
Sustainability is now intrinsic to our operations—
woven into how we design, build, and operate. IGBC 
Green Certifications, along with integrated water, 
energy, and waste efficiencies, mark tangible progress 
toward our goal of carbon neutrality by 2032. This is 
both an environmental imperative and a reaffirmation 
that our progress leaves a lighter footprint.
A strengthened financial foundation—endorsed by 
our upgraded A+ (Stable) ICRA rating—gives us 
the confidence to keep advancing with purpose. 
We believe true progress lies where cultural 
stewardship, operational precision, and environmental 
responsibility converge, creating a legacy that is 
enduring, relevant, and unmistakably ours.

We are committed to embedding sustainable practices across every facet of our 
operations, ensuring that our environmental responsibility enhances, rather than 
compromises, our luxury experience. By closely tracking our carbon footprint 
and implementing eco-friendly measures, from energy-efficient systems to 
sourcing local, sustainable products, we offer guests a stay that is indulgent  
yet environmentally conscious.
Water Management
Our water stewardship strategy focuses on 
conservation, recycling, and efficient usage.  
All wastewater is treated on-site and reused for 
flushing systems and cooling towers, reducing 
freshwater consumption significantly. Initiatives 
include rainwater harvesting, low-flow fixtures,  
and energy-efficient technologies.
Since the early 2000s, THE Park Hotels have  
been ‘Sustainable by Design’, incorporating  
water-saving aerators, dual-flush systems, and 
optimised showerheads to reduce usage by up to 
60%. We have replaced diesel boilers with heat 
pumps and installed rainwater harvesting across  
all locations.

Community Engagement
We continued to strengthen our connection with 
the communities around us through a range of 
meaningful outreach initiatives. Our teams actively 
participated in activities such as blood donation 
camps, health camps, basic life support training, 
meditation sessions, cleanliness drives, and 
celebrations of International Yoga Day. We also 
observed key occasions like Republic Day, Earth Day, 
and International Chef Day with the involvement 
of our associates and local communities. To raise 
awareness on critical social issues, we hosted a 
three-hour seminar on mobile and drug addiction 
prevention in collaboration with the Rotary Club. 
We also organised training sessions for the National 
Disaster Response Force (HK & F&B Service) to 
support essential services.
Our commitment to social impact was reflected in 
numerous donation drives and volunteer-led efforts. 
We distributed food packets to underprivileged 
children near Howrah through Flurys, donated 
essentials to orphanages including Balgram, Cheers 
Foundation, and Bal Sahyog, and provided clothes 
and snacks to patients at a hospital. Contributions 
were also made to Agniraksha and the DB Converge 
Trust for the children of Pope John Garden. School 
supplies were donated to students at the Zilla 
Parishad School. 
One of our standout efforts was a livelihood initiative

Our engagement with arts, culture, and heritage 
extended beyond traditional forms, embracing 
creativity as a means to inspire awareness 
and inclusion. We encouraged associates and 
communities to express their ideas through  
initiatives that blended artistic expression with  
meaningful causes.

Environment and Sustainability
Our sustainability journey continued to evolve 
with a deeper focus on responsible operations and 
environmental stewardship. Across locations,  
we initiated a range of efforts to reduce our ecological 
footprint: rainwater harvesting systems, composting 
of organic waste through OWC machines, adoption  
of EVs and charging stations, and the use of  
solar-powered lighting were just some of the steps  
we took towards a greener future. Several of our  
properties also pursued or maintained IGBC 
certification, reflecting our alignment  
with green building standards.
We placed strong emphasis on reducing single-use  
plastics and improving waste segregation practices. 
These efforts were complemented by awareness 
drives and observances that engaged both 
associates and the community. Events such as World 
Environment Day, Earth Hour, and No Waste Day have 
become platforms for reflecting on our collective 
responsibility towards the planet.
Participatory campaigns, such as the Earth Day 
celebration and the Swachh Bharat Cleanliness Drive, 
carried out in association with the Navi Mumbai 
Municipal Corporation (NMMC), brought together 
teams for on-the-ground action, reinforcing that 
meaningful change often begins with small, consistent 
efforts in our immediate surroundings.
Skills and Education
We remained deeply committed to nurturing 
talent and encouraging continuous learning across 
our ecosystem. Our structured development 
programmes, such as the AIH Management Trainee 
programme and the Professional Development 
Programme at Cornell University, continued to offer 
associates valuable exposure to global best practices 
and leadership skills.
Beyond formal training, we created opportunities for 
knowledge-sharing through expert-led guest sessions. 
One such highlight was an engaging talk on nutrition, 
modern diets, and healthy lifestyles, which helped 
both students and staff explore emerging trends in 
wellness and hospitality. These initiatives reflect our 
belief that investing in people, at every level, is key to 
building a future-ready organisation.

Economic Overview
Global Economy
According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (April 
2025), the global economy grew by 3.3% in 2024, 
reflecting stability and resilience amid geopolitical 
risks, policy uncertainty, and trade disruptions.  
The year was marked by significant political activity, 
with major economies like India, France, the UK and 
the US participating in national elections, adding 
further unpredictability to the global landscape. 
Despite geopolitical conflicts leading to energy price 
volatility and supply chain disruptions, improved 
financial conditions, stable consumer demand in key 
markets, and the adaptability of global supply chains 
supported overall economic momentum.
Global inflation eased from 5.6% in 2023 to 4.0%  
in 2024, moving closer to central bank targets,  
aided by lower food, energy, and commodity prices.  
While inflation in advanced economies neared targets, 
some developing regions continued to face elevated 
or double-digit rates. As labour markets softened 
slightly, unemployment remained near historic lows, 
and real household incomes improved on the back of 
robust wage growth and declining inflation.
Growth in advanced economies moderated to 1.8%, 
with the US expanding 2.8%, the Eurozone growing 
0.9%, and Germany contracting for a second year. 
Emerging markets and developing economies grew 
4.3%, supported by robust domestic consumption, 
increased public infrastructure investments, and a 
recovery in services and tourism-related sectors. 
China’s growth slowed to 5% amid weak consumer 
spending and property sector challenges. 
Private consumption softened in several regions due 
to dampened consumer sentiment, though India 
remained a bright spot, maintaining its status as the 
fastest-growing major economy.
Although consumer confidence stayed below  
pre-pandemic levels, stable labour markets and lower 
price pressures supported discretionary spending. 
This directly benefited the travel and dining sectors, 
with more consumers willing to spend on experiences. 
As real household incomes improved, spending on 
holidays, hotels, restaurants, and related services saw 
a steady rise, boosting demand across the global 
hospitality industry.

Outlook
Global economic growth is projected to moderate 
to 3.0% in 2025 and edge up slightly to 3.1% in 2026, 
according to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook  
(July 2025). This deceleration reflects the unwinding 
of front-loaded trade and investment activity seen in 
early 2025, ongoing uncertainty around global trade 
policy, and the gradual impact of elevated interest 
rates. Key drivers supporting growth include eased 
global financial conditions, a weaker US dollar, and 
fiscal expansion in major economies such as the US 
and China. However, downside risks remain prominent, 
including the potential for renewed tariff escalations, 
geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions, all 
of which could weigh on global trade and investment.
In advanced economies, growth is forecast at 1.5% 
in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, as tight monetary policies 
and subdued external demand continue to weigh 
on economic activity. In contrast, emerging markets 
and developing economies is projected to grow by 
4.1% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026, supported by stable 
commodity prices, resilient domestic consumption, 
and public investment, particularly in Asia and parts  
of Africa. 
Global headline inflation is expected to decline to 
4.2% in 2025 and further to 3.6% in 2026, marking a 
gradual return to price stability. The forecast reflects 
the continued easing of goods and energy prices, 
along with the impact of tight monetary policies 
implemented over the past two years. While inflation 
in the services sector remains somewhat elevated, 
improving supply conditions and anchored inflation 
expectations are helping to reduce overall price 
pressures. The easing of inflation is also expected to 
support real income growth and consumer spending  
in many economies.

Indian Economy 
India’s economy maintained strong momentum in  
FY 2024-25, recording GDP growth of 6.5%, 
supported by firm domestic demand, an expanding 
services sector, and increased public investment. 
Growth was broad-based, with manufacturing, 
services, and agriculture all contributing meaningfully. 
Rural consumption improved, urban spending 
accelerated, and private investment gathered pace. 
Capacity expansion across industries was aided 
by stable borrowing conditions and sustained 
infrastructure development by the government.
The services sector has remained the steadiest 
contributor to Gross Value Added (GVA), with its 
share rising from 50.6% in FY 2013-14 to around 
55% in FY 2024-25. It also accounts for nearly 30% 
of total employment. In addition to its direct role, 
the sector is central to the growing ‘servicification’ 
of manufacturing adding value through services 
integrated into both production and post-production 
processes.
Services are projected to grow by 7.3%, driven by 
the Financial, Real Estate and Professional Services 
sector at 7.2% and the Trade, Hotels, Transport, 
Communication and Broadcasting-related Services 
sector at 6.4%, according to the National Statistical 
Office’s Second Advance Estimates. Agriculture is 
estimated to expand by 4.6%, while manufacturing  
is expected to grow by 4.3%.
Private consumption, accounting for 56.7% of GDP, 
rose by 7.6% during the year, recovering from the 
moderation of the previous year. Gross Fixed Capital 
Formation, at 33.4% of GDP, increased by 6.1%, 
reflecting sustained public capital expenditure and  
a gradual pickup in private investments. Also, exports 
grew by 7.1%, while imports dipped by 1.1%, indicating 
stabilising trade conditions.
As per the Department of Economic Affairs, inflation 
averaged 4.7% in FY 2024-25, down from 5.4% a year 
earlier, while core inflation eased to a four-year low of 
3.5%, supported by subdued input costs and prudent 
monetary policy.
Labour market conditions improved, with the 
unemployment rate declining to 4.9% in FY 2023-24 
from 5.0% in the previous year, while labour force 
participation held steady at around 59.6%, according 
to the Periodic Labour Force Survey.
India’s external fundamentals remained strong, with 
foreign exchange reserves at USD 645 billion as of 
early March 2025. The current account deficit stayed 
stable at 1.1% of GDP in Q3 FY 2024-25, compared 
with the same quarter of the previous year, though 
narrowing from 1.8% in Q2 FY 2024-25.
The services sector has 
remained the steadiest

Outlook
Looking ahead to FY 2025-26, India’s GDP growth is 
projected to remain steady at 6.5%, supported by an 
expected revival in urban consumption boosted by 
recent tax cuts and sustained rural demand supported 
by strong agricultural production following another 
year of normal monsoon. Lower oil prices are expected 
to bolster corporate margins and fiscal stability, while 
improving real wages and moderating food inflation 
are likely to lift discretionary spending, particularly in 
sectors such as automobiles.
The broader economic outlook remains one of 
stability and strength, supported by firm domestic 
demand, easing inflation, buoyant capital markets, 
and rising exports. Key indicators such as record 
foreign exchange reserves, a manageable current 
account deficit, and growing foreign investment reflect 
increasing global confidence in India’s long-term 
growth potential. Together, these factors signal an 
economy advancing across sectors while maintaining 
macroeconomic discipline.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to 
maintain its disinflationary approach through 
calibrated liquidity and interest rate measures aimed 
at keeping inflation within the target range, while 
also facilitating capacity utilisation and encouraging 
private investment. However, weak global demand 
may continue to dampen export performance, posing 
a potential downside risk.
The RBI has revised its inflation forecast for  
FY 2025-26 to 3.7%, down from 4%. This outlook 
factors in softening commodity prices and improved 
food output, although risks linked to weather 
variability and global trade dynamics persist.
India’s services sector continued its strong growth 
path in 2025, reaffirming its central role in driving 
economic activity and employment. The HSBC India 
Composite PMI Output Index rose marginally from 61.0 
in June 2025 to 61.1 in July 2025, marking the fastest 
pace of expansion since April 2024 and indicating 
continued strength in services activity. This expansion 
is expected to drive business travel, conferences, and 
corporate events, benefiting the hospitality sector, 
particularly hotels and restaurants, which are likely to 
witness higher occupancy and increased demand  
for services.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Outlook
Against a backdrop of economic uncertainty,  
the Global Hospitality (Travel & Tourism) sector  
is expected to maintain strong growth in CY 2025  
and beyond. According to WTTC’s 2025 Economic 
Impact Research (EIR), international visitor spending 
is forecasted to reach USD 2.1 trillion in 2025, 
surpassing the previous high of USD 1.9 trillion  
in 2019 by USD 164 billion. 
The sector’s total contribution to global GDP is 
projected at a record USD 11.7 trillion in 2025, or 10.3% 
of global GDP. While the US market continues its 
recovery, international visitor spend remains below 
2019 levels. China, despite surpassing pre-pandemic 
spending in 2024, is expected to experience slower 
growth in 2025. In contrast, Saudi Arabia is rapidly 
expanding, with plans to invest USD 800 billion into 
tourism by 2030. European destinations like France 
and Spain continue to lead with consistent visitor 
inflows and strategic investments. 
By 2035, the global travel and tourism sector is 
forecast to support 30 billion tourist visits and 
contribute USD 16.5 trillion, or 11.5% of global GDP, 
with international spending expected to reach USD 2.9 
trillion and domestic spending USD 7.7 trillion, growing 
at annual rates of 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively.

Indian Hospitality Industry 
In 2024, India witnessed a strong rebound in 
foreign arrivals, with Foreign Tourist Arrivals 
(FTAs) reaching ~9.70 million, up from 
9.20 million in 2023. Foreign exchange earnings 
for January-February 2025 amounted to  
INR 27,736 crores (USD 3.28 billion), reflecting 
a robust 19.8% YoY growth. The top source 
markets as of October 2024 were the USA 
(19.2%), UK (13.8%), Canada (7.6%), Australia 
(4.6%), and Malaysia (3.7%).
In 2024, domestic travel continued to be a major 
growth engine for India’s tourism and hospitality 
sector, with domestic spending reaching  
INR 15.5 trillion, which is 22% higher than  
pre-pandemic levels in 2019, according to 
WTTC’s latest Economic Impact Research (EIR). 
This momentum is expected to strengthen 
further in 2025, with spending projected to rise 
to INR 16.8 trillion, fuelled by a young population, 
rising disposable incomes, and a growing 
preference for local travel experiences.
Domestic tourists contributed nearly 84% of 
total visitor spending in 2024, highlighting their 
pivotal role in sustaining the sector’s recovery 
and long-term growth. 
Events like the Maha Kumbh 2025, one of the 
largest religious gatherings in the world, further 
reflect the scale and vibrancy of domestic 
tourism, with 660 million visitors in just 45 days.
Additionally, according to DGCA data, domestic 
airlines carried 1.40 crores passengers in 
February 2025, compared to 1.26 crores in the 
same month of the previous year, registering an 
annual growth of 11.16% and a monthly growth of 
11.04%. This showcases the continued demand 
for travel within the country.
Horwath HTL’s India Hotel Market Review 
2024 reports that about 14,400 rooms across

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
India’s Growth Journey
The hospitality sector has rebounded strongly, with 
occupancy rising from 43.1% in 2021 to 63.9% in 2024, 
nearly matching the 2019 level of 64.5%. ADR grew 
from INR 4,448 to INR 7,951 over the same period, 
surpassing the 2019 rate of INR 5,684. As a result, 
RevPAR more than doubled from INR 1,917 in 2021 to 
INR 5,078 in 2024, well above the pre-pandemic figure 
of INR 3,664. These gains highlight a solid recovery 
in demand, stronger pricing power, and improved 
revenue generation, surpassing the pre-pandemic 
figures and making 2024 the strongest year  
in the period.
Outlook
The Indian hospitality sector is set for steady growth, 
driven by strong domestic demand and the revival of 
international tourism. ICRA projects revenue growth 
of 7-9% in FY 2024-25, easing to 6-8% in FY 2025-26. 
Premium hotel occupancy is expected to rise from  
70-72% in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 to 72-74%  
in FY 2025-26, supported by leisure, MICE,  
and business travel.
Domestic tourism will remain the key growth driver, 
fuelled by rising incomes, a growing middle class, and 
higher discretionary spending. India’s travel market is 
projected to grow from USD 75 billion in 2020 to  
USD 125 billion by 2027, with the airline segment 
expected to double from ~USD 20 billion and the 
hotel market expanding from USD 32 billion to USD 
52 billion, supported by stronger demand and the 
growing role of travel facilitators.
Foreign Tourist Arrivals are forecast to reach 30.5 
million by 2028, generating over INR 5.12 lakhs 
crores (USD 59 billion). International hotel chains 
are projected to capture nearly 50% of the market, 
reflecting global interest. With a projected 20% CAGR 
over the next two decades, supported by government 
policy, improved infrastructure, and rising travel 
appetite, India is poised to become a global  
tourism powerhouse.

Indian Food Service Industry
The Indian food service sector continued its upward 
progression in 2024, reflecting a strong recovery  
post-pandemic and a surge in consumer demand 
across urban and semi-urban areas. According to the 
National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI),  
the industry was valued at USD 68.31 billion  
(INR 5.69 trillion) in FY 2023-24, making it one of the 
most significant contributors to the nation’s services 
sector. The food service industry, encompassing 
both organised and unorganised players including 
restaurants, cafés, cloud kitchens, and street food 
vendors, currently contributes about 1.9% to India’s 
GDP and plays a vital role in employment generation, 
especially in urban centres.
The growth in FY 2024-25 has been driven by rising 
disposable incomes, rapid urbanisation, evolving food 
preferences, and a growing culture of dining out and 
ordering in. The expansion of app-based food delivery 
services, innovations in cloud kitchens, and increasing 
investments in food retail infrastructure have further 
boosted the sector’s performance. Additionally,  
Tier-II and Tier-III cities have shown a sharp rise in  
food service penetration, reflecting a nationwide  
trend toward convenience, affordability, and variety  
in food choices.
Outlook
Looking ahead, the Indian food service industry is 
poised for strong, persistent growth. The market is 
projected to expand to USD 93.16 billion (INR 7.76 
trillion) by FY 2027-28, growing at a compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% over the next four years. 
This would position India as the third-largest food 
service market globally, according to NRAI. 
This growth will be enabled by several factors: rising 
urbanisation, a younger demographic with evolving 
consumption habits, increasing digital adoption 
for food ordering, and the rise of health-conscious, 
experiential, and premium dining segments.  
The organised segment comprising quick service 
restaurants (QSRs), casual dining restaurants, fine 
dining, and cafes is expected to witness the fastest 
growth, fuelled by franchise expansions and increased 
investor interest.
Moreover, with government initiatives to formalise 
and upskill the workforce, along with supportive 
regulatory frameworks and digital payment adoption, 
the sector is expected to become more structured 
and employment intensive. Innovation, localisation of 
global cuisines, and deeper penetration in non-metro 
cities will be the key drivers shaping the future of the 
Indian food service market.
With a CAGR of 8.1% over 4 years India’s food services market will reach USD 93.16 billion by 2028.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Business Review
FY 2024-25 was a standout year for ASPHL, marked 
by growth, progress and success across our hospitality 
and F&B businesses. We closed the year with 35 
operational hotels and a total of 2,394 keys, of which 
194 keys were launched during the year, under our 
five distinct hospitality brands: The Park, The Park 
Collection, Zone by The Park, Zone Connect and Stop 
by Zone.
We added two new hotels during the year – The Lotus 
Palace, Chettinad and Ran Baas – The Palace, Patiala – 
both under The Park Collection brand. These launches 
marked our entry into the heritage luxury segment. 
The Lotus Palace recorded an ARR of INR 14,699, while 
Ran Baas achieved an ARR of INR 24,000 with 42% 
occupancy in Q4 FY 2024-25.
Across our hotel portfolio, we retained our leadership 
in occupancy at 93% (India’s highest), ARR of  
INR 7,624 and RevPAR of INR 7,061. Flagship 
properties in Kolkata recorded 100% occupancy, while 
Navi Mumbai and Chennai achieved 95% and 93%, 
respectively. Hotels in New Delhi, Hyderabad,  
and Bangalore also reported a strong occupancy of 
around 91%. Overall, ARR and RevPAR increased 
by 8% and 9% YoY, respectively.
Zone by The Park and Zone Connect continued to 
expand our reach in the upper midscale and midscale 
segments. These brands contributed meaningfully to 
portfolio growth and brand visibility. Stop by Zone, 
our smart stay concept, remains a strategic addition, 
expanding our presence along transit routes  
and highways.

Strategy 
We are pursuing a focused growth strategy that 
capitalises on opportunities in India’s expanding 
hospitality sector. A key pillar of this strategy is 
the development of our existing land bank to build 
new hotels and serviced apartments. By leveraging 
our early investments in land and cost-effective 
construction, we aim to boost revenue and occupancy 
while maintaining profitability.
We are also scaling up through an asset-light model 
by increasing managed and leased hotel partnerships, 
particularly in the upper midscale space. This ensures 
capital-efficient growth.
Brand development is another core priority.  
We are continuously investing in renovating existing 
properties, creating new offerings across categories, 
and elevating our dining experiences with distinctive 
bar and restaurant concepts.
Operationally, we are driving efficiencies through 
technology upgrades, cost optimisation, and strong 
supplier partnerships. We are also expanding our 
iconic ‘Flurys’ brand across retail and digital channels, 
tapping into new regions and formats to strengthen 
our presence in the F&B space.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Digital and Marketing
We have built a strong digital and technology backbone 
to support operations and deliver seamless guest 
experiences. From international platforms like Oracle 
MICROS, Simphony, and Opera PMS to a centralised 
reservation and guest management system, our IT 
infrastructure is designed for efficiency and security.  
We continue to evolve with innovations such as 
contactless check-in/out, QR-based ordering and 
payments, and AI-enabled concierge services. Our 
move to a private cloud environment is set to further 
enhance scalability and performance.
Our marketing is driven by an integrated sales and 
digital strategy, backed by active engagement on 
platforms like Facebook and Instagram. We create  
high-impact campaigns tailored to audience 
preferences and supported by data-led insights. 
Influencer tie-ups, design-led collaborations, and 
targeted offers help us connect meaningfully with our 
guests. Our loyalty programme, THE Park Preferred, 
encourages strong guest relationships and drives repeat 
visits, with a significant portion of our guests choosing 
to return across our portfolio.

Social and People Initiatives
We are deeply engaged with the communities 
around us, shaping our outreach through a blend of 
compassion, creativity, and sustainability.
We supported youth mentoring programmes, worked 
with underprivileged children and senior citizens, and 
conducted awareness drives around health, safety, and 
disaster preparedness. Blood donation camps, training 
sessions for the National Disaster Response Force,  
and community safety initiatives reinforced our  
social commitment.
Our focus on gender equity found expression 
through POSH awareness sessions, breast cancer 
talks, and inclusive celebrations that recognised the 
role of women across our ecosystem. Creativity and 
culture were nurtured through diversity-themed art 
competitions and environmental poster-making drives.
Sustainability continued to guide our actions, from 
rainwater harvesting and waste management to EV 
adoption and clean-up efforts under Swachh Bharat 
and Earth Day campaigns. Through learning initiatives, 
including leadership development and industry-led 
knowledge sessions, we invested in our people, building 
capabilities for a brighter, more inclusive future.

Logistics are crucial to our operations, particularly 
in managing the supply chain for key ingredients in 
our F&B offerings. We depend on a steady supply 
of high-quality ingredients, sourced daily or weekly 
from suppliers. Our logistics face challenges such 
as shortages, price fluctuations driven by climate, 
seasonality, exchange rates, and import tariffs, along 
with the need to maintain strict quality standards. 
Efficient logistics ensure timely delivery and proper 
handling of perishables, as delays or mishandling 
can affect food quality, reputation, and customer 
satisfaction. We also work with delivery aggregators 
who manage technology integration and logistics 
for our off-premise dining, further highlighting the 
importance of a well-managed logistics system.
Risk Management
ASPHL has put in place a comprehensive risk 
management framework to identify, evaluate, and 
mitigate operational, strategic, and external risks that 
could impact its core business objectives.  
We ensure compliance with legal requirements through 
regular reviews of operations, with a strong focus on 
workplace safety. The Board has established an Audit 
and Risk Management Committee to oversee key 
risks and guide mitigation efforts. Both the Board and 
the Committee regularly review and update the risk 
management framework to ensure its effectiveness.
Audit and Risk Management 
Committee
The Audit and Risk Management Committee is vital 
in upholding corporate governance by overseeing 
financial reporting, risk management, and internal 
controls. It is authorised to investigate matters 
within its purview, seek information from associates, 
obtain external professional advice, and involve 
relevant experts as needed. Its key responsibilities 
include reviewing and evaluating the Company’s risk 
management system, formulating and implementing 
risk management policies, and assessing potential risks 
associated with new business ventures.

Delays in new hotel construction 
or expansion of existing properties

Seasonality
Changes 
in Travel 
Preferences
Brand and 
Marketing 
The hospitality industry is 
inherently seasonal, with 
fluctuations in revenue, profit 
margins, and earnings largely 
driven by changes in demand 
during different periods of the 
year. Our business is heavily reliant 
on peak travel seasons, which can 
result in variations in cash flow 
and profitability. During slower 
periods, we may need to rely on 
alternative revenue streams or 
adjust our operations to maintain 
profitability, which can be 
challenging.
The shift towards remote work 
and virtual meetings may lead to 
a decline in demand for traditional 
hotel rooms, as companies 
reduce their travel expenditures 
and associates opt for virtual 
conferencing alternatives. 
Additionally, changes in corporate 
travel policies or increased use of 
budget-friendly accommodations 
could further erode demand for 
our premium hotel offerings.
Inadequate brand promotion 
and marketing efforts can lead 
to a decline in customer loyalty 
and market share. If we fail to 
effectively promote our brands 
and implement targeted marketing 
strategies, we may struggle to 
attract new customers and retain 
existing ones. This could result  
in reduced occupancy rates,  
lower average daily rates,  
and decreased revenue.

Our brand is our most valuable 
asset, and any unauthorised 
use or misappropriation of our 
intellectual property could lead 
to reputational damage, loss of 
market share, and even legal 
action. Moreover, the loss of 
unique selling points or distinctive 
features of our brand can result in 
a loss of competitive advantage 
and reduced customer loyalty.
Quality control issues can arise 
from various factors, including 
inadequate staff training, 
inefficient processes, or poor 
maintenance of facilities.  
If left unchecked, these issues 
can spread quickly and have a 
significant impact on our business 
performance.
Various threats, including natural 
disasters such as hurricanes or 
earthquakes, accidents such as 
fires or slips and falls, or even 
criminal activity such as theft 
or violence, may impact the 
guest experience and lead to 
reputational damage. In addition, 
the rise of cybercrime and data 
breaches also poses a risk to our 
operations.
Our reliance on third-party 
service providers may lead to 
quality control issues, reputational 
damage, and even legal action, 
if they fail to meet required 
standards. These providers 
may include contractors for 
maintenance, cleaning services, or

New entrants, existing

the hospitality industry is highly 
competitive, there is a constant 
risk that other hotels, resorts, or

competitive prices, leading to a 
loss of customer loyalty

The uncertainty surrounding 
global economic trends, trade

Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy 
ASPHL’s internal systems and controls play a crucial 
role in ensuring operational efficiency, financial 
accuracy, and regulatory compliance. These systems 
encompass a wide range of processes, including 
financial reporting, risk management, data security, 
and operational procedures. The adequacy of these 
internal systems is regularly assessed through 
internal audits and management reviews to identify 
any weaknesses or areas for improvement. A robust 
internal control framework helps safeguard assets, 
detect and prevent fraud, and ensure the reliability 
of financial and operational information. The Board 
of Directors, particularly through the Audit and Risk 
Management Committee, oversees the adequacy 
and effectiveness of these internal systems, ensuring 
they evolve with the changing business environment 
and regulatory landscape. Maintaining strong and 
adequate internal systems is essential for sustainable 
business growth, stakeholder confidence, and 
corporate governance.

During the reporting year, the Company undertook

Board Membership Criteria and Selection Process
In accordance with the Company’s Policy on 
Nomination, Remuneration, and Board Diversity, the 
Nomination, and Remuneration Committee oversees 
the selection of new Board members. This process is 
designed to serve the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders. The Committee is tasked with 
identifying and assessing candidates for Board 
positions, including executive, non-executive, and 
independent roles. Selection criteria encompass a 
range of factors such as knowledge, skills, experience, 
and diverse backgrounds, including educational, 
cultural, and geographical aspects. The Committee 
also considers current industry trends and other 
relevant factors to ensure a diverse and effective 
Board. After evaluating candidates, the Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board, which then 
seeks shareholder approval for the appointments 
as necessary.

under Section 149(6) of the Act and Regulation 16(1)
(b) of the SEBI Listing Regulations and that they 
are independent of the management. Further, the

effect from the close of business hours on February 
20, 2025, upon completion of his second term of 
office. The Board at its meeting held on February

Nomination and Remuneration Committee and

Meetings of Independent Directors
Independent Directors convene separately at least 
one meeting in a year, without Non-Independent 
Directors or management present. These meetings 
allow them to independently review Board matters, 
seek necessary clarifications from management, 
and assess the performance of Non-Independent 
Directors, the Board, the Chairperson and the 
Managing Director. They also evaluate the quality and 
timeliness of information flow between management 
and the Board.
During the Financial Year 2024-25, the Independent 
Directors met one time on May 23, 2024.
Familiarisation Programme
The Company firmly believes that investment in 
Board development strengthens the Board as well as 
the individual directors. The Company sees director 
induction as a first step of the Board’s continuing 
improvement. Directors are regularly updated on 
changes in policies and programmes, laws and the 
general business environment.
The Company ensures that independent directors 
are familiarised with the Company, their roles, rights, 
responsibilities in the Company, nature of the industry 
in which the Company operates and the business 
model of the Company, through various programmes 
and at regular intervals.
The details of the familiarisation programme of 
Independent Directors are available on the Company 
website at https://www.theparkhotels.com/investor-
relations/policies-and-codes.html.
Board Evaluation
A critical function of the Board is to oversee the 
evaluation framework for its performance. The Board 
collaborates with the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee to establish criteria for assessing the 
Chairperson, the Board, Board Committees and 
individual 
directors 
through 
peer 
evaluations. 
In alignment with regulatory requirements, the 
Committee has approved the evaluation process, 
attributes, and criteria, including those for the 
Chairperson and Managing Director.
The annual evaluation process assesses various 
parameters such as structure, composition, and overall 
effectiveness for the Board and its Committees, as 
well as individual directors. Performance metrics 
for directors include ethics, participation, and 
contribution, while the Managing Director is evaluated 
on company performance and leadership.
Independent Directors are specifically evaluated on 
their adherence to independence criteria, external 
expertise, and contribution to Board objectivity. 
All Directors participated in the evaluation, and 
results were reviewed in meetings with Independent 
Directors, Committees, and the full Board. The 
Board considered recommendations to enhance its 
effectiveness and leverage individual strengths based 
on the evaluation outcomes.
Succession planning
The Company has established a succession planning 
policy for both the Board and Senior Management. 
Oversight 
and 
implementation 
of 
this 
policy 
are managed by the Board of Directors and the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
Board: The process ensures an orderly succession for 
Directors, including Executive Directors and senior 
management. The Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee, in collaboration with the Board, focuses 
on factors such as role identification, performance 
evaluations, 
skill 
requirements 
and 
compliance 
with statutory obligations. Reappointment or term 
extensions are based on performance assessments 
and regulatory requirements.
Senior Management Personnel: The Committee 
reviews upcoming retirements or resignations and 
addresses new vacancies due to business needs. 
They assess internal and external candidates to 
ensure alignment with the Company’s growth and 
strategic objectives. The Company also fosters an 
internal talent pool for future leadership roles and 
may recommend external candidates as needed. The 
Managing Director and Chief Human Resource Officer 
play a role in identifying high-potential employees for 
accelerated career progression and overseeing their 
development and training.

Disclosures and Policies 
Disclosure on Materially Significant Related Party 
Transactions that may have potential conflict 
with the interest of Company at large
The Company has a well-defined and structured 
governance process for transactions with related 
parties undertaken by the Company. The related 
party transactions are undertaken after review and 
certification by leading Independent global valuation/ 
accounting firms confirming that the proposed pricing 
mechanism for a particular transaction meets the arm’s 
length criteria. In certain cases, the external valuers 
from the said leading Independent global valuation/ 
accounting firm(s) also present the valuation report 
to the Audit & Risk Management Committee. The 
Committee considers the certifications of leading 
Independent global valuation/accounting firm and 
conducts a review before granting approval to any 
related party transaction. 
All transactions entered into with related parties 
as defined under the Companies Act, 2013 and the 
Listing Regulations during the financial year were 
in the ordinary course of business and on an arm’s 
length pricing basis or were approved by the Board/ 
Audit & Risk Management Committee under specific 
provisions of the act.

were in conflict with the interest of the Company. 
Rather, they synchronise and synergise with the 
Company’s operations. Details of the transactions with 
the related parties are set out in Note No. 38 of the 
Standalone Financial Statements, forming part of this 
Integrated Report. 
The required statements / disclosures, with respect

Food Safety 
and Quality

Implementing robust food safety 
measures presents an opportunity 
for Apeejay to enhance customer 
satisfaction, uphold its reputation 
for excellence, and comply with 
regulatory standards. By ensuring 
the highest standards of food safety 
and quality, Apeejay can attract 
and retain customers, leading to 
increased revenue and loyalty.

safety protocols, conducts 
routine inspections and 
provides ongoing training to

Positive 
Implications
2.
Emission
and Energy
Management
Opportunity
Emission and energy management 
represent a material opportunity for 
Apeejay in terms of cost reduction, 
regulatory compliance, and brand 
enhancement. By implementing 
energy-efficient technologies 
and reducing emissions, Apeejay 
can lower operational expenses, 
comply with increasingly stringent 
environmental regulations, and 
enhance its reputation as a 
sustainable hospitality provider.
To mitigate energy and 
emission management risks, 
The Company has implemented 
energy-efficient technologies, 
such as solar hot water systems, 
heat pumps, and waste heat 
recovery units, leading to 
significant energy savings. The 
Company has also transitioned 
to LED lighting, introduced 
energy efficient laundry 
systems, and installed advanced 
air conditioning units. These 
initiatives not only reduce the 
Company’s environmental 
impact while also mitigating the 
financial and reputational risks 
associated with energy  
and emissions

Risk
However, if emissions and energy 
consumption are not managed 
effectively, the consequences can 
be significant, including a rise 
in operational expenses due to 
inefficiencies and increased energy 
prices. Additionally, non-compliance 
regulations can result in fines 
from regulatory bodies, while the 
Company’s public image may 
suffer, leading to a potential loss of 
customer trust and market share

4.
Climate
Strategy
Risk
Apeejay acknowledges that climate 
change presents both risks and 
opportunities that are essential to 
address for the sustainability of 
its operations. The recognition of 
climate-related risks—including 
regulatory shifts, resource scarcity, 
and physical impact to assets— 
compels Apeejay to integrate 
a robust Climate Strategy into 
its business model. This focus 
on climate resilience ensures 
compliance, operational continuity, 
and asset protection.
Apeejay’s climate strategy is 
underscored by the Integration 
of renewable energy (RE), 
energy efficiency interventions 
and other resource conservation 
actions. The company is shifting 
towards renewable sources like 
solar and wind energy to power 
its operations, reducing reliance 
on fossil fuels and curbing 
emissions. Alongside, Apeejay 
is upgrading its properties with 
energy-efficient technologies, 
encompassing state-of-the-art 
HVAC systems, lighting, and 
smart building solutions to 
minimise energy consumption. 
The Apeejay Business Continuity 
and Disaster Response Plan has 
been developed to safeguard 
the smooth operation of critical 
business functions and ensure 
the well-being of guests and 
employees during disruptive 
incidents or disasters. These 
actions not only mitigate climate 
related risks by enhancing 
operational resilience and 
resource optimisation but also 
position Apeejay as a leader 
in sustainable hospitality, 
committed to reducing its 
environmental footprint and 
catering to the sustainability 
expectations of guests and 
investors.

The scope of engagement with customers in 
the hotel industry is vital for building strong 
relationships, enhancing guest satisfaction, and 
driving loyalty. By interacting with guests at 
every stage of their journey—before, during, and 
after their stay—we can personalise experiences, 
address needs in real-time, and provide 
exceptional service. Effective engagement 
fosters positive reviews, repeat business, and 
customer retention, while also helping hotels 
stay competitive. Additionally, it offers valuable 
insights through feedback, enabling continuous 
improvement and ensuring that the hotel meets 
evolving customer expectations.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Members of Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements 
of Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels Limited (“the 
Company”), which comprise the Balance sheet as 
at March 31 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss, 
including the statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income, the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement 
of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, 
and notes to the standalone financial statements, 
including a summary of material accounting policies 
and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid standalone financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013, 
as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 
31, 2025, its profit including other comprehensive 
income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for 
the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements’ 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India together with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance 
in our audit of the standalone financial statements 
for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter 
below, our description of how our audit addressed 
the matter is provided in that context.
We have determined the matters described below to 
be the key audit matters to be communicated in our 
report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described 
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
standalone financial statements section of our report, 
including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, 
our audit included the performance of procedures 
designed to respond to our assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements. The results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address the 
matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion 
on the accompanying standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Litigation, claims and other contingencies (as described in Note 42 of the standalone financial statements)
As of March 31, 2025, the Company 
has disclosed contingent liabilities of 
H 138.25 Cr relating to tax and legal claims.
Due to complexity of cases, timescales 
for resolution and need to negotiate with 
various authorities, significant judgement 
is required by management in assessing 
the exposure of each case. Thus, there is a 
risk that such cases may not be adequately 
provided for or disclosed in the standalone 
financial statements.
Accordingly, litigations, claims and other 
contingencies was determined to be a key 
audit matter in our audit of the standalone 
financial statements.
Our audit procedures, among others included the following:
•	 We obtained an understanding of the process of identification of claims, litigations, 
arbitrations and contingent liabilities, and evaluated the design and tested the 
operating effectiveness of key controls.
•	 We obtained the legal and tax cases summary and assessed management’s 
position through discussions with the management, on both the probability of 
success in significant cases, and the magnitude of any potential loss.
•	 We obtained external confirmation from relevant third-party legal counsel and 
conducted discussions with them regarding material cases. We evaluated the 
objectivity, independence, competence and relevant experience of third-party 
legal counsel.
•	 We involved our tax specialists to assess management’s application and 
interpretation of tax legislation affecting the Company, and to consider the 
quantification of exposures and settlements arising from disputes with tax 
authorities.
•	 We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the standalone financial statements 
with regard to the facts and circumstances of the tax and legal litigation matters.
We have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.
138     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Other Information
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Annual 
report but does not include the standalone financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
such other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view 
of the financial position, financial performance 
including other comprehensive income, cash flows 
and changes in equity of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also 
includes 
maintenance 
of 
adequate 
accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company 
and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
assessing 
the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
The board of directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	 Evaluate 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25     139

including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the financial year 
ended March 31, 2025 and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.

Annexure 2 To The Independent Auditor’s Report Of Even Date On The 
Standalone Financial Statements Of Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels Limited
Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
of Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on {the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the Company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's internal financial controls with reference 
to these standalone financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
and the Standards on Auditing, as specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued 
by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to these standalone financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to these standalone Financial 
Statements
A 
company's 
internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference to standalone financial statements is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company's assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls With Reference to standalone 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
146     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and 
such internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued 
by the ICAI.

2.	
Material Accounting Policies
	
This note provides a list of the material 
accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these Standalone Financial Statements.
2.01	 Basis of preparation of Standalone 
Financial Statements:
	
These Standalone Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind 
AS”) as prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Act read with Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and 
presentation requirements of Division II of 
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind 
AS compliant Schedule III), as amended from 
time to time, as applicable to the Standalone 
Financial Statements.
	
The 
accounting 
policies 
applied 
by 
the 
Company in preparation of the Standalone 
Financial Statements are consistent with those 
adopted in the preparation of Standalone 
Financial statements for the year ended March 
31, 2024. These standalone financial statements 
have been prepared for the Company as a going 
concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are 
effective as at March 31, 2025.
	
The Standalone Financial Statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, except for 
the following assets and liabilities which have 
been measured at fair value:
•	 	Certain 
financial 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
measured at fair value (refer accounting 
policy regarding financial instruments);
•	 Defined benefits plan - plan assets measured 
at fair value;
•	 Equity settled ESOP at grant date fair value;
	
The 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements 
are 
presented in Indian Rupees “INR” or “H” and all 
values are rounded to the nearest crores except 
when otherwise indicated.
2.02	 Current versus non-current classification:
	
The Company segregates assets and liabilities 
into 
current 
and 
non-current 
categories 
for presentation in the balance sheet after 
considering its normal operating cycle and 
other criteria set out in Ind AS 1, “Presentation of 
Financial Statements”. For this purpose, current 
assets and liabilities include the current portion 
of non-current assets and liabilities respectively.
	
An asset is treated as current when it is:
•	 Expected to be realized or intended to be 
sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
•	 Held primarily for purpose of trading
•	 Expected to be realized within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
•	 cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
A liability is current when:
•	 It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle
•	 It is held primarily for purpose of trading
•	 It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
•	 There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities a 
re classified as non-current assets and liabilities. 
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realization in cash and cash equivalents, the 
Company has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
2.03	Property, plant and equipment:
	
Recognition and initial measurement:
	
All items of property, plant and equipment 
are stated at deemed cost (fair value as at 
transition date) less accumulated depreciation, 
impairment loss, if any. Deemed cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items.
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with 
the item will flow to the Company and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. The carrying 
amount of any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognised when replaced. 
All other repairs and maintenance are charged 
to the statement of profit and loss during the 
reporting period in which they are incurred.
	
Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of 
property, plant and equipment that are not yet 
ready for their intended use on the reporting 
date and materials at site.
	
Subsequent 
measurement 
(Depreciation 
methods, estimated useful lives and residual 
value):
	
Property, plant and equipment are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and 
impairment 
losses. 
Depreciation 
on 
property, plant and equipment is provided on 
a straight-line basis, computed on the basis 
of useful lives (as set out below) prescribed in 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013:
	
The Company, based on technical assessment 
made by technical expert and management 
estimate, 
depreciates 
certain 
property, 
plant and equipment, overestimated useful 
lives which are different from the useful life 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013. The management believes that these 
estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect 
fair approximation of the period over which the 
assets are likely to be used.

*Depreciation on building constructed on leasehold land is 
restricted to lower of useful life of balance period of leasehold 
land or useful life calculated based on 100 years.
	
Depreciation on deemed cost of other property, 
plant and equipment (except land) is provided 
on pro rata basis on straight line method based 
on useful lives specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
The useful lives, residual values and method of 
depreciation of property plant and equipment 
are reviewed and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate at the end of each reporting period.
	
Derecognition:
	
An item of property, plant and equipment 
and any significant part initially recognised 
is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included 
in the statement of profit and loss when the 
asset is derecognised.
2.04	Business combination and goodwill:
	
Business 
combinations 
other 
than 
those 
under 
common 
control 
transactions 
are 
accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred 
measured at acquisition date fair value and 
the amount of any non-controlling interests in 
the acquiree. For each business combination, 
the Company elects whether to measure the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at 
154     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
fair value or at the proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. In respect 
to the business combination for acquisition of 
subsidiary, the Company has opted to measure 
the non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs 
are expensed as incurred.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are 
recognised at their acquisition date fair values. 
For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include 
contingent 
liabilities 
representing 
present 
obligation and they are measured at their 
acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact 
that outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits is not probable.
	
When the Company acquires a business, it 
assesses the financial assets and liabilities 
assumed 
for 
appropriate 
classification 
and 
designation 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances 
and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition 
date. This includes the separation of embedded 
derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. 
If the business combination is achieved in 
stages, any previously held equity interest is re-
measured at its acquisition date fair value and 
any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss or OCI, as appropriate.
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for non-
controlling interests, and any previous interest 
held, over the net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the 
net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Company re-
assesses whether it has correctly identified all 
of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to 
measure the amounts to be recognised at the 
acquisition date. If the reassessment still results 
in an excess of the fair value of net assets 
acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in OCI 
and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. 
However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain 
purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly 
in equity as capital reserve, without routing the 
same through OCI.
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Company’s cash-generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities 
of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill 
has been allocated is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit 
is less than it carrying amount, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata 
based on the carrying amount of each asset 
in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill 
is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in 
subsequent periods.
2.05	Investment in equity instruments of 
subsidiaries:
	
A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the 
Company. The Company controls its subsidiary 
when the company is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the 
subsidiary and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the subsidiary.
	
The consideration made in determining whether 
significant influence or joint control are similar 
to those necessary to determine control over 
the subsidiaries.
	
Investment in equity instruments of subsidiaries 
are stated at cost as per Ind AS 27 ‘Separate 
Financial Statements’. Where the carrying 
amount of an investment is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount, it is assessed 
for recoverability and in case of permanent 
diminution provision for impairment is recorded 
in Statement of Profit and Loss. On disposal 
of investment, the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is 
charged or credited to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
2.06 Investment Properties
	
Property that is held for long term rental 
yields or for capital appreciation or for both, 
and that is not occupied by the Company, is 
classified as investment property. Investment 
property is measured initially at its cost, 
including related transaction cost and where 
applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, investment properties are 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment loss, if any.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25     155
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to assets 
carrying amount only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to the Company and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
When significant parts of investment property 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
Company depreciates them separately based on 
their respective useful lives. All other repair and 
maintenance cost are expensed when incurred.
	
Though the Company measures investment 
property using cost-based measurement, the 
fair value of investment property is disclosed in 
the notes. Fair values are determined based on 
an annual evaluation performed by an external 
independent valuer applying a valuation model 
as per Ind AS 113 “ Fair value measurement”.
	
Investment properties are derecognised either 
when they have been disposed of or when 
they are permanently withdrawn from use and 
no future economic benefit is expected from 
their disposal. The difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset is recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss in the period of derecognition.
	
Investment properties are depreciated using 
straight line method over their estimated useful 
life i.e. 30 years.
	
Transfers are made to (or from) investment 
properties only when there is a change in 
use. Transfers between investment property, 
owner-occupied 
property 
and 
inventories 
do not change the carrying amount of the 
property transferred and they do not change 
the cost of that property for measurement or 
disclosure purposes.
2.07	Intangible Assets
	
Intangible assets including brand acquired 
separately are measured on initial recognition 
at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in 
a business combination is their fair value at the 
date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed 
as either finite or indefinite.
	
Computer Software for internal use, which is 
primarily acquired from third party vendors, is 
capitalised. Subsequent costs associated with 
maintaining such software are recognised as 
expense as incurred. Cost of software includes 
license fees and cost of implementation/system 
integration services, where applicable.
	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised 
over the useful economic life (Computer software 
5 years) and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangible asset 
may be impaired. The amortisation period and 
the amortisation method for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life are reviewed at least 
at the end of each reporting period. Changes 
in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset are considered 
to modify the amortisation period or method, 
as appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates. The amortisation 
expense on intangible assets with finite lives is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
unless such expenditure forms part of carrying 
value of another asset.
	
The Brand under the head ‘Intangible assets’ is 
being amortised based on the useful life of 20 
years as assessed by the management based on 
technical assessment made by technical expert.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are 
not amortized, but are tested for impairment 
annually, either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level. The assessment of 
indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine 
whether the indefinite life continues to be 
supportable. If not, the change in useful life from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss when the asset 
is derecognised.
	
Amortisation method
	
Computer software are amortized on a straight 
line basis over estimated useful life of five years 
from the date of capitalisation.
	
Brand are amortized on a straight line basis 
over estimated useful life of Twenty years from 
the date of capitalisation.
2.08	Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date, 
whether there is an indication that an asset 
may be impaired. If any indication exists, or 
when annual impairment testing for an asset 
is required, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an assets or cash-
generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of 
disposal and its value in use. The recoverable 
156     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
amount is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets or Company’s assets. When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 
considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted 
share prices for publicly traded companies or 
other available fair value indicators.
	
The Company bases its impairment calculation 
on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, 
which are prepared separately for each of the 
Company’s CGUs to which the individual assets 
are allocated. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of five 
to eight years. For longer periods, a long-term 
growth rate is calculated and applied to project 
future cash flows after the 8th year. To estimate 
cash flow projections beyond periods covered 
by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the 
Company extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining growth 
rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing 
rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate 
does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, or country or 
countries in which the Company operates, or for 
the market in which the asset is used.
	
Impairment losses of continuing operations, 
including 
impairment 
on 
inventories, 
are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss, 
except for properties previously revalued 
with the revaluation surplus taken to OCI. For 
such properties, the impairment is recognised 
in OCI up to the amount of any previous 
revaluation surplus.
	
An assessment is made at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no 
longer exist or have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Company estimates the assets 
or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed only 
if there has been a change in the assumptions 
used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was 
recognised. The reversal is limited so that the 
carrying amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net 
of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued 
amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as 
a revaluation increase.
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at 
each reporting date and when circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be 
impaired. 
Impairment 
is 
determined 
for 
goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount 
of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the 
goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount 
of the CGU is less than it’s carrying amount, 
an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment 
losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in 
future periods. Intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives are tested for impairment annually 
at each reporting date at the CGU level, as 
appropriate, and when circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired.
2.09	Financial instruments:
	
A financial instrument is any contract that 
gives rise to a financial asset of one entity 
and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
	
(i)	 Financial Assets
	
	
The Company classifies its financial assets in 
the following measurement categories:
•	 Those to be measured subsequently at fair 
value (either through other comprehensive 
income, or through profit or loss)
•	 Those measured at amortized cost
	
	
The classification of financial assets at 
initial recognition depends on the financial 
asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics 
and the Company’s business model for 
managing them.
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing 
component or for which the Company 
has applied the practical expedient, the 
Company initially measures a financial asset 
at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial 
asset not at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs.

Trade receivables that do not contain 
a 
significant 
financing 
component 
or 
for which the Company has applied the 
practical expedient and are measured at the 
transaction price determined under Ind AS 
115. Refer to the accounting policies in section 
‘Revenue from contracts with customers’.
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash 
flows that are ‘solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred 
to as the SPPI test and is performed at an 
instrument level. Financial assets with cash 
flows that are not SPPI are classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
	
	
The Company’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages 
its financial assets in order to generate 
cash flows. The business model determines 
whether cash flows will result from collecting 
contractual cash flows, selling the financial 
assets, or both.
	
	
Financial assets classified and measured at 
amortised cost are held within a business 
model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows while financial assets classified and 
measured at fair value through OCI are held 
within a business model with the objective 
of both holding to collect contractual cash 
flows and selling.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement 
financial 
assets 
are 
classified 
in 
following categories:
•	 Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
•	 Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with 
recycling of cumulative gains and losses 
(debt instruments)
•	 Financial 
assets 
designated 
at 
fair 
value through OCI with no recycling 
of cumulative gains and losses upon 
derecognition (equity instruments)
•	 Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the 
amortised 
cost 
if 
both 
the 
following 
conditions are met:
	
	
(a)	 Business model test: The objective 
is to hold the financial asset to collect 
the contractual cash flows (rather 
than to sell the instrument prior to its 
contractual maturity to realize its fair 
value changes) and;
	
	
(b) 	Cash flow characteristics test: The 
contractual 
terms 
of 
the 
financial 
asset give rise on specific dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on principal 
amount outstanding.
	
	
	
This category is most relevant to the 
Company. After initial measurement, 
such financial assets are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of EIR. EIR is the rate 
that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash receipts over the expected 
life of the financial instrument or a 
shorter 
period, 
where 
appropriate, 
to the gross carrying amount of the 
financial asset. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Company 
estimates the expected cash flows by 
considering all the contractual terms of 
the financial instrument but does not 
consider the expected credit losses. The 
EIR amortization is included in other 
income in statement of profit and loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are 
recognized in the profit or loss. This 
category generally applies to trade and 
other receivables.
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
(FVTOCI) (debt instruments)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the 
FVTOCI if both of the following criteria 
are met:
	
	
(a) 	 Business model test: The objective of 
financial instrument is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling the financial assets; and

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
(b)	 Cash 
flow 
characteristics 
test: 
The contractual terms of the Debt 
instrument give rise on specific dates 
to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on principal 
amount outstanding.
	
	
	
Debt instrument included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at 
fair value. Fair value movements are 
recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI), except for the recognition 
of interest income, impairment gains or 
losses and foreign exchange gains or 
losses which are recognized in statement 
of profit and loss and computed in 
the same manner as for financial 
assets measured at amortised cost. 
The remaining fair value changes are 
recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, 
the 
cumulative 
fair 
value 
changes 
recognised in OCI is reclassified from 
the equity to profit or loss.
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss are carried in the balance sheet 
at fair value with net changes in fair value 
recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. This category includes derivative 
instruments and listed equity investments 
which the Company had not irrevocably 
elected to classify at fair value through 
OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments 
are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss when the right of payment has 
been established.
	
	
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI (equity instruments)
	
	
Upon initial recognition, the Company 
can elect to classify irrevocably its equity 
investments as equity instruments designated 
at fair value through OCI when they meet the 
definition of equity under Ind AS 32 Financial 
Instruments: Presentation and are not held 
for trading. The classification is determined 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Equity 
instruments which are held for trading and 
contingent consideration recognised by an 
acquirer in a business combination to which 
Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the statement 
of profit and loss when the right of payment 
has been established, except when the 
Company benefits from such proceeds as a 
recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded 
in OCI. Equity instruments designated at 
fair value through OCI are not subject to 
impairment assessment.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part 
of a financial asset or part of a group of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognised 
(i.e. removed from the Company’s statement 
of financial position) when:
•	 The rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset have expired, or
•	 the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset or has 
assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a “pass through” 
arrangement and either;
	
	
(a)	the Company has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
	
	
(b)	 the Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset but has transferred 
control of the asset.
	
	
When the Company has transferred its rights 
to receive cash flows from an asset or has 
entered into a pass-through arrangement, 
it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control of the 
asset, the Company continues to recognise 
the transferred asset to the extent of the 
Company’s 
continuing 
involvement. 
In 
that case, the Company also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and 
the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations 
that the Company has retained.
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form 
of a guarantee over the transferred asset is 
measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the Company 
could be required to repay.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with IND AS 109, the Company 
applies expected credit losses(ECL) model

for 
measurement 
and 
recognition 
of 
impairment loss on the following financial 
asset and credit risk exposure
•	 Financial 
assets 
measured 
at 
amortized cost;
•	 Financial assets measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI);
	
	
ECLs are based on the difference between 
the contractual cash flows due in accordance 
with the contract and all the cash flows that 
the Company expects to receive, discounted 
at an approximation of the original effective 
interest rate. The expected cash flows will 
include cash flows from the sale of collateral 
held or other credit enhancements that are 
integral to the contractual terms.
	
	
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For 
credit exposures for which there has not 
been a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition, ECLs are provided 
for credit losses that result from default 
events that are possible within the next 
12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those 
credit exposures for which there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, a loss allowance is required for 
credit losses expected over the remaining life 
of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of 
the default (a lifetime ECL).
	
	
The Company follows “simplified approach” 
for 
recognition 
of 
impairment 
loss 
allowance on:
•	 Trade 
receivables 
or 
contract 
revenue receivables.
•	 All lease receivables resulting from the 
transactions within the scope of Ind AS 
116 -Leases”.
	
	
Under the simplified approach, the Company 
does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, 
it recognizes impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition. 
The Company uses a provision matrix to 
determine impairment loss allowance on the 
portfolio of trade receivables. The provision 
matrix is based on its historically observed 
default rates over the expected life of trade 
receivable and is adjusted for forward 
looking estimates. At every reporting date, 
the historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-looking 
estimates are analysed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized 
as income/ expense in the Standalone 
statement of profit and loss. This amount is 
reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in 
the statement of Standalone statement of 
profit and loss. The Standalone statement of 
assets and liabilities presentation for various 
financial instruments is described below:”
	
	
(a)	 Financial 
assets 
measured 
as 
at 
amortised cost: ECL is presented as 
an allowance, i.e., as an integral part 
of the measurement of those assets in 
the statement of assets and liabilities. 
The allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Company does not reduce 
impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
(b)	 Loan 
commitments 
and 
financial 
guarantee contracts: ECL is presented 
as a provision in the statement of assets 
and liabilities, i.e., as a liability.
	
	
(c)	 Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: 
For debt instruments measured at 
FVTOCI, the expected credit losses 
do not reduce the carrying amount in 
the statement of assets and liabilities, 
which remains at fair value. Instead, 
an amount equal to the allowance that 
would arise if the asset was measured 
at amortised cost is recognised in 
other comprehensive income as the 
accumulated impairment amount.”
	
(ii)	 Financial liabilities:
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified at initial 
recognition as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
and payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. All financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at fair value and, in the 
case of loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Company financial liabilities include 
loans and borrowings, trade payables, trade 
deposits, retention money, liabilities towards 
services and other payables.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial 
liabilities 
are 
classified 
in 
two categories:
160     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
(i)	 Financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
(ii)	 Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(loans and borrowings)”
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss include financial liabilities held for 
trading and financial liabilities designated 
upon initial recognition as at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial liabilities 
are classified as held for trading if they are 
incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in 
the near term. This category also includes 
derivative financial instruments entered into 
by the Company that are not designated as 
hedging instruments in hedge relationship 
as defined by Ind AS 109. The separated 
embedded derivate are also classified as 
held for trading unless they are designated 
as effective hedging instruments.
	
	
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading 
are recognized in the statement of profit 
and loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or 
loss are designated as such at the initial 
date of recognition, and only if the criteria 
in IND AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities 
designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses 
attributable to changes in own credit risk are 
recognized in OCI. These gains/ losses are 
not subsequently transferred to profit and 
loss. However, the Company may transfer 
the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All 
other changes in fair value of such liability 
are recognized in the statement of profit or 
loss. The Company has not designated any 
financial liability as at fair value through 
profit and loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(Loans and borrowings)
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings 
are 
subsequently 
measured 
at amortized cost using the Effective 
interest rate method. Gains and losses 
are recognized in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through 
the Effective interest rate amortization 
process. Amortized cost is calculated by 
taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the Effective interest rate. 
The Effective interest rate amortization is 
included as finance costs in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the 
Company are those contracts that require a 
payment to be made to reimburse the holder 
for a loss it incurs because the specified 
debtor fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a debt 
instrument. Financial guarantee contracts 
are recognised initially as a liability at fair 
value, adjusted for transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the issuance of 
the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is 
measured at the higher of the amount of loss 
allowance determined as per impairment 
requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount 
recognised less cumulative amortisation.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financials assets and financial liabilities are 
offset, and the net amount is reported in the 
statement of assets and liabilities if there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognized amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
	
Reclassification of financial assets/ 
financial liabilities
	
	
The 
Company 
determines 
classification 
of financial assets and liabilities on initial 
recognition. After initial recognition, no 
reclassification is made for financial assets 
which are equity instruments and financial 
liabilities. For financial assets which are debt 
instruments, a reclassification is made only 
if there is a change in the business model 
for managing those assets. Changes to the 
business model are expected to be infrequent. 
The 
Company’s 
senior 
management 
determines change in the business model as

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Company’s operations. 
Such changes are evident to external parties. 
A change in the business model occurs 
when the Company either begins or ceases 
to perform an activity that is significant to 
its operations. If the Company reclassifies 
financial assets, it applies the reclassification 
prospectively from the reclassification date 
which is the first day of the immediately next 
reporting period following the change in 
business model.
2.10	Inventories:
	
Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net 
realisable value.
	
Cost includes the cost of purchase and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories (other 
than finished goods) to their present location 
and condition. Cost of finished goods includes 
cost of direct materials and labour and a 
proportion of manufacturing overheads based 
on the normal operating capacity but excluding 
borrowing costs. Cost is determined on a first in 
first out basis.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business less 
estimated costs necessary to make sale.
2.11	Income Tax:
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period 
is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable 
income based on the applicable income tax rate 
for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
	
Current income tax
	
The current income tax charge is calculated on 
the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period. 
Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulation is subject 
to interpretation and considers whether it is 
probable that a taxation authority will accept 
an uncertain tax treatment. The Company 
measures its tax balances either based on the 
most likely amount or the expected value, 
depending on which method provides a better 
prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit 
or loss (either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred income tax is provided in full, 
using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts 
in 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements. However, deferred tax liabilities 
are not recognised if they arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred 
income tax is also not accounted for if it 
arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting profit 
nor taxable profit (tax loss). Deferred income 
tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the end of the reporting period 
and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised, or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences and 
unused tax losses only if it is probable that 
future taxable amounts will be available 
to 
utilise 
those 
temporary 
differences 
and losses.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amount and tax bases of investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
and interest in joint arrangements where the 
Company is able to control the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences and 
it is probable that the differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are not recognised for 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amount and tax bases of investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
and interest in joint arrangements where 
it is not probable that the differences will 
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable 
profit will not be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
where there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset current tax assets and liabilities 
and where the deferred tax balances relate 
to the same taxation authority. Current tax 
assets and tax liabilities are offset where 
the entity has a legally enforceable right to 
offset and intends either to settle on a net 
basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Current and deferred tax is recognised in 
statement of profit and loss, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, respectively.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting 
date and are recognised to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable 
profits will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss is recognised outside 
profit or loss (either in other comprehensive 
income or in equity). Deferred tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
2.12	Revenue from contract with customers:
	
Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects 
the consideration to which the Company expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring the 
promised goods or services to a customer i.e., 
on transfer of control of the goods or service 
to the customer. Revenue from sales of goods 
or rendering of services is net of Indirect taxes, 
returns and variable consideration on account 
of discounts and schemes offered by the 
Company as part of the contract. The Company 
applies the revenue recognition criteria to 
each separately identifiable component of the 
revenue transaction as set out below:
	
(i)	Revenue from sale of services (Rooms, Food 
and Beverage & Banquets):
•	 Revenue is recognised at the transaction 
price that is allocated to the performance 
obligation. Revenue includes room revenue, 
food and beverage sale and banquet 
services which is recognised once the rooms 
are occupied, food and beverages are sold, 
and banquet services have been provided as 
per the contract with the customer.
•	 Revenue is recognised net of discounts and 
sales related taxes in the period in which 
the services are rendered. The Company 
collects Goods and Service Tax (GST) and 
value added tax (VAT) on behalf of the 
government, and therefore, these are not 
economic benefits flowing to the Company.
	
(ii)	Other Operating Revenue:
•	 Exports entitlements [arising out of Served 
from India Scheme (SFIS)] are recognised 
when the right to receive credit as per the 
terms of the schemes is established in 
respect of the exports made by the Company 
and when there is no significant uncertainty 
regarding the ultimate collection of the 
relevant export proceeds.
•	 Loyalty Programme: The Company operates 
a loyalty point’s programme, which allows 
customers to accumulate points when 
they obtain services in the Company’s 
Hotels. 
This 
programme 
provides 
a 
material right to customers, in the form 
of award points, on eligible spends. The 
promise to provide the discount through 
award points to the customer is therefore 
a separate performance obligation. The 
points so earned by such customers are 
accumulated and have a fixed redemption 
price. The revenues related to award points 
pertaining to the Company is deferred and 
a contract liability is created at the time of 
initial sales basis the points awarded to the 
customer and the likelihood of redemption, 
as evidenced by the Company’s historical 
experience. On redemption or expiry of such 
award points, revenue is recognised at pre-
determined rates.
•	 Space and Shop Rentals: Rentals basically 
consists of rental revenue earned from 
letting of spaces for retails and office at the 
properties. Revenue is recognised in the 
period in which services are being rendered.
•	 Other Allied Services: In relation to laundry 
income, 
communication 
income, 
health 
club income, airport transfers income and 
other allied services, the revenue has been 
recognised by reference to the time of 
service rendered.
•	 Management 
and 
Operating 
Fees: 
Management 
fees 
earned 
from 
hotels 
managed by the Company are usually 
under long-term contracts with the hotel 
owner. Under Management and Operating 
Agreements, the Company’s performance 
obligation is to provide hotel management 
services and a license to use the Company’s 
trademark and other intellectual property. 
Management and incentive fee are earned 
as a percentage of revenue and profit and 
are recognised when earned in accordance

with the terms of the contract based on 
the underlying revenue, when collectability 
is certain and when the performance 
criteria are met. Both are treated as 
variable consideration.
•	 Membership Fees: Membership fee income 
majorly 
consists 
of 
membership 
fees 
received from the loyalty programme and 
Chamber membership fees. In respect of 
performance obligations satisfied over a 
period of time, revenue is recognised at 
the allocated transaction price on a time-
proportion basis.
	
(iii)	Interest Income:
	
	
Interest income is recorded on accrual 
basis using the effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. For all debt instruments 
measured either at amortised cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive 
income, interest income is recorded using 
the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the 
rate that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash payments or receipts over the 
expected life of the financial instrument 
or a shorter period, where appropriate, to 
the gross carrying amount of the financial 
asset or to the amortised cost of a financial 
liability. When calculating the effective 
interest rate, the Company estimates the 
expected cash flows by considering all the 
contractual terms of the financial instrument 
(for example, prepayment, extension, call 
and similar options) but does not consider 
the expected credit losses.
	
(iv) Rental Income:
	
	
Rental income is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease over 
the lease terms and is included in revenue 
in the statement of profit or loss due to its 
operating nature.
	
(v)	 Dividend Income:
	
	
Dividend income is recognised at the time 
when the right to receive is established which 
is generally when shareholders approve 
the dividend.
	
(vi) Contract balances
	
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration 
in exchange for goods or services transferred 
to the customer. If the Company performs by 
transferring goods or services to a customer 
before the customer pays consideration or 
before payment is due, a contract asset is 
recognised for the earned consideration that 
is conditional.
	
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer 
goods or services to a customer for which 
the Company has received consideration (or 
an amount of consideration is due) from the 
customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before 
the 
Company 
transfers 
goods 
or services to the customer, a contract 
liability is recognised when the payment is 
made, or the payment is due (whichever is 
earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as 
revenue when the Company performs under 
the contract.
	
	
A trade receivable is recognised if an amount 
of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., 
only the passage of time is required before 
payment of the consideration is due). Refer 
to accounting policies of financial assets 
in section (Financial instruments – initial 
recognition and subsequent measurement).
2.13	Retirement and other employee benefits:
	
Retirement benefit in the form of provident 
fund is a defined contribution scheme. The 
Company has no obligation, other than the 
contribution payable to the provident fund. 
The Company recognizes contribution payable 
to the provident fund scheme as an expense, 
when an employee renders the related service. 
If the contribution payable to the scheme for 
service received before the balance sheet date 
exceeds the contribution already paid, the 
deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a 
liability after deducting the contribution already 
paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds 
the contribution due for services received 
before the balance sheet date, then excess is 
recognized as an asset to the extent that the 
pre-payment will lead to, a reduction in future 
payment or a cash refund.
	
The Company operates a defined benefit gratuity 
plan in India, which requires contributions to be 
made to a separately administered fund.
	
The cost of providing benefits under the defined 
benefit plan is determined using the projected 
unit credit method.
	
Remeasurements, 
comprising 
of 
actuarial 
gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, 
excluding amounts included in net interest on 
the net defined benefit liability and the return 
on plan assets (excluding amounts included in 
net interest on the net defined benefit liability), 
are recognised immediately in the balance sheet 
with a corresponding debit or credit to retained 
earnings through OCI in the period in which they 
164     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
Past service costs are recognised in profit or 
loss on the earlier of:
•	 The date of the plan amendment or 
curtailment, and
•	 The date that the Company recognises 
related restructuring costs
	
“Net interest is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net defined benefit liability 
or asset. The Company recognises the following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation as 
an expense in the statement of profit and loss:
•	 Service costs comprising current service 
costs, 
past-service 
costs, 
gains 
and 
losses on curtailments and non-routine 
settlements; and
•	 Net interest expense or income
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be 
utilized within the next 12 months, is treated 
as short-term employee benefit. The Company 
measures the expected cost of such absences 
as the additional amount that it expects to 
pay as a result of the unused entitlement that 
has accumulated at the reporting date. The 
Company recognizes expected cost of short-
term employee benefit as an expense, when an 
employee renders the related service.
2.14	Leases:
	
The Company assesses at contract inception 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That 
is, if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time 
in exchange for consideration.
	
Company as a lessee
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily 
comprise of lease for land and building. The 
Company applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except 
for short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets. The Company recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-
of-use assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
	
(i)	 Right-of-use assets
	
	
The Company recognises right-of-use assets 
at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., 
the date the underlying asset is available 
for use). Right-of-use assets are measured 
at cost, less any accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, and 
adjusted for any remeasurement of lease 
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets 
includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received. Right-of-use assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
unexpired period of respective leases.
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to 
the Company at the end of the lease term or 
the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase 
option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The right-
of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section 
‘Impairment of non-financial assets.
	
	
(ii)	 Lease Liabilities
	
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, 
the Company recognises lease liabilities 
measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed 
payments (including in substance fixed 
payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments 
that depend on an index or a rate, and 
amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease 
payments also include the exercise price 
of a purchase option reasonably certain 
to be exercised by the Company and 
payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects 
the Company exercising the option to 
terminate. Variable lease payments that 
do not depend on an index or a rate are 
recognised as expenses (unless they are 
incurred to produce inventories) in the 
period in which the event or condition 
that triggers the payment occurs.”
	
	
	
In calculating the present value of 
lease payments, the Company uses 
its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because 
the interest rate implicit in the lease 
is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of 
lease liabilities is increased to reflect the 
accretion of interest and reduced for 
the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a modification, a 
change in the lease term, a change in the

lease payments (e.g., changes to future 
payments resulting from a change in an 
index or rate used to determine such 
lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the 
underlying asset.
	
	
(iii)	Short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets
	
	
	
The Company applies the short-term 
lease recognition exemption to its short-
term leases (i.e., those leases that have a 
lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option). It also applies the 
lease of low-value assets recognition 
exemption to leases that are considered 
to be low value. Lease payments on 
short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognised as expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
	
	
Company as a lessor
	
	
	
Leases for which the Company is a lessor 
is classified as finance or operating lease. 
Leases in which the Company does not 
transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of an 
asset are classified as operating leases. 
Rental income arising is accounted for 
on a straight-line basis over the lease 
terms. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating 
lease are added to the carrying amount 
of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis 
as rental income. Contingent rents are 
recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned.
2.15	Earnings Per Share:
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by 
dividing the net profit or loss for the period 
attributable to equity holders by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the period. The weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period is adjusted for events such as bonus 
issue, bonus element in a rights issue, share 
split, and reverse share split (consolidation of 
shares) that have changed the number of equity 
shares outstanding, without a corresponding 
change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings 
per share, the net profit or loss for the period 
attributable to equity holders and the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding during 
the period are adjusted for the effect of all 
potentially dilutive equity shares.
2.16	Borrowing Costs:
	
Borrowing cost includes interest and other 
costs incurred in connection with the borrowing 
of funds and charged to Statement of Profit 
& Loss on the basis of effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Borrowing cost also includes 
exchange differences to the extent regarded as 
an adjustment to the borrowing cost.
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of an 
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period 
of time to get ready for its intended use or 
sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the 
respective asset. All other borrowing costs are 
recognized as expense in the period in which 
they occur.
2.17	Share Based Payments:
	
Certain 
employees 
(including 
senior 
management personnel) of the Company 
receive part of their remuneration in the form 
of share based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for 
shares or rights over share (equity-settled 
transactions). 
The 
cost 
of 
equity-settled 
transactions with employees is determined 
measured at fair value at the date at which 
they are granted using an appropriate valuation 
model. That cost is recognised, together with a 
corresponding increase in share-based payment 
(SBP) reserves in equity, over the period in which 
the service conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits expense. The cumulative expense 
recognised 
for 
equity-settled 
transactions 
at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The statement of profit and loss 
expense or credit for a period represents the 
movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period 
and 
is 
recognised 
in 
employee 
benefits 
expense. Service and non-market performance 
conditions are not taken into account when 
determining the grant date fair value of awards, 
but the likelihood of the conditions being met 
is assessed as part of the Company’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest.
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised 
166     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
is the expense had the terms had not been 
modified, if the original terms of the award are 
met. An additional expense is recognised for 
any modification that increases the total fair 
value of the share-based payment transaction 
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification. Where 
an award is cancelled by the entity or by the 
counterparty, any remaining element of the fair 
value of the award is expensed immediately 
through profit or loss.
2.18	Cash and cash equivalents:
	
Cash and Cash and cash equivalent in the 
Standalone Statement of Assets and Liabilities 
comprises of cash at banks and on hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less, that are readily convertible 
to a known amount of cash and subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
For the purpose of the Standalone statement of 
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are 
considered an integral part of the Company’s 
cash management.
2.19	Foreign currency translation:
	
(i)	Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items included in the Financial Statements 
are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The 
Company’s 
Standalone 
financial 
statements are presented in INR, which is 
the functional currency for the Company.
	
(ii) Transactions and balances
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated 
into the functional currency using the 
exchange rate prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transaction and from the translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at year end exchange 
rate 
are 
generally 
recognised 
in 
the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates at 
the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in 
a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair 
value is determined.
	
(iii)	Exchange differences
	
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement 
or 
translation 
of 
monetary 
items 
are 
recognized as income or expense in the 
period in which they arise with the exception 
of exchange differences on gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items 
measured at fair value which is treated in 
line with the recognition of the gain or loss 
on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair 
value gain or loss is recognized in OCI or 
profit or loss are also recognized in OCI or 
profit or loss, respectively).”
2.20	Fair value Measurement:
	
The 
Company 
measures 
its 
financial 
instruments such as derivative instruments, 
etc at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The 
fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the 
asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
•	 In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
•	 In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset 
or liability
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is 
measured using the assumptions that market 
participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability, assuming that market participants 
act in their economic best interest. A fair value 
measurement of a non-financial asset takes 
into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset 
in its highest and best use or by selling it to 
another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value 
is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
•	 Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market 
prices in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities.

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
•	 Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable.
•	 Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement is unobservable.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
	
External valuers are involved for valuation 
of significant assets, such as investment 
properties and unquoted financial assets. 
Valuers 
are 
selected 
based 
on 
market 
knowledge, 
reputation, 
independence 
and 
whether professional standards are maintained. 
For other assets management carries out the 
valuation based on its experience, market 
knowledge and in line with the applicable 
accounting requirements.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets 
and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability 
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.
	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair 
value. Other fair value related disclosures are 
given in the relevant notes:
•	 Quantitative 
disclosures 
of 
fair 
value 
measurement hierarchy (refer note 47)
•	 Investment in unquoted equity share (refer 
note 6)
•	 Financial 
instruments 
(including 
those 
carried at amortised cost) (refer note 47)
•	 Disclosures for valuation methods, significant 
estimates and assumptions (refer note 47)
•	 Investment properties (refer note 5)
2.21	Provisions and Contingent Liabilities:
	
Provisions:
	
Provisions are recognised when the Company 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
because of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. When the Company expects 
some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset, but only when the reimbursement is 
virtually certain. The expense relating to a 
provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-
tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the 
risks specific to the liability. When discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
	
Contingent liability is disclosed for:
•	 Possible obligations which will be confirmed 
only by future events not wholly within the 
control of the Company or
•	 Present obligations arising from past events 
where it is not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount 
of the obligation cannot be made.
2.22	Significant estimates and judgement:
	
The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
these financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses for the years 
presented. These judgements and estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the 
relevant facts and circumstances, having regard 
to previous experience, but actual results may 
differ materially from the amounts included in 
the financial statements.
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised, and 
future periods affected.
	
The information about significant areas of 
estimation uncertainty and critical judgements 
in applying accounting policies that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements are as 
given below:”
	
(i)	Significant estimates
	
	
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
168     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
The 
Company 
has 
carry 
forward 
tax 
losses, unabsorbed depreciation and MAT 
credit that are available for offset against 
future taxable profit. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the unused tax losses or tax 
credits can be utilised. This involves an 
assessment of when those assets are likely 
to reverse, and a judgement as to whether 
there will be sufficient taxable profits 
available to offset the assets. This requires 
assumptions regarding future profitability, 
which is inherently uncertain. To the extent 
assumptions regarding future profitability 
change, there can be an increase or decrease 
in the amounts recognised in respect of 
deferred tax assets and consequential 
impact in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
asset 
is 
recognized 
on 
unabsorbed 
depreciation 
and 
business 
losses to the extent it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences and 
unabsorbed depreciation can be utilised.
	
(ii)	 Significant judgements
	
	
a)	
Determining the Lease Term
	
	
	
Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ requires lessees to 
determine the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease adjusted 
with any option to extend or terminate 
the lease, if the use of such option 
is reasonably certain. The Company 
makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on a lease-by-lease basis 
and thereby assesses whether it is 
reasonably certain that any options to 
extend or terminate the contract will be 
exercised. In evaluating the lease term, 
the Company considers factors such as 
any significant leasehold improvements 
undertaken over the lease term, costs 
relating to the termination of the lease 
and the importance of the underlying 
asset to Company’s operations taking 
into 
account 
the 
location 
of 
the 
underlying asset and the availability 
of 
suitable 
alternatives. 
The 
lease 
term in future periods is reassessed 
to ensure that the lease term reflects 
the current economic circumstances. 
Critical Judgements in Determining 
the Discount Rate: The discount rate 
is generally based on the incremental 
borrowing rate specific to the lease 
being evaluated or for a portfolio of 
leases with similar characteristics.
	
	
b)	
Employee 
Benefits 
(Estimation 
of 
defined benefit obligation)
	
	
	
Post-employment 
benefits 
represent 
obligation that will be settled in the future 
and require assumptions to project 
benefit obligations. Post-employment 
benefit 
accounting 
is 
intended 
to 
reflect the recognition of future benefit 
cost over the employee’s approximate 
service period, based on the terms of 
plans and the investment and funding 
decisions made. The accounting requires 
the Company to make assumptions 
regarding variables such as discount 
rate, rate of compensation increase 
and future mortality rates. Changes 
in these key assumptions can have a 
significant impact on the defined benefit 
obligations, funding requirements and 
benefit costs incurred.
	
	
c) 	 Impairment of trade receivables
	
	
	
The risk of collectability of accounts 
receivable is primarily estimated based 
on prior experience with, and the past 
due status of doubtful debtors, while 
large accounts are assessed individually 
based on factors that include ability to 
pay, bankruptcy and payment history. 
The assumptions and estimates applied 
for determining the valuation allowance 
are reviewed periodically.
	
	
d) 	 Estimation of expected useful lives 
and residual values of property, plants 
and equipment
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are 
depreciated at historical cost using 
straight-line method based on the 
estimated useful life, considered at 
residual value. The asset’s residual 
value and useful life are based on the 
Company’s best estimates and reviewed, 
and adjusted if required, at each Balance 
Sheet date.
	
	
e) 	 Contingent Liabilities
	
	
	
Legal proceedings covering a range 
of matters are pending against the 
Company. 
Due 
to 
the 
uncertainty 
inherent in such matters, it is often 
difficult to predict the final outcomes. 
The cases and claims against the

subject 
to 
many 
uncertainties 
and complexities, including but not 
limited to the facts and circumstances 
of each particular case and claim, 
the jurisdiction and the differences in 
applicable law, in the normal course of 
business, the Company consults with 
legal counsel and certain other experts 
on matters related to litigations. The 
Company accrues a liability when it is 
determined that an adverse outcome 
is probable, and the amount of the loss 
can be reasonably estimated. In the 
event an adverse outcome is possible, 
or an estimate is not determinable, the 
matter is disclosed.
	
	
f)	
Fair value measurements
	
	
	
When the fair values of financial assets 
and financial liabilities recorded in the 
Balance Sheet cannot be measured 
based on quoted prices in active 
markets, their fair values are measured 
using valuation techniques which involve 
various judgements and assumptions.
	
	
g)	 Impairment testing
	
	
	
Impairment Testing: Property, plant and 
equipment, Right-of-Use assets and 
intangible assets that are subject to 
depreciation/ amortisation are tested for 
impairment periodically including when 
events occur or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit is less than its 
carrying value. The recoverable amount 
of cash generating units is higher of 
value-in-use and fair value less cost 
to sell. The calculation involves use of 
significant estimates and assumptions 
which includes turnover and earnings 
multiples, growth rates and net margins 
used to calculate projected future cash 
flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future 
economic and market conditions.
2.23	New and amended standards:
	
(i)	Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts
	
	
The Ministry of corporate Affairs (MCA) 
notified the Ind AS 117, Insurance Contracts, 
vide notification dated 12 August 2024, 
under the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) 
Amendment 
Rules, 
2024, 
which is effective from annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2024. 
Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts is a 
comprehensive new accounting standard for 
insurance contracts covering recognition and 
measurement, presentation and disclosure. 
Ind AS 117 replaces Ind AS 104 Insurance 
Contracts. Ind AS 117 applies to all types 
of insurance contracts, regardless of the 
type of entities that issue them as well as to 
certain guarantees and financial instruments 
with discretionary participation features; a 
few scope exceptions will apply. Ind AS 117 is 
based on a general model, supplemented by:
•	 A specific adaptation for contracts with 
direct participation features (the variable 
fee approach)
•	 A simplified approach (the premium 
allocation approach) mainly for short-
duration contracts
•	 The application of Ind AS 117 had no 
impact on the Company standalone 
financial statements as the Company has 
not entered any contracts in the nature 
of insurance contracts covered under Ind 
AS 117.
	
(ii) Amendment to Ind AS 116 Leases – 
Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback
	
	
The MCA notified the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Second Amendment 
Rules, 2024, which amend Ind AS 116, 
Leases, with respect to Lease Liability in a 
Sale and Leaseback.
	
	
The amendment specifies the requirements 
that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the 
lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback 
transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does 
not recognise any amount of the gain or loss 
that relates to the right of use it retains.
	
	
The amendment is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 
2024 and must be applied retrospectively 
to sale and leaseback transactions entered 
into after the date of initial application of Ind 
AS 116.
	
	
The amendment does not have a material 
impact on the Company financial statements.

5.1	 Investment properties primarily consists of 
leasehold land taken for a continuous period 
of 99 years. In prior years, the Company had 
acquired certain parcel of lands aggregating 
to INR 146.78  crores for expanding its hotel 
business. The Company had been actively 
considering opportunities for development and 
sale of portions of each such land parcel.
	
In previous years, the Company acquired certain 
parcel of lands of 3.36 acres at EM Bypass, Kolkata. 
This land parcel was classified as investment 
properties pending a final decision on the extent 
to which each such land parcel may be used 
for purposes other than the Company's hotel 
business. During the year ended March 31, 2024, 
the Company had executed a Joint Development 
Agreement ('JDA'), for development of serviced 
apartments (49% of land area) and hotel (51% of 
land area) at EM Bypass with Ambuja Housing 
and Urban Infrastructure Company Limited 
(“Developer”). Till March 31, 2024, this was still 
classified as investment properties pending 
active development in accordance with Ind AS 
40 “Investment properties”. Management had 
recognised deferred tax asset (‘DTA’) of INR 
19.33 crores arising from difference between 
book values of the portions of land parcels 
that relate to serviced apartment and their 
corresponding indexed costs for tax purposes. 
 
During the year ended, the Company initiated 
architectural designs and other approvals required 
to be taken for the purpose of construction of 
serviced apartments/ hotel, which indicates that 
active development began on the EM Bypass 
property as per Ind AS 40. Accordingly, the 
proportionate land parcel and ancillary cost of 
INR 92.10 crores relating to hotel was transferred 
from investment properties to right-of-use assets 
- Land and INR 88.50 crores relating to serviced 
apartments to inventories. Further, construction 
cost of INR 5.85 crores relating to serviced 
apartments was transferred from capital work-
in-progress to inventories. Consequent to such 
transfer, deferred tax charge of INR 19.33 crores 
was recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss during the year ended March 31, 2025.
	
Fair value of the properties for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 was determined by using the 
market comparable method. This means that 
valuations performed by the valuer are based on 
active market prices, significantly adjusted for 
difference in the nature, location or condition of 
the specific property. As at the date of valuation, 
the properties’ fair values are based on valuations 
performed by Mr. Pradyumna Kumar Dev an 
accredited independent valuer who has relevant 
valuation experience for similar office properties 
in India for the last 7 years and is a registered 
valuer as defined under rule 2 of Companies 
(Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017. 
 
Further, the Company had performed sensitivity 
analysis on the assumptions used by the valuer 
and ensured that the valuation of investment 
properties is appropriate.

Notes:
a) 	 For impairment testing, goodwill of INR 22.81 crores as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 respectively, 
acquired through business combinations for Flurys brand (cash generating unit referred as “CGU”), having 
indefinite life is allocated to the hospitality segment which is also an operating and reportable segment of 
the Company.
	
The Company has performed its annual impairment test for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 
2024 in accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. The Company considers the 
cash flows from the said CGU in comparison to the cash projections at the time of acquisition, amongst 
other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. For the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 
31, 2024, there were no impairment triggers identified since the Company was able to meet the cash 
flow projections.
	
The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is calculated using cash flow projections basis 10.00% growth 
rate (March 31, 2024: 10.00%) till March 31, 2035, 4.50% terminal growth rate (March 31, 2024: 4.50%) for 
periods subsequent to the forecast period of 10 years, pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) 
of 16.00% (March 31, 2024: 13.00%) and capitalisation rate of 9.00% (March 31, 2024: 9.00%). An analysis 
of the sensitivity of the value-in-use to a change in key parameters (such as operating margin, WACC and 
average growth rate) based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which 
the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.

As per the terms of the contract with its customers, the customer loyalty points can be redeemed up to two years from 
generation of points. All other performance obligations are to be completed within one year from the date of contracts with 
customer. Accordingly, the Company has availed the practical expedient available under paragraph 121 of Ind AS 115 and 
dispensed with the additional disclosures with respect to performance obligations that remained unsatisfied (or partially 
unsatisfied) at the balance sheet date. Further, since the terms of the contracts directly identify the transaction price for each 
of the completed performance obligations there are no elements of transaction price which have not been included in the 
revenue recognised in the financial statements. Further, there is no material difference between the contract price and the 
revenue from contract with customers.

Note: (a) The Company has entered into an MOU with the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India 
and Archaeological Survey of India on September 16, 2018 for adopting Jantar Mantar, New Delhi under 
"Adopt a Heritage" scheme. During the year the Company was not able to spend two per cent of the 
average net profit as per section 135(5) in the current financial year. Unspent CSR amount pertaining to 
the commitments made by the Company towards preserving natural heritage, art and culture has been 
transferred to a separate Unspent CSR account of the Company. The amount transferred to the aforesaid 
Unspent CSR account will be spent for the said purpose within the permissible time limit. Accordingly, the 
Company has duly complied with section 135 of the Act read with rules thereunder and the CSR policy of 
the Company.
32	 Earning per share (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders (after adjusting 
for interest on the convertible preference shares, if any) by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on 
conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.
The following reflects the profit and share capital data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

(i) 	 The asset of  INR 30.01 crores (March 31, 2024: INR 41.93 crores) recognized by the Company as MAT 
credit entitlement represents the portion of MAT Assets, which can be recovered and set off in subsequent 
years based on provisions of Section 115JAA of the Income tax Act, 1961. The management based on the 
present trend of profitability and also the future profitability projections, is of the view that there would 
be sufficient taxable income in foreseeable future, which will enable the Company to utilize MAT credit 
assets.	 	
	
	
(ii) 	 Deferred tax asset is recognized on unabsorbed depreciation and carried forward business losses to the 
extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and unabsorbed depreciation can be utilised. The Company has tax losses of INR Nil crores 
(March 31, 2024: INR 20.40 crores) in the form of unabsorbed depreciation that are available for offsetting 
for unlimited period against future taxable profits and carried forward business losses, that are available

There are no financial assets or financial liabilities routed through FVOCI.
	
*Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss.
(ii)	 Fair Value
	
1)	
The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, 
investment in mutual fund and other investments, other current financial assets and other current 
financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of 
these instruments.
	
2) 	 The fair value of the other financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the 
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced 
or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
	
3) 	 The fair values of the company’s interest-bearing borrowings are determined by using effective 
interest rate (EIR) method using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end 
of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 was 
assessed to be insignificant.
	
4) 	 Long-term receivables/payables are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest 
rates, risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the counterparty and the risk characteristics of the 
financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected credit 
losses of these receivables.

The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost in the financial 
statements are a reasonable approximation of their fair values since the company does not anticipate that 
the carrying amount would be significantly different from the values that would eventually be received 
or settled.
	
Fair value hierarchy
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
	
The Company categorises assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of the three levels depending 
on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement which are described as follows:
	
Level 1: Inputs are quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2: Inputs are observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within 
level 1 for the asset and liability.	
	
Level 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to 
observable related market data or Company's assumptions about pricing by market participants.

Valuation inputs and relationship to fair value and valuation process:
	
(i)	 As per the Company policies, whenever any investment is made by the company in equity securities, 
the same is made either with some strategic objective or as a part of contractual arrangement.
	
	
Valuation technique used to determine fair value include
	
	
Investment in unquoted equity shares in Green Infra Wind Farms Limited and Green Infra Wind 
Generation Limited amounting to INR 0.02 (March 31, 2024: 0.02) are made pursuant to the contract 
for procuring electricity supply at the hotels units. Investment in said companies is not usually 
traded in market. Considering the terms of the electricity supply contract and best information 
available in the market, cost of investment is considered as fair value of the investments.
	
(ii)	 Valuation technique for fair value of fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings has been determined 
by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates, country risk factors, and the risk 
characteristics of the financed project.
	
(iii) 	Investment in mutual funds traded in active markets are determined by reference to quotes from the 
financial institutions; for example: Net asset value (NAV) for investments in mutual funds declared by 
mutual fund house.
	
(iv)	 In the absence of observable inputs to measure fair value the assets and liabilities have been classified 
as level 3. The Company has not given further disclosures since the amount involved is not material.
	
The management considers that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities having 
short term maturities recognised in the standalone financial statements approximates their face values.
35 	Financial risk management objectives and policies
	
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings, trade and other payables and other 
financial liabilities. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the operations 
of the Company. The Company’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, loans, 
investments and cash & cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.
	
The Company’s business activities are exposed to a variety of risks including liquidity risk, credit risk 
and market risk. The Company seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks by managing 
them through a structured process of identification, assessment and prioritization of risks followed by 
coordinated efforts to monitor, minimize and mitigate the impact of such risks on its financial performance 
and capital. For this purpose, the Company has laid comprehensive risk assessment and minimization/
mitigation procedures and are reviewed by the management from time to time. These procedures are 
reviewed to ensure that executive management controls risks by way of properly defined framework. The 
Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

(a)	 Trade receivables	
	
	
	
	
	
Trade receivables consist of large number of customers, spread across geographical areas. In order to 
mitigate the risk of financial loss from defaulters, the Company has an ongoing credit evaluation process 
in respect of customers who are allowed credit period. In respect of walk-in customers the company does 
not allow any credit period and therefore, is not exposed to any credit risk.
	
In general, it is presumed that credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition if the payments 
are more than 90 days past due. The Company has a policy to provide for specific receivables which 
are overdue for a period over 180 days. On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Company also uses 
expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or reversal thereof.

(c)	 Credit risk related to investments	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company has made investments in liquid mutual funds to meet their short term liquidity objectives. 
The Company analyses the credit worthiness of the party before investing their funds. The Company 
limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties 
that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these 
counterparties, and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specific industry sectors 
or specific country risks.
B 	 Liquidity risk	
	
	
	
	
	
Liquidity risk implies that the Company may not be able to meet its obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities. The Company manages its liquidity risk on the basis of the business plan that ensures that the 
funds required for financing the business operations and meeting financial liabilities are available in a 
timely manner and in the currency required at optimal costs. The Management regularly monitors rolling 
forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position to ensure it has sufficient cash on an ongoing basis to meet 
operational fund requirements.	
	
	
	
	
	
Additionally, the Company has committed fund and non-fund based credit lines from banks which may 
be drawn anytime based on Company’s fund requirements. The Company maintains a cautious liquidity 
strategy with positive cash balance and undrawn bank lines throughout the year.

C 	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flow of financial instruments may fluctuate because 
of changes in market conditions. Market risk broadly comprises three types of risks namely currency risk, 
interest rate risk and price risk (for equity instruments). The above risks may affect the Company’s income 
and expenses and/or value of its investments. The Company’s exposure to and management of these risks 
are explained below:
(a)	 Interest rate risk	
	
The company’s exposure to risk of change in market interest rates relates primarily to its debt interest 
obligations.  It’s borrowings are at floating rates and its future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates.

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions 
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When 
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method 
(present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the 
reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet. 
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior 
period.
	
Risk associates with plan provisions
Valuations are performed on certain basic set of pre-determined assumptions and other regulatory framework which 
may vary overtime. Thus, the Company is exposed to various risks in providing the above gratuity benefit, the most 
significant of which are as follows:
Interest Rate risk: The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result 
in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the 
liability (as shown in financial statements).
Liquidity Risk: This is the risk that the Company is not able to meet the short term gratuity pay outs. This may arise due 
to non availability of sufficient cash/cash equivalents to meet the liabilities.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
Salary Escalation Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase 
rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of 
increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.
Demographic Risk: The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. 
The Company is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption. 
Regulatory Risk: Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity Act , 1972 (as 
amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations requiring higher gratuity payouts e.g. Increase in the 
maximum limit on gratuity of INR 20,00,000 and upward revision of maximum gratuity limit will result in gratuity plan 
obligation.
Asset Liability Mismatching or Market Risk: The duration of the liability is longer compared to duration of assets, exposing 
the Company to market risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.
Investment Risk: The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular 
investment.

for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements by the Board of Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for assessing 
the ability of their respective companies to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company has adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	 Evaluate 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding 
the 
financial 
information 
of 
the 
entities or business activities within the Group 
of which we are the independent auditors and 
whose financial information we have audited, to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the 
financial statements of such entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are 
the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, 
which have been audited by other auditors, such 
other auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried 
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Holding Company and such other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements of 
which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial 
year ended March 31, 2025 and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure 2 To The Independent Auditor’s Report Of Even Date On The 
Consolidated Financial Statements Of Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels Limited
Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of Apeejay Surrendra Park 
Hotels Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding 
Company”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 
2025, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements of 
the Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
“the Group”) which are companies incorporated in 
India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group, which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls {based on 
the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Holding Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Holding Company's internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance 
Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to 
an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by 
ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
226     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements 
was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our 
audit 
involves 
performing 
procedures 
to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other 
auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the 
Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
With Reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
A 
company's 
internal 
financial 
control 
with 
reference to consolidated financial statements is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company's assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls With Reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Group, which are companies 
incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements and 
such internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Holding Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note issued by the ICAI.
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company, in 
so far as it relates to these 3 subsidiaries, which 
are companies incorporated in India, is based on 
the corresponding reports of the auditors of such 
subsidiaries incorporated in India.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
1.	 Corporate Information
	
Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels Limited (the 
Group) (L85110WB1987PLC222139) is a public 
group domiciled in India and is incorporated in 
India under the provisions of the Companies Act,

India, 700016. The Holding Company got listed 
on National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay 
Stock Exchange (BSE) on February 12, 2024.
	
The Group is primarily engaged in the business 
of owning, operating and managing hotels 
in India under the names "The Park Hotels, 
The Park Collection and Zone by the Park". 
The Consolidated Financial Statements were 
approved for issue in accordance with a resolution 
of the Board of Directors on May 26, 2025.
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements once 
approved by the Board of directors needs to be 
adopted by the shareholders at the annual general 
meeting of the Group. The Board of directors can 
withdraw and re-issue the financial statements 
so adopted only in specific cases such as non-
compliance with the applicable accounting 
standards, with the approval of Tribunal, after 
following the appropriate procedure as per the 
Companies Act, 2013.
2.	 Material Accounting Policies
	
This note provides a list of the material accounting 
policies adopted in the preparation of these 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
2.01 Basis of preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements:
	
These Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (referred to as "Ind AS") as 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
2015, as amended and presentation requirements 
of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies 
Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule  III), as 
amended from time to time, as applicable to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
	
The accounting policies applied by the Group 
in preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are consistent with those adopted 
in the preparation of Consolidated Financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. 
These Consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared for the Group as a going concern 
on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective 
as at March 31, 2025.
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
for the following assets and liabilities which have 
been measured at fair value:
•	 Certain financial assets and liabilities measured 
at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding 
financial instruments);
•	 Defined benefits plan - plan assets measured 
at fair value;
•	 Equity settled ESOP at grant date fair value;
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements are 
presented in Indian Rupees "INR" or “H” and all 
values are rounded to the nearest crores except 
when otherwise indicated.
2.02 Current versus non-current classification:
	
The Group segregates assets and liabilities 
into 
current 
and 
non-current 
categories 
for presentation in the balance sheet after 
considering its normal operating cycle and 
other criteria set out in Ind AS 1, “Presentation of 
Financial Statements”. For this purpose, current 
assets and liabilities include the current portion 
of non-current assets and liabilities respectively.
	
An asset is treated as current when it is:
•	 Expected to be realized or intended to be sold 
or consumed in normal operating cycle
•	 Held primarily for purpose of trading
•	 Expected to be realized within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
•	 cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
A liability is current when:
•	 It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle
•	 It is held primarily for purpose of trading
•	 It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
•	 There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
classified as non- current assets and liabilities. 
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their

realization in cash and cash equivalents, the 
Group has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
2.03 Property, plant and equipment:
	
Recognition and initial measurement:
	
All items of property, plant and equipment are 
stated at deemed cost (fair value as at transition 
date) less accumulated depreciation, impairment 
loss, if any. Deemed cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of 
the items.
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with 
the item will flow to the Group and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. The carrying 
amount of any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognised when replaced. 
All other repairs and maintenance are charged 
to the statement of profit and loss during the 
reporting period in which they are incurred.
	
Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of 
property, plant and equipment that are not yet 
ready for their intended use on the reporting 
date and materials at site.
	
Subsequent measurement (Depreciation 
methods, estimated useful lives and residual 
value):
	
Property, plant and equipment are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. Depreciation on property, 
plant and equipment is provided on a straight‑line 
basis, computed on the basis of useful lives (as 
set out below) prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013:
	
The Group, based on technical assessment 
made by technical expert and management 
estimate, depreciates certain property, plant 
and equipment, overestimated useful lives which 
are different from the useful life prescribed in 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The 
management believes that these estimated useful 
lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation 
of the period over which the assets are likely 
to be used.

*Depreciation on building constructed on leasehold land 
is restricted to lower of useful life of balance period 
of leasehold land or useful life calculated based on 
100 years.
	
Depreciation on deemed cost of other property, 
plant and equipment (except land) is provided 
on pro rata basis on straight line method based 
on useful lives specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
The useful lives, residual values and method of 
depreciation of property plant and equipment 
are reviewed and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate at the end of each reporting period.
	
Derecognition:
	
An item of property, plant and equipment 
and any significant part initially recognised 
is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included 
in the statement of profit and loss when the asset 
is derecognised.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
2.04 Business combination and goodwill:
	
Business combinations other than those under 
common control transactions are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. The cost of 
an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred measured at 
acquisition date fair value and the amount of 
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. 
For each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. In respect to the business combination 
for acquisition of subsidiary, the Group has 
opted to measure the non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree at the proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-
related costs are expensed as incurred.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired, 
and 
the 
liabilities 
assumed 
are 
recognised at their acquisition date fair values. 
For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include 
contingent 
liabilities 
representing 
present 
obligation and they are measured at their 
acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact 
that outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits is not probable.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses 
the financial assets and liabilities assumed for 
appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. This includes the separation of 
embedded derivatives in host contracts by the 
acquiree. If the business combination is achieved 
in stages, any previously held equity interest is 
re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and 
any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss or OCI, as appropriate.
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for non-
controlling interests, and any previous interest 
held, over the net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the 
net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses 
whether it has correctly identified all of the 
assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed 
and reviews the procedures used to measure 
the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition 
date. If the reassessment still results in an excess 
of the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred, then the 
gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in 
equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no 
clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity 
recognises the gain directly in equity as capital 
reserve, without routing the same through OCI.
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is, from 
the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected 
to benefit from the combination, irrespective of 
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree 
are assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has 
been allocated is tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than 
it carrying amount, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any 
impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in 
profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
2.05 Investment in equity instruments of 
subsidiaries:
	
A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the 
Group. The Group controls its subsidiary when 
the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the subsidiary 
and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the subsidiary.
	
The consideration made in determining whether 
significant influence or joint control are similar 
to those necessary to determine control over 
the subsidiaries.
	
Investment in equity instruments of subsidiaries 
are stated at cost as per Ind AS 27 'Separate 
Financial 
Statements'. 
Where 
the 
carrying 
amount of an investment is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount, it is assessed 
for recoverability and in case of permanent 
diminution provision for impairment is recorded 
in Statement of Profit and Loss. On disposal 
of investment, the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is 
charged or credited to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
2.06 Investment Properties
	
Property that is held for long term rental yields 
or for capital appreciation or for both, and that 
is not occupied by the Group, is classified as

investment property. Investment property is 
measured initially at its cost, including related 
transaction cost and where applicable borrowing 
costs. 
Subsequent 
to 
initial 
recognition, 
investment properties are stated at cost less 
accumulated 
depreciation 
and 
accumulated 
impairment loss, if any.
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to assets 
carrying amount only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. When 
significant parts of investment property are 
required to be replaced at intervals, the Group 
depreciates them separately based on their 
respective useful lives. All other repair and 
maintenance cost are expensed when incurred.
	
Though 
the 
Group 
measures 
investment 
property using cost-based measurement, the 
fair value of investment property is disclosed in 
the notes. Fair values are determined based on 
an annual evaluation performed by an external 
independent valuer applying a valuation model 
as per Ind AS 113 " Fair value measurement".
	
Investment properties are derecognised either 
when they have been disposed of or when they 
are permanently withdrawn from use and no 
future economic benefit is expected from their 
disposal. The difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss in 
the period of derecognition.
	
Investment properties are depreciated using 
straight line method over their estimated useful 
life i.e. 30 years.
	
Transfers are made to (or from) investment 
properties only when there is a change in 
use. Transfers between investment property, 
owner‑occupied 
property 
and 
inventories 
do not change the carrying amount of the 
property transferred and they do not change 
the cost of that property for measurement or 
disclosure purposes.
2.07 Intangible Assets
	
Intangible assets including brand acquired 
separately are measured on initial recognition 
at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in 
a business combination is their fair value at the 
date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated 
amortisation 
and 
accumulated 
impairment losses.
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed 
as either finite or indefinite.
	
Computer Software for internal use, which is 
primarily acquired from third party vendors, is 
capitalised. Subsequent costs associated with 
maintaining such software are recognised as 
expense as incurred. Cost of software includes 
license fees and cost of implementation / system 
integration services, where applicable.
	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised 
over the useful economic life (Computer software 
5 years) and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangible asset 
may be impaired. The amortisation period and 
the amortisation method for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at 
the end of each reporting period. Changes 
in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset are considered 
to modify the amortisation period or method, 
as appropriate, and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense 
on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss unless such 
expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset.
	
The Brand under the head ‘Intangible assets’ is 
being amortised based on the useful life of 20 
years as assessed by the management based on 
technical assessment made by technical expert.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are 
not amortized, but are tested for impairment 
annually, either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite 
life is reviewed annually to determine whether 
the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If 
not, the change in useful life from indefinite to 
finite is made on a prospective basis.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss when the asset 
is derecognised.
	
Amortisation method
	
Computer software are amortized on a straight 
line basis over estimated useful life of five years 
from the date of capitalisation.
	
Brand are amortized on a straight line basis over 
estimated useful life of Twenty years from the 
date of capitalisation.
2.08 Impairment of non- financial assets
	
The Group assesses at each reporting date, 
whether there is an indication that an asset may 
236     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 
higher of an assets or cash-generating unit’s 
(CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and 
its value in use. The recoverable amount is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the 
asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets 
or Group’s assets. When the carrying amount of 
an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted 
share prices for publicly traded companies or 
other available fair value indicators.
	
The Group bases its impairment calculation 
on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, 
which are prepared separately for each of the 
Group's CGUs to which the individual assets 
are allocated. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of five 
to eight years. For longer periods, a long-term 
growth rate is calculated and applied to project 
future cash flows after the 8th year. To estimate 
cash flow projections beyond periods covered 
by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the 
Group extrapolates cash flow projections in the 
budget using a steady or declining growth rate 
for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate 
can be justified. In any case, this growth rate 
does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, or country or 
countries in which the Group operates, or for the 
market in which the asset is used.
	
Impairment losses of continuing operations, 
including 
impairment 
on 
inventories, 
are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss, 
except 
for 
properties 
previously 
revalued 
with the revaluation surplus taken to OCI. For 
such properties, the impairment is recognised 
in OCI up to the amount of any previous 
revaluation surplus.
	
An assessment is made at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no 
longer exist or have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Group estimates the assets or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been 
a change in the assumptions used to determine 
the asset’s recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is 
limited so that the carrying amount of the asset 
does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor 
exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss unless the asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the 
reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at 
each reporting date and when circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
Impairment is determined for goodwill by 
assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU 
(or Group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. 
When the recoverable amount of the CGU is 
less than it’s carrying amount, an impairment 
loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to 
goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are 
tested for impairment annually at each reporting 
date at the CGU level, as appropriate, and when 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
2.09 Financial instruments:
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity.
	
(i)	 Financial Assets
	
	
The Group classifies its financial assets in the 
following measurement categories:
•	 Those to be measured subsequently at fair 
value (either through other comprehensive 
income, or through profit or loss)
•	 Those measured at amortized cost
	
	
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and 
the Group's business model for managing 
them."
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing 
component or for which the Group has 
applied the practical expedient, the Group

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
initially measures a financial asset at its fair 
value plus, in the case of a financial asset 
not at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs.
	
	
Trade receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component or for which 
the Group has applied the practical expedient 
and are measured at the transaction price 
determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the 
accounting policies in section 'Revenue from 
contracts with customers'.
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash 
flows that are ‘solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred 
to as the SPPI test and is performed at an 
instrument level. Financial assets with cash 
flows that are not SPPI are classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
	
	
The Group's business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages 
its financial assets in order to generate 
cash flows. The business model determines 
whether cash flows will result from collecting 
contractual cash flows, selling the financial 
assets, or both.
	
	
Financial assets classified and measured at 
amortised cost are held within a business 
model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows while financial assets classified and 
measured at fair value through OCI are held 
within a business model with the objective 
of both holding to collect contractual cash 
flows and selling."
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement 
financial 
assets 
are 
classified 
in 
following categories:
•	 Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
•	 Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with 
recycling of cumulative gains and losses 
(debt instruments)
•	 Financial 
assets 
designated 
at 
fair 
value through OCI with no recycling 
of cumulative gains and losses upon 
derecognition (equity instruments)
•	 Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the 
amortised 
cost 
if 
both 
the 
following 
conditions are met:
	
	
(a)	 Business model test: The objective 
is to hold the financial asset to collect 
the contractual cash flows (rather 
than to sell the instrument prior to its 
contractual maturity to realize its fair 
value changes) and;
	
	
(b)	 Cash flow characteristics test: The 
contractual 
terms 
of 
the 
financial 
asset give rise on specific dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on principal 
amount outstanding.
	
	
	
This category is most relevant to the 
Group. 
After 
initial 
measurement, 
such financial assets are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of EIR. EIR is the rate 
that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash receipts over the expected 
life of the financial instrument or a 
shorter 
period, 
where 
appropriate, 
to the gross carrying amount of the 
financial asset. When calculating the 
effective 
interest 
rate, 
the 
Group 
estimates the expected cash flows by 
considering all the contractual terms of 
the financial instrument but does not 
consider the expected credit losses. The 
EIR amortization is included in other 
income in statement of profit and loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are 
recognized in the profit or loss. This 
category generally applies to trade and 
other receivables.
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
(FVTOCI) (debt instruments)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the 
FVTOCI if both of the following criteria 
are met:
	
	
(a)	 Business model test: The objective of 
financial instrument is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling the financial assets; and
238     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
(b)	 Cash 
flow 
characteristics 
test: 
The contractual terms of the Debt 
instrument give rise on specific dates 
to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on principal 
amount outstanding."
	
	
	
Debt instrument included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at 
fair value. Fair value movements are 
recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI), except for the recognition 
of interest income, impairment gains or 
losses and foreign exchange gains or 
losses which are recognized in statement 
of profit and loss and computed in 
the same manner as for financial 
assets measured at amortised cost. 
The remaining fair value changes are 
recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, 
the 
cumulative 
fair 
value 
changes 
recognised in OCI is reclassified from 
the equity to profit or loss.
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss are carried in the balance sheet 
at fair value with net changes in fair value 
recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. This category includes derivative 
instruments and listed equity investments 
which the Group had not irrevocably elected 
to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends 
on listed equity investments are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss when the 
right of payment has been established.
	
	
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI (equity instruments)
	
	
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect 
to classify irrevocably its equity investments 
as equity instruments designated at fair 
value through OCI when they meet the 
definition of equity under Ind AS 32 Financial 
Instruments: Presentation and are not held 
for trading. The classification is determined 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Equity 
instruments which are held for trading and 
contingent consideration recognised by an 
acquirer in a business combination to which 
Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends 
are recognised as other income in the 
statement of profit and loss when the right of 
payment has been established, except when 
the Group benefits from such proceeds as a 
recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded 
in OCI. Equity instruments designated at 
fair value through OCI are not subject to 
impairment assessment.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part 
of a financial asset or part of a group of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognised 
(i.e. removed from the Group's statement of 
financial position) when:"
•	 The rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset have expired, or
•	 the Group has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset or has 
assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a "pass through" 
arrangement and either;
	
	
(a)	 the Group has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
	
	
(b)	 the Group has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset but has transferred 
control of the asset.
	
	
When the Group has transferred its rights 
to receive cash flows from an asset or has 
entered into a pass-through arrangement, 
it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control of the 
asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s 
continuing involvement. In that case, the 
Group also recognises an associated liability. 
The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects 
the rights and obligations that the Group 
has retained.
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form 
of a guarantee over the transferred asset 
is measured at the lower of the original 
carrying amount of the asset and the 
maximum amount of consideration that the 
Group could be required to repay.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets

model for measurement and recognition of 
impairment loss on the following financial 
asset and credit risk exposure
•	 Financial 
assets 
measured 
at 
amortized cost;
•	 Financial assets measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI);
	
	
ECLs are based on the difference between 
the contractual cash flows due in accordance 
with the contract and all the cash flows that 
the Group expects to receive, discounted at 
an approximation of the original effective 
interest rate. The expected cash flows will 
include cash flows from the sale of collateral 
held or other credit enhancements that are 
integral to the contractual terms.
	
	
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For 
credit exposures for which there has not 
been a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition, ECLs are provided 
for credit losses that result from default 
events that are possible within the next 
12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those 
credit exposures for which there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, a loss allowance is required for 
credit losses expected over the remaining life 
of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of 
the default (a lifetime ECL).
	
	
The Group follows "simplified approach" for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on:
•	 Trade 
receivables 
or 
contract 
revenue receivables.
•	 All lease receivables resulting from the 
transactions within the scope of Ind AS 
116 -Leases”.
	
	
Under the simplified approach, the Group 
does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, it 
recognizes impairment loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right 
from its initial recognition. The Group uses 
a provision matrix to determine impairment 
loss allowance on the portfolio of trade 
receivables. The provision matrix is based on 
its historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of trade receivable and is 
adjusted for forward looking estimates. At 
every reporting date, the historical observed 
default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward-looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized 
as income/ expense in the Consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. This amount is 
reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in 
the statement of Consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. The Consolidated statement of 
assets and liabilities presentation for various 
financial instruments is described below:
	
	
(a)	 Financial 
assets 
measured 
as 
at 
amortised cost: ECL is presented as 
an allowance, i.e., as an integral part 
of the measurement of those assets in 
the statement of assets and liabilities. 
The allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-
off criteria, the Group does not reduce 
impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
(b)	 Loan 
commitments 
and 
financial 
guarantee contracts: ECL is presented 
as a provision in the statement of assets 
and liabilities, i.e., as a liability.
	
	
(c)	 Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: 
For debt instruments measured at 
FVTOCI, the expected credit losses 
do not reduce the carrying amount in 
the statement of assets and liabilities, 
which remains at fair value. Instead, 
an amount equal to the allowance that 
would arise if the asset was measured 
at amortised cost is recognised in 
other comprehensive income as the 
accumulated impairment amount."
	
(ii)	 Financial liabilities:
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified at initial 
recognition as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
and payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. All financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at fair value and, in the 
case of loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction 
costs. The Group financial liabilities include 
loans and borrowings, trade payables, trade 
deposits, retention money, liabilities towards 
services and other payables.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial 
liabilities 
are 
classified 
in 
two categories:
	
	
(i)	 Financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss
240     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
(ii)	 Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(loans and borrowings)"
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss include financial liabilities held for 
trading and financial liabilities designated 
upon initial recognition as at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial liabilities 
are classified as held for trading if they are 
incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in 
the near term. This category also includes 
derivative financial instruments entered into 
by the Group that are not designated as 
hedging instruments in hedge relationship 
as defined by Ind AS 109. The separated 
embedded derivate are also classified as 
held for trading unless they are designated 
as effective hedging instruments.
	
	
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading 
are recognized in the statement of profit 
and loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or 
loss are designated as such at the initial 
date of recognition, and only if the criteria 
in IND AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities 
designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ 
losses attributable to changes in own credit 
risk are recognized in OCI. These gains/ 
losses are not subsequently transferred to 
profit and loss. However, the Group may 
transfer the cumulative gain or loss within 
equity. All other changes in fair value of such 
liability are recognized in the statement of 
profit or loss. The Group has not designated 
any financial liability as at fair value through 
profit and loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(Loans and borrowings)
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings 
are 
subsequently 
measured 
at amortized cost using the Effective 
interest rate method. Gains and losses 
are recognized in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through 
the Effective interest rate amortization 
process. Amortized cost is calculated by 
taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the Effective interest rate. 
The Effective interest rate amortization is 
included as finance costs in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the 
Group are those contracts that require a 
payment to be made to reimburse the holder 
for a loss it incurs because the specified 
debtor fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a debt 
instrument. Financial guarantee contracts 
are recognised initially as a liability at fair 
value, adjusted for transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the issuance of 
the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is 
measured at the higher of the amount of loss 
allowance determined as per impairment 
requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount 
recognised less cumulative amortisation.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financials assets and financial liabilities are 
offset, and the net amount is reported in the 
statement of assets and liabilities if there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognized amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
	
Reclassification of financial assets/ 
financial liabilities
	
	
The Group determines classification of 
financial assets and liabilities on initial 
recognition. After initial recognition, no 
reclassification is made for financial assets 
which are equity instruments and financial 
liabilities. For financial assets which are 
debt instruments, a reclassification is made 
only if there is a change in the business 
model for managing those assets. Changes 
to the business model are expected to be 
infrequent. The Group’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as 
a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Group’s operations. 
Such changes are evident to external parties.

A change in the business model occurs 
when the Group either begins or ceases 
to perform an activity that is significant 
to its operations. If the Group reclassifies 
financial assets, it applies the reclassification 
prospectively from the reclassification date 
which is the first day of the immediately next 
reporting period following the change in 
business model.
2.10 Inventories:
	
Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net 
realisable value.
	
Cost includes the cost of purchase and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories (other 
than finished goods) to their present location and 
condition. Cost of finished goods includes cost of 
direct materials and labour and a proportion of 
manufacturing overheads based on the normal 
operating capacity but excluding borrowing 
costs. Cost is determined on a first in first 
out basis.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business less estimated 
costs necessary to make sale.
2.11 Income Tax:
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period 
is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable 
income based on the applicable income tax rate 
for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
	
Current income tax
	
The current income tax charge is calculated on 
the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period. 
Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulation is subject 
to interpretation and considers whether it is 
probable that a taxation authority will accept an 
uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures 
its tax balances either based on the most likely 
amount or the expected value, depending on 
which method provides a better prediction of 
the resolution of the uncertainty. Current income 
tax relating to items recognised outside profit or 
loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either 
in other comprehensive income or in equity). 
Current tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
Deferred tax
	
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the 
liability method, on temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. However, deferred tax 
liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income 
tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). Deferred 
income tax is determined using tax rates (and 
laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the end of the reporting period and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred 
income tax asset is realised, or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all 
deductible temporary differences and unused 
tax losses only if it is probable that future 
taxable amounts will be available to utilise those 
temporary differences and losses.
	
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amount and tax bases of investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and 
interest in joint arrangements where the Group 
is able to control the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences and it is probable 
that the differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
	
Deferred tax assets are not recognised for 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amount and tax bases of investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and 
interest in joint arrangements where it is not 
probable that the differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will not be 
available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
where there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets and liabilities and where the 
deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation 
authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are 
offset where the entity has a legally enforceable 
right to offset and intends either to settle on a 
net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
	
Current and deferred tax is recognised in 
statement of profit and loss, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in 
242     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, respectively.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside 
profit or loss is recognised outside profit or 
loss (either in other comprehensive income or 
in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in 
OCI or directly in equity.
2.12 Revenue from contract with customers:
	
Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects 
the consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring the 
promised goods or services to a customer i.e., 
on transfer of control of the goods or service 
to the customer. Revenue from sales of goods 
or rendering of services is net of Indirect 
taxes, returns and variable consideration on 
account of discounts and schemes offered by 
the Group as part of the contract. The Group 
applies the revenue recognition criteria to each 
separately identifiable component of the revenue 
transaction as set out below:
	
(i)	 Revenue from sale of services (Rooms, Food 
and Beverage & Banquets):
•	 Revenue is recognised at the transaction 
price that is allocated to the performance 
obligation. 
Revenue 
includes 
room 
revenue, food and beverage sale and 
banquet services which is recognised 
once the rooms are occupied, food and 
beverages are sold, and banquet services 
have been provided as per the contract 
with the customer.
•	 Revenue is recognised net of discounts 
and sales related taxes in the period in 
which the services are rendered. The 
Group collects Goods and Service Tax 
(GST) and value added tax (VAT) on 
behalf of the government, and therefore, 
these are not economic benefits flowing 
to the Group.
	
(ii)	 Other Operating Revenue:
•	 Exports 
entitlements 
[arising 
out 
of 
Served from India Scheme (SFIS)] are 
recognised when the right to receive 
credit as per the terms of the schemes 
is established in respect of the exports 
made by the Group and when there is 
no 
significant 
uncertainty 
regarding 
the ultimate collection of the relevant 
export proceeds.
•	 Loyalty Programme: The Group operates 
a loyalty point’s programme, which allows 
customers to accumulate points when 
they obtain services in the Group’s Hotels. 
This programme provides a material 
right to customers, in the form of award 
points, on eligible spends. The promise 
to provide the discount through award 
points to the customer is therefore a 
separate performance obligation. The 
points so earned by such customers are 
accumulated and have a fixed redemption 
price. The revenues related to award points 
pertaining to the Group is deferred and 
a contract liability is created at the time 
of initial sales basis the points awarded 
to the customer and the likelihood of 
redemption, as evidenced by the Group’s 
historical experience. On redemption or 
expiry of such award points, revenue is 
recognised at pre-determined rates.
•	 Space and Shop Rentals: Rentals basically 
consists of rental revenue earned from 
letting of spaces for retails and office at 
the properties. Revenue is recognised 
in the period in which services are 
being rendered.
•	 Other Allied Services: In relation to laundry 
income, communication income, health 
club income, airport transfers income 
and other allied services, the revenue has 
been recognised by reference to the time 
of service rendered.
•	 Management 
and 
Operating 
Fees: 
Management fees earned from hotels 
managed by the Group are usually under 
long-term contracts with the hotel owner. 
Under 
Management 
and 
Operating 
Agreements, the Group’s performance 
obligation is to provide hotel management 
services and a license to use the Group’s 
trademark and other intellectual property. 
Management and incentive fee are earned 
as a percentage of revenue and profit

ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25     243
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
and are recognised when earned in 
accordance with the terms of the contract 
based on the underlying revenue, when 
collectability is certain and when the 
performance criteria are met. Both are 
treated as variable consideration.
•	 Membership 
Fees: 
Membership 
fee 
income majorly consists of membership 
fees received from the loyalty programme 
and Chamber membership fees. In respect 
of performance obligations satisfied over 
a period of time, revenue is recognised at 
the allocated transaction price on a time-
proportion basis.
	
(iii)	 Interest Income:
	
	
Interest income is recorded on accrual basis 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. 
For all debt instruments measured either at 
amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, interest income is 
recorded using the effective interest rate 
(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments or 
receipts over the expected life of the financial 
instrument or a shorter period, where 
appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of 
the financial asset or to the amortised cost 
of a financial liability. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Group estimates 
the expected cash flows by considering 
all the contractual terms of the financial 
instrument 
(for 
example, 
prepayment, 
extension, call and similar options) but does 
not consider the expected credit losses.
	
(iv)	 Rental Income:
	
	
Rental income is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease over 
the lease terms and is included in revenue 
in the statement of profit or loss due to its 
operating nature.
	
(v)	 Dividend Income:
	
	
Dividend income is recognised at the time 
when the right to receive is established which 
is generally when shareholders approve 
the dividend.
	
(vi)	 Contract balances
	
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration 
in exchange for goods or services transferred 
to the customer. If the Group performs by 
transferring goods or services to a customer 
before the customer pays consideration or 
before payment is due, a contract asset is 
recognised for the earned consideration that 
is conditional.
	
	
A contract liability is the obligation to 
transfer goods or services to a customer for 
which the Group has received consideration 
(or an amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer pays 
consideration before the Group transfers 
goods or services to the customer, a contract 
liability is recognised when the payment is 
made, or the payment is due (whichever is 
earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised 
as revenue when the Group performs under 
the contract.
	
	
A trade receivable is recognised if an amount 
of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., 
only the passage of time is required before 
payment of the consideration is due). Refer 
to accounting policies of financial assets 
in section (Financial instruments – initial 
recognition and subsequent measurement).
2.13 Retirement and other employee benefits:
	
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme. The Group 
has no obligation, other than the contribution 
payable to the provident fund. The Group 
recognizes contribution payable to the provident 
fund scheme as an expense, when an employee 
renders the related service. If the contribution 
payable to the scheme for service received before 
the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme 
is recognized as a liability after deducting the 
contribution already paid. If the contribution 
already paid exceeds the contribution due for 
services received before the balance sheet date, 
then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent 
that the pre-payment will lead to, a reduction in 
future payment or a cash refund.
	
The Group operates a defined benefit gratuity 
plan in India, which requires contributions to be 
made to a separately administered fund.
	
The cost of providing benefits under the defined 
benefit plan is determined using the projected 
unit credit method.
	
Remeasurements, 
comprising 
of 
actuarial 
gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, 
excluding amounts included in net interest on 
the net defined benefit liability and the return 
on plan assets (excluding amounts included in 
net interest on the net defined benefit liability), 
are recognised immediately in the balance sheet 
with a corresponding debit or credit to retained 
earnings through OCI in the period in which they 
244     APEEJAY SURRENDRA PARK HOTELS LIMITED
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss 
on the earlier of:
•	 The 
date 
of 
the 
plan 
amendment 
or 
curtailment, and
•	 The date that the Group recognises related 
restructuring costs
	
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount 
rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
The Group recognises the following changes in 
the net defined benefit obligation as an expense 
in the statement of profit and loss:
•	 Service costs comprising current service 
costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on 
curtailments and non-routine settlements; and
•	 Net interest expense or income
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be 
utilized within the next 12 months, is treated 
as short-term employee benefit. The Group 
measures the expected cost of such absences 
as the additional amount that it expects to pay 
as a result of the unused entitlement that has 
accumulated at the reporting date. The Group 
recognizes expected cost of short-term employee 
benefit as an expense, when an employee renders 
the related service.
2.14 Leases:
	
The Group assesses at contract inception 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That 
is, if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.
	
Group as a lessee
	
The Group's lease asset classes primarily comprise 
of lease for land and building. The Group applies 
a single recognition and measurement approach 
for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises 
lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-
of-use assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
	
(i)	 Right-of-use assets
	
	
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., 
the date the underlying asset is available 
for use). Right-of-use assets are measured 
at cost, less any accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, and 
adjusted for any remeasurement of lease 
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets 
includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received. Right-of-use assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
unexpired period of respective leases.
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to 
the Group at the end of the lease term or 
the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase 
option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The right-
of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section 
'Impairment of non-financial assets.
	
(ii)	 Lease Liabilities
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, 
the 
Group 
recognises 
lease 
liabilities 
measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease term. 
The lease payments include fixed payments 
(including in substance fixed payments) less 
any lease incentives receivable, variable 
lease payments that depend on an index 
or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid 
under residual value guarantees. The lease 
payments also include the exercise price 
of a purchase option reasonably certain to 
be exercised by the Group and payments 
of penalties for terminating the lease, if the 
lease term reflects the Group exercising the 
option to terminate. Variable lease payments 
that do not depend on an index or a rate 
are recognised as expenses (unless they 
are incurred to produce inventories) in the 
period in which the event or condition that 
triggers the payment occurs."
	
	
In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion 
of interest and reduced for the lease 
payments made. In addition, the carrying 
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if 
there is a modification, a change in the lease 
term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., 
changes to future payments resulting from a 
change in an index or rate used to determine 
such lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the 
underlying asset.

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
(iii)	Short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets
	
	
The Group applies the short-term lease 
recognition exemption to its short-term 
leases (i.e., those leases that have a 
lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a 
purchase option). It also applies the lease of 
low-value assets recognition exemption to 
leases that are considered to be low value. 
Lease payments on short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets are recognised 
as expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
	
	
Group as a lessor
	
	
Leases for which the Group is a lessor is 
classified as finance or operating lease. 
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of an asset are 
classified as operating leases. Rental income 
arising is accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating and arranging an 
operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis 
as rental income. Contingent rents are 
recognised as revenue in the period in which 
they are earned.
2.15 Earnings Per Share:
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit or loss for the period attributable to 
equity holders by the weighted average number 
of equity shares outstanding during the period. 
The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period is adjusted for 
events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a 
rights issue, share split, and reverse share split 
(consolidation of shares) that have changed the 
number of equity shares outstanding, without a 
corresponding change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings 
per share, the net profit or loss for the period 
attributable to equity holders and the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding during 
the period are adjusted for the effect of all 
potentially dilutive equity shares.
2.16 Borrowing Costs:
	
Borrowing cost includes interest and other 
costs incurred in connection with the borrowing 
of funds and charged to Statement of Profit 
& Loss on the basis of effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Borrowing cost also includes 
exchange differences to the extent regarded as 
an adjustment to the borrowing cost.
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of an 
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period 
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are 
capitalized as part of the cost of the respective 
asset. All other borrowing costs are recognized 
as expense in the period in which they occur.
2.17 Share Based Payments:
	
Certain employees (including senior management 
personnel) of the Group receive part of their 
remuneration in the form of share based 
payment 
transactions, 
whereby 
employees 
render services in exchange for shares or rights 
over share (equity-settled transactions). The cost 
of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
determined measured at fair value at the date 
at which they are granted using an appropriate 
valuation model. That cost is recognised, 
together with a corresponding increase in 
share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the service conditions 
are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The 
cumulative expense recognised for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until 
the vesting date reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The statement of profit 
and loss expense or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period and 
is recognised in employee benefits expense. 
Service and non-market performance conditions 
are not taken into account when determining the 
grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood 
of the conditions being met is assessed as part 
of the Group’s best estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised 
is the expense had the terms had not been 
modified, if the original terms of the award are 
met. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value 
of the share-based payment transaction or is 
otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured 
at the date of modification. Where an award is 
cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, 
any remaining element of the fair value of the 
award is expensed immediately through profit 
or loss.

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
2.18 Cash and cash equivalents:
	
Cash and Cash and cash equivalent in the 
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities 
comprises of cash at banks and on hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less, that are readily convertible 
to a known amount of cash and subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
For the purpose of the Consolidated statement of 
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they 
are considered an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management.
2.19 Foreign currency translation:
	
(i)	 Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items included in the Financial Statements are 
measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity 
operates ('the functional currency'). The 
Group’s Consolidated financial statements 
are presented in INR, which is the functional 
currency for the Group.
	
(ii)	 Transactions and balances
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated 
into the functional currency using the 
exchange rate prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transaction and from the translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at year end exchange 
rate 
are 
generally 
recognised 
in 
the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates at 
the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in 
a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair 
value is determined.
	
(iii)	Exchange differences
	
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement 
or 
translation 
of 
monetary 
items 
are 
recognized as income or expense in the 
period in which they arise with the exception 
of exchange differences on gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items 
measured at fair value which is treated in 
line with the recognition of the gain or loss 
on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair 
value gain or loss is recognized in OCI or 
profit or loss are also recognized in OCI or 
profit or loss, respectively)."
2.20 Fair value Measurement:
	
The Group measures its financial instruments 
such as derivative instruments, etc at fair value 
at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date. The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
•	 In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
•	 In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest. A fair value measurement 
of a non-financial asset takes into account a 
market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best 
use or by selling it to another market participant 
that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
•	 Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•	 Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable.
•	 Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement is unobservable.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
External valuers are involved for valuation of 
significant assets, such as investment properties 
and unquoted financial assets. Valuers are 
selected based on market knowledge, reputation, 
independence 
and 
whether 
professional 
standards are maintained. For other assets 
management carries out the valuation based on 
its experience, market knowledge and in line with 
the applicable accounting requirements.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Group has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair 
value. Other fair value related disclosures are 
given in the relevant notes:
•	 Quantitative 
disclosures 
of 
fair 
value 
measurement hierarchy (refer note 47)
•	 Investment in unquoted equity share (refer 
note 6)
•	 Financial instruments (including those carried 
at amortised cost) (refer note 47)
•	 Disclosures for valuation methods, significant 
estimates and assumptions (refer note 47)
•	 Investment properties (refer note 5)
2.21 Provisions and Contingent Liabilities:
	
Provisions:
	
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) because 
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. When the Group expects 
some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the 
reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, 
but only when the reimbursement is virtually 
certain. The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the statement of profit and loss net 
of any reimbursement.
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax 
rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognised as a finance cost.
	
Contingent liability is disclosed for:
•	 Possible obligations which will be confirmed 
only by future events not wholly within the 
control of the Group or
•	 Present obligations arising from past events 
where it is not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount 
of the obligation cannot be made.
2.22 Significant estimates and judgement:
	
The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that 
affect 
the 
application 
of 
accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of these financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses for the years 
presented. These judgements and estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the 
relevant facts and circumstances, having regard 
to previous experience, but actual results may 
differ materially from the amounts included in 
the financial statements.
	
Estimates 
and 
underlying 
assumptions 
are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised, and future 
periods affected.
	
The information about significant areas of 
estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in 
applying accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements are as given below:
	
(i)	 Significant estimates
	
	
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
	
	
The Group has carry forward tax losses, 
unabsorbed depreciation and MAT credit 
that are available for offset against future 
taxable profit. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the unused tax losses or tax 
credits can be utilised. This involves an 
assessment of when those assets are likely 
to reverse, and a judgement as to whether 
there will be sufficient taxable profits 
available to offset the assets. This requires 
assumptions regarding future profitability, 
which is inherently uncertain. To the extent 
assumptions regarding future profitability 
change, there can be an increase or decrease 
in the amounts recognised in respect of 
deferred tax assets and consequential 
impact in the statement of profit and loss.

(All amounts in Rupees Crores, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
asset 
is 
recognized 
on 
unabsorbed 
depreciation 
and 
business 
losses to the extent it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences and 
unabsorbed depreciation can be utilised.
	
(ii)	 Significant judgements
	
	
a)	
Determining the Lease Term
	
	
	
Ind AS 116 'Leases' requires lessees 
to determine the lease term as the 
non-cancellable 
period 
of 
a 
lease 
adjusted with any option to extend or 
terminate the lease, if the use of such 
option is reasonably certain. The Group 
makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on a lease-by-lease basis 
and thereby assesses whether it is 
reasonably certain that any options to 
extend or terminate the contract will be 
exercised. In evaluating the lease term, 
the Group considers factors such as 
any significant leasehold improvements 
undertaken over the lease term, costs 
relating to the termination of the lease 
and the importance of the underlying 
asset to Group’s operations taking into 
account the location of the underlying 
asset and the availability of suitable 
alternatives. The lease term in future 
periods is reassessed to ensure that the 
lease term reflects the current economic 
circumstances. 
Critical 
Judgements 
in Determining the Discount Rate: 
The discount rate is generally based 
on the incremental borrowing rate 
specific to the lease being evaluated 
or for a portfolio of leases with 
similar characteristics.
	
	
b)	
Employee Benefits (Estimation of 
defined benefit obligation)
	
	
	
Post-employment 
benefits 
represent 
obligation that will be settled in the 
future and require assumptions to 
project 
benefit 
obligations. 
Post-
employment 
benefit 
accounting 
is 
intended to reflect the recognition of 
future benefit cost over the employee’s 
approximate service period, based on 
the terms of plans and the investment 
and 
funding 
decisions 
made. 
The 
accounting requires the Group to make 
assumptions regarding variables such 
as discount rate, rate of compensation 
increase and future mortality rates. 
Changes in these key assumptions 
can have a significant impact on the 
defined benefit obligations, funding 
requirements and benefit costs incurred.
	
	
c)	
Impairment of trade receivables
	
	
	
The risk of collectability of accounts 
receivable is primarily estimated based 
on prior experience with, and the past 
due status of doubtful debtors, while 
large accounts are assessed individually 
based on factors that include ability to 
pay, bankruptcy and payment history. 
The assumptions and estimates applied 
for determining the valuation allowance 
are reviewed periodically.
	
	
d)	 Estimation of expected useful lives 
and residual values of property, plants 
and equipment
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are 
depreciated at historical cost using 
straight-line method based on the 
estimated useful life, considered at 
residual value. The asset’s residual value 
and useful life are based on the Group’s 
best 
estimates 
and 
reviewed, 
and 
adjusted if required, at each Balance 
Sheet date.
	
	
e)	
Contingent Liabilities
	
	
	
Legal proceedings covering a range of 
matters are pending against the Group. 
Due to the uncertainty inherent in such 
matters, it is often difficult to predict the 
final outcomes. The cases and claims 
against the Group often raise difficult 
and complex factual and legal issues 
that are subject to many uncertainties 
and complexities, including but not 
limited to the facts and circumstances 
of each particular case and claim, 
the jurisdiction and the differences in 
applicable law, in the normal course of 
business, the Group consults with legal 
counsel and certain other experts on 
matters related to litigations. The Group 
accrues a liability when it is determined 
that an adverse outcome is probable, 
and the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated. In the event an 
adverse outcome is possible, or an 
estimate is not determinable, the matter 
is disclosed.

f)	
Fair value measurements
	
	
	
When the fair values of financial assets 
and financial liabilities recorded in the 
Balance Sheet cannot be measured 
based on quoted prices in active 
markets, their fair values are measured 
using valuation techniques which involve 
various judgements and assumptions.
	
	
g)	 Impairment testing
	
	
	
Impairment Testing: Property, plant 
and equipment, Right-of-Use assets 
and intangible assets that are subject 
to 
depreciation/ 
amortisation 
are 
tested 
for 
impairment 
periodically 
including 
when 
events 
occur 
or 
changes 
in 
circumstances 
indicate 
that the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than its 
carrying value. The recoverable amount 
of cash generating units is higher of 
value-in-use and fair value less cost 
to sell. The calculation involves use of 
significant estimates and assumptions 
which includes turnover and earnings 
multiples, growth rates and net margins 
used to calculate projected future cash 
flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future 
economic and market conditions.
2.23 New and amended standards:
	
(i)	 Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts
	
	
The Ministry of corporate Affairs (MCA) 
notified the Ind AS 117, Insurance Contracts, 
vide notification dated 12 August 2024, 
under the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2024, which 
is effective from annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
	
	
Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts is a 
comprehensive new accounting standard 
for insurance contracts covering recognition 
and 
measurement, 
presentation 
and 
disclosure. Ind AS 117 replaces Ind AS 104 
Insurance Contracts. Ind AS 117 applies to 
all types of insurance contracts, regardless 
of the type of entities that issue them as 
well as to certain guarantees and financial 
instruments with discretionary participation 
features; a few scope exceptions will apply. 
Ind AS 117 is based on a general model, 
supplemented by:
•	 A specific adaptation for contracts with 
direct participation features (the variable 
fee approach)
•	 A simplified approach (the premium 
allocation approach) mainly for short-
duration contracts
	
	
The application of Ind AS 117 had no 
impact on the Group Consolidated financial 
statements as the Group has not entered 
any contracts in the nature of insurance 
contracts covered under Ind AS 117.
	
(ii)	 Amendment to Ind AS 116 Leases – 
Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback
	
	
The MCA notified the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Second Amendment 
Rules, 2024, which amend Ind AS 116, 
Leases, with respect to Lease Liability in a 
Sale and Leaseback.
	
	
The amendment specifies the requirements 
that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the 
lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback 
transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does 
not recognise any amount of the gain or loss 
that relates to the right of use it retains.
	
	
The amendment is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 
2024 and must be applied retrospectively 
to sale and leaseback transactions entered 
into after the date of initial application of Ind 
AS 116. 
	
	
The amendment does not have a material 
impact on the Group financial statements.

5.1	 Investment properties primarily consists of 
leasehold land taken for a continuous period of 
99 years. In prior years, the Group had acquired 
certain parcel of lands aggregating to INR 146.78 
crores for expanding its hotel business.
	
In previous years, the Group acquired certain 
parcel of lands of 3.36 acres at EM Bypass, 
Kolkata. This land parcel was classified as 
Investment Properties pending a final decision on 
the extent to which each such land parcel may be 
used for purposes other than the Group's hotel 
business. During the year ended March 31, 2024, 
the Group had executed a Joint Development 
Agreement ('JDA'), for development of serviced 
apartments (49% of land area) and hotel (51% of 
land area) at EM Bypass with Ambuja Housing 
and Urban Infrastructure Company Limited 
(“Developer”). Till March 31, 2024, this was still 
classified as investment properties pending 
active development in accordance with Ind AS 
40 “Investment properties”. Management had 
recognised deferred tax asset (‘DTA’) of INR 19.33 
crores arising from difference between book 
values of the portions of land parcels that relate 
to serviced apartment and their corresponding 
indexed costs for tax purposes.
	
During the year ended, the Group initiated 
architectural 
designs 
and 
other 
approvals 
required to be taken for the purpose of 
construction of serviced apartments/ hotel, 
which indicates that active development began 
on the EM Bypass property as per Ind AS 40. 
Accordingly, the proportionate land parcel and 
ancillary cost of INR 92.10 crores relating to hotel 
was transferred from investment properties to 
Right-of-use assets - Land and INR 88.50 crores 
relating to serviced apartments to Inventories. 
Further, construction cost of INR 5.85 crores 
relating to serviced apartments was transferred 
from Capital work-in-progress to Inventories. 
Consequent to such transfer, deferred tax 
charge of INR 19.33 crores was recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss during the year 
ended March 31, 2025.
	
Fair value of the properties for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 was determined by using the 
market comparable method. This means that 
valuations performed by the valuer are based on 
active market prices, significantly adjusted for 
difference in the nature, location or condition of 
the specific property. As at the date of valuation, 
the properties’ fair values are based on valuations 
performed by Mr. Pradyumna Kumar Dev an 
accredited independent valuer who has relevant 
valuation experience for similar office properties 
in India for the last 7 years and is a registered 
valuer as defined under rule 2 of Companies 
(Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017.
	
Further, the Group had performed sensitivity 
analysis on the assumptions used by the valuer 
and ensured that the valuation of investment 
properties is appropriate."

Note:
For impairment testing, goodwill of INR 22.81 crores as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 respectively, 
acquired through business combinations for Flurys brand (cash generating unit referred as “CGU”), having 
indefinite life is allocated to the hospitality segment which is also an operating and reportable segment of 
the Group.
The Group has performed its annual impairment test for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 in 
accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. The Group considers the cash flows from 
the said CGU in comparison to the cash projections at the time of acquisition, amongst other factors, when 
reviewing for indicators of impairment. For the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, there were no 
impairment triggers identified since the Group was able to meet the cash flow projections.
The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is calculated using cash flow projections basis 10.00% growth rate 
(March 31, 2024: 10.00%) till March 31, 2035, 4.50% terminal growth rate (March 31, 2024: 4.50%) for periods 
subsequent to the forecast period of 10 years, pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of 16.00% 
(March 31, 2024: 13.00%) and capitalisation rate of 9.00% (March 31, 2024: 9.00%). An analysis of the sensitivity 
of the value-in-use to a change in key parameters (such as operating margin, WACC and average growth rate) 
based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of 
the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.

Performance obligation
	
As per the terms of the contract with its customers, the customer loyalty points can be redeemed up to two years from 
generation of points. All other performance obligations are to be completed within one year from the date of contracts with 
customer. Accordingly, the Company has availed the practical expedient available under paragraph 121 of Ind AS 115 and 
dispensed with the additional disclosures with respect to performance obligations that remained unsatisfied (or partially 
unsatisfied) at the balance sheet date. Further, since the terms of the contracts directly identify the transaction price for each 
of the completed performance obligations there are no elements of transaction price which have not been included in the 
revenue recognised in the financial statements. Further, there is no material difference between the contract price and the 
revenue from contract with customers.

Note: (a) The Group has entered into an MOU with the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India and 
Archaeological Survey of India on September 16, 2018 for adopting Jantar Mantar, New Delhi under 
"Adopt a Heritage" scheme. During the year, the Group was not able to spend two per cent of the 
average net profit as per section 135(5) in the current financial year. Unspent CSR amount pertaining 
to the commitments made by the Group towards preserving natural heritage, art and culture has been 
transferred to a separate Unspent CSR account of the Group. The amount transferred to the aforesaid 
Unspent CSR account will be spent for the said purpose within the permissible time limit. Accordingly, 
the Group has duly complied with section 135 of the Act read with rules thereunder and the CSR policy of 
the Group.
32.	Earning per share (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders (after adjusting 
for interest on the convertible preference shares, if any) by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on 
conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

(i)	 The asset of INR 30.01 crores (March 31, 2024: INR 41.93 crores) recognized by the group as MAT credit 
entitlement represents the portion of MAT Assets, which can be recovered and set off in subsequent 
years based on provisions of Section 115JAA of the Income tax Act, 1961.The management based on the 
present trend of profitability and also the future profitability projections, is of the view that there would 
be sufficient taxable income in foreseeable future, which will enable the group to utilize MAT credit assets.
(ii)	 Deferred tax asset is recognized on unabsorbed depreciation and carried forward business losses to the 
extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and unabsorbed depreciation can be utilised. The group has tax losses of INR Nil (March 
31, 2024: INR 20.85 crores) in the form of unabsorbed depreciation that are available for offsetting for 
unlimited period against future taxable profits and carried forward business losses. That are available for 
offsetting for period a period of 8 years from the year of generation against future taxable profits.

(ii)	 Fair Value
	
1)	
The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, 
investment in mutual fund and other investments, other current financial assets and other current 
financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of 
these instruments
	
2)	
The fair value of the other financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at 
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, 
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:
	
3)	
The fair values of the group’s interest-bearing borrowings are determined by using effective interest 
rate (EIR) method using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the 
reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 was 
assessed to be insignificant.
	
4)	
Long-term receivables/payables are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest 
rates, risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the counterparty and the risk characteristics of the 
financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected credit 
losses of these receivables.
(iii)	Set out is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Group's 
financial instruments:

The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 
in the financial statements are a reasonable approximation of their fair values since the 
 Group does not anticipate that the carrying amount would be significantly different from the values that 
would eventually be received or settled.
b.	
Fair value hierarchy
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
	
The Group categorises assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of the three levels depending 
on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement which are described as follows:
	
Level 1: Inputs are quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2: Inputs are observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within 
level 1 for the asset and liability.
	
Level 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to 
observable related market data or Group's assumptions about pricing by market participants.

Valuation inputs and relationship to fair value and valuation process:
	
(i)	 As per the Group policies, whenever any investment is made by the Group in equity securities, the 
same is made either with some strategic objective or as a part of contractual arrangement.
	
	
Valuation technique used to determine fair value include
	
	
Investment in unquoted equity shares in Green Infra Wind Farms Limited and Green Infra Wind 
Generation Limited amounting to INR 0.02 (March 31, 2024: 0.02) are made pursuant to the contract 
for procuring electricity supply at the hotels units. Investment in said companies is not usually traded 
in market. Considering the terms of the electricity supply contract and best information available in 
the market, cost of investment is considered as fair value of the investments.
	
(ii)	 Valuation technique for fair value of fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings has been determined by 
the Group based on parameters such as interest rates, country risk factors, and the risk characteristics 
of the financed project.
	
(iii)	 Investment in mutual funds traded in active markets are determined by reference to quotes from the 
financial institutions; for example: Net asset value (NAV) for investments in mutual funds declared by 
mutual fund house
	
(iv)	 In the absence of observable inputs to measure fair value the assets and liabilities have been classified 
as level 3. The Group has not given further disclosures since the amount involved is not material.
	
	
The management considers that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities 
having short term maturities recognised in the standalone financial statements approximates their 
face values.

35.	Financial risk management objectives and policies
	
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings, trade and other payables and other 
financial liabilities. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the operations 
of the Group. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, loans, investments 
and cash & cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.
	
The Group’s business activities are exposed to a variety of risks including liquidity risk, credit risk and market 
risk. The Group seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks by managing them through a 
structured process of identification, assessment and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated efforts 
to monitor, minimize and mitigate the impact of such risks on its financial performance and capital. For 
this purpose, the Group has laid comprehensive risk assessment and minimization/mitigation procedures 
and are reviewed by the management from time to time. These procedures are reviewed to ensure that 
executive management controls risks by way of properly defined framework. The Group does not enter 
into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A 	 Credit risk
	
Credit risk refers to risk of financial loss to the Group if customers or counterparties fail to meet their 
contractual obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (mainly trade 
receivables) and from its investing activities (primarily deposit with banks).

(a)	 Trade receivables
	
Trade receivables consist of large number of customers, spread across geographical areas. In order to 
mitigate the risk of financial loss from defaulters, the Group has an ongoing credit evaluation process in 
respect of customers who are allowed credit period. In respect of walk-in customers the Group does not 
allow any credit period and therefore, is not exposed to any credit risk.
	
In general, it is presumed that credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition if the payments 
are more than 90 days past due. The Group has a policy to provide for specific receivables which are 
overdue for a period over 180 days. On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Group also uses expected 
credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or reversal thereof.

(c)	 Credit risk related to investments
	
The Group has made investments in liquid mutual funds to meet their short term liquidity objectives. 
The Group analyses the credit worthiness of the party before investing their funds. The Group limits its 
exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a 
good credit rating. The Group does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties, 
and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specific industry sectors or specific 
country risks.
B	
Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk implies that the Group may not be able to meet its obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities. The Group manages its liquidity risk on the basis of the business plan that ensures that the 
funds required for financing the business operations and meeting financial liabilities are available in a 
timely manner and in the currency required at optimal costs. The Management regularly monitors rolling 
forecasts of the Group’s liquidity position to ensure it has sufficient cash on an ongoing basis to meet 
operational fund requirements.
	
Additionally, the Group has committed fund and non-fund based credit lines from banks which may be 
drawn anytime based on Group’s fund requirements. The Group maintains a cautious liquidity strategy 
with positive cash balance and undrawn bank lines throughout the year.

C 	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flow of financial instruments may fluctuate because 
of changes in market conditions. Market risk broadly comprises three types of risks namely currency risk, 
interest rate risk and price risk (for equity instruments). The above risks may affect the Group’s income 
and expenses and / or value of its investments. The Group’s exposure to and management of these risks 
are explained below:
	
Interest rate risk
	
The Group’s exposure to risk of change in market interest rates relates primarily to its debt interest 
obligations. It’s borrowings are at floating rates and its future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates.

36.	Capital management
For the purposes of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, all other equity reserves and long term 
borrowed capital less reported cash and cash equivalents.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain an efficient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital, 
support the corporate strategy and to maximise shareholder’s value.
The Group’s policy is to borrow primarily through banks to maintain sufficient liquidity. These borrowings, together with cash 
generated from operations are utilised for operations of the Group including periodic capital projects undertaken for the Group's 
existing projects. The Group monitors capital on the basis of cost of capital. The Group manages its capital structure and makes 
adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided 
by total capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and cash 
equivalents.
The following table summaries the capital of the Company:

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. 
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the 
sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the 
defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been 
applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior 
period.
Risk associates with plan provisions
Valuations are performed on certain basic set of pre-determined assumptions and other regulatory framework which may 
vary overtime. Thus, the Group is exposed to various risks in providing the above gratuity benefit, the most significant 
of which are as follows:
Interest Rate risk: The plan exposes the Group to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an 
increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability 
(as shown in financial statements).
Liquidity Risk: This is the risk that the Group is not able to meet the short term gratuity pay-outs. This may arise due to 
non availability of sufficient cash/cash equivalents to meet the liabilities.
Salary Escalation Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase 
rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of 
increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.
Demographic Risk: The Group has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Group 
is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
Regulatory Risk: Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity Act , 1972 (as 
amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations requiring higher gratuity payouts e.g. Increase in the 
maximum limit on gratuity of INR 20,00,000 and upward revision of maximum gratuity limit will result in gratuity plan 
obligation.
Asset Liability Mismatching or Market Risk: The duration of the liability is longer compared to duration of assets, exposing 
the Group to market risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.
Investment Risk: The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular 
investment.

(a)	 During earlier years, the Group had received 
a Property Tax demand from New Delhi 
Municipal Council (NDMC) for INR 67.65 
crores for period upto March 31, 2024 with a 
view that the assessable value for calculation 
of property tax considered by Group is lower 
than the actual ought to be value. Against 
the amount demanded, the Group had 
deposited INR 2.02 crores in the form of 
regular tax payment and remaining INR 8.56 
crores was deposited ‘under protest’ up to 
March 31, 2025 (INR 7.36: March 31, 2024).
	
	
On January 22, 2019, the property tax 
matter for similar case contested by another 
Company was decided in favour of that 
Company by Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India (‘SC’). Thereafter, on September 11, 
2019, the Group filed representation before 
NDMC claiming a sum of INR 5.34 Crores 
(amount paid under protest till the date of 
SC order). Till date, NDMC has not provided 
any specific response for refund of such 
excess amount paid by the Group. Instead, 
NDMC issued notice u/s 72 and proposed to 
increase rateable value w.e.f April 01, 2018.
	
	
The Group is of the view that NDMC has not 
adhered to the orders of Supreme Court and 
the demand raised for earlier years up to 2024 
is not tenable. For period from April 01, 2018 
to March 31, 2025, the Group, basis the legal 
opinion, is of the view that the assessable 
value considered for calculation of property 
tax is high and accordingly revised rate is not 
acceptable keeping in view other properties 
in the vicinity and in same industry. Based 
on above, management believes that there 
is no impact required to be recorded in the 
Group’s financial statements.
	
	
The Delhi High Court, vide its order dated 
September 20, 2022, has ordered a stay on 
the aforesaid writ petitions since the same 
are linked to certain other writ petitions, 
and will be disposed off along with the said 
petitions. The matter is listed in Delhi High 
Court on August 19, 2025.
	
(b)	 During the earlier years Group had received 
order u/s 143(3) of income tax act for the A.Y. 
2013-14 with respect to various matters such 
as disallowances of interest capitalization, 
Bad debts written off and disallowances 
Amortization of leasehold land.
	
	
During the previous year, the Group has 
received a demand order u/s 147 for the 
A.Y. 2022-23 dated March 22, 2024 and for 
the A.Y. 2018-19 dated March 24, 2024 of 
income tax act from Income Tax Department 
with respect to various matters such as 
tax on income on buy back of shares and 
disallowances 
of 
interest 
capitalization, 
addition u/s 37 and other disallowances 
of expenses.

Based on evaluations of the matters and 
legal advice obtained, management believes 
that the chances of liability devolving on 
the company are less likely and there will 
be no adverse impact on the Group in this 
regard. Accordingly, no provision has been 
considered in these financial statements.
	
(c)	 The Group had received a demand March 
11, 2022 amounting to INR 9.81 Crores from 
Land & Development Office (LDO), Ministry 
of Urban Development, Government of India, 
to regularise the alleged breaches relating 
to the property of New Delhi. This was the 
first time that the Group had received such 
demand letter despite regular/ periodic 
inspection of the said property carried out 
by appropriate authority. Based on the 
communication received from LDO, the 
demand had been raised with retrospective 
effect from 1985. The Group has disputed 
the alleged claim and the matter is pending 
before LDO which is supported by a legal 
opinion obtained by the Group.
	
	
Further, in April 10, 2024, the Group has 
received 
additional 
demand 
order 
for 
INR  1.42 Crore till July 14, 2024 calculated 
retrospective from January 01, 1994,
	
	
A writ petition was filed before Hon’ble High 
Court of Delhi challenging aforesaid demand 
and the Court has directed that no coercive 
action with respect to the enhanced ground 
rent shall be taken against the Group till such 
matter is heard. Next date of hearing xx.
	
	
Management believes that the alleged 
demand is questionable, arbitrary and not 
tenable and is likely to be settled in favour 
of the Group. Based on the above, liability in 
this regard has not been recognised based 
on management’s best estimate. 
	
(d)	 During the year, the Group received a 
property tax demand dated July 26, 2024 
under Section 108(A) (10) of K.M.C. Act, 1976 
and Section 144 (12) of current BBMP Act, 
2020 from Office of the Zonal Commissioner 
(East), 
Bruhat 
Bengaluru 
Mahanagra 
Palike East Zone for INR 8.32 crores which 
includes penalty, after revising and fixing the 
property tax, by amendments to principal 
act, based on for years starting from 2008-
09 to 2023‑24 for ‘The Park Hotels’ building 
situated at Bengaluru pursuant to Total 
Station Survey of the subject Building.
	
	
The Group is of the view that amendments 
to principal act are contrary to the various 
provisions of the Constitution of India, 1950, 
and accordingly, the demand raised for 
earlier years up to 2024 is not tenable. The 
Group had filed the writ petition against the 
said order. The Bengaluru High Court, vide its 
order dated August 20, 2024, has ordered a 
stay on the aforesaid writ petition. The date 
of hearing is not yet notified.
	
	
For period from April 01, 2008 to March 
31, 2024, the Group, basis the legal opinion, 
is of the view that the amendments to the 
principal act for property tax is not tenable 
and cannot be retrospective, and accordingly, 
revised rate is not acceptable keeping in 
view other properties in the vicinity and 
in same industry. Based on the above, the 
management believes that no provision is 
required to be made in the consolidated 
financial statements in this regard.
	
(e)	 Pursuant to a lease deed dated August 
08, 2007, executed between the Jaipur 
Development Authority (“JDA”) and the 
Group, the JDA granted leasehold rights in 
favour of the Group. The JDA has, from time 
to time, sent letters/notices directing the 
Group to clear its dues of annual lease rent 
for the period starting from the year 2008 
onwards. The JDA last issued a notice to the 
Group on December 12, 2019 under Sections 
256 and 257 of the Rajasthan Land Revenue 
Act, 1956, raising a demand for outstanding 
dues of annual rent aggregating up to 
INR 2.21 Crores, coupled with interest payable 
amounting to approximately INR 1.78 Crores. 
The Group has filed a writ of certiorari dated 
January 17, 2020 before the High Court of 
Jaipur together with an application to stay 
the Notice during the pendency of the writ 
petition. Pursuant to the writ petition, our 
Group has prayed for, among other things, to 
direct JDA (i) not to take any unjust or illegal 
action against our Group, in accordance with 
the Notice; (ii) to direct JDA not to take any 
stern legal action against our Group. The 
matter is currently pending. Management 
believes that there will be no adverse impact 
on the Group in this regard and therefore no 
liability in this regard has been recognised 
in these financial statements based on 
management’s best estimate.
