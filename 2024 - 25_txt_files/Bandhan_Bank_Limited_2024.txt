STATEMENTS PURSUANT TO SECTION 102 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 AND 
OTHER APPLICABLE PROVISIONS
Statements with respect to items under Ordinary/ Special Business covered in the Notice of Meeting are given below:
Item No. 4:
In terms of the Guidelines for Appointment of Statutory 
Central Auditors (SCAs)/ Statutory Auditors (SAs) of 
Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), UCBs and NBFCs 
(including HFCs) dated April 27, 2021, issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) (‘RBI Guidelines’), for 
entities with asset size of ₹15,000 crore and above, as at 
the end of the previous year, the statutory audit should 
be conducted under joint audit of a minimum of two audit 
firms [Partnership Firms/ Limited Liability Partnerships 
(LLPs)]. Further, in order to protect the independence of 
the auditors/ audit firms, entities will have to appoint the 
SCAs/ SAs for a continuous period of three years, subject 
to the firms satisfying the eligibility norms each year. 
Furthermore, Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) will be 
required to take prior approval of RBI for appointment/ 
re-appointment of SCAs/ SAs, on an annual basis. In view 
of the RBI Guidelines, the Bank has adopted a Policy for 
Appointment of Statutory Auditors of the Bank (‘Policy’). 
Accordingly, in terms of the RBI Guidelines and the Policy 
of the Bank, the Bank is required to have two Statutory 
Auditors to act as its Joint Statutory Auditors.

since the term of M/s. Singhi & Co., Chartered Accountants,

Accordingly, on the basis of recommendation of the Audit

to hold office from the conclusion of this 11th AGM until the

Item No. 7:
Mr. Ratan Kumar Kesh (DIN: 10082714) has been the 
Executive Director & Chief Operating Officer (‘ED&COO’) 
of the Bank since March 31, 2023. His current tenure as 
ED&COO, as approved by the RBI and the Members of the 
Bank, is of three years, from March 31, 2023 up to March 30, 
2026. The remuneration of an Executive Director is subject 
to prior approval of RBI and approval of Members of the 
Bank, on the basis of recommendations of the NRC and 
the Board of Directors. The remuneration of an Executive 
Director is also subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act, 2013, Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI Guidelines 
on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/ Chief Executive 
Officers/ Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff 
dated November 04, 2019 and the Compensation Policy of 
the Bank.
In view of the above and pursuant to approval of the RBI 
on fixed pay, the proposal for remuneration (Fixed and 
Variable) of Mr. Kesh for FY 2023-24 was placed before 
the Members of the Bank at its 10th AGM held on August 
20, 2024. The Members had approved Total Fixed Pay and 
Perquisites of ₹2.80 crore and Total Variable Pay of ₹3.51 
crore for Mr. Kesh for FY 2023-24. Subsequently, the RBI 
had approved a variable pay of ₹2.80 crore for Mr. Kesh for 
FY 2023-24. Approval of Members is, now, being sought, 
by way of resolution at Item No. 7 of this Notice, for the 
19
Notice
remuneration of Mr. Kesh for FY 2024-25, on the basis of 
the recommendations of the NRC and the Board.
The proposed revised remuneration comprises fixed pay 
and variable pay. In line with the RBI approval, a fixed pay of 
₹3.10 crore per annum is proposed for Mr. Ratan Kumar Kesh, 
for FY 2024-25, as against ₹2.80 crore per annum, which was 
previously approved by the Members. Further, considering 
the Bank’s performance as per Balanced Score Card (‘BSC’) 
methodology and on the basis of the recommendation of 
the NRC, the Board recommends the performance based 
variable pay of Mr. Ratan Kumar Kesh for FY 2024-25, as 
stated in the resolution, which is subject to approval of 
the RBI. The proposed revision in the remuneration of 
Mr. Ratan Kumar Kesh is in line with the Compensation 
Policy of the Bank. Further, for overall performance 
assessment of Mr. Ratan Kumar Kesh, ED&COO, BSC is used. 
The BSC is a performance evaluation technique that takes 
into consideration a number of financial and non-financial 
performance indicators aligned to the long-term strategy 
of the organisation. The performance goals are organised 
to address four perspectives, viz., financial, customer, 
internal process and people, the latter three being drivers 
of future performance. As per the RBI guidelines dated 
November 04, 2019, the performance based variable pay is 
subject to in-year adjustment, malus or clawback. Further, 
the deferred composition of the variable pay would be 
subject to malus and clawback arrangements in the event 
of subdued or negative financial performance of the Bank 
and/ or the relevant line of business in any year. Further 
details are provided in the Report on Corporate Governance 
and Financial Statement forming part of the Bank’s Annual 
Report for FY 2024-25.

Secretarial Standard on General Meetings (‘SS-2’) are 
annexed to this Notice.
Your Board of Directors, therefore, recommends passing of 
Ordinary Resolution as set out at Item No. 7 of this Notice,

of Mr. Ratan Kumar Kesh, ED&COO of the Bank.
Save and except Mr. Kesh and his relatives, none of the 
other Directors or Key Managerial Personnel of the Bank 
or their relatives are, in any way, concerned or interested, 
financially or otherwise, in the resolution set out at Item 
No. 7 of this Notice.
Item No. 8:

‘Corporate Governance in Banks - Appointment of Directors

2024 on ‘Review of Fixed Remuneration granted to Non-
Executive Directors (NEDs)’, in addition to sitting fees and 
expenses related to attending meetings of the Board and 
its committees as per extant statutory norms/ practices, the 
Bank may provide for payment of compensation to NEDs 
in the form of a fixed remuneration commensurate with an 
individual director’s responsibilities and demands on time 
and which are considered sufficient to attract qualified 
competent individuals, however, such fixed remuneration 
for an NED including independent directors, other than the 
Chair of the board, shall not exceed ₹30 Lakh per annum.
In terms of the provisions of Regulation 17(6) of the SEBI 
LODR, the Board shall recommend all fees or compensation, 
if any, paid to NEDs, including independent directors and 
shall require approval of shareholders in general meeting. 
Further, in terms of Section 197 of the Companies Act,

of the net profits of the company, if there is a managing or 
whole-time director or manager.
Pursuant to the RBI Guidelines, based on recommendations 
of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the 
Board of Directors of the Bank, the Shareholders of the 
Bank, at their 8th Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) held on 
August 10, 2022, approved the proposal for payment of

₹12,00,000 per annum per NED, other than the Part-time 
Non-Executive Chairperson, with effect from April 01, 2022 
onwards for a period of three years.
Considering the amount of time and efforts devoted 
by the NEDs, providing professional expertise in their 
respective fields of specialization while discharging their 
duties as a member of the Board and the critical roles that 
they are playing in the effective functioning of the Board 
Committees, and considering the nature and complexity 
of the banking business, and considering the prevailing 
industry benchmarks and the performance of the Bank, 
the approval of the Members of the Bank is, now, being 
20
11th AGM Notice 2024-25
sought for increase in payment of fixed remuneration 
from ₹12,00,000 to up to ₹18,00,000 per annum per NED, 
other than the Part-time Non-Executive Chairperson, with 
effect from April 01, 2025, for a period of one year, or any 
other or different limits as may be applicable under law / 
relevant RBI guidelines, from time to time, in addition to 
payment of sitting fees and reimbursement of expenses 
for attending the Board and Committee meetings. The 
fixed remuneration will be paid at such frequency as may 
be decided by the Board, which should be proportionate to 
the tenure of the NEDs during a financial year.
As per the Secretarial Standard on General Meetings, the 
required details of the NEDs who are entitled for fixed 
remuneration are annexed to this Notice, except for NEDs 
whose details are already captured in the Explanatory 
Statement to this Notice.

this Notice.
Save and except the NEDs (other than Non-Executive 
Chairman) and their relatives, none of the other Directors 
or Key Managerial Personnel of the Bank or their relatives 
are, in any way, concerned or interested, financially or 
otherwise, in the resolution set out at Item No. 8 of 
this Notice.

Chairman’s Message
Dear Shareholders,
It is with great privilege that I present your 
Bank’s Annual Report for FY 2024-25.  This 
is a moment to reflect on the progress your 
Bank has made and the values that have 
shaped its journey. As your Bank continues 
to grow and evolve, we remain committed 
to building a resilient, inclusive, and 
purpose-driven institution.
From its inception with a bold vision for 
financial empowerment, your Bank has 
evolved into a trusted financial institution, 
grounded in resilience, transparency, 
and empathy. The theme of this year’s 
report, ‘trust that grows, bandhan that 
strengthens’, aptly captures the essence 
of what we have built together, a 
growing institution anchored in enduring 
relationships and shared purpose
Indian Economic Review 
The Indian economy demonstrated commendable resilience 
in FY25, sustaining its status as the fastest-growing major 
economy worldwide. GDP growth eased to 6.5% in FY25 
due to a high base in the previous year. However, a strong 
7.4% growth in the fourth quarter reaffirmed the economy’s 
momentum. This recovery was driven partly by private 
consumption (over 7% growth), steady rural demand, and 
a resilient agricultural sector that grew by more than 4%. 
Additionally, construction activity surged, registering 
annual growth exceeding 9%. Gross Fixed Capital Formation 
(GFCF) rose by 9.4% in Q4 FY25, the fastest pace in six 
quarters, indicating increased investment in infrastructure 
and construction. 
Despite external challenges, including heightened 
geopolitical tension and policy uncertainty and subdued 
global demand, India’s structural strengths, favourable 
demographics, accelerating digital adoption, and supportive 
fiscal policies continued to provide macroeconomic 
stability. These trends created a conducive environment 
for credit growth and financial sector expansion. Sustained 
consumption and infrastructure investment are expected 
to drive continued demand for retail and corporate banking 
services, while a stable macroeconomic backdrop supports 
prudent risk management and long-term sectoral growth.
Indian Banking Sector’s Performance
The Indian banking sector demonstrated resilience and 
adaptability in FY 2024-25 amidst evolving macroeconomic 
dynamics. Public sector banks (PSBs) strengthened their 
market position, particularly in home and MSME lending, 
supported by improved asset quality and effective credit 
guarantee mechanisms. Private sector banks continued to 
exhibit stability, although they exercised greater caution 
in unsecured retail and small business lending due to rising 
delinquency levels. The microfinance segment, however, faced 
headwinds with a contraction in the loan book, elevated credit 
costs, and increased delinquencies, particularly in specific 
pockets. Despite these challenges, sector-wide GNPA levels 
remained contained, and the regulatory outlook points to 
gradual normalisation in asset quality and credit performance 
into FY26. 
Bandhan Bank’s Progress 
Amid a challenging macroeconomic landscape and 
headwinds for the microfinance (MFI) segment during the 
latter half of FY 2024-25, marked by rising credit costs and 
moderated growth, your Bank displayed strong resilience 
and strategic agility. Despite these headwinds, Profit After 
Tax (PAT) for the full year rose by a robust 23% year-on-
Dr. Anup Kumar Sinha 
Non-Executive (Independent) Chairman

Annual Report 2024-25
year to ₹2,745 crore, highlighting your Bank’s disciplined 
execution and focus on sustainable profitability. Building on 
this momentum, your Bank’s digital transformation remained 
a key enabler of its strategic priorities, driving operational 
efficiency, enhancing risk management, and elevating 
customer engagement. Initiatives such as the establishment 
of the Transformation Management Team and the Digital 
and Transaction Excellence Unit have advanced automation, 
digital payments, and fee-based income streams, while the 
Market Intelligence Team leverages AI to provide real-
time market insights. Additionally, your Bank’s expanded 
government payment integrations have strengthened its 
presence in the public sector, collectively positioning your 
Bank as a digitally empowered, customer-centric institution 
ready to capture new growth opportunities.
This year also marked a critical transition in your Bank’s 
leadership journey. Your Bank welcomed Mr. Partha Pratim 
Sengupta as the new Managing Director & CEO, effective 
November 1, 2024. A seasoned industry leader with expertise 
across business, credit, and technology, Mr. Sengupta 
brings with him a fresh perspective and strategic depth that 
will be instrumental in leading your Bank through its next 
phase—Bandhan Bank 2.0. His vision for a customer-centric, 
digitally enabled, and operationally efficient Bank is well 
aligned with your Bank’s long-term goals. The leadership 
transition was seamless, further strengthening your 
Bank’s governance and risk management frameworks, and 
reinforcing our commitment to regulatory compliance and 
operational resilience. 
Throughout the year, your Bank remained steadfast in its 
commitment to good governance, risk discipline, and long-
term value creation. We have expanded the scope of our 
conversations beyond just financial metrics to encompass 
the growing relevance of financial inclusion, digital equity, 
climate-conscious banking, and ethical leadership. Your Bank 
continues to evolve, ensuring its growth is not only inclusive 
but also sustainable. We recognise that while balance sheet 
strength is essential; it is trust, transparency, and social 
impact that define an enduring institution.
India’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain supportive of 
sustained growth in the financial sector. GDP is projected to 
expand by around 6.5% in FY26, with inflation easing towards 
the lower end of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target 
range. In response, the RBI reduced key policy rates and the 
Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) in June 2025, signalling a more 
neutral monetary stance aimed at lowering funding costs, 
improving liquidity, and stimulating credit demand. Stable 
food prices and moderating inflation are expected to revive 
rural demand and support urban consumption. Investment 
activity is gaining momentum, driven by healthy corporate 
balance sheets, increasing private capital expenditure, and 
continued public infrastructure investment. While global 
uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, commodity price 
volatility, and climate-related risks persist, India’s banking 
sector remains well-positioned to navigate these challenges.
In this promising environment, your Bank remains focused 
on leveraging these macro tailwinds by expanding its reach, 
deepening its customer relationships, and continuing 
to strengthen its balance sheet. We are confident that 
its diversified portfolio, robust capital base, and digital-
led approach will enable your Bank to capture emerging 
opportunities and deliver sustainable growth in the 
years ahead. 
As your Bank enters its second decade, it does so with 
renewed momentum, a sharper strategic vision, and a deep 
sense of responsibility to the millions of lives it serves. 
The journey ahead is filled with both purpose and promise, 
and we are well-positioned to seize the opportunities it 
presents. With each passing year, we have gained not only 
scale but also a richer understanding of the evolving needs 
of our customers, communities, and stakeholders. We 
move forward with the confidence that comes from staying 
rooted in our founding values, of trust, inclusion, service, 
and resilience. These values have served as our compass, 
guiding us through dynamic economic landscapes and times 
of transformation.
Looking Ahead 
Looking ahead, your Bank is more determined than ever 
to accelerate progress on its core priorities: delivering 
inclusive financial solutions, driving digital innovation, 
enhancing customer experience, and building a future-
ready, sustainable bank. This agenda is firmly anchored in 
strong governance, regulatory compliance, and robust risk 
management, ensuring that its growth is both responsible 
and resilient. Your Bank’s mission is not just to expand but 
to empower, not just to grow but to do so with integrity 
and accountability.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest 
gratitude to all those who have been part of this journey 
- customers, employees, regulators, and shareholders, for 
your enduring trust and belief in your Bank’s purpose.
Together, let us build not just a larger Bank, but a stronger, 
more inclusive, and future-ready institution that continues 
to stand the test of time and creates lasting value for 
generations to come.
Warm regards, 
Dr. Anup Kumar Sinha
Non-Executive (Independent) Chairman

MD and CEO’s Message
Despite the headwinds of global 
macroeconomic and geopolitical 
uncertainties, the Indian economy and 
the banking sector demonstrated strong 
resilience. Amongst the major economies, 
India’s real GDP growth of 6.5% during 
FY25 had been the highest. While 
inflation had been high during H1 FY25, 
it moderated considerably during the 
latter half of the financial year allowing 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to start 
lowering the repo rate by Q4, apart from 
strongly infusing liquidity. Banking sector’s 
deposit and credit growth moderated 
during the year to reach low double-digit 
growth by the end of the year, while 
maintaining decent asset quality.
Dear Shareholders,
It is with great pride and gratitude that I present your Bank’s 
Annual Report for the financial year 2024–25. This year’s 
report, themed trust that grows, bandhan that strengthens, 
reflects the essence of your Bank’s journey — building 
enduring trust, nurturing stronger bonds, and driving 
sustainable growth. Over the past decade, your Bank has 
evolved from a pioneering venture to a pan-India universal 
Bank, serving millions and strengthening financial inclusion 
across diverse geographies.
Despite the headwinds of global macroeconomic and 
geopolitical uncertainties, the Indian economy and the 
banking sector demonstrated strong resilience. Amongst 
the major economies, India’s real GDP growth of 6.5% 
during FY25 had been the highest. While inflation had been 
high during H1 FY25, it moderated considerably during 
the latter half of the financial year allowing the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) to start lowering the repo rate by Q4, 
apart from strongly infusing liquidity. Banking sector’s 
deposit and credit growth moderated during the year to 
reach low double-digit growth by the end of the year, while

Against the backdrop of a resilient economy and banking 
sector, your Bank also continued demonstrating resilience, 
innovation, and an unwavering commitment to stakeholders. 
Your Bank reaffirms its dedication to creating lasting value, 
deepening relationships, and fortifying its position as a 
trusted banking partner in India.
Performance:
Your Bank’s deposits reached ₹1.51 lakh crore by March 
2025, a decent 12% increase year-on-year. This growth 
is a testament to the trust our customers have placed in 
your Bank as a safe, reliable financial partner. A well-
diversified and granular deposit base underpins your 
Bank’s financial resilience. We prioritised CASA and 
retail term deposits to ensure a stable, low-cost funding 
mix that supports sustainable credit expansion and 
liquidity management.

Annual Report 2024-25
Reducing dependence on volatile bulk deposits has 
been a strategic focus, as these funds, while substantial, 
tend to be more expensive and less reliable. Your Bank’s 
conscious shift towards a more stable deposit profile 
safeguards long-term cost efficiency and balance sheet 
stability. Your Bank also pivoted towards enhancing 
fee-based income, accelerating digital adoption, and 
reinforcing risk controls to sustain profitability and 
stakeholder confidence.
Gross advances grew by 10% year-on-year to ₹1.37 lakh 
crore as of March 2025. This growth was broad-based, 
driven by increased demand from secured lending 
portfolios and strategic sectors aligned with national 
priorities. Secured advances showed exceptional growth 
of 32%, now forming 50.5% of total advances. This 
transition towards secured lending mitigates credit risk 
and improves portfolio quality by leveraging collateral-
backed credit. Emerging Entrepreneur Business (EEB) 
loans continued to be a key segment, with prudent 
credit appraisal and collection efforts ensuring strong 
portfolio performance vis-à-vis other players in the 
microfinance industry.
Your Bank delivered a Profit After Tax of ₹2,745 crore for 
FY25, a growth of 23% year-on-year increase in full-year 
profit, reflecting sustained and resilient performance. 
Fee-based income, treasury operations, and trade finance 
also contributed to diversifying income streams beyond 
interest margins.
A disciplined cost management approach, including 
technology-driven operational efficiencies, helped 
maintain a competitive cost-to-income ratio. Your Bank 
posted a Return on Assets (RoA) of 1.5% for FY25. Your 
Bank remains focused on enhancing RoA to 1.8%–1.9% 
over the next 2–3 years through quality asset growth and 
diversified revenue sources.
The capital adequacy ratio stood robustly at 18.7% as of 
31 March 2025, well above the regulatory requirement 
of 11.5%. This strong capital position enables your 
Bank to absorb shocks, invest in growth initiatives, and 
meet future regulatory demands comfortably. Capital 
strength remains a key enabler of strategic flexibility and 
risk mitigation.
We are committed to improve our Gross NPA and Net 
NPA levels, which stood at 4.7% and 1.3%, respectively, 
at the end of FY25. This will be achieved through 
disciplined credit appraisal, proactive provisioning, and 
effective recovery mechanisms. The Provision Coverage 
Ratio improved to 86.5%, including technical write-offs, 
indicating prudent provisioning. Excluding technical 
write-offs, PCR was at 73.7%, reinforcing our conservative 
risk posture.
Risk Management and Compliance
Your Bank’s risk management framework is a foundational 
pillar that supports sustainable growth and stakeholder 
confidence. We continuously embed risk awareness across 
all levels, from frontline employees to senior management, 
ensuring risks are identified early and mitigated effectively. 
Regular risk assessments and stress-testing scenarios are 
integral to our prudential practices. Your Bank maintains 
strict adherence to our Risk Appetite Framework, ensuring 
that all business decisions align with our risk tolerance levels 
and strategic objectives. In today’s dynamic regulatory 
environment, compliance is more critical than ever. Your 
Bank is committed towards a high standard of compliance 
– statutory, regulatory, and internal policies. A robust 
vigilance mechanism protects customers and your Bank’s 
reputation alike.

Technology, Innovation and 
Transformation:
During the year, your Bank made significant progress in 
embedding technology across functions to drive innovation 
and agility. A major milestone in this journey was the 
establishment of the Transformation Management Team, 
a dedicated unit focused on reimagining core processes 
through automation and digital services.
In parallel, your Bank formed Digital and Transaction 
Excellence Unit (DTEU) to build customised digital solutions 
combining technical, functional, and commercial platforms.
Your Bank has also introduced Credit Administration and 
Asset Operations Department (CAD), which monitors post-
disbursement formalities, NPA resolutions, underwriting 
reviews, and ensures regulatory reporting. This will help in 
achieving better asset quality for the Bank.
Additionally, your Bank has established a Market Intelligence 
Team that works in extensive collaboration with the Data 
Science and Analytics team to process unstructured data, 
providing early warning signals and also real-time insights 
into borrower sentiments and market trends.
These initiatives collectively reinforce your Bank’s position 
as a digitally empowered customer-centric institution, ready 
to adapt to rapid technological changes while capturing new 
growth opportunities across the financial ecosystem.
Your Bank remains steadfast in its mission 
to expand its geographic footprint across 
the country. Your Bank had over 6,300 
outlets pan-India, including over 1,700 
bank branches as at end of FY25, which 
reflects our commitment to inclusive 
banking. Your Bank will remain committed 
to strengthening presence in semi-urban 
and rural areas, while maintaining steady 
branch and ATM expansion across the 
country. Your Bank remains focused to 
further promote financial inclusion through 
these banking outlets.

Way Forward:
This year holds special significance as your Bank completes 
ten years of service, growth, and impact. It is a moment to 
reflect on the journey so far and the foundation that has 
been laid for the future.
While the first decade was about building, learning, and 
evolving, the next decade holds the promise of greater 
opportunities, confident growth, and purposeful scale. Your 
Bank is now poised to enter a new chapter — one defined 
by innovation, inclusion, and impact. With experience as our 
guide and a strong foundation in place, your Bank is prepared 
to meet the aspirations of customers – both existing and

Together, we will embrace the future with confidence and

Retail Liabilities 
Designed for your 
Bank’s Diverse Customer 
Aspirations
Your Bank continues to deepen its commitment to 
customer-centric banking through a broad suite of 
retail liability products. These offerings are designed to 
promptly and effectively serve the diverse banking needs 
of your Bank’s customers, reinforcing the growing trust 
they place in your Bank and the enduring relationships 
the Bank cultivates with them.
During FY25, your Bank’s deposit portfolio recorded a 
robust 12% growth, with the total deposit base reaching 
₹1,51,212 crore as on March 31, 2025. This growth was 
largely driven by a well-diversified liability product mix 
comprising term, savings, and current account deposits, 
reflecting the growing confidence that customers place 
in your Bank. The retail deposit book grew by 11%, 
underscoring the strengthening of customer relationships 
and your Bank’s expanding reach.
Further, your Bank enhanced its savings product 
proposition by strategically addressing diverse customer 
segments. Alongside strengthening its offerings for 
the Affluent Segment with Elite Plus and Elite Savings 
Accounts, your Bank introduced four new savings 
products: Avni Savings Account for women, Pension 
Savings Account, PMJDY Savings Account, and Classic 
Savings Account.
These were launched to deepen financial inclusion further 
and respond to the unique needs of every customer 
segment, thereby strengthening the bandhan your Bank 
shares with its customers. These efforts were supported 
by targeted campaigns focused on product awareness, 
interest rates, and technology-led services.
Furthermore, in FY25, your Bank also introduced new 
Debit Card variants — Elite Plus, Elite, Platinum Plus, 
Titanium, PMJDY, and Avni Debit Cards — offering 
enhanced features and benefits. The Debit Card portfolio 
contributed approximately ₹88 crore in card fee income, 
encompassing annual issuance, and re-issuance fees, 
reflecting the value customers continue to find in your 
Bank’s offerings.
The Current Account segment demonstrated remarkable 
resilience, benefiting from a range of well-executed 
strategic initiatives. These included the launch of the 
new Collection Account, higher penetration of EDC 
and QR code solutions, re-engagement with existing 
customers, and a stronger team of Current Account 
managers. Through sharper customer segmentation, 
digital expansion, and process automation, your Bank not 
only enhanced customer experience but also fortified 
operational efficiency, advancing its focus on long-term, 
trust-driven growth. Expansion into high-potential 
catchment areas and targeted acquisition campaigns 
further contributed to the performance.
The Merchant Acquiring Business remains a key driver of 
liability growth.  FY25 marked significant gains:
•	 127% Y-O-Y growth in merchant acquisition
•	 68% Y-O-Y increase in transaction throughput
•	 21% Y-O-Y growth in revenue, backed by increased 
balances in associated current accounts
Merchant Acquiring Business’ success highlights the 
trust merchants place in your Bank and its integral

52
Annual Report 2024-25
During FY25, your Bank focused on enhancing 
experiences across every customer touchpoint.
Several strategic initiatives were undertaken to 
ensure improved access, convenience, and service 
excellence:
•	 Your Bank’s 24/7 Contact Centre supports multiple 
regional languages in addition to English and 
Hindi, managing a wide range of services, including 
emergency support, grievance resolution, and product-
related queries. Additionally, customers can reach out 
to explore additional products and services. As part of

hub across three locations with a frictionless Self-
Service IVR system that offers profile-based call 
routing, including direct access to agents for EEB 
(Emerging Entrepreneurs Business) customers.
•	 To elevate the in-branch experience, 50 branches have 
been redesigned to offer an enhanced ambience, 
seating arrangements, and visibility of essential 
banking information. Awareness campaigns and visual 
cues further enrich the customer experience. The next 
phase includes upgrading additional 500 branches. 
Concurrently, branch banking transactions and account

ensuring faster, error-free and hassle-free banking.
•	 Recognising the growing importance of digital

roadmap, with particular attention to reducing

Further, your Bank continues to strengthen its ‘Customer-
First’ culture through regular engagement. Customers

Customer Service and the Customer Service Committee 
of the Board, enabling direct feedback to senior 
management. Monthly Branch-Level Customer Service 
Committee meetings are held, inviting customers from 
diverse backgrounds, including senior citizens and 
pensioners, to share their experiences and suggestions.  
Your Bank has also initiated transaction surveys, wherein 
feedback is taken from customers within a week of their 
interaction for the recency effect. In addition, your Bank 
regularly gathers feedback from its frontline employees, 
whose insights are invaluable in refining service delivery.
Moreover, your Bank benchmarks its services against 
industry standards and incorporates findings from 
ongoing feedback and periodic studies. As a result, 
continuous improvements are being made to service 
delivery and customer journeys. Similarly, your Bank’s 
governance framework has been reinforced to monitor

covering all product lines. The outcomes of this study 
will guide large-scale enhancements in product, process,

Furthermore, your Bank’s Customer Experience 
Department publishes a periodic ‘Customer-First’ internal

Transformation
How the drive for survival affects all living beings is 
understood since the days of Charles Darwin. According 
to modern-day economic research, this also applies to the 
corporate world. Your Bank understands that though the 
parallels between natural and economic transformation 
are striking, the pace is significantly different. 
In nature, it can take centuries or millennia for traits 
to impact a species' prospects positively or negatively. 
On the contrary, in a fast-paced economy of the 
Anthropocene, companies often have mere months or 
years to adapt to secure their survival. 
Businesses are never in a state of equilibrium. Instead, 
they are characterised by constant competition among 
companies, products, and systems. As in Darwin's 
observations on natural selection, only those that adapt 
to their environment emerge victorious. 
Companies must, therefore, navigate this challenge 
daily by adapting to new regulations, shifting consumer 
preferences, demographic changes, long-term trends 
like climate change, and above all, digitalisation. This 
is achieved through transformational efforts that 
create new ecosystems or interconnect existing ones, 
benefiting all. 
The Epicentre of Trust-led 
Transformation
Transformation and Trust
Your Bank believes that trust and transformation are 
intrinsically linked, both in personal and professional 
contexts. Since banking is a business built on trust, any 
transformation must be rooted in it. Within relationships, 
a foundation of mutual faith enables vulnerability, open 
communication, transparency, and collaboration, all of 
which are vital for positive change and growth. 
Trust is also essential for creating a shared commitment to 
change, where team members feel valued and empowered 
to contribute their best work. Your Bank's leadership 
prioritises building trust with their teams, creating a sense 
of psychological safety that encourages innovation and 
risk-taking. Your Bank believes in maintaining high ethical 
standards and showing empathy towards others, paying 
attention to others' perspectives and showing genuine 
care to build trust and strengthen relationships. They 
inspire followers by communicating a compelling vision 
and demonstrating genuine care for their well-being. 
In essence, trust acts as the lubricant that allows 
transformation to occur smoothly and effectively. A lack of 
trust can create friction and resistance, while a foundation 
of trust enables individuals and organisations to navigate 
change with greater ease and achieve more impactful 
results. When employees trust their leaders and the 
organisation's intentions, they are more likely to embrace 
new strategies, technologies, and processes. 
It is not the strongest of the 
species that survives, nor the 
most intelligent that survives. 
It is the one that is most 
adaptable to change.

Wise men put their trust in 
ideas and not in circumstances.

Transformation at Your Bank
Your Bank is at a pivotal stage of its growth journey, and 
to stay competitive, it has embarked on the Bandhan 
Bank 2.0 transformation journey encompassing business, 
channels, operations, digital, and customer experience. 
To achieve the goal of a syncretic transformation, a 
Transformation Management Office (TMO) has been 
established as an extension of the MD and CEO’s office. 
The TMO oversees and catalyses several transformative 
initiatives being undertaken at your Bank. It operates 
under four I’s - Initiation, Intervention, Innovation, 
and Integration, guiding its comprehensive approach 
to strategic evolution. Presently, TMO is catalysing 
29 projects and initiatives involving 16 departments 
with 129 Bandhanites, reflecting One Bandhan Bank.
Furthermore, your Bank believes that driving 
transformation requires exuberance, experience and 
an amalgamation of diverse skill sets and thinking, and 
the TMO has been staffed accordingly. The TMO has 
already initiated actions associated with technology 
modernisation, process improvements, capability 
evolution, new business model reconfiguration, and more. 
Some of the transformative initiatives currently in the 
pipeline include retail liability sourcing from increased 
catchments through the banking units (BU), modernising 
the credit underwriting process with an integrated 
approach of implementing business rule engines for all 
rule-based products, and using analytical tool-based 
scorecards and technology-based PDs, leading to STP 
digital underwriting. Simultaneously, all digital platforms 
are being upgraded in accordance with Service-Channel-
Customer compatibility mapping to ensure a seamless 
customer journey. 
Moreover, your Bank is working to innovatively utilise 
emerging technologies such as QR codes, WhatsApp 
banking, and facial recognition capabilities in various 
aspects, including customer convenience, operational 
efficiency, recovery efforts, and fraud risk management. 
Besides, a culture of agility and continuous improvement 
underpins these efforts, reflected in workplace 
transformation initiatives and the alignment of new 
technologies, such as AEPS, with business objectives 
aimed at digitalising the working environment.
At its core, the Transformation Management Office 
embodies your Bank's unwavering commitment to its 
future. By championing these strategic imperatives and 
embracing the evolutionary currents of the industry, your 
Bank is not simply reacting to change but actively shaping 
for the future. 
Your Bank is confident in its ability to build  
Bandhan Bank 2.0, an agile, innovative, tech-savvy 
and customer-centric universal bank, ensuring that 
with growing trust, the bandhan with its customers 
strengthens. Together, they symbolify resilience, 
deeper engagement, and sustained financial inclusion, 
reinforcing your Bank’s core values of trust, customer-
centricity, and long-term empowerment.
The best way to predict the 
future is to create it.

Focusing on what Matters: 
Key Risk Areas
Your Bank prioritises proactive identification and mitigation of potential risks 
through a robust risk management strategy aligned with industry’s best practices. 
This approach ensures resilience and builds growing trust among stakeholders, 
strengthening the long-standing relationship they share with your Bank. 
Your Bank’s holistic approach towards 
managing risks emphasises four key elements:
1.	
Developing a corporate risk profile
2.	
Risk function that manages risk prudently
3.	
Practicing integrated risk management
4.	
Ensuring continuous risk monitoring
These practices protect your Bank’s long-term 
stability and reinforce stakeholder confidence, 
enabling stronger bonds and deeper engagement. 
They continue to differentiate your Bank, empower 
decision-making, protect stakeholder interest, and 
win their trust and loyalty.
The risks managed include credit risk, credit 
concentration risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest 
rate risk in the banking book, operational risk, fraud 
risk, conduct risk, IT risk, outsourcing risk, compliance 
and legal risk, information security (InfoSec) risk, 
reputational risk, strategic risk, business risk and their 
underlying interlinkages.
Your Bank's strong risk governance strives to nurture 
enduring relationships, upholding the values of trust, 
customer-centricity and long-term empowerment, 
true to the spirit of trust and bandhan.
The essence of risk 
management lies not 
in avoiding risk but 
in understanding and 
preparing for it.
– Peter L. Bernstein
Risk Management
62
Annual Report 2024-25
Success is not final, failure is 
not fatal: It is the COURAGE 
to CONTINUE that counts. 
– Winston S. Churchill
Risk management and resilience are closely 
intertwined. Effective risk management 
practices contribute to resilience by reducing 
the likelihood and severity of adverse events, 
thereby providing stability and building trust.  
In recent years, unexpected global events have 
disrupted businesses across different parts of the 
world. The confluence of a global pandemic, massive 
supply chain disruptions, geopolitical risks, and many 
other challenges has fueled inflation, escalated the 
cost of living, and led to large-scale cyber-attack, 
among other consequences. 
Furthermore, the predominant operational risks faced 
earlier emanated from vulnerabilities related to the 
increasing dependence and rapid adoption of technology 
for the provision of financial services and intermediation. 
However, the growing reliance on third-party providers, 
exacerbated by COVID-19 with a greater reliance on 
virtual working arrangements, has highlighted the 
increasing importance of operational resilience. 
Moreover, the landscape is ever-evolving, with frequent 
changes in regulatory guidelines, technological 
expectations, and shifting consumer preferences.  
To stay one step ahead, your Bank has embarked on 
a forward-looking transformation journey, driving 
innovation within—through a focus on modernising its 
technology, optimising processes, evolving capabilities, 
and innovating its business and operating models. 
This will ultimately enhance customer convenience, 
operational efficiency, and risk management.
Your Bank acknowledges the critical need to shape a 
resilient and robust organisation that can adapt quickly 
and take informed decisions and actions. Therefore, 
uniform measures are in place to assess the immediate 
and potential future effects and proactively map 
probable corrective actions and mitigation plans. 
Accordingly, streamlining of core business is prioritised, 
which supports critical services and products. A 
comprehensive Crisis and Business Continuity Plan 
(BCP), developed in collaboration with key stakeholders, 
has been put in place and can be quickly activated. 
Similarly, stress testing, through various extreme but 
plausible scenarios, is done regularly to prepare your 
Bank for uncertainties, apart from testing for normal 
risk scenarios.

Approach to Risk Management
Your Bank’s Risk Management framework outlines 
its approach to risk management, encompassing 
provisions for risk governance arrangements, 
appetite and limits for risk exposures, policies for 
the management of various risk types, risk culture 
standards, and risk reporting.  
The key arrangements and standards for risk management 
and internal controls that support your Bank’s compliance 
with statutory and regulatory requirements are also 
clearly defined under this framework. By doing so, your 
Bank establishes a foundation for institutional trust 
and responsible growth practices. Simultaneously, risk 
transparency is built through reporting, disclosure, 
sharing of information and open dialogue on the risks 
arising from various activities across your Bank. 
Your Bank’s risk appetite is dynamic, taking into 
account changing situations. To assess the potential 
levels of stress that your Bank may encounter in the 
current dynamic macroeconomic and microeconomic 
environment, it conducts additional scenario analysis 
prudently, beyond what is required by the regulator.
Furthermore, your Bank’s robust Risk Appetite Framework 
(‘RAF’), set annually by the Board on the recommendation 
of the RMCB, aims to align risk-taking with its strategy, 
business, and capital plans. The RAF is a key governance 
tool. Hence, clarity regarding risk appetite and knowledge 
of operational triggers, which act as internal management 
triggers, is considered essential for risk-aware decision-
making.
Moreover, scenarios and measurement approaches for 
quantifying risk and capital demands are implemented 
across all material risk types. Systems, processes, 
and policies are critical components of your Bank’s 
risk management capability. Meanwhile, continuous 
Risk Management is a more 
realistic term than safety. 
It implies that hazards are 
ever-present, that they must 
be identified, analysed, 
evaluated and controlled or 
rationally accepted. 
– Jerome F. Lederer
monitoring, scenario analysis, stress testing tools, 
and escalation processes safeguard key capital and 
liquidity levels. 
Overall, the lessons from recent uncertainties has helped 
in strengthening the Risk Assessment Framework. 
The learnings were incorporated to regulate industry 
and socio-political risks and conduct risk within the 
framework, taking them into consideration while 
formulating your Bank’s strategy and business 
expansion plan.
Your Bank keeps risk appetite as a guiding document 
while planning for the growth strategy.

Annual Report 2024-25
Risk Governance That Guards Trust
Banks need well-defined roles and responsibilities 
for managing risks, with robust mechanisms 
capable of holding individuals and teams 
accountable for their risk management 
decisions and actions. This includes establishing 
risk committees, risk appetite frameworks, and 
efficient escalation mechanisms to ensure the 
risks are identified, assessed, and managed at 
all levels within the organisation. 
Furthermore, your Bank believes that considerations of 
profits or performance evaluation should not influence 
the role of risk management, but rather should align with 
regulatory guidelines and international best practices. 
Accordingly, your Bank’s risk governance framework 
provides guidance on adopting a more holistic approach 
to managing risk. The detailed roles and responsibilities 
within your Bank further support the framework.
Your Bank follows three levels of the Risk 
Governance Framework:
1.	
Board
2.	
Committees of the Board
3.	
Management Committees
Your Bank’s Board, through the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board (RMCB), is regularly updated and 
as necessary, on special developments in its risk situation, 
risk management, and risk mitigation.
The Risk Management Committee of the Board (RMCB) 
deliberates with the Management on the issues of 
aggregate risk disposition and risk strategy. It also 
supports the Board in monitoring the implementation of 
this strategy.
Uncertainty is the only 
certainty there is, and 
knowing how to live with 
insecurity is the only security. 
– John Allen Paulos
Various risk-related committees at Executive Level, 
such as Asset Liability Management Committee 
(ALCO), Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC), 
Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), 
Market Risk Management Committee (MRMC), and 
Information Security Committee (ISC), among others 
serve as formalised decision-making forums, which 
enable the views of risk decision takers and risk 
managers to be taken into account.
The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is directly responsible 
for all the risk management functions, such as 
Credit Risk Management, Market Risk Management, 
Operational Risk Management, Liquidity Risk Control 
and Information Security. In addition, the CRO is 
responsible for monitoring, analysing, and reporting 
risks on a comprehensive basis.
Meanwhile, the independence of the CRO is ensured 
through a fixed tenure, reporting structure and 
periodic reviews by the Board and RMCB.

Risk Culture
Your Bank believes in the philosophy  
of ‘Setting the Tone from the Top.’  
The Board and the Management build a strong 
risk culture within the organisation, further 
influencing the rest of the employees and driving 
strong risk resilience across all roles and levels, 
thereby safeguarding the key capitals and 
upholding your Bank’s reputation.
 
Risk culture at your Bank is nurtured through:
i. 	
Regular and adequate risk management training for 
employees, tailored to their profiles and roles within 
risk management. Every risk taken needs to be 
approved within the risk management framework.
ii. 	
Issuing weekly or monthly newsletters and 
publications on various areas of risks.
You can’t mandate culture. It 
evolves organically, but it can 
be steered. 
– Satya Nadella
iii. 	 Issuing directions on measures required for 
strengthening risk culture, formulation of policies 
and frameworks, whistle-blower mechanism, risk 
appetite framework, and more.
iv. 	 Placing emphasis on taking risks within the 
defined risk appetite. Also, ensuring that the risk taken 
is adequately compensated in line with risk-adjusted 
performance measures.
Leadership and ‘Tone 
from the Top’
•	 Viable and consistent role modelling from 
senior leadership; core values practised in 
daily actions
•	 Transparent and coordinated  
decision-making
•	 Continuous and constructive challenging of 
preconceptions, decision-making and actions
•	 High standards of analytical insight and 
information-sharing at all levels
•	 Rapid escalation of issues and concerns
•	 Failures used as critical learning opportunities
•	 Incentives that encourage all members to 
 ‘do the right thing’ while considering 
the overall health and operations of 
the organisation
•	 Focus on external stakeholders of risk

Risk Strategy and Capital
Risk Awareness and Communication
Your Bank aims to maintain an adequate capital 
buffer on an ongoing and forward-looking basis, 
i.e., internal capital supply to exceed internal 
capital demand at all times.  
Your Bank maintains compliance with the Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) as required under 
Pillar 2 of Basel III through its robust risk management 
and governance framework, methodologies, processes 
and infrastructure.
Your Bank employs a strategic planning process that 
aligns its risk strategy and appetite with its commercial 
objectives, a continuous monitoring process covering 
approved risk, leverage, and capital. This includes regular 
reporting of these parameters to management and a 
robust stress testing framework.
Your Bank believes that communication plays a 
pivotal role in building enhanced risk awareness 
among stakeholders, especially in matters related 
to risk culture and cybersecurity, and that a risk-
aware employee and customer is, in itself, helps 
mitigate undesired risks. 
Your Bank regularly trains staff on risk management 
through newsletters, circulars, seminars, workshops, and 
desktop screensavers. To enhance customer awareness of 
information security, multilingual text messages, emails, 
and social media posts are also used. 
To win without risk is to 
triumph without glory. 
– Pierre Corneille
In the business world, the 
rear-view mirror is always

– Warren Buffett
The ICAAP, Risk Appetite Framework, and Strategic 
Document are annually approved by the Board and 
reviewed on a periodic basis, ensuring alignment among 
risk, capital, and strategy.
Furthermore, your Bank has a framework in place 
to gauge the effectiveness of Information Security 
Awareness. It also employs a Learning Management 
System (LMS) for employees, featuring curated modules 
in specialised areas such as information security, business 
continuity planning, and risk culture.

This further ensures proactive participation of the Board and the Management 
in nurturing a strong culture of compliance and risk awareness. Such 
commitment underpins your Bank's continuous efforts to build and maintain 
trust with customers, regulators, and the broader public.
70
Annual Report 2024-25
Your Bank has stringent compliance standards 
aligning with regulatory, statutory, and internal 
requirements. A comprehensive compliance policy, 
aligned with your Bank’s philosophy, clearly defines 
roles and responsibilities within the Department. 
With this structured approach, your Bank ensures that 
its operations remain transparent, responsible, and 
trustworthy, thereby building trust and deepening 
bandhan in the relationship engagement it shares with 
all stakeholders.
Additionally, the Compliance Department supports 
the Board and Management in proactively managing 
compliance risks, ensuring that your Bank's activities 
consistently adhere to guidelines issued by the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) and other regulatory and statutory 
authorities. It also ensures that your Bank complies to 
the various standards and codes set forth by institutions 
such as the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), the Foreign 
Exchange Dealers' Association of India (FEDAI), and the 
Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association 
of India (FIMMDA). 
Moreover, the Department serves as the primary liaison 
with regulatory bodies, staying updated with evolving 
regulations, providing expert interpretation to senior 
management, and actively monitoring for potential 
gaps or deviations.
In line with your Bank's values of collaboration and 
resilience, the Department works closely with other 
departments to ensure a clear understanding and 
implementation of regulatory requirements. It also 
partners with the Risk and Internal Audit departments 
to enhance risk management practices and strengthen 
internal controls.
Further, your Bank has implemented a comprehensive, 
risk-based Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programme 
to address risks associated with money laundering 
and terrorism financing. 
This entails a well-defined AML Policy, comprehensive 
customer due diligence protocols, continual risk 
assessments, and effective monitoring tools for detecting 
and reporting suspicious activities. Simultaneously, 
regular training sessions are conducted to equip staff 
with the knowledge required for ongoing compliance and 
proactive risk mitigation.

Data Analytics
Data-Driven Approach: 
Fostering Trust  
Through Analytics
Trust forms the foundation of the banking industry, serving as the cornerstone 
of customer relationships and organisational reputation. Time and again, 
regulators worldwide are working to protect all customers' data.
72
Annual Report 2024-25
With the advent of data science and analytics, your 
Bank has begun transforming its services and building 
greater trust among its customers. It is committed to 
protect its customers' information at all costs. Your 
Bank has heavily invested in Big Data Lake to enable the 
organisation to process vast amounts of information to 
uncover actionable insights. Similarly, it has created a 
comprehensive Data Governance Framework to secure 
data and address vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, one-size-fits-all approaches are rapidly 
becoming obsolete in modern banking. For an improved 
customer experience and customer centricity, your Bank 
has developed several in-house solutions like NEEV (in-
house CRM Solution). 
Based on AI-ML models, your Bank has 
tailored services to meet individual 
customer needs:
•	 Customer Segmentation: Banks use clustering 
techniques to categorise clients based on demographic 
profiles, preferences, and behaviours.
•	 Recommendation Engines: Predictive analytics design 
customised offers for lending products, savings 
plans, etc.
•	 Internal Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Gen-
AI-based personalised support, ensuring swift 
and accurate responses to customer queries, and 
knowledge institutionalisation.
Further, personalisation not only enhances customer 
satisfaction but also demonstrates your Bank's 
commitment to understanding and meeting individual 
needs. Simultaneously, transparency is crucial for 
building trust. 
With the help of near-real-time data and 
analytics, your Bank has implemented:
•	 Transactions and Operations Monitoring: To prevent 
fraud, regulatory breaches, and revenue losses.
•	 Regulatory Compliance: Utilise algorithms to ensure 
adherence to laws and regulations, minimising errors 
and promoting fairness.
Data-driven risk management is another avenue where 
analytics reinforce trust. Predictive models assess 
the creditworthiness of customers, their income and 
asset wealth, and provide early warning signals for new 
borrowers. Forecasting and stress testing models further 
predict future financial trends.
Data analytics is thus redefining trust in banking 
services. Through enhanced security, transparency, 
personalisation, and predictive management, your Bank 
is strengthening its bandhan with its customers. As 
these technologies evolve, they will continue to play a 
pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and integrity of 
this institution, thereby building trust that grows with 
every transaction.
Enterprise Data Lake (EDL): Centralising 
Data for Smarter Decisions
Your Bank’s Enterprise Data Lake (EDL) acts as a Single

The Targeting the Hardcore Poor (THP) programme 
is a flagship CSR initiative implemented by Bandhan 
Konnagar, targeting the most vulnerable women-headed 
households. It adopts a holistic approach, providing not 
only free assets but also enabling them to generate 
income and improve their livelihoods. Over the course of 
24 months, participants undergo a transformative journey 
through continuous counselling and mentoring support, 
lifting themselves out of extreme poverty and integrating 
into the broader community. To ensure that the women's 
basic household needs are met during the initial phase, 
a weekly consumption stipend is also provided, ensuring 
financial stability as they integrate into mainstream socio-
economic activities.
The THP programmes adopt a holistic 360° approach to 
developing the required competencies to run a successful 
enterprise. It starts with confidence-building measures, 
and thereafter, these women undergo a series of training, 
including basic literacy skills, financial literacy, enterprise-
specific skill development, health and sanitation 
awareness, vulnerability mapping, and risk mitigation 
strategies, among others. Such a rigorous approach 
empowers these marginalised women to make informed 
decisions, while education on social issues enhances their 
awareness and well-being. 
Over the years, this intervention has positively impacted 
52,500 women, enabling them to secure a stable monthly 
income, improve their health and education, and better 
support their families.

The health programme aims to improve access to 
healthcare and enhance the well-being of underprivileged 
women. It focuses on essential maternal and child 
healthcare services, including antenatal care (ANC),

Recognising the interconnection between climate action 
and Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals, your 
Bank has initiated the Climate Action Programme, which 
contributes to this goal through the following strategies:
Reducing Atmospheric Carbon
•	 Carbon sequestration through plantation 
and agroforestry
•	 Reducing GHG emissions through clean development 
practices and technologies in energy, agriculture and 
allied sectors
Climate Change Adaptation
•	 Building resilience to climate change and extreme 
weather conditions among vulnerable communities by 
addressing the interrelated SDGs
•	 Mitigating climate change impacts
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
2021 states the agricultural sector in India faces high 
vulnerability towards drastic weather events due to 
poor climate-resilient agricultural practices, poor water 
management, over-dependence on conventional sources 
of energy, high chemical dumping destroying soil health, 
loss of soil quality and topsoil, high dependency on 
groundwater, destruction of bio-diversity including 
natural balance with the ecosystem and overall high 
GHG emission.
Considering the vulnerabilities in the agricultural 
sector, this year, your Bank launched a new initiative, 
Climate Smart Villages (CSV), under its Climate Action 
Programme. This programme aims to develop a holistic 
climate action approach for a village to make it climate 
resilient. This includes water security and protection from 
erratic rainfall patterns through water conservation, 
which helps safeguard rain-fed agriculture, as well as the 
adoption of climate-resilient varieties. The Climate Action 
Programme continues to focus on its earlier commitment 
to carbon sequestration through afforestation, especially 
mangrove plantation, and greening of urban spaces.
Your Bank also contributed to biodiversity conservation 
at Jambusar, funding a mangrove biodiversity assessment 
and the development of a Nature Interpretation Centre 
to educate the public about mangrove ecosystems. 
Furthermore, a Nature Education Programme, Mud-
Flat Dhuleti, raised funds and provided 20 participants 
with an immersive learning experience about the local 
ecosystem. In Gujarat's Jambusar Taluka, 25 marginalised 
tribal farmers were supported with solar-powered drip 
irrigation systems.
Furthermore, your Bank has installed solar-powered 
high-mast streetlights in the vicinity of Vittal Temple, 
Pandharpur. The initiative has helped enhance safety 
while contributing to long-term environmental 
sustainability. These initiatives are a testament to your 
Bank's commitment to environmental sustainability and 
community empowerment.
Mangrove Conservation and 
Agroforestry Plantation
Your Bank has undertaken the plantation of 4,34,046 
saplings in 511 hectares through agroforestry plantations 
in Purulia district and mangrove conservation in the 
Sundarbans, West Bengal, and Jambusar, Gujarat. The 
estimated carbon sequestered through the plantation 
initiatives is approximately 3,968 metric tons of CO2 
per year.

Biodiversity Conservation and Education 
at Jambusar
During FY25, your Bank contributed towards a 
comprehensive Biodiversity Assessment of Mangroves 
and the design proposal for a Nature Interpretation 
Centre at Jambusar, Gujarat. A team of experts, including 
a marine ecologist, an architect, and a social worker, 
conducted a field visit to assess the region's biodiversity. 
This evaluation identified vulnerable species such as the 
Sarus Crane, Lesser Flamingo and Indian Flap Shell Turtle, 
highlighting the ecological importance of the area. As a 
result, the proposal for a Nature Interpretation Centre 
was put forward to educate the public, especially school 
students, about mangroves and their conservation.
Additionally, a pilot Nature Education Programme, Mud-
Flat Dhuleti, was organised in March 2025. The event 
offered 20 participants an immersive and experiential 
learning opportunity to explore the mangrove ecosystem, 
local biodiversity, and coastal life. The event raised 
₹14,500 in donations, supporting the region's ecotourism 
and biodiversity conservation efforts.
Solar Irrigation with Drip and Farm  
Pond for Water Conservation and 
Renewable Energy
Your Bank's commitment to sustainable farming practices 
is reflected in the support of the Solar Irrigation with Drip 
and Farm Pond project in Jambusar Taluka, Gujarat.  
As part of this initiative, 25 marginalised farmers 
were provided with solar-linked drip irrigation 
systems to enhance water conservation and improve 
agricultural productivity. 
The project, implemented through the VIKAS Centre 
for Development, included the establishment of two 
demonstration sites to demonstrate the system's 
effectiveness, with refinements incorporated to improve 
durability and ease of operation.
Solar-powered Streetlights
During FY25, your Bank contributed towards the 
installation of solar-powered high-mast streetlights 
in the vicinity of Vitthal Temple, Pandharpur, as part 
of its Climate Action Programme. This initiative will 
provide sustainable, renewable energy for the temple, 
enhancing lighting throughout the temple complex and 
its surrounding areas. 
The solar-powered streetlights will not only reduce 
the carbon footprint but also enhance safety and 
accessibility for the thousands of devotees and visitors 
who frequent the temple. Additionally, by using clean 
energy, the project will contribute to long-term cost 
savings and promote environmental awareness within 
the community. This initiative reflects your Bank's 
ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability and 
community well-being.

Stories of Transformation
Bandhan in Action: Lending 
Vision, Transforming Lives
Manjula 
Dairy and floral business owner
Manjula hails from a modest background, where daily life was a constant challenge. She lives 
with her husband, Ningappa, and their son. Until recently, the family’s only source of income 
came from a single cow, and though they owned a small piece of land, they lacked the capital to 
utilise it productively.
Everything began to change when Manjula learned about Bandhan Bank. Recognising an 
opportunity to improve her family’s livelihood, she approached Bandhan Bank for support. A 
year ago, she received her first loan of ₹1,70,000.
With careful planning and determination, Manjula and her husband used the funds to expand 
their dairy business by purchasing two additional cows. They also invested in their farmland to 
increase agricultural output. Within a year, their efforts started yielding results. The family’s 
income grew significantly, enabling them to lead a more secure and dignified life.
What began as a modest 1-acre plot soon transformed into a flourishing 2.5-acre stretch of 
growth and opportunity. The land was thoughtfully segmented. One portion now blooms with a 
variety of flowers, while another is solely dedicated to cultivating roses. To safeguard their crops, 
the family planted 50 coconut trees along the boundary, which have since created an additional 
stream of income.
Today, Manjula and her family are thriving. From once relying solely on dairy farming and 
struggling to make ends meet, they now earn over ₹1,00,000 every month from flower farming 
alone. Their dairy business continues to provide a steady and reliable income too.
With timely financial support from Bandhan Bank, the family has not only improved their 
standard of living but also expanded their livelihood with confidence. Manjula’s journey stands 
as a powerful testament to what determination, the right opportunities, and trusted support 
can achieve.

Biplab grew up in a modest mud house with his mother, Amina, and their family, where each day was 
a battle for survival. Their only asset was a tiny plot of land, barely enough to sustain them. Life was 
uncertain, and opportunities were few. But everything began to change when Bandhan Bank opened 
its first branch in their village.
With courage and unwavering hope, Amina approached Bandhan Bank for a loan of ₹5,000. It may 
have seemed like a small sum to many, but for their family, it was a lifeline and a chance to dream 
again. She invested the amount into farming, planting the first seeds of what would become a story 
of resilience and growth.
Over the years, with every loan repaid and every crop harvested, Amina continued to borrow and 
reinvest, slowly expanding the farm and laying the foundation for something greater. By her side 
stood her son, Biplab, who shared her vision and worked tirelessly to support her efforts.
Their big break came when they discovered the potential of rubber cultivation. Supported once 
again by Bandhan Bank, they turned fallow land into flourishing green stretches. What began as 
subsistence farming slowly transformed into a thriving agri-business. Today, they cultivate nearly 75 
kani, approximately 13,00,000 sq. ft., with over 3,000 rubber trees covering 50 kani, and the remaining 
used for mixed farming.
But Biplab was not content with mere cultivation – he envisioned something greater. With additional 
financial backing from Bandhan Bank, he established his first rubber processing unit, a move that 
significantly boosted their income and expanded their reach. As demand continued to rise, Biplab 
scaled the business further by setting up a second factory. His vision and drive transformed their family 
enterprise into a robust operation that added value at every step, from plantation to production.
Today, Biplab’s business stands as a thriving enterprise. His factories employ 14 permanent staff and 
10 seasonal workers, providing livelihoods to others in the community, something he once struggled 
to secure for himself.
Despite limited formal education, Biplab’s resolve, vision, and the unwavering support of his wife, 
who, alongside serving as a police officer, helps manage the paperwork and logistics, have propelled 
the business to new heights. Together, they are building a secure future for their children, ensuring 
access to quality education and a life of dignity.
From a humble ₹5,000 loan to business loans totalling nearly ₹20,00,000 the journey of Amina 
and Biplab is a powerful example of how access to finance, combined with determination and 
purpose, can transform lives. Their story reflects not just financial progress, but the enduring 
spirit of entrepreneurship and the belief that even the smallest beginning can lead to a future 
beyond imagination.

Hardeep and her husband once ran a modest furniture-making business from a small, rented 
room. With just one worker and limited means, they struggled to grow. Their monthly profit 
barely reached ₹25,000, and despite their hard work, they had little scope to expand. Life was 
tough, and the future felt uncertain.
It was during this time of challenge that Hardeep first heard about Bandhan Bank through a 
friend. Driven by hope and the desire to uplift their business, she and her husband approached 
Bandhan Bank to understand how a loan might help them move forward. That visit marked the 
beginning of a new chapter in their journey.
Around six years ago, Hardeep took her first group loan of ₹30,000. With thoughtful planning, 
they invested the money into their business. The results were encouraging, and over the next 
few years, they continued to take loans, each one used carefully to fuel their steady progress.
Their growth was remarkable. From just one worker, they expanded to a team of six. Their 
services grew beyond furniture-making to include interior design, attracting a wider clientele. 
As their earnings increased, they were able to move out of the cramped rented space and recently 
purchased a 3,000 sq. ft. flat, where they now plan to shift their entire business operations.
Alongside the family venture, Hardeep followed her own passion and opened a boutique, 
supported once again by a loan from Bandhan Bank. With hard work and consistent support, both 
businesses began to thrive. Their children are now enrolled in private English-medium schools, 
once a distant dream, now a reality.
Today, their businesses earn over ₹1,50,000 in monthly profit, a sixfold increase from where they 
began. More than just transforming Hardeep’s family, this success story has positively impacted 
others. Each of their employees now earns ₹12,000 per month, creating stable livelihoods for 
more families in their community.
Bandhan Bank’s support came at a time when it was needed most. For Hardeep and her family, 
it was not just about financial assistance, but about dignity, growth, and belief in their potential. 
Their journey reflects how consistent effort, guided by the right opportunities, can truly change 
the course of life.

accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies 
Act, the SEBI LODR and SEBI Guidance Note on Board 
Evaluation. In terms of the Board PE Policy, performance 
evaluation of the Board and its Committees, Chairman 
and individual Directors are done on various parameters. 
Parameters for the Board include various aspects, such as, 
structure, meetings, appointments, agenda, discussions, 
evaluation of risks, strategy, governance and compliance, 
conflict of interest, etc.
Parameters for Board Committees include various aspects, 
such as, meetings, effectiveness, agenda, discussion and

parameters include fulfilment of the independence criteria 
and their independence from the management.
The evaluation process has been carried out electronically. 
The Board of Directors have undertaken the evaluation of 
Independent Directors, excluding the Independent Director 
being evaluated. Similarly, Independent Directors have 
done the evaluation of the Board as whole, Non-Executive 
Chairman and Non-Independent Directors including the MD 
& CEO and Executive Directors. The members of respective

electronically for Directors, assessed the performance 
of the Directors including Chairman, Managing Director 
& CEO, Executive Directors, Board Level Committees and

evaluation to the NRC for reviewing the implementation 
of performance evaluation.
Based on the feedback from the performance evaluation 
process, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board discusses 
the same with respective Directors whereas the Lead 
Independent Director discusses the same with the Non-
Executive Chairman for necessary action. The Board 
evaluation provides inputs for optimising the roles and 
responsibilities, quality, quantity and timeliness of flow 
of information between the Bank’s management and the 
Board. The Directors have been discharging their roles and 
responsibilities as expected by the Board and as required 
under the applicable regulatory provisions. The Board 
continues to be duly constituted representing various 
expertise, skill sets, knowledge and qualification required 
for the banking business. There was no observation during 
the performance evaluation of the previous years; and so 
is the case with the current year.
In addition to internal evaluation, in terms of the Board 
PE Policy of the Bank and in order to have independent 
assessment, with the concurrence of the Board, the NRC 
has approved the engagement of the Indian Institute of 
Corporate Affairs (‘IICA’), an external agency, to conduct

Compliance and Audit
Your Bank has put in place extensive internal controls 
and processes that are commensurate with the size and 
scale of the Bank to mitigate Operational and other allied 
risks, including centralised operations and ‘segregation of 
duty’ between the front and back-office. The front office 
units usually act as customer touchpoints and sales and 
service outlets while the back-office carries out the entire 
processing, accounting and settlement of transactions in 
your Bank’s core banking system. The policy framework, 
definition and monitoring of limits is carried out by various 
mid-office and risk management functions.
Your Bank has set up various executive-level committees 
with participation from various business and control 
functions that are designed to review and oversee 
matters pertaining to capital, assets and liabilities, 
business practices and customer service, operational risk, 
information security, business continuity planning and 
internal risk-based supervision among others.
The second line of defence functions set standards and 
lay down policies and procedures by which the business 
functions manage risks, including compliance with 
applicable laws, compliance with regulatory guidelines, 
adherence to operational controls and relevant standards 
of conduct. At the ground level, your Bank has a mix of 
preventive and detective controls implemented through 
systems and processes, ensuring a robust framework in 
your Bank to enable correct and complete accounting, 
identification of outliers (if any) by the management 
on a timely basis for corrective action and mitigating 
operational risks.
Your Bank has a Compliance Department, which 
independently tracks, reviews and ensures compliance 
105

with regulatory guidelines and promotes a compliance 
culture in the Bank. The Compliance Department assists 
the Board and Top/ Senior Management in managing the 
compliance risk of your Bank. The Compliance Department 
ensures that overall business of your Bank is conducted in 
strict adherence to the guidelines issued by the RBI and 
other regulators, various statutory provisions, standards 
and codes prescribed by FEDAI, FIMMDA, etc., by evaluating 
the products/ processes, guiding business departments on 
the various regulatory guidelines with a special emphasis 
on better understanding of the perspective. It closely 
works with operational risk and internal audit functions 
and monitors various activities of your Bank with more 
emphasis on active risk management.
As the focal point of contact with the RBI and other 
regulatory entities, the Compliance Department evaluates 
the adequacy of internal controls and examines any 
systemic correction that is required, based on its analysis 
and interpretation of regulatory guidelines and deviations 
observed during monitoring and testing. Your Bank has 
a robust Anti Money Laundering (AML) framework and 
tools to manage the AML risk. It periodically apprises Top/ 
Senior Management, the ACB and the Board on compliance 
levels, based on the changes in the external regulatory 
environment. The Compliance Department submits the 
compliance report to the ACB at regular intervals providing 
the compliance status with the laws/rules and regulations 
applicable to your Bank.
Your Bank has an Internal Audit Department (‘IAD’) 
that acts as a third line of defence and is responsible for 
independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal controls, risk management, governance systems 
and processes and is manned by appropriately qualified and 
experienced personnel.
This department adopts a risk-based audit approach 
and carries out internal and concurrent audit of various 
functions in your Bank, in order to independently evaluate 
the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls 
on an ongoing basis and proactively recommending 
enhancements thereof. The IAD, during the course of 
audit, also ascertains the extent of adherence to regulatory 
guidelines, legal requirements and operational processes 
and provides timely feedback to the management for 
corrective actions. A strong oversight on the operations is 
also kept through off-site monitoring by use of data analytics 
and to detect outliers (if any) and alert the management for 
due corrective action, wherever warranted.
IAD further ensures that independent checks and balances 
are in place, and that laid down policies and procedures 
are followed and recommendations for improvements in 
processes and systems controls are suitably adhered to.
For review of effectiveness of controls, significant audit 
findings along with corrective and preventive action taken 
by your Bank are placed before the ACB periodically and 
directions, if any, given by the ACB are tracked closely for 
suitable closure in a time bound manner.
The Internal Audit team and the Compliance team undergo 
regular training both in-house and external to equip them 
with the necessary knowhow and expertise to carry out 
the function.
To maintain the independence of these departments, the 
performance evaluation of the Chief Compliance Officer 
(‘CCO’) and the Chief Audit Executive (‘CAE’) are carried out 
by the ACB. The Audit function is also subject to periodic 
external assurance reviews. Your Bank has always adhered 
to the highest standards of compliance and has put in 
place appropriate controls and risk measurement and risk 
management tools to ensure a robust compliance and 
governance structure.
Internal Financial Control
Your Bank also engages external auditors/ firms to carry 
out independent review of internal controls, processes, 
reporting, etc., and accordingly recommendations, if any, 
are made by them to your Bank/ the ACB for improvement. 
Considering the internal financial controls of the Bank, and 
the work performed by the auditors, including the audit of 
internal financial controls over financial reporting by the 
auditors and the reviews performed by management under 
the supervision of the ACB, the Board of Directors is of the 
opinion that the internal financial controls established and 
maintained by your Bank are adequate.

communities. Your Bank has policies and procedures to 
systematically measure, assess, monitor, and manage risks 
across all its portfolios.
Your Bank is committed to creating an environment of risk 
awareness at all levels. Your Bank’s view on risk is dynamic 
and it aims at constantly upgrading controls and security 
measures, including cyber security measures, to avoid or 
mitigate various risks. The ability to manage risk is strongly 
supported by a strong risk conduct and risk aware culture. 
Further, Risk transparency is fostered through reporting, 
disclosure, sharing of information and open dialogue on the 
risks arising from various activities across the Bank.
Your Bank has an independent Risk Governance Structure, 
which is in line with industry best practices, that has been 
put in place to separate duties and ensure the independence 
of Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Control functions. 
This framework visualises the empowerment of Business 
Units at the operating level, with technology being the key 
driver, enabling the identification and management of risk 
at the place of origination. Your Bank’s Risk Management 
Department is responsible for setting up the appropriate 
112
Annual Report 2024-25
risk control mechanism to quantify and monitor risks in 
timely manner.
Risk Appetite
To address various risks that your Bank faces in its business, 
it has established a risk appetite framework which 
defines the levels and types of risk that are acceptable 
and within its defined risk capacity. The framework is 
defined with the goal of aligning risk taking with your 
Bank’s strategy, business and capital plans. Furthermore, 
risk-specific policies, limits and triggers are implemented 
to  operationalise the appetites at enterprise level for 
enabling effective monitoring and providing cushion for 
initiating a timely risk mitigation plan.
The risk appetite framework is approved on an annual 
basis and is a pre-cursor to the strategy of your Bank. A 
comprehensive dashboard that shows all the risks that your 
Bank carries at any given time is provided by the Risk Profile, 
which is a component of the Risk Appetite Framework. It 
links goals and priorities to risk management in a way that 
empowers employees to serve customers well and meet 
financial targets. Your Bank has a quarterly risk appetite and 
annual risk appetite with defined quarterly glidepath for 
effective monitoring along with a well-defined Governance 
framework for better efficacy.
Risk Culture
Risk culture is a set of norms, and behaviours related to 
awareness, management, and controls of risks. In your Bank, 
risk culture is at the centre of both the risk management 
framework and risk management practice. The desired risk 
culture behaviours are aligned to your Bank’s core values 
thus forming an effective basis for risk culture since these 
are used for performance management, recruitment, 
and development.
The Board and Senior Management sets the “tone at the 
top” and has a trickle-down effect on all employees. Thus, 
it supports a strong culture, which is defined by your Bank’s 
expectations, thereby guiding how employees conduct 
themselves, work with colleagues, and make decisions. 
Your Bank has a well-defined Whistle Blower Policy in place.
As part of its awareness campaigns, your Bank circulates 
and promotes information security awareness contents 
and materials through several mediums (SMS, Email,

employees, customers, and vendors. Your Bank educates 
its staff on risk management through periodic newsletters, 
circulars, floor-level awareness seminars, trainings, 
workshops, and innovative desktop screensavers.
Stress Testing
Your Bank recognises the importance of stress testing as an 
integral risk management tool. Your Bank’s Stress testing 
includes Scenario testing, which examines the impact of a 
hypothetical future state to define changes in risk factors 
as also Sensitivity testing, which examines the impact 
of an incremental change to one or more risk factors. In 
addition to standard stress scenarios, your Bank conducts 
stress testing based on various themes driven by climate, 
macroeconomic, etc. Your Bank carries out reverse stress 
testing, in order to identify circumstances that may lead to 
specific, defined outcomes.
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(‘ICAAP’)
Your Bank conducts a comprehensive ICAAP exercise on 
a yearly basis with respect to the adequacy of Capital 
under normal and stressed conditions. The examination of 
capital requirements under normal economic and adverse 
market conditions enables your Bank to determine whether 
its projected business performance meets internal and 
regulatory capital requirements. The assessment is to 
identify, assess, and manage all risks that could potentially 
have a significant negative impact on its business, financial 
position, or capital adequacy.
The ICAAP comprises of a point-in-time assessment of 
exposures and risks at the end of the FY, along with a 
forward-looking stress capital assessment. Your Bank 
also conducts back-testing assessments as part of ICAAP 
process to assess its stress scenarios.
Risk Management Framework
Your Bank’s Risk Management Framework sets forth the 
core principles on how it seeks to manage and govern 
the risk. Your Bank’s comprehensive risk management 
is overseen by its Board of Directors who has the overall 
responsibility for your Bank‘s Risk Management, including 
culture and governance framework. The Risk Management 
Committee of the Board (‘RMCB’) assists the Board in 
discharging these responsibilities effectively. The RMCB 
annually reviews and approves your Bank’s risk management 
framework. The RMCB plays a crucial role in guiding the 
development of policies, procedures, and systems, and 
continuously evaluates their suitability and relevance to 
the evolving business landscape. The RMCB also oversees 
the Risk Management Department (‘RMD’) and the Chief 
Risk Officer (‘CRO’) reports functionally to the RMCB. The 
RMCB meets the CRO on one-to-one basis, without the 
presence of the Whole-time Directors including MD&CEO, 
on quarterly basis.
Major Risks
Your Bank’s risk management approach is to ensure that 
major risks and emerging risks, as they evolve, are identified, 
managed, and incorporated into its existing risk management 
assessment, measurement, monitoring and escalation 
processes. By adhering to these protocols, management 
can be sure of growing the business in a risk-controlled 
manner and fulfilling their ongoing responsibilities for risk 
supervision. The Board and senior management deliberate 
top and emerging risks on a regular basis.

Information Security and Cyber Risks
Cyber security in banks has gained paramount importance, 
as banks are investing extensively in IT platforms enabling 
them to move towards digitisation, enhance customer 
experience, reduction of transaction cost, compete 
with peers etc. Across banks in India, large amounts of 
confidential data reside in bank’s Data Centres and flows 
through bank’s servers and various networks and devices.

your Bank and its customers, either in rest or in motion, 
and to ensure continuity of business, your Bank has policies 
and frameworks in place for Information security and 
Cyber risks.
Banks are exposed and susceptible to various types of 
cybercrime. Cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated 
and organised and they are continuously carrying attacks 
in volume, frequency, and severity. Malware perpetrators 
are inventing and inflicting various types of malware 
attacks. Distributed Denial of Service (‘DDOS’) activity is 
ever-increasing and evolving as they are using Internet of 
Things (‘IOT’) devices as platform to conduct such attacks. 
Your Bank has not experienced any material loss relating to 
these or other types of cyber-attacks.

third-party service providers for delivering banking operations 
for your Bank, which would be undertaken by it in future, 
with risk factors including service failures, data breaches,

identifies these risks by evaluating outsourced functions and 
vendor reliability at the time of empanelment by assessing 
risk through due diligence and compliance reviews, and 
monitoring performance via regular reviews and audits. 
Your Bank has implemented comprehensive outsourcing risk 
management framework with roles and responsibilities for 
identification, measurement, mitigation, management, and 
reporting of risks associated with Outsourcing activities.
Market Risk

and measuring risks, control measures, monitoring, and 
reporting systems. Your Bank actively manages Market risk, 
which is the risk of possible economic loss from adverse 
changes in market risk factors, such as, interest rates, credit 
spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity 
prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty 
exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk, 
and market liquidity risk. Value at Risk (VaR) is a tool for 
monitoring risk in your Bank’s trading portfolio and is used 
for estimating the potential loss from adverse movements 
in the financial markets.
Regulatory Risk
Your Bank recognises the utmost importance of regulatory 
risk. It closely monitors changes in the regulatory landscape 
and assesses how new regulations might affect its 
business and strategy. In order to take proactive steps to

stakeholders, and the trust and loyalty they place in it is 
core to its purpose as a financial services organisation.

competitive environment as well as any emerging risks, 
which may derail the overall Strategic pursuit so that 
suitable risk mitigation measures are timely taken. As 
part of strategic risk assessments, your Bank conducts

vs. Estimated) basis and assessments are presented to the 
RMCB. Your Bank has a robust Business Risk Management 
Framework in place, which involves monitoring actionable 
metrics, including various financial indicators, as well as

Separation of office of the Chairman and the 
Managing Director & CEO
In terms of the provisions of the BR Act, the Companies 
Act and the SEBI LODR, your Bank has separate offices 
for the Chairman and the MD&CEO. Your Bank has a Non-
Executive (Independent) Chairman and an MD&CEO, 
and the appointments of both have been approved by 
the RBI, pursuant to the provisions of the BR Act. The 
Chairman provides overall direction and guidance to the 
Board whereas the MD&CEO is responsible for the overall 
management of the Bank.
The operational and functional heads of your Bank, 
together with the two Executive Directors, plays a 
pivotal role in supporting the MD&CEO in the day-to-day 
functioning, execution, and strategic operations of your 
Bank. This collaborative leadership structure ensures 
seamless coordination across business units, effective 
implementation of strategic initiatives, and robust 
operational governance.
Responsibilities of the Board
The responsibilities of the Board, inter alia, include overseeing 
the functioning of the Bank, financial performance of the 
Bank, monitoring legal & statutory compliance, reviewing

Accordingly, the Board deliberates on matters, such 
as, business strategy, risks, financial results, succession 
planning, compliance, customer service, financial inclusion, 
information technology and human resources in line with 
the seven critical themes prescribed by the RBI and such 
other matters as may be deemed appropriate. The Board 
spends considerable time perusing the information shared 
with them, which facilitates informed decision-making and 
effective participation at its meetings, leading to board 
effectiveness. The Board oversees the actions and results 
of the management to ensure that the long-term objectives 
of enhancing the shareholders’ value is achieved. The Board

Corporate Governance practices, providing strategic 
direction and functioning of the Bank. Notice and agenda 
papers are circulated to the Directors, in advance, before

meaningful and focused discussions at the meetings. All

17(7) of the SEBI LODR, read with Part A of Schedule 
II thereto, are regularly placed before the Board. The

exigency(ies) or urgency(ies), in compliance with Section 
175 of the Companies Act, proposals are approved by 
passing resolutions through circulation, which are placed

Performance Evaluation Criteria for 
Independent Directors
The performance evaluation of Independent Directors 
is conducted in terms of the provisions of ‘Performance 
Evaluation Policy for the Board, Committees, Non-
independent / Whole-time Directors and Independent 
Directors’ (the ‘Board PE Policy’) as recommended by the 
NRC and approved by the Board, pursuant to the relevant 
provisions of the Companies Act, the SEBI LODR and SEBI 
Guidance Note on Board Evaluation. In terms of the Board 
PE Policy, an indicative list of factors on which evaluation 
of the Independent Directors was carried out includes 
commitment, contribution, competency, attendance, 
initiative, teamwork, communication, adherence to 
code of conduct, corporate governance, fulfilment of 
the independence criteria and their independence from 
the Management. Further details of the evaluation on 
Independent Directors are provided in the Board’s Report.
Policy on Appointment of Directors
Your Bank has in place a ‘Policy on Appointment and Fit 
& Proper Criteria for Directors’. This Policy lays down the 
criteria for identification of persons who are qualified 
and ‘fit and proper’ to become Directors on the Board, 
such as, academic qualifications, special knowledge 
or practical experience, competence, track record, 
integrity, etc., which shall be considered by the NRC 
while recommending appointment/re-appointment of a 
Director. The Policy is available on the website of the Bank 
at https://bandhanbank.com/pdfViewerJS/index.html#../
sites/default/files/2025-01/Policy-on-Appointment-and-
Fit-Proper-Criteria-for-Directors.pdf. This Policy is guided 
by the provisions of the BR Act and the rules framed 
thereunder, the Companies Act and the SEBI LODR and the 
circulars or guidelines issued by the RBI, from time to time, 
in this regard. While appointing a Director on its Board, your 
Bank follows the direction(s) of the RBI with regard to ‘fit 
and proper’ criteria, as applicable to private sector banks, 
and obtains the ‘Declaration and Undertaking’ from the 
candidate and executes Deed of Covenants, which includes 
the requirement for Directors to discharge their duties and 
responsibilities to the best of their abilities, individually and 
collectively. The NRC ascertains the fit and proper status 
of the candidate for the office of director, fulfilment 
of criteria of independence as prescribed under the 
Companies Act and the SEBI LODR in case of independent 
directors, and thereafter, recommends their appointment/
reappointment to the Board for approval. The Board also 
ensures that the Directors have the requisite skill sets, 
practical experience, special knowledge required for the 
banking business and as prescribed under Section 10A(2)
(a) of the BR Act. The Board is duly constituted, including 
gender diversity. The appointments of the Chairman, the 
Managing Director and Executive Director(s) on the Board 
are made with the prior approval of the RBI. The Board also 
takes into account the outcome of performance evaluation 
while considering the re-appointment/continuation of 
appointment of Independent Directors.
The NRC evaluates whether the members of the Board, 
excluding NRC members, adhere to the ‘fit and proper’ 
criteria as prescribed by the RBI and the adherence to 
the ‘fit and proper’ criteria by the members of the NRC is 
evaluated by the Board of Directors annually, in addition 
to evaluation of fit and proper status at the time of 
appointment/re-appointment of Directors.
Remuneration Policy
Your Bank has formulated and adopted a Compensation 
Policy for Directors, KMP and Employees of the Bank, in 
terms of Section 178 of the Companies Act, read with the 
relevant Rules made thereunder, Regulation 19 of the 
SEBI LODR and the Guidelines or Circulars or directions 
issued by the RBI, in this regard, from time to time. Your 
Bank’s Compensation Policy is aligned to its business 
strategy, market dynamics, internal characteristics and 
complexities within the Bank. Your Bank‘s remuneration 
framework aims to attract, motivate and retain people 
with the requisite skills, experience and ability to deliver 
its strategy; create an alignment and balance between the 
rewards and risk exposure of shareholders and interests 
of employees; promote responsible growth and create 
long term sustainable shareholders’ value consistent 
with strategic goals and appropriate risk management; 
reinforce behaviour consistent with its values, principles 
and objectives, and support appropriate conduct and 
meritocratic culture through differentiated performance 
rewards. The Compensation Policy of your Bank is reviewed 
by the NRC and the Board on an annual basis to align the 
provisions with regulatory changes as well as to meet the 
organisational requirements. The Compensation Policy 
of your Bank was reviewed by the Board during the year 
and one change was made relating to receipt of unvested 
deferred variable pay, post-retirement of an employee. 
The updated Policy is available on the website of the Bank 
at https://bandhanbank.com/pdfViewerJS/index.html#../

Management Discussion & Analysis Report
A.	 Global and Indian Economic Scenario
	
Global economy – slow recovery amid 
heightened uncertainty
The global landscape over the past year has remained 
fluid, shaped by geopolitical tensions, uneven inflation, 
varied market sentiments across the globe, and policy 
related uncertainties. According to the International 
Monetary Fund (‘IMF’), global GDP growth is projected 
at 2.8 percent for 2025, lower than the previous year’s 
projection of 3.3 per cent.1, and is expected to remain 
rangebound for the foreseeable future, signalling a 
slow and steady recovery.
Regional divergences in inflation have become 
prominent over the past year. While United States’s 
(‘US’) core inflation was forecasted at 2.8 per cent.2 
for 2025, a rise of 30 bps from previous forecast due 
to recent changes in the tariff landscape, Eurozone’s 
inflation has eased out3 and is expected to stabilise.
While US exhibited resiliency in its growth story, China, 
traditionally a growth engine, experienced hiccups due 
to internal structural challenges such as a declining 
workforce and a real estate slump. China’s GDP 
estimates were revised downwards to 4.0 per cent4, 
for both – 2025 and 2026 – from previous projections 
of 4.6 percent and 4.5 percent for 2025 and 20265, 
respectively. Additionally, Eurozone’s growth forecast 
at 0.8 per cent6. in 2025 faced challenges from 
uncertain global trade policies. Similarly, emerging 
economies have also experienced downgrades due to 
intensifying downside risks such as currency volatility, 
geopolitical risks, among others. India, while remaining 
a major growth driver globally, also hit a four-year low 
of 6.5 per cent growth in FY 2024-25, slowed down 
from 9.2 per cent.7, growth recorded in FY 2023-24.
Global economic and trade policies are in a period of 
transition, shaped by competing priorities: national 
security vs. globalisation, sustainability vs. growth, 
and inflation control vs. economic stimulus. The 
trajectory of global growth in the coming years will 
depend on how effectively policymakers balance 
these competing priorities. Economies are increasingly 
expected to realign themselves towards bilateral 
treaties from multilateral arrangements to balance 
growth objectives and policy uncertainties.
In addition, driven by Artificial intelligence (‘AI’), 
global technology landscape has undergone a tectonic 
shift. Advancements in AI, quantum computing and 
the rise of decentralised technologies have created 
a new digital paradigm that is redefining industries, 
economies, and societies at an unprecedented pace. 
Large scale adoption of Generative AI, in particular, is 
reshaping how businesses operate and differentiate 
themselves. As innovation cycles shorten and 
disruption becomes the norm, economies that identify 
and adopt these emerging technologies early, are 
expected to be at the centre of global influence.
	
Climate change poses significant threats to the 
global economy, with major institutions highlighting 
escalating risks. The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (‘OECD’) warned 
that without intensified climate action, global GDP 
could decline by up to 4 per cent. annually by 2100 
due to sea-level rise and extreme weather events. 
The World Bank highlighted that 1.2 billion people 
are at high risk from climate hazards. Collectively, 
these findings underscore the urgent need for 
coordinated global action to mitigate climate risks 
and invest in adaptation strategies to safeguard 
economic stability.
	
Indian economy – continues to remain steady 
amid heightened uncertainty elsewhere
	
India's economy has demonstrated resilience amid 
global uncertainties and is expected to maintain 
steady growth in the future. As per the recent 
estimates, India’s GDP growth for FY 2024-25 was at 
6.5 per cent. with Q4 FY 2024-25 exhibiting a growth 
of 7.4 per cent8. amid global uncertainties. The steady 
growth has been supported by robust domestic 
consumption, industrial activity, rural demand and 
government spending.
	
Consumer price index (‘CPI’) inflation is expected to 
moderate from 4.9 per cent9., in FY 2024-25 to below 
4.5 per cent. over the next year, aided by prudent 
monetary policy. Favourable monsoon forecasts, 
better kharif sowing and healthy reservoir levels are 
expected to boost agricultural output and stabilise 
inflation further.

Annual Report 2024-25
Despite external challenges, India's macroeconomic 
fundamentals 
remain 
strong. 
Government 
infrastructure spending and a robust services sector 
continue to underpin economic stability, positioning 
India favourably compared to other major economies.
Rural sector rebounds after a period 
of softness
India’s rural economy rebounded in FY 2024-25, with 
agricultural growth estimated at 4.6 per cent., up 
from 2.7 per cent.10, in previous year, and is expected 
to exhibit similar growth in the coming year, aided by 
above-average monsoon forecasts and increased rural 
spending. Rural consumption has recovered from the 
Covid shock and is likely to stay resilient due to wage 
growth and subsequently the rising demand. Rural 
wage growth, adjusted for inflation, is at its highest 
in the past few years. Being the largest contributor to 
the overall consumption, rural sector continues to play 
pivotal role in India’s economic growth story.
Consumption 
and 
investments 
remained steady
India's economy has maintained steady consumption 
and investment levels in FY 2024-25, as estimated during 
the year showing economic resiliency. Private final 
consumption expenditure accounts for 56.5 per cent. 
of GDP, while gross fixed capital formation contributes 
33.7 per cent.11, reflecting robust domestic demand 
and investment activity. Additionally, the Government's 
capital expenditure is set at a record ₹11.21 lakh crore12, 
for FY 2025-26, underscoring a strong commitment to 
consumption growth and infrastructure development.
B.	 Indian Banking Sector:  
Key Developments
	
Indian Banking Sector: Robust and healthy
	
During FY 2024-25, deposits grew at 10.7 percent. year-
on-year, tad behind the credit offtake which grew at 
11 per cent. The gap between yearly growth of credit 
and deposits in a financial year narrowed down from 
approx. 340 bps in FY 2023-24 to 30 bps in FY 2024-
25. Consequently, the credit-to-deposit (‘CD’) ratio 
remained elevated above 80 per cent. from 79.7 per 
cent. in the previous year for all Scheduled Commercial 
Banks ('SCB')13.
	
Overall credit growth decelerated in FY 2024-25 as 
compared to the previous year. The growth drivers 
in the credit changed from previous year with loans 
to medium industries growing at the highest rate, 
followed by micro & small14 :
a.	
Personal Loans (Retail Loans incl. Housing Loans) 
growth decelerated to 14.0 per cent. in the 
FY 2024-25 from 17.6 per cent. in the previous 
financial year, due to concerns of over-leveraging 
in unsecured lending i.e. Other Personal Loans, 
Credit Cards, Education Loans and Consumer 
Durables. On the other hand, growth in secured 
personals loans i.e., Housing and Gold Loans 
remained robust at 15.3 per cent. and 103.5 per 
cent., respectively against 17.1 per cent. and 14.8 
per cent., respectively in the previous year.
b.	
Credit growth to services sector fell to 13.4 
per cent. in FY 2024-25 from 20.8 per cent. in 
the previous year, due to drag in the credit to 
Commercial Real Estates, NBFCs and Aviation.
c.	
Credit to Agriculture and allied activities halved 
in the FY 2024-25 from previous year.
d.	
Industry credit growth remained consistent at 8.0 
per cent., in FY 2024-25. Credit growth to micro 
and small industries decelerated to 9.0 per cent. 
while credit to medium industries accelerated to 
18.6 per cent. and remained at constant level for 
large industries at 6.2 per cent.

in March 2025 whereas the Net Non-Performing 
Assets (‘NNPA’) improved to 0.5 per cent.
f.	
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (‘LCR’) was 
comfortably at 132.6 per cent. as on March 2025 
above minimum requirement of 100 per cent. 
across bank groups. It was the highest among 
foreign banks followed by public sector banks and 
private banks.

Potential threats
Cybersecurity and Digital Fraud – The cybersecurity 
threats are evolving, driven by rapid technological 
change and increasing sophistication of the 
participants. Simple phishing attacks are now evolving 
into highly coordinated attacks involving deepfakes 
and AI, among others. At the same time, the growing 
sophistication of AI-driven fraud and cyberattacks 
exposes vulnerabilities in banks’ traditional security 
frameworks. The targets broadened from only 
customers previously to also include banking 
infrastructure and digital channels now, leading to 
financial and reputational risks. Banks, thus need to 
invest in advanced security measures and collaborate 
with regulatory bodies to strengthen their cyber 
defences and protect against these evolving threats.
Credit Risk and Household Debt – The surge in 
unsecured lending and the delinquencies in the 
segment raised concerns about borrowers' repayment 
capacities. RBI’s intervention to increase the risk 
weight of the unsecured loans hints at the wider 
concern. Banks need to closely monitor credit risk 
and implement stricter lending criteria to mitigate 
potential defaults and maintain financial stability 
within the sector.
Disruptive Technologies – The rapid evolution of AI 
and Machine Learning (‘ML’) is fundamentally altering 
the financial services landscape, posing a significant 
threat to traditional banking. These technologies 
enable new entrants—often leaner, digital-native, 
and more agile—to deliver financial products 
with unprecedented speed, personalisation, and 
efficiency. As customer expectations shift towards 
real-time, intuitive services, conventional banks risk 
falling behind due to legacy infrastructure, rigid 
processes, and slower innovation cycles. Traditional 
banks need to adapt quickly and redefine their role in 
a tech-first financial environment to avoid the risk of 
losing control.
Climate Risks – Events related to climate change 
are no longer isolated. Rather, they have increasingly 
become a systemic threat to the stability and 
resiliency of the banking industry. These pose threat 
to the borrowers’ credit worthiness, which puts 
pressure on banks’ asset quality and provisioning 
norms. Banks with high exposure to carbon-intensive 
industries may suffer from loss of asset value and 
credit related challenges. Additionally, regulatory 
push towards climate-related financial disclosures and 
ESG integration may add to the operational cost for 
banks in the near term. It is thus imperative for banks 
to integrate climate resilience into their strategy, 
underwriting, and governance practices to maintain 
sustainable business operations.
Absence of Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) 
initiatives – The banking sector, while showing 
progress in DEI initiatives, still lags in equitable 
representation of communities and genders. Lack of 
diversity may result in homogeneous decision-making, 
limiting the industry's ability to innovate and respond 
effectively to rapidly evolving business environment. 
Failure to do so could result in a loss of competitive 
advantage, talent attrition, and diminished trust 
among increasingly socially conscious consumers.

Overview

Statements
Dear Shareholders,
It is with great pride and purpose that we are presenting 
the third edition of your Bank’s Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the Financial Year 2024–25. 
This report reaffirms our ongoing commitment to driving 
long-term value creation for all stakeholders through 
ethical governance, inclusive growth, and sustainable 
environmental management. Since inception, your Bank 
has remained rooted in its mission of delivering innovative, 
inclusive, and customer-centric banking solutions.
Your Bank’s performance during the year reflects 
the strength of its sustainable and balanced growth 
strategy, supported by robust governance, prudent risk 
management, and the continued trust of its stakeholders. 
The total deposits stood at ₹1.51 Lakh crore, with over 
12 percent YoY growth whereas, advances (Net) reached 
1.37 Lakh crore, with over 10 percent YoY growth.
As environmental and social challenges intensify globally, 
we believe that while adherence to regulatory requirements 
is essential, businesses must also actively foster meaningful 
change beyond compliance. Your Bank has taken significant 
steps to reduce its ecological footprint while embracing a 
future-ready, digital-first banking model.
Leveraging advanced technologies such as Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Analytics, 
your Bank is designing products and services that respond 
to the evolving needs of customers. To institutionalise this 
transformation, a dedicated Transformation Management 
Team has been established to drive innovation and 
efficiency. In parallel, the Digital & Transaction Excellence 
Unit is focused on enhancing transaction banking and 
elevating the overall digital experience.
Through sustained digitalisation, we have significantly 
reduced paper usage, improved energy efficiency, and 
minimised operational waste. This strategic shift is reflected 
in key achievements—93% of savings accounts were 
opened digitally, 98% of retail transactions were conducted 
through digital platforms, and digital deposit volumes grew 
by 99% year-on-year. These milestones represent a decisive 
move toward a low-carbon, tech-enabled operating model 
and contribute meaningfully to India’s net-zero ambitions.
Beyond internal efficiencies, we have implemented on-
ground environmental initiatives to promote ecosystem 
regeneration and climate resilience. To date, we have planted 
over 4.34 lakh saplings and constructed 72 water harvesting 
structures. These initiatives have led to the sequestration 
of CO2 and rainwater harvesting that partially offsets the 
carbon footprint and water consumption of your Bank.
Message from the MD&CEO on Sustainability
In line with our commitment to clean energy, climate 
resilience, and rural empowerment, the Bank has 
implemented targeted solar initiatives that deliver 
tangible environmental and socio-economic benefits. 
Your Bank installed high-mast solar lighting systems in 
Pandharpur and provided solar-powered irrigation pumps 
equipped with drip systems to tribal farmers in Gujarat. 
These interventions have not only strengthened rural 
infrastructure and improved agricultural productivity but 
also achieved a remarkable 90%+ reduction in water usage. 
These efforts are focused on promoting decentralised 
renewable energy solutions in underserved and energy-
deficient geographies, helping bridge infrastructure gaps 
while fostering community resilience.
We recognise that responsible capital allocation is a 
powerful lever for sustainable development. As part of 
our commitment to aligning our portfolio with global 
climate targets, we have adopted a disciplined approach 
to managing financed emissions. Our credit exposure to 
carbon-intensive sectors such as mining, petroleum, and coal 
has been consciously limited to just 0.12%. Simultaneously, 
we are promoting the clean energy transition by allocating 
4% of our outstanding credit portfolio to renewable energy 
projects, predominantly solar. This strategy of divesting 
from carbon-heavy industries while scaling up investments 
in green energy not only aligns our portfolio with evolving 
regulatory expectations and climate commitments but also 
strengthens our resilience against long-term environmental 
and reputational risks. These choices reflect a risk-aware 
financing strategy that supports India’s green growth 
agenda while safeguarding our portfolio against climate-
related risks.
Guided by the principle of “Aapka Bhala, Sabki Bhalai,” your 
Bank remains deeply committed to the collective well-
being of its stakeholders and the broader mission of social 
upliftment across India. With a customer base of 31.6 million 
and a network of 6,309 banking outlets, predominantly in 
underserved semi-urban and rural areas, Bandhan Bank 
is a leader in driving financial inclusion at scale. Through 
our flagship women-centric group loan model (EEB), we 
serve 13.2 million active women customers, who account 
for 26.2% of our overall portfolio—the highest proportion 
among Indian banks.
Our CSR programmes are designed to deliver holistic 
and measurable impact. In FY 2024-25, these initiatives 
reached 25.81 lakh families through strategic interventions 
in health, education, skill development, financial literacy, 
business incubation, and climate action, all mapped to the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). 
Annex 6

Annual Report 2024-25
Notably, 2.0 million women benefited from our community 
initiatives this year—1.3 million through healthcare services 
and 0.6 million through financial literacy programmes.
A signature programme, Targeting the Hard-core Poor 
(THP), enabled the upliftment of 52,932 ultra-poor, women-
led households, empowering them to achieve economic 
self-reliance. Additionally, we supported over 2,000 farmers 
in adopting climate-smart agriculture, strengthening their 
adaptive capacity against climate variability. To nurture 
India’s future workforce, we provided free supplementary 
education to more than 0.1 million children and delivered 
skill training to over 19,000 youth, 68% of whom secured 
employment across diverse sectors.
Internally, our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Policy 
continues to foster a workplace culture anchored in fairness, 
opportunity, and representation. We remain committed to 
building an inclusive organisation that reflects the diverse 
communities we serve.
Governance continues to be at the heart of your Bank’s 
operations. Since inception, your Bank has upheld the 
highest standards of corporate governance, led by a Board 
comprising a majority of Independent Directors and a clear 
demarcation of responsibilities between the Non-Executive 
Chairman and the Managing Director & CEO. This structure 
ensures effective checks and balances, independent 
oversight, and strategic accountability.
Our governance framework is anchored in a strong risk 
management architecture, well-defined compliance 
protocols, and a zero-tolerance stance toward unethical 
practices. Under the leadership of your Bank’s core 
management team, our 75,032 employees remain 
dedicated to upholding the highest standards of integrity 
and accountability, delivering banking services through a 
balanced “High-tech and High-touch” approach.
In an increasingly digital financial environment, we are 
investing significantly in cybersecurity infrastructure and 
digital risk mitigation systems. Guided by a clear roadmap 
that embeds risk management and compliance into every 
facet of our operations, we remain optimistic about 
unlocking greater value for all our stakeholders.
Transparency and stakeholder engagement are integral to 
our ethos. We communicate proactively through multiple 
channels and ensure compliance with all disclosure 
norms. Our ESG practices are codified in a comprehensive 
compendium of Board-approved BRSR policies, which 
guide our conduct across all verticals and geographies.
The Bank’s performance in FY 2024-25 reflects the strength 
of its integrated sustainability strategy. Total deposits rose 
by over 12% to ₹1.51 lakh crore, while net advances grew 
by over 10% to ₹1.37 lakh crore. These figures validate the 
trust placed in us by millions of customers, investors, and 
partners—and reaffirm our ability to grow responsibly 
and sustainably.
As we look to the future, Bandhan Bank remains resolute 
in its commitment to delivering financial services that 
are not only inclusive and innovative but also aligned 
with the imperatives of sustainability and social good. 
Our leadership is dedicated to responsible growth, 
promoting environmental responsibility, and empowering 
communities. Our strategic focus on green financing, clean 
energy, and social upliftment reflects our long-term vision of 
driving India’s transformation into a resilient, equitable, and 
climate-conscious economy. With the continued trust and 
support of our stakeholders, we will remain steadfast in our 
mission to create lasting value, foster inclusive prosperity, 
and contribute meaningfully to a sustainable future.
We thank all our stakeholders for their unwavering trust 
and partnership. Together, we will continue to chart a path 
of responsible growth and shared prosperity.
Warm regards,

26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
	
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining 
to environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, 
rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk, along with its financial 
implications, as per the following format:
Materiality assessment is the process of determining topics (issues) that can impact economic, environmental, 
social and governance attributes in banking operations. It has the potential to influence the decisions of 
stakeholders, who are willing to partner like customers, shareholders, lenders and investors. The preliminary 
step in materiality assessment is to identify and consult with the right set of stakeholders (or representatives) 
who can provide useful insights. The materiality assessment process includes –
a)	
Identification of sector-specific material topics: The process involves identifying relevant peer 
companies across the banking sector and mapping standards like the Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’), 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (‘UN SDGs’), International Integrated Reporting Council 
(‘IIRC’) requirements, to understand the appropriate material topics.
b)	
Identification of external stakeholders: The Bank assesses the impact of its banking operations on its 
investors, customers, employees, community, regulatory bodies, value chain partners, media, civil and 
societies to evaluate ways to further improve stakeholder value creation.
c)	
External stakeholder consultation: The Bank liaisons with external stakeholders and seeks their 
perception and comments on the identified material topics. Such material topics are further prioritised 
basis of the importance they hold to each stakeholder group and their feedback.
d)	
Prioritisation of material topics relevant to the Bank: External stakeholder responses are first assessed 
and collated. The collated material topics are categorised into low, medium and high categories and 
finally, the materiality map is finalised post consultation with the decision-making committee and senior 
leadership team.
The Bank remains committed to implementing relevant policies to ensure responsible banking conduct and 
undertake required sustainability initiatives. Based on the prioritised material topics, the Bank has identified 
relevant risks and opportunities that are mentioned below. This report includes information, which is material to 
all stakeholders of the Bank, and it presents an overview of the Bank’s businesses and associated activities. The 
Bank discloses matters that substantially impact or affect the Bank’s ability to create value. To ensure effective 
mitigation of identified risks, the Bank carries out a materiality analysis, to identify topics material to the Bank 
and its stakeholders. The sensitivity of an issue to stakeholders and the Bank, in terms of importance, forms 
the basis of the materiality analysis, which in turn guides the processes for identifying, managing, and devising 
specific action plans for addressing these material aspects. Every material topic is taken into account, and the 
Bank has policies and procedures in place to address these topics in order to create sustainable growth and 
long-term value.

Climate Change-
Related Risks
Risk
•	
Climate-related risks refer to the potential risks 
that may arise from climate change or from efforts 
to mitigate climate change, its impact and the 
economic and financial consequences.
•	
It can impact the financial sector through two 
broad channels - physical risks and transition risks.
•	
Physical Risk: The physical impacts from climate 
change will feed through to an economy in various 
ways, including damages to physical assets 
through extreme weather, reduced agricultural 
productivity, heat-related health and medical 
issues, and loss of biodiversity.
•	
Transition Risk: It refers to the risks arising from 
the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon 
economy. A range of factors influences this 
adjustment, including changes in climate-related 
policies and regulations, the emergence of newer 
technologies, shifting sentiments and behaviour of 
customers. The process of transition, i.e., reducing 
carbon emissions may have a significant impact on 
the economy.
•	
The uncertainty about the timing and severity of 
climate-related risks like physical risk and transition 
risk threatens the safety, soundness and resilience 
of regulated entities (REs) and in turn, it affects the 
overall stability of the financial system.
•	
Financial, reputational, regulatory and market 
risk implications are becoming increasingly 
prominent with increased threats of climate 
change such as but not limited to floods, droughts, 
erratic rainfall, supply chain disruptions, change 
in market perception and shift towards more 
environmentally friendly products and services.
•	
The Bank has a robust governance structure to 
develop climate-related risk mitigation strategies, 
ensure effective implementation of the identified 
levers and monitor performance against such risks 
at regular intervals.
•	
The Bank ensures that climate-related risks like 
floods, cyclones and external rating impact on 
industries with CO2 emissions are properly reflected 
in the Bank's short-term and long-term capital 
planning under the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP)* through stress testing 
and impact analysis.
	
*(ICAAP under BASEL accord – a mechanism to 
ensure the institution's strategic focus, business 
plan and internal procedures for ensuring adequate 
possession of long-term capital resources to cover 
all material risks.)
•	
The Bank is deliberating to embark on a journey 
of advocating sustainability in its value chain, such 
as assessment of the GHG emission footprint of 
its lending portfolio, lender’s customer targets 
and commitments on ESG resource optimisation, 
evaluating the quantum of collateral positioned in 
high-risk flood/drought-prone areas, checking green 
building certifications of real estate portfolios, social 
inclusivity of corporates, SME & MSME customers.

Within its operation, the Bank is considering 
greening the branches and data centres, eliminating 
the use of paper in the operations, introducing the 
option of e-receipts on registered mobile numbers 
at their ATMs, evaluating options of switching 
over to renewable energy for sourcing power 
gradually and future-proofing operations against 
regulatory requirements.
•	
Negative financial implications:
•	
Financial/Credit risk: Rising frequency and 
severity of extreme weather events can 
impair the value of assets held by the Banks’ 
customers, or impact supply chains affecting 
customers’ operations and profitability and 
leading to higher loan defaults and NPAs.
•	
Market risk: Increased volatility in 
investments because of shifts in investor 
preferences or climate-induced adverse 
effects might lead to a decline in lending 
portfolio valuation.
•	
Reputational risk: Failure to address the 
challenging climate change vulnerabilities 
will affect stakeholders’ trust resulting in 
loss of customer base.

Regulatory 
& Statutory 
Compliance
Risk
•	
Financial institutions face expanding regulatory

•	
With growing footprint, there is a risk of unintended 
slippages resulting in non-compliance.

for monitoring transactions, performing customer 
background checks and evaluating all lending 
decisions for tackling litigation matters timely.

Governance
Risk

Effective governance practices help in minimising 
its exposure to business and ethics-related risks

mechanisms and controls, to monitor its performance 
diligently and periodically.

from breach of maintaining ethical and 
governance standards.

governed effectively, leading to reduced

Risk & Crisis 
Management
Risk
Integration of ESG risks in banking operations is a must 
for building resilient organisations. These risks are 
increasingly becoming uncertain and volatile.

'Impact Study of Cyclones Leading to Business 
Disruption in Micro Banking in Coastal Areas’, 'Impact 
study of River Floods leading to Business Disruption 
in Micro Banking’, ‘Impact study of rating downgrade 
of companies falling under industries with High CO2 
emission for commercial banking portfolio’ and ‘Impact 
study of unfavourable climate condition on agricultural 
districts’.
•	
Transition risk is also assessed by way of an impact 
study on business disruption in agricultural districts 
for the EEB segment, and incorporation of the 
Pollution Index (PI) score in Credit Proposal Vetting 
and Industry Outlook framework for the commercial 
banking segment.
Negative financial implication:
The absence of proactive crisis management 
practices might lead to unanticipated losses on 
account of market disruptions, policy changes, 
and data service disruptions.
9.

Digitalisation
Risk

comply with data protection and privacy regulations 
to ensure that customer data is kept secured and 
confidential to avoid any penal measures such as fines, 
and penalties.
•	
The Bank ensures implementation of robust 
cybersecurity measures and data protection 
policies and procedures to prevent data breaches,

Financial Inclusion
Opportunity
•	
Financial inclusion and serving the underserved 
is a hallmark of the Bank. In terms of its banking 
operations and customer base, the Bank is highly 
invested in addressing financial inclusion.
•	
The Bank’s unique high-tech and high-touch 
approach enables much deeper last-mile doorstep 
delivery of banking services.

government to fulfil the financial inclusion drive 
and has allied itself with various government 
schemes to achieve the goals of financial inclusion.

The Bank has immense potential to expand its 
banking operation across the country and has been 
diversifying its operations to non-east states.
•	
More than 75 per cent. (25.3 million) of the customers 
are EEB customers. The Bank has more than 70 per 
cent. of its banking outlets in rural and semi-urban 
areas, which is in alignment with the Bank’s vision of 
catering for the underbanked.
•	
Affordable 
housing 
is 
another 
hallmark 
that provides micro-home loan solutions to 
underbanked customers.
•	
The Bank has promoted various government schemes 
related to the agri sector, social security schemes, etc.
•	
The Bank actively supports small businesses, artists, 
farmers, women groups and underprivileged 
sections for holistic development and helps create 
employment and livelihood opportunities.

individuals and businesses to those who are 
currently excluded from the traditional banking 
system will provide deeper market penetration 
and will unleash the Bank’s true growth 
potential.

policy-210123.pdf
The Bank has an anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy embedded in the Code of Conduct section of the HR Policy and 
is also available on the website as part of the Compendium of BRSR Policies. Every new joinee signed the hard copy and 
also digitally in the HRMS portal for the first time use. Subsequently, every year in the month of April, all employees 
including KMP and senior management digitally undertake the annual code of conduct declaration, containing the 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption provisions of the Bank.
Additionally, the Bank has a Vigilance Policy and Whistleblower Policy, which aim to effectively implement systems 
and procedures to prevent corruption, serving as a deterrent for any wrongdoing. The Bank has established a 
two-tier system, viz., (i) the Chief of Internal Vigilance (‘CIV’) and (ii) the Disciplinary Committee which bears the 
responsibility of (a) investigating any alleged or proven misconduct by an employee and (b) taking necessary punitive 
actions, respectively.
The Bank is extremely strict in taking measures against wrongdoings, misconduct and cases of bribery and corruption, 
adhering to its zero-tolerance practice. Furthermore, the CIV takes measures to prevent bribery by conducting 
periodic reviews and checks on high-value purchases made by the Bank, scrutinising assets held or declared by senior 
management and employees and probing into any reported cases of conflicts of interest involving employees. These 
measures ensure 100% compliance from all employees, as the Bank strives towards zero cases of non-compliance. 
The CIV apprises the MD&CEO about the monthly vigilance activities and submits the report to the Audit Committee 
of the Board.

In the absence of any definition in the prescribed BRSR format in the SEBI Circular, the Bank has interpreted, a trading house as an entity 
that acts as an intermediary that facilitates trade between countries, i.e., linking a home country’s buyers and sellers with other foreign 
country’s buyers and sellers. Therefore, given the nature of the Bank’s operation, there were no sales or purchases done that involved 
any trading house.
	
2.	
The Bank does not appoint any dealers or distributors to provide its products and services to customers. All the customers are direct 
customers of the Bank. Therefore, there was nil sales to any dealers or distributors.
	
3.	
The Bank is a service-oriented company and is not involved in any purchases or sales in its operations. Therefore, there are nil purchases 
from related parties. However, certain services including rent, accommodation/venue charges for the training of employees and interest 
paid are provided in the related party transaction schedule of the financial statement of the Bank.
	
4.	
There is nil investment in any related parties. The Bank has, as per its Policy, extended housing loans to KMPs, the percentage of which 
is derived on the closing balance of the outstanding loan at the end of the FY. Further details regarding related party transactions are

The Bank is a service provider and a regulated entity and 
operates as per the Banking Regulations. Therefore, the scope 
of Capex to improve the environmental and social impacts of 
products and processes is not material to the Bank. However, 
the Bank has taken several environmental and social initiatives, 
as mentioned below.
Environmental – The Bank has transitioned effectively into a 
digital banking ecosystem. This has helped the Bank in reducing 
its usage of paper across its branches and operations. The Bank 
has also invested in various innovative technologies and IT 
transformations across all its branches.
The 
energy-efficient 
lighting 
system 
and 
water-saving 
technology have led to a reduction in power and water usage. 
The seamless transactions through mobile and net banking have 
led to a reduction in commuting time to the branches, thereby 
considerably reducing vehicular emissions and costs from 
commutation and energy consumption.
Social – The Bank has established EEB banking units catering to 
the underbanked rural and semi-urban areas leading to greater 
financial inclusion in the remote areas. The Bank has brought 
banking to the doorsteps of marginalised and economically 
backward communities through these Business Units. The Bank 
has taken several initiatives of financial literacy and financial 
empowerment amongst vulnerable groups such as rural 
housewives, and women entrepreneurs, ensuring inclusivity and 
ease of access for all sections of society, to banking services.
During the pandemic and post-pandemic restrictions, many of 
the customers of your Bank lost their livelihoods, which made 
them financially vulnerable. To strengthen the customers, your 
Bank came up with products specifically designed for these 
situations and ensured that the customers get the maximum 
financial assistance during the toughest time in their lives.
To overcome digital-based challenges, the Bank is providing 
training to enhance customer awareness of the benefits of 
digital payments and various other aspects, such as seeding bank 
accounts with mobile numbers and Aadhaar.
The Bank scaled up the first of its kind ‘Android PoS’, a testament 
to the commitment to providing innovative and customer-
centric solutions to merchants and promoting digital payments 
in remote areas.
2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Owing to the nature of the banking products and services offered, sustainable sourcing may not be a significant 
material topic for the Bank. However, the Bank endeavours to integrate sustainability in the supply chain(s) for its 
products and services across its operations. Wherever feasible, the Bank tries to incorporate sustainable sourcing in its 
operations. For procurement of equipment, the Bank ensures that energy efficiency standards are considered during 
the purchase of electronic equipment such as computers, laptops, lighting devices, ACs amongst others.
The Bank’s supply chain includes outsourced agencies, third-party service providers, transporters, suppliers of 
materials and capital goods, franchisees, dealers and distributors. The Bank recognises the need to work closely with 
the suppliers to reduce waste, improve efficiency, reduce carbon footprint and continuously work towards ensuring 
greater integration of environmental factors in its procurement practices.

Corporate 
Overview

Reports
Financial
Statements
In line with the Bank's sustainability commitment, it has prioritised several key actions, as mentioned below:
Partnering for Good: The Bank actively seeks suppliers who demonstrate ethical labour practices, environmental 
responsibility, and high-quality standards. Transparency and minimising environmental impact are key factors in 
supplier selection.
Sustainable Procurement Policies: Formalised procurement policies guide sourcing decisions, ensuring suppliers 
align with the Bank's values of environmental and social accountability.
Minimising Environmental Footprint: The Bank is mindful of the environmental impact of its procurement activities. 
We actively work to reduce waste, promote energy efficiency, and encourage the use of renewable resources 
throughout their operations and supply chain.
Social Impact: Beyond environmental considerations, the Bank prioritises social impact. We choose suppliers who 
uphold human rights, provide safe working conditions, and contribute positively to their communities.
Continuous Improvement: The Bank remains dedicated to ongoing improvement in its sustainable sourcing practices. 
Regular reviews and updates to procurement policies ensure they incorporate emerging sustainability trends and 
best practices.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of life, for:
(a)	 Plastics (including packaging),
(b)	 E-waste,
(c)	
Hazardous waste, and
(d)	 Other waste.
The Bank does not have physical product offerings in its normal course of operations. Therefore, there is an insignificant 
footprint of waste generation for the reclamation for reusing and recycling of such wastes.
a)	
Plastics – The plastic usage in the products is minimal, hence, reclamation of plastics is not applicable. However, 
in its day-to-day usage, there are plastic usage recycling bins for designated plastics like water bottles and other 
plastic containers. These are collected by a recycling service and processed according to local regulations.
b)	
E-waste - E-waste generated from the banking operations across all offices and branches is responsibly disposed 
of by third-party service providers.
c)	
Hazardous Waste – Owing to the nature of the operations as a banking facility, there isn’t much scope for 
the generation of hazardous waste from the Bank’s branches and offices that are owned and controlled by 
third parties.
d)	
Other Waste – Paper waste is disposed of for recycling by third-party service providers.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
No. As the Bank does not have any physical product offering or has any major plastics usage in its products and services, 
the Bank does not qualify for any EPR obligation.

The HR policy of the Bank incorporates the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) for addressing 
issues related to sexual harassment. An Internal Committee (IC) consisting of one Presiding Officer and 
three members is constituted at the head office to enquire into and provide redressal of Sexual Harassment 
complaints. The composition of the IC consists of at least one external member and one-half of the total 
member are women officials. In addition to POSH, the Bank has also built an in-house grievance redressal 
system which is available in the HRMS portal of the Bank. The grievance redressal mechanism lays down 
guidelines that need to be followed by the organisation, which include the following:
Conflict Resolution
An employee who feels that he or she is being subjected to harassment should first, where possible, make his 
/ her disapproval clearly known to the individual(s) concerned and ask that the behaviour be stopped. If there 
is no apparent change in the behaviour of the respondent, the employee concerned can make use of either 
an informal or formal resolution process for redressing their complaint.
Freedom from Retaliation
A person who in good faith brings a complaint of harassment against another person, shall not be subjected 
to any form of retaliation. The Bank prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a complaint in good faith, 
and retaliation in itself constitutes misconduct subject to disciplinary action. Discriminating against an 
employee who has made a complaint of harassment or deleteriously affecting the terms and conditions of 
employment or work environment of the employee will be construed as retaliation.
Confidentiality
All employees who are aware of a harassment complaint, or involved in its resolution, must recognise the 
seriousness of the situation and respect the sensitivity and confidentiality that must be accorded to the 
matter. The employees must refrain from discussing the complaint amongst themselves or with anyone who 
does not have a ‘need to know.’ Every effort will be made to preserve the dignity and self-respect of the 
parties to the complaint.
Action against false complaints
False or malicious complaints can seriously damage a person’s reputation, career, and relationships. If anyone 
makes a false or malicious complaint of harassment and it is so established after a thorough and proper 
investigation, the complainant will face disciplinary action, depending on the situation.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Bank believes that an effective stakeholder engagement process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal of 
inclusive growth. The Bank accordingly anchors its stakeholder engagement on the principles of the following features:

important to the organisation as well as its stakeholders.
•	 Completeness - understanding the stakeholders' key concerns and expectations.
•	 Responsiveness - responding coherently and speedily to such issues and concerns.
	
The key stakeholder groups include the Central and State Governments, regulatory/statutory agencies, media, 
shareholders, clients, employees, local communities, channel partners, and suppliers. Attributes including dependency, 
accountability, immediacy and influence are used to identify stakeholders. The engagement strategy recognises the 
individuality and distinct set of priorities of each stakeholder group. Stakeholder engagement insights support the 
Bank's performance and help to create fresh viewpoints.

day-to-day business and operations of the Bank. In view of the Bank’s sustainability objectives, business strategies, 
operational policies, and global market trends, the responses and feedback gathered during stakeholder engagement 
are reviewed by top management to understand stakeholders’ perspectives. The Board and senior management are 
informed of the feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders in order to get their advice and take appropriate action.

Cycle Management on their own devices and at their own disposal which enables employees to get their grievances 
redressed. In a nutshell, with the grievance redressal mechanism incorporated into the HRMS, the employees have a 
one-stop solution for any queries or complaints.

a period of 5 years and 72 water harvesting structures have been constructed with a storage capacity of 1,45,318 
Kilolitres of water, which approximately resulted in sequestering over 3,968 MT of CO2 equivalent annually to date.
The Bank has also initiated Climate Action Programme under its CSR initiatives which focuses on water conservation, 
afforestation, and sustainable projects like solar-powered irrigation and streetlights, contributing to climate 
adaptation, carbon sequestration, and community sustainability.
Details of the climate action programme are available in the Annual Report of the Bank.

ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
A good customer experience remains paramount for the service industry and the Bank believes that providing 
prompt & efficient service is essential not only to attract new customers but also to retain existing ones. Grievance 
redressal is an essential aspect of effective service delivery and hence, the Bank has a robust customer complaint 
resolution mechanism.
The Bank has a framework in place for effective redressal of the complaints received from its customers. The Bank 
follows the principle of “First Contact Resolution”, and effort is made to resolve the grievance to the full satisfaction 
of the complainant at the point of first contact.
The grievance redressal mechanism is applicable for complaints received from all customers of the Bank including 
customers of third-party products as well as complaints emanating from rural areas and those relating to financial 
assistance to Priority Sector and Government's Poverty Alleviation Programmes. The grievance redressal channels of 
the Bank are also available to deal with issues related to services provided by Outsourced Agencies.
With a view to strengthen the internal grievance redressal system in line with the RBI regulations and to ensure 
that the complaints of the customers are redressed at the level of the Bank itself, the Internal Ombudsman (I.O.) 
mechanism has been set up for effective resolution of grievances.
Further, there is also a Branch Level Customer Service meeting wherein relevant feedback and suggestions of the 
customers are captured and taken up for improving Bank’s serviceability. Moreover, there are quarterly senior 
management level and Board level customer service Committee meetings wherein all the major areas of complaints 
and steps taken to address them are being discussed till logical conclusion.

To the Members of Bandhan Bank Limited
Report on the Audit of the  
Financial Statements
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying financial 
statements of Bandhan Bank Limited (the 
“Bank”) which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 
March 31, 2025, the Profit and Loss Account, the Cash 
Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes 
to the Financial Statements including a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (“the Financial Statements”).
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid financial statements give the information 
required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as 
the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and the circulars 
and guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India, in the 
manner so required for banking companies and are in 
conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India including the accounting standards 
specified under Section 133 of the Act as applicable 
to banks and give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2025, and its profit 
and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of Financial Statements” section of our 
report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance 
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the Financial Statements under the provisions of the 
Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the Financial Statements of the current 
year. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined 
the matters described below to be the key audit matters:
Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing Advances (NPA):
Total NPA as at March 31, 2025: ₹6,435.56 crore 
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2025: ₹4,742.71 crore
(Refer Schedule 9, 18.6 & 18.7 to the Financial Statements)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Identification of NPA and measurement of provision 
on account of NPA is made based on the assessment 
of various criteria stipulated in the Reserve Bank of 
India (‘RBI’) guidelines on ‘Prudential Norms on Income 
Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning 
pertaining to advances’ (‘IRACP’).
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to 
determine the identification and provision required against 
NPAs by applying quantitative as well as qualitative factors. 
The risk of identification of NPAs is affected by factors like 
stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision against advances is based on criteria such 
as past due status, out of order status etc. The provision 
in respect of such NPAs are made based on ageing and 
classification of NPAs, recovery estimates, value of 
security, nature of loan products and other qualitative 
factors and is subject to minimum provisioning levels 
prescribed by the RBI and approved policy of the bank 
in this regard. In addition to this, for restructured 
accounts, provision is made for erosion/ diminution in fair 
value of restructured loans, in accordance with the RBI 
guidelines. Further, NPA classification is made borrower 
wise whereby if one facility of the borrower becomes 
NPA then all facilities of such a borrower will be treated 
as NPA.
•	 Tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls 
(including application controls) over approval, recording, 
monitoring, and recovery of loans, monitoring overdue/
stressed accounts, identification of NPA, provision for NPA, 
and valuation of security including collateral. Testing of 
Application controls includes testing of automated controls, 
reports and system reconciliations.
•	 Evaluated the governance process and tested controls over 
calculations of provision on non-performing advances, basis 
of provisioning in accordance with the Board approved policy.
•	 Selected the borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative 
risk factors for their assessment of appropriate classification 
as NPA including computation of overdue ageing to assess its 
correct classification and provision amount as per the IRACP 
norms and Bank policy.

Annual Report 2024-25
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We 
have 
identified 
‘Identification 
of 
NPA 
and 
Provisioning on Advances’ as a key audit matter in view of 
the significant level of estimation involved, as well as the 
stringent compliances laid down by the RBI in this regard.
Performed other substantive procedures including but not 
limited to the following:
•	 Selected sample of performing loans and assessed them 
independently as to whether these should be classified 
as NPA;
•	 For sample selected, examined the security valuation, 
financial statements and other qualitative information of 
the borrowers;
•	 Considered the accounts reported by the Bank and other 
Banks as Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central 
Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to 
identify stress;
•	 Performed inquiries with the credit and risk departments to 
ascertain if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of 
an event of default in a particular loan account or any product 
category which needs to be considered as NPA;
•	 Assessed the appropriateness of asset classification and 
adequacy of related provisioning by performing procedures 
such as computation of overdue ageing, assessment of 
borrower level, NPA identification and verification of 
applicable provision rates as per IRACP norms and Bank’s 
Policy on test check basis; and assessed the adequacy of 
disclosures against the relevant accounting standards and 
RBI requirements relating to NPAs.
•	 We communicated the observations arising out of our 
above procedures with those charged with governance 
and the management. The resultant modifications in IT 
procedures to improve financial and operating controls have 
been implemented or expected to be implemented in the 
near future. In the meanwhile, the management has made 
compensating computations through specific manual or 
other off system exercises to which we have applied audit 
tests, where necessary.
Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank has a complex IT architecture to support its day-
to-day business operations. High volume of transactions are 
processed and recorded on single or multiple applications. 
The reliability and security of IT systems plays a key role in 
the business operations of the Bank. Since large volume of 
transactions are processed daily, the IT controls are required 
to ensure that applications process data as expected and 
that changes are made in an appropriate manner.
Appropriate IT general controls and application controls 
are required to ensure that such IT systems are able to 
process the data, as required, completely, accurately and 
consistently for reliable financial reporting.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the 
following:
In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we 
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding of 
the IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We evaluated 
and tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-scope” IT 
systems and IT dependencies identified as relevant for our audit 
of the financial statements and financial reporting process of the 
Bank. On such “in-scope” IT systems, we have tested key IT general 
controls with respect to the following domains:
•	 Program change management, which includes that program 
changes are moved to the production environment as per 
defined procedures and relevant segregation of environment 
is ensured.
•	 User access management, which includes user access 
provisioning, de-provisioning, access review, password 
management, sensitive access rights and segregation of duties 
to ensure that privilege access to applications, operating 
systems and databases in the production environment were 
granted only to authorised personnel.

Statements
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We have identified ‘IT systems and controls’ as key audit 
matter because of the high level automation, significant 
number of systems being used by the management and 
the complexity of the IT architecture and its impact on 
the financial reporting system.
•	 Program development, which includes controls over IT 
application development or implementation and related 
infrastructure, which are relied upon for financial reporting. 
In addition, understood where relevant, changes made to the 
IT landscape during the audit period.
•	 IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring and 
backup and recovery.
We also evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of relevant key IT dependencies within the 
key business process, which included testing automated 
controls, automated calculations/ accounting procedures, 
interfaces, segregation of duties and system generated reports, 
as applicable.
We communicated the observations arising out of our above 
procedures with those charged with governance and the 
management. The resultant modifications in IT Procedures 
to improve financial and operating controls have been 
implemented or expected to be implemented in the near future. 
In the meanwhile, the management has made compensating 
computations through specific manual or other off system 
exercises to which we have applied audit tests, where necessary.
Information other than financial statements and 
auditors’ report thereon
5.	
The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report but 
does not include the Financial Statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is 
expected to be made available to us after the date of 
this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above when it becomes 
available and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Financial 
Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When 
we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to those charged with 
governance and take appropriate action as applicable 
under the relevant laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of management and those 
charged with governance for the  
Financial Statements
6.	
The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act, 
with respect to the preparation and presentation of 
these Financial Statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of the Bank in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Accounting Standards specified under 
Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, and the provisions 
of Section 29 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 
and circulars, guidelines and directions issued by 
the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
7.	
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Board of 
Directors are responsible for assessing the Bank’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management and Board of Director either intends to 
liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
226
Annual Report 2024-25
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
8.	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Financial Statements.
9.	
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Bank has internal financial 
controls with reference to the Financial Statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management of 
the Bank.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
10.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
11.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
12.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the Financial 
Statements of the current year and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
13.	 The financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 were jointly audited by Singhi & Co. 
and M M Nissim & Co. LLP, who vide their audit report 
dated May 17, 2024 issued an unmodified opinion 
on the audited financial statements. Accordingly, 
V. Sankar Aiyar & Co., do not express any opinion 
on the comparable figures reported in the financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the 
above matter.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
14.	 In our opinion, the Balance Sheet and the Profit and 
Loss Account have been drawn up in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949 and Section 133 of the Act.
15.	 As required by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we report that:

Annexure A 
to Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 16(g) of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of Bandhan Bank Limited 
on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025
Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Financial Statements 
under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Act
1.	
We have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to Financial Statements of Bandhan 
Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2025, in 
conjunction with our audit of the financial statements 
of the Bank for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for 
Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The Banks’s management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Bank considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to Banks’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Banks’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 
Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under 
Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to 
an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls and both 
issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to Financial Statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system with reference to Financial 
Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our 
audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to Financial Statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to Financial Statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the Financial Statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Banks’s internal financial controls 
system with reference to Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to financial statements
6.	
A Banks’s internal financial controls with reference to 
Financial Statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of Financial 
Statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A Banks’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Financial 
Statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the Bank are being made only 
in accordance with authorisations of management 
and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
Financial Statements.
230
Annual Report 2024-25
Inherent Limitations of Internal  
Financial Controls with reference  
to financial statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to Financial 
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
Financial Statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with 
reference to Financial Statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the Bank 
has, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls system with reference to financial 
statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to Financial Statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Bank considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued 
by ICAI.

Schedule 17 – Significant accounting 
policies forming part of the financial 
statements for the year ended  
March 31, 2025
1. Background
Bandhan Bank Limited (the ‘Bank’), incorporated on 
December 23, 2014 in India, is a banking company, 
governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. 
Pursuant to the Banking license received from Reserve 
Bank of India on June 17, 2015, the Bank has commenced 
its banking operations from August 23, 2015.
2. Basis of preparation
The accompanying financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and on the 
accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and 
comply with the requirements prescribed under the Third 
Schedule (Form A and Form B) of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949. The accounting and reporting policies of the 
Bank used in the preparation of these financial statements 
conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in 
India (‘Indian GAAP’), the guidelines issued by RBI from 
time to time, the accounting standards notified under 
section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with 
the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 to the 
extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the 
banking industry in India.
3. Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with the generally accepted accounting principles requires 
the Management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities) as at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported income and expenses during the reporting 
period. The Management believes that the estimates used in 
the preparation of the financial statements shall be prudent 
and reasonable. Any revisions to the accounting estimates are 
recognised prospectively in the current and future periods. 
Actual results could differ from estimates.
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
4.1 Revenue Recognition
Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss 
account on an accrual basis, except in the case of interest 
on non-performing assets, which is recognised as income 
on realisation, as per the income recognition and asset 
classification norms of RBI. Accrual of income shall also 
be suspended on certain other loans, including projects 
under implementation where the implementation has been 
significantly delayed and in the opinion of the management 
significant uncertainties exist as to the final financial closure 
and/ or date of completion of the project.
The Bank shall not charge and take to income account 
interest on any NPA. This will apply to Government 
guaranteed accounts also. However, interest on advances 
against Term Deposits, National Savings Certificates (NSCs), 
Indira Vikas Patras (IVPs), Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) and 
Life policies is taken to income account on the due date, 
provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.
Profit or Loss on sale of investments is recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account. However, the profit on sale of investments 
in ‘Held to Maturity’ category is appropriated (net of 
applicable taxes and amount required to be transferred to 
statutory reserve) to ‘Capital Reserve Account’.
Income from hire purchase operations is accrued by applying 
the interest rate implicit on outstanding investments.
Income from leases is calculated by applying the interest 
rate implicit in the lease to the net investment outstanding 
on the lease over the primary lease period.
Income on discounted instruments is recognised over the 
tenure of the instrument on a straight line basis.
Interest Income on PTC and Loan purchase through 
assignment are recognised on a constant yield basis.
Dividend is accounted on an when the right to receive the 
dividend is established.
Loan processing fees is accounted for upfront when it 
becomes due.
Fees other than loan processing fees received as a 
compensation of future interest sacrifice are amortised 
over the remaining period of the facility.
Compromise on settlement is accounted on receipt of 
settlement money.
Arranger’s fee is accrued proportionately where more than 
75% of the total amount of finance has been arranged.
Guarantee / Letter of credit (LC) commission is recognised 
over the period of the guarantee / LC.
Annual/renewal fee on credit cards and debit cards is 
recognised upfront.
Locker Rent recognised on Straight Line Method basis over 
the period of Contract
All fees from deposit accounts are accounted for as and 
when they are due and realised.
242
Annual Report 2024-25
Schedules forming part of the Balance sheet
as at March 31, 2025
Income from sale of Priority Sector Lending certificate 
(PSLC) is recognised in the Profit & Loss Account during 
the quarter on an equated basis from the quarter in which 
the sale has occurred and the remaining amount will be 
recognised in the Profit & Loss Account over the remaining 
quarters of that financial year.
Appropriation of recovery in NPAs and prudential  
written off accounts:
Any recoveries in NPA accounts and prudential written 
off accounts will be first appropriated to fees/charges 
outstanding, if any, then interest outstanding and then 
principal outstanding except in those cases where bank has 
specific agreement with the borrower w.r.t appropriation 
of recoveries.
The sale of NPA and technically written off portfolio is 
accounted as per guidelines prescribed by RBI :
i.	
When the Bank sells its financial assets to Securitisation 
Company (SC)/Reconstruction Company (RC), the 
same is removed from the books.
ii.	
If the sale is at a price below the net book value (NBV) 
(i.e., book value less provisions held), the shortfall 
is debited to the profit and loss account in the year 
of sale.
iii.	
If the sale is for a value higher than the NBV, the

are received, as permitted by the RBI.

4.2. Investments
Classification, valuation and operation of investment 
portfolio is carried out in accordance with the revised 
framework as detailed in the Reserve Bank of India 
(Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment 
Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 2023 (“RBI 
Directions”) applicable from April 01, 2024, to all Commercial 
Banks excluding Regional Rural Banks.
A) Classification
Investments shall be classified into three categories, viz. 
Held to Maturity (‘HTM’), Available for Sale (‘AFS’) and Fair 
Value through Profit and Loss (‘FVTPL’). Held for Trading 
(‘HFT’) shall be a separate investment subcategory within 
FVTPL. The category of the investment shall be decided 
by the bank before or at the time of acquisition and for 
reclassification, Bank shall need to obtain approval from the 
Board of Directors for reclassification between categories 
((viz. HTM, AFS and FVTPL (includes FVTPL (HFT) and FVTPL 
(Non-HFT)). Further, reclassification shall also require the 
prior approval of the Department of Supervision (DoS), RBI.
Investments are accounted for on settlement date basis 
except for equity shares which are accounted for on 
trade date.
•	 Securities that meet the Solely Payment of Principal and 
Interest (‘SPPI’) criterion and are acquired with the intention 
and objective of holding it till maturity, i.e., the financial 
assets are held with the objective to collect the contractual 
cash flows shall be classified under HTM.
•	 Securities that meet the SPPI criterion and are acquired with 
the objective of both (a) collecting contractual cash flows 
and (b) selling securities shall be classified under AFS. These 
includes securities held for ALM.
•	 Investments, which are not classified in the above two 
categories, shall be classified as “Fair Value through Profit 
and Loss (FVTPL)”.
B) Initial Recognition:
At initial recognition, bank shall measure all investments at 
fair value. Bank shall presume acquisition cost to be the fair 
value unless the facts and circumstances suggest otherwise. 
Cost of investment excludes broken period interest paid 
on acquisition of investments. Brokerage and commission 
paid at the time of acquisition are charged to Profit and 
Loss Account. Cost of investments is determined on the 
weighted average cost basis. Any discount or premium on 
the acquisition of debt securities under AFS, FVPTL & HTM 
shall be amortised over the remaining life of the instrument.
C) Valuation & Subsequent Measurement:
Investments classified under the ‘AFS’ and ‘HFT’ categories 
are fair valued periodically as per RBI guidelines.
The fair valuation gains and losses across all performing 
investments held under AFS shall be aggregated. The net 
appreciation or depreciation shall be directly credited or 
debited to a reserve named ‘AFS Reserve’ without routing 
through the Profit & Loss Account. Upon sale or maturity of 
a debt instrument in AFS category, the accumulated gain/ 
loss for that security in the AFS Reserve are transferred 
from the AFS Reserve and recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account. In the case of equity instruments designated 
under AFS at the time of initial recognition, any gain or loss 
on sale of such investments shall not be transferred from 
AFS-Reserve to the Profit and Loss Account. Instead, such 
gain or loss shall be transferred from AFS-Reserve to the 
Capital Reserve.
The securities held in FVTPL shall be fair valued and the 
net gain or loss arising on such valuation shall be directly 
credited or debited to the Profit and Loss Account.
The market/fair value for the purpose of periodical valuation 
of quoted investments included in the ‘AFS’ and ‘FVTPL’ 
categories is the market price of the security available from 
trades/quotes on the recognised stock exchanges, price

list of RBI or prices declared by Financial Benchmarks India 
Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL), periodically. Other unquoted fixed income 
securities, including Pass through Certificate wherever 
linked to the Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) rates, is computed 
based on residual maturity with a mark-up (applicable to 
the issuer) over the YTM rates for GOI securities of similar 
maturities published by FIMMDA/FBIL as directed by RBI.
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up value, 
if the latest balance sheet is available or at ₹1 as per 
RBI guidelines.
Discounted instruments like Treasury Bills, Certificate of 
Deposits, Commercial Papers are valued at carrying cost.
Investments categorised under HTM are carried at 
acquisition cost, or at amortised cost if acquired at a 
discount or premium over the face value. Such discount 
or premium is amortised over the remaining period to 
maturity of the relevant security on a straight-line basis. 
Where in the opinion of management, a diminution, other 
than temporary in the value of investments classified under 
HTM has taken place, suitable provisions are made. Any 
profit or loss on the sale of investments in HTM shall be 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The profit on 
sale of an investments in HTM shall be appropriated below 
the line from the Profit and Loss Account to the ‘Capital 
Reserve Account’. The amount so appropriated shall be 
net of taxes and the amount required to be transferred to 
Statutory Reserve.
Security receipts issued by the asset reconstruction 
companies are valued in accordance with the guidelines 
applicable to such instruments, prescribed by RBI 
from time to time at the end of each reporting period. 
Accordingly, in cases where the cash flows from security 
receipts issued by the asset reconstruction companies 
are limited to the actual realisation of the financial assets 
assigned to the instruments in the concerned scheme, the 
Bank reckons the net asset value obtained from the asset 
reconstruction company from time to time, for valuation of 
such investments at each reporting period end.
D) Repurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase transactions:
Repurchase (‘repo’) and reverse repurchase (‘reverse 
repo’) transactions including liquidity adjustment facility 
(with RBI) shall be accounted for as borrowing and lending 
transactions. Accordingly, securities given as collateral 
under an agreement to repurchase them continue to be 
held under the investment account of the Bank and the 
Bank would continue to accrue the coupon/discount on the 
security during the repo period. Also, the Bank continues to 
value the securities sold under repo as per the investment 
classification of the security. The difference between the 
clean price of the first leg and clean price of the second leg 
shall be recognised as interest income/expense over the 
period of the transaction in the profit and loss account.
E) Short Sales:
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, the Bank undertakes 
short sale transactions in Central Government dated 
securities. Such short positions are categorised under HFT 
category. These positions are marked-to-market along with 
the other securities under HFT portfolio and the resultant 
mark-to-market gains/losses are accounted for as per the 
relevant RBI guidelines as stated above.
F) Investment Fluctuation Reserve:
The amount transferred to IFR will be lower of the following 
(i) net profit on sale of investments during the year or (ii) 
net profit for the year, less mandatory appropriations, until 
the amount of IFR is at least 2 percent of the AFS and FVTPL 
including HFT portfolio, on a continuing basis.
G) Non-Performing Investment
Non-performing investments are identified and 
depreciation / provision are made thereon based on RBI 
guidelines. The depreciation / provision on such non-
performing investments are not set off against the 
appreciation in respect of other performing securities. 
Interest on non-performing investments is not recognised 
in the Profit & Loss Account until received.
H) Transition and Repeal Provisions
At the time of transition to these RBI Directions (i.e., on 
April 01, 2024), banks shall;

4.3 Loans /Advances and Provisions thereon
Advances are classified into performing and non-performing 
advances (‘NPAs’) as per the RBI guidelines and Stressed 
Asset Management & Recovery (SAMR) policy of the bank 
and are stated net of specific provisions made towards 
NPAs. Further, NPAs are classified into sub-standard, 
doubtful and loss assets based on the criteria stipulated 
by the RBI. Provisions for NPAs are made for sub-standard 
and doubtful assets at rates as prescribed by the RBI.
The Bank has a policy of deferment of instalments for micro 
(EEB) loan borrowers in case the group meetings have 
been suspended and the same has not been considered as 
overdue for the purpose of NPA classification.
Amounts recovered against debts written off in earlier 
years are recognised in the profit and loss account as credit 
to Miscellaneous Income under the head ‘Other Income’
The Bank maintains general provision on standard advances 
as prescribed by RBI. In case of micro (EEB & SBAL) lending 
portfolio, general provision on standard advances will be 
maintained by Bank at 1% comprising 0.25% as per the 
minimum provisioning requirement by RBI and 0.75% as 
additional provision. Provision made against standard 
assets is included in “Other liabilities & provisions”.
In case of non-performing micro (EEB & SBAL) lending 
portfolio, where 30 days have elapsed from the completion 
of loan tenure, the Bank is making 100% provision.
Non-performing loans, which have been fully provided for, are 
written off when the prospect of recovery is considered remote 
as per the management estimate in compliance with the 
stressed assets management and recovery policy of the Bank.
Restructured assets are classified and provided for in 
accordance with the guidelines issued by RBI from time to time.
For entities with Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure 
(‘UFCE’), provision is made in accordance with the guidelines 
issued by RBI, which requires to ascertain the amount of 
UFCE, estimate the extent of likely loss and estimate the 
riskiness of unhedged position. This provision is classified 
under Schedule 5 – Other Liabilities in the Balance Sheet.

participation pool and interest paid to the issuing Bank and 
is recognised on accrual basis.
4.5 Tangible Assets
All tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Cost 
comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Asset under development as at the balance sheet date are 
shown as Capital Work in Progress. Advance paid towards 
such development are shown as capital advance.
Any subsequent expenses is capitalised only when it increases 
the future economic benefit / functioning capability.
4.6 Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any.
4.7 Depreciation and Amortisation
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of a 
fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The useful lives of the 
groups of fixed assets are given below:

Assets purchased and sold during the year shall be 
depreciated on the basis of actual number of days the asset 
has been put to use.
In case of revision in the estimated useful life of assets 
any unamortised depreciation shall be amortised over the 
remaining useful life of the assets.
4.8 Impairment
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine if there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal/external factors. An 
impairment loss is recognised wherever the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount which 
is the greater of the asset’s net selling price and value in 
use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessment of 
the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised 
carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.
4.9 Foreign Currency transactions
All transactions in foreign currency are recognised at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are 
translated at the Balance Sheet date at the closing rates 
of exchange notified by the Foreign Exchange Dealers’ 
Association of India (‘FEDAI’) and the resulting gains or 
losses are recognised in the Profit and Loss account.
Non-monetary items which are measured in terms of 
historical cost denominated in a foreign currency, are 
reported using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. 
Non-monetary items, which are measured at fair value or 
others similar valuation denominated in a foreign currency, 
are translated using the exchange rate at the date when 
such value was determined.
Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic 
operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts outstanding 
as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are 
revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively 
as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts 
of interim maturities.
Contingent liabilities at the Balance Sheet date on account 
of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts, 
guarantees, acceptances, endorsements and other 
obligations denominated in a foreign currency are stated 
at the closing rates of exchange notified by the FEDAI.
4.10 Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS)
In case of Employee stock option plan, measurement and 
disclosure of the employee share based payment plans is 
done in accordance with Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 
2014 and the Guidance Note on Accounting for Employee 
Share-based Payments, issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. The cost of equity-settled 
transactions shall be measured using the intrinsic value 
method for options granted till March 31, 2021. For options 
granted to all employees after March 31, 2021, the fair value 
on the date of grant of such instruments is recognised 
as an expense in accordance with the RBI guidelines on 
Compensation of Whole-Time Directors / Chief Executive 
Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff. 
The fair value of the stock-based employee compensation is 
estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes model. 
The cumulative compensation expense is recognised with 
a corresponding increase in the ‘stock options outstanding 
account’ in reserve for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflecting the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and the Bank’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The expense or credit recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period and shall be recognised 
in employee benefits expense. ESOP cost is recognised in 
Profit and Loss Statement on the basis of number of days 
of vesting period.
4.11 Retirement and employee benefits
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a 
defined contribution scheme. The Bank has no obligation, 
other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. 
The Bank recognises contribution payable to the provident 
fund scheme as expenditure, when an employee renders the 
related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for 
service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the 
contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme 
is recognised as a liability after deducting the contribution 
already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the 
contribution due for services received before the balance 
sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset.

Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is 
provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on 
projected unit credit method made at the end of each 
financial year.
The Bank provides for compensated absences based on 
actuarial valuation conducted by an independent actuary.
Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken to the profit 
and loss account and are not deferred.
4.12 Income Taxes
Tax expenses comprises current and deferred tax. Current 
income tax is measured at the amount expected to be 
paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income 
Tax Act, 1961 and in compliance with AS 22 “Accounting 
for Taxation Income”. Deferred income taxes reflects the 
impact of current year timing differences between taxable 
income and accounting income for the year and reversal of 
timing differences of earlier years.
Deferred Tax is measured based on the tax rates and the tax 
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future 
taxable income will be available against which such deferred 
tax assets can be realised. If the Bank has carried forward 
unabsorbed depreciation and tax losses, all deferred tax 
assets is recognised only to the extent that there is a virtual 
certainty supported by convincing evidence that sufficient 
taxable income will be available in future against which 
such deferred tax assets can be realised.
At each reporting date, the Bank re-assesses unrecognised 
deferred tax assets. It recognises unrecognised deferred 
tax assets to the extent that it has become reasonably 
certain or virtually certain, as the case may be, that sufficient 
future taxable income will be available against which such 
deferred tax assets can be realised.
Deferred Tax liability is created on amount transferred to 
special reserve under section 36(i)(viii) of the Income Tax 
Act, 1961 as per the RBI guidelines.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date. The Bank writes down the 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets to the extent 
that it is no longer reasonably certain or virtually certain 
as the case may be, that sufficient future taxable income 
will be available against which deferred tax asset can be 
realised. Any such write down is reversed to the extent 
that it becomes reasonably certain or virtually certain, as 
the case may be that sufficient future taxable income will 
be available.
4.13 Non-banking assets
Non-banking assets (NBAs) acquired in satisfaction of 
claims are valued at the market value on a distress sale 
basis or value of loan, whichever is lower. Further, the Bank 
creates provision on these assets as per the extant RBI 
guidelines or specific RBI directions.
4.14 Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net 
profit or loss after tax for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution 
that could occur if contracts to issue equity shares were 
exercised or converted during the year. Diluted earnings 
per equity share is computed using the net profit or loss 
for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the 
period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
4.15 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  
and Contingent Assets
A provision is recognised when the Bank has a present 
obligation as a result of past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not 
discounted to their present value and are determined based 
on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the 
reporting date. These estimates are reviewed at each reporting 
date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the Bank 
or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is 
not probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in 
extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot 
be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. The 
Bank does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses 
its existence in the financial statements.
Contingent Assets are not recognised in the 
financial statements.
4.16 Leases
Leases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all 
the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased items are 
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments 
are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account 
on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Premium Account in terms of Section 52(2) of the 
Companies Act, 2013.
4.19 Reward points
Reward points on cards are accounted for based on value 
per point after taking into account the probability of 
redemption of such reward points
4.20 Derivative Transactions
Derivative transactions comprises of forward contracts, 
currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The Bank 
undertakes derivative transactions for trading and hedging 
balance sheet assets and liabilities.
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts (other than those 
designated as hedges) at fair value, on the date on which the 
derivative contracts are entered into and are remeasured at 
fair value as at the Balance Sheet or reporting dates.
Derivative transactions such as Foreign exchange forward 
contracts, Forex swap and Interest rate swaps outstanding 
as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are fair 
valued at present value basis. The resulting profit or loss 
on valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Derivatives which are not intended for trading such as 
Foreign exchange forward contracts and Forex swaps and 
which are outstanding at balance sheet date are fair valued 
at the FEDAI closing SPOT rate. The premium or discount 
arising at the inception of such Forward contracts and 
Forex swaps is amortised as expense or income over the 
life of the contract.
Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is 
positive (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities 
when the fair value is negative (negative marked 
to market value).
Pursuant to the RBI guidelines, any receivable under a 
derivative contract with a counterparty which remains 
overdue for more than 90 days, mark-to-market gains on 
any other derivative contract with the same counterparty, 
is reversed through Profit and Loss account.

proceedings pending with tax authorities and other contracts including derivative and long term contracts. In 
accordance with the provisions of AS 29 on ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, the Bank 
recognises a provision for material foreseeable losses when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it 
is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate 
can be made. In cases where the available information indicates that the loss on the contingency is reasonably possible 
or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, a disclosure to this effect is made as contingent liabilities in 
the financial statements. The Bank does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse 
effect on its financial results.

Transitional adjustments - Classification, Valuation & Operation of Investment portfolio
	
The RBI, vide its master direction dated September 12, 2023 issued revised norms for the classification, valuation and operation of investment portfolio of banks, which 
became applicable from April 01, 2024. While hitherto, the investment portfolio was classified under the held to maturity (HTM), available for sale (AFS) and held for 
trading (HFT) categories, the revised norms bring in a principle-based classification of investment portfolio and a symmetric treatment of fair value gains and losses. In 
accordance with the revised norms and the Bank’s board approved policy, the Bank has classified its investment portfolio as on April 01, 2024 under the categories of 
held to maturity (HTM), available for sale (AFS) and fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) with held to trading (HFT) as a sub-category of FVTPL, and from that date, 
measures and values the investment portfolio under the revised framework. On transition to the framework on April 01, 2024, the bank has recognised ₹99.03 crore (net 
of tax of ₹33.31 crore) and ₹218.72 crore (net of tax of ₹73.56 crore) which has been credited to General reserve and AFS reserve respectively, in accordance with the said 
norms. The impact on the Profit & Loss of the change in the accounting framework as compared to previous period/s is not ascertainable and as such the income / profit 
or loss from investments for the year ended March 31, 2025 is not comparable with that of the previous period/s.”

*GRUH was merged with and into Bandhan Bank Limited. At the time of merger of GRUH with the Bank, GRUH had a private 
provident fund trust, viz., Gruh Employees Provident Fund Trust, for its employees. Post-merger, GRUH had to transfer the 
balance in Gruh Employees Provident Fund Trust to EPFO, since the Bank had its PF managed by EPFO instead of Private Provident 
Fund Trust, some of the securities of IL&FS Limited and IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd could not be liquidated and the EPFO 
was paid by the Bank the face value of the securities as the Non-Performing Investments (‘NPI’) bonds could not be liquidated. 
These securities were Non-Performing Investments, having zero value, with face value of the three securities being ₹2.20 crore, 
in lieu of which, the amount had been paid to EPFO. The face value of the three securities transferred was ₹2.20 crore, these 
NPI securities were transferred to the books of the Bank at ₹1 each, thereby totalling ₹3 only and increasing the NPI by ₹3 only.
The above NPI NCD investment aggregating to ₹3 of IL&FS and IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd has been written off in 
Financial Year 2024-25.

18.11 Segment Reporting
A)	 Segment Identification
Pursuant to the guidelines issued by RBI on AS 17 - Segment Reporting - Enhancement of Disclosures dated 
April 18, 2007, the following business segments have been reported:
i) Treasury :
Treasury operations include investments in sovereign securities and trading operations. The Treasury segment 
also includes the central funding unit.
ii) Retail banking :
Includes lending to individuals/small businesses through the branch network and other delivery channels subject 
to the orientation, nature of product, granularity of the exposure and low value of individual exposure thereof. 
It also includes liability products, card services, internet banking, mobile banking, ATM services and NRI services. 
All deposits sourced by branches are classified in retail category.
iii) Corporate/Wholesale Banking:
Includes corporate relationships not included under Retail Banking.
iv) Other Banking Business :
Include para banking activities like third party product distribution and other banking transaction not covered 
under any of the above three segments.
Income, expenses, assets and liabilities are either specifically identified with individual segments or are allocated 
to segments on a systematic basis.
The liabilities of the Bank are first used by the units generating the same. Any excess liabilities of the units are 
pooled to central funding unit (Treasury). Treasury then lends these funds to other units at appropriate rates.
The transfer pricing mechanism of the Bank is periodically reviewed. The segment results are determined based 
on the transfer pricing mechanism prevailing for the respective reporting periods.
Revenues of the Treasury segment primarily consist of fees and gains or losses from trading operations and 
interest income on the investment portfolio. The principal expenses of the segment consist of interest expense 
on funds borrowed from external sources and other internal segments, premises expenses, personnel costs, 
other direct overheads and allocated expenses.
Revenues of the Corporate/Wholesale Banking segment consist of interest and fees earned on loans given to 
customers falling under this segment and fees arising from these. Revenues of the Retail Banking segment 
are derived from interest earned on loans classified under this segment, fees for banking services and ATM 
interchange fees. Expenses of the Corporate/Wholesale Banking and Retail Banking segments primarily comprise 
interest expense on deposits and funds borrowed from other internal segments, infrastructure and premises 
expenses for operating the branch network and other delivery channels, personnel costs, other direct overheads 
and allocated expenses.
Segment income includes earnings from external customers and from funds transferred to the other segments. 
Segment result includes revenue as reduced by interest expense and operating expenses and provisions, if any, 
for that segment. Segment-wise income and expenses include certain allocations. Inter segment interest income 
and interest expense represent the transfer price received from and paid as per the transfer pricing mechanism 
presently followed by the Bank.

practices and is consistent with effective risk 
management and long term business interests of 
the Bank. The NRC works in close coordination 
with the Risk Management Committee of the 
Bank, to achieve the effective alignment between 
remuneration and risks.

v)	
To review the HR strategy and policy

vi)	
To review and recommend to the Board, the 
succession policy at the level of Managing 
Director & CEO, other WTDs, senior 
management one level below the Board and 
key roles.
B)	
Information relating to the design and structure of 
remuneration processes and the key features and 
objectives of remuneration policy
The Compensation Policy reflects the Bank’s 
objectives for good corporate governance as 
well as sustained and long-term value creation 
for stakeholders. The aims of the Bank’s 
remuneration framework are to:
i)	
Attract, motivate and retain people with 
requisite skill, experience and ability to 
deliver the Bank’s strategy;
ii)	
Create an alignment and balance 
between the rewards and risk exposure of 
shareholders and interests of employees;
iii)	
Link rewards to creation of long term 
sustainable shareholder value consistent 
with strategic goals and appropriate risk 
management; and
iv)	
Encourage behaviour consistent with the 
Bank’s values and principles.
v)	
Support 
appropriate 
conduct 
and 
meritocratic culture through differentiated 
performance rewards
To achieve the above objectives, the philosophy 
adopted by the Bank is as follows:
i)	
Market referenced: offer employees 
competitive salary, achieved through 
benchmarking with peer groups.
ii)	
Making 
fixed 
salary 
the 
main 
remuneration component.
iii)	
Ensure that jobs of similar internal value are 
grouped and pegged within a range guided 
by market benchmarked jobs.
iv)	
Risk Adjusted: By integrating non-financial 
considerations relating to conduct in 
performance assessments, employing 
proper mix of compensation elements and 
aligning compensation incentives to risk 
outcomes and factoring the time horizon 
of risks
v)	
Focus on ‘Total rewards’, all aspects of 
compensation, rewards and well defined 
benefits, including rewarding work 
environment and personal development.
vi)	
The focus will be to ensure that the Bank 
is competitive in its overall salary offer to 
its employees without being excessively 
expensive for the Bank.
The compensation structure for the MD & CEO 
also mirrors the Bank’s philosophy of aligning 
with the principles of sound compensation 
practices to ensure:
i)	
Effective and independent governance 
of compensation.
ii)	
Effective alignment of compensation with 
prudent risk taking.
iii)	
Effective supervisory oversight and 
engagement by stakeholders.
Design & Structure of Remuneration process
The total compensation is a prudent mix of 
fixed remuneration and performance-based 
variable remuneration 
The key remuneration elements are:
1)	
Fixed Pay
2)	
Discretionar y 
Performance-based 
Variable Remuneration
The Bank ensures that the fixed pay element is 
reasonable, taking into account the market rates 
and trends. The fixed pay is reviewed annually 
using market intelligence provided by a leading 
global performance/reward consulting and 
benchmarking firm for financial services industry 
to ensure that the Bank remains competitive in 
278
Annual Report 2024-25
Schedules forming part of the Balance sheet
as at March 31, 2025
marketplace and that the Bank is able to attract 
and retain best talent. The level of fixed pay 
shall be sufficient enough in order to discourage 
inappropriate risk-taking.
Performance-based variable remuneration may 
comprise cash bonus, stock linked instruments, 
and is awarded by ensuring:
i)	
an appropriate balance between fixed and 
performance-based components;
ii)	
that the fixed component represents a 
higher proportion of the total remuneration;
iii)	
that the performance-based component 
reflects 
the 
risk 
underlying 
the 
achieved result;
iv)	
that a substantial part of the performance-
based component may be deferred;
v)	
that no hedging of deferred shares 
takes place;
Presently, the bank utilises only two form of 
performance based variable remuneration, 
viz.,cash bonus, ESOP, as referred in note no 18.32 
is linked to continuous service with the Bank.
The compensation policy of the Bank is reviewed 
by the NRC and approved by the Board of 
Directors. The NRC oversees the implementation 
of the policy and reviews the fixed pay increases, 
the organisational performance threshold for 
bonus to be paid, cash bonus and deferred 
variable remuneration.
C)	
Description of the ways in which current and 
future risks are taken into account in the 
remuneration process
The MD & CEO, employees in the grades of 
SVPs and above and employees engaged in 
the functions of Risk Control and Compliance 
are included in the policy of risk alignment 
of compensation.
The alignment of compensation to prudent risk 
taking is ensured through the following:
i)	
Structure of remuneration is such that 
a significant part of performance based 
variable remuneration is deferred.
ii)	
Performance hurdles includes financial 
and non-financial parameters, ensuring 
compensation is aligned to both.
iii)	
Fixed Salary is reasonable and sufficient, 
thereby discouraging inappropriate 
risk taking.
iv)	
Annual Bonus Plan is managed with an 
independent governance framework.
v)	
Variable 
remuneration 
awards 
are 
conditional, discretionary and contingent 
upon a sustainable and risk-adjusted 
performance. 
They 
are 
therefore 
capable of forfeiture or reduction at the 
Bank’s discretion.
vi)	
For employees included in the policy of risk 
alignment of compensation, NRC has the 
discretion to apply malus and clawback – 
ex-post risk adjustment, allowing the Bank 
to adjust previously awarded remuneration 
to take account of subsequent performance 
and potential risk outcomes and thus 
enabling to recoup variable pay in the event 
of a negative contribution.
Deferral of Variable Pay
To ensure that risk measures are not focused 
only on the achievement of short term goals, 
variable payout is deferred, if it exceeds 50% of 
the fixed pay.
The Bank’s compensation policy aims to ensure 
that both ex-ante estimates and ex-post 
outcomes of risk affect payoffs; so that one 
or the other, can better address the various 
situations or risks.
D)	
Description of ways in which the Bank seeks 
to link performance, during a performance 
measurement period with levels of remuneration.
The Bank has a performance measurement 
framework in place to assess the achievements 
of the organisation as a whole, its business lines 
and organisational units as well as individual 
employees. In order to maximise the incentive to 
deliver adequate performance and to take into 
account any risks of the business activities, the 
Bank seeks to closely link remuneration outcomes 
with performance and risk outcomes. Accordingly, 
the Bank’s performance management and 
compensation philosophy is designed in a manner 
to help achieve the Bank’s business objectives.
The performance management system in the 
Bank is aligned to the balanced scorecard 
approach. The goal setting process helps 
279

Statements
Schedules forming part of the Balance sheet 
as at March 31, 2025
individuals to have clarity on their roles and align 
their profiles in line with the broad organisation 
strategy. Both quantitative / financial and 
qualitative / non-financial performance measures 
are considered. The qualitative or non-financial 
measures include customer service, adherence 
to risk and compliance standards, behaviour and 
values such as accountability, team work, etc., 
which builds a culture conducive to sustainable 
business performance.
The performance appraisal process starts with 
the employee conducting self-appraisal followed 
by the assessment of the supervisor via appraisal 
feedback and discussion.
Individual fixed pay increases and variable 
remuneration are based on the final performance 
ratings. In addition, the fixed pay increase is 
also influenced by an employee’s position in 
the salary range and relevant market salaries. 
Performance related variable compensation 
is linked to corporate performance, business 
performance and individual performance. The 
performance ratings based bonus distribution 
matrix is reviewed by the NRC.
Employees engaged in all control functions 
including Compliance and Risk do not carry 
business profit targets in their goal sheets 
and hence are compensated based on their 
achievement of key result areas as per the 
balance score card. The aim is to ensure that 
the remuneration system and outcomes 
relating to such control functions maintain the 
independence of the function and Bank’s robust 
risk management framework. Accordingly, for the 
control functions, the variable pay is conservative 
to promote prudent risk management behaviour 
and the ‘pay mix’ is skewed towards fixed pay.
In the case of performance evaluation of the 
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of 
the Bank, factors such as financial performance 
measures, cost management initiatives, 
other strategic initiatives, prudential risk and 
compliance management, recognition and awards 
to the Bank, etc., is taken into account, which may 
vary from year to year depending on the Bank’s 
strategic priorities. Based on the inputs from 
NRC, the Board reviews the performance and 
recommends the rate of bonus to be paid, and 
the increments for the MD & CEO, for regulatory 
approval in terms of Section 35B of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949 (B.R. Act, 1949).
E)	
Bank’s policy on deferral and vesting of variable 
remuneration and bank’s policy and criteria for 
adjusting deferred remuneration before vesting 
and after vesting.
In terms of RBI guidelines, the Compensation Policy 
specifically addresses the following categories 
of employees:
Category I : Managing Director &Chief Executive 
Officer / Whole Time Directors / Material Risk Takers
Category II : Risk Control and Compliance Staff
Category III: Other Categories of Staff (employees 
receiving share-linked variable pay)
The following principles are applied for grant 
and deferral of performance-based variable 
remuneration for the above categories 
of employees.
Category I
i)	
Variable pay shall not exceed 3 (three) 
times the annual fixed pay for MD & CEO 
and WTDs.
ii)	
Variable pay shall not exceed 2.5 (two and 
half) times the annual fixed pay for MRTs.
iii)	
At minimum, variable pay shall be equal to

18.29 Disclosure on Derivatives
	
(i)	 Derivatives
Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying parameters like interest 
rates or foreign exchange rates. These include forward contracts, swaps, etc. These transactions may expose 
the Bank to risks primarily in the nature of market and credit risk. The following sections outline the nature and 
terms of the derivative transactions undertaken by the Bank.
Interest Rate swaps undertaken by the Bank involve the exchange of interest obligations with a counterparty 
for a specified period without exchanging the underlying principal i.e., notional amount. The Bank has 
undertaken derivative transactions in Rupee Interest Rate Swaps (OIS) only on the Astroid platform of CCIL for 
proprietary trading.
Foreign Exchange forward contracts and Foreign Exchange Swaps are agreements to buy /sell/exchange fixed 
amounts of currency against another currency at an agreed exchange rate on Spot / forward date. These 
instruments are carried at fair value.
The Bank has adopted the following mechanism for managing risks arising out of the derivative transactions.
The derivative transactions are governed by the Investment Policy and Market Risk Management Policy of the 
Bank as well as by the extant RBI guidelines. The risk limits are set up and actual exposures are monitored vis-à-vis 
the limits allocated. These limits are set up taking into account market volatility, risk appetite, business strategy 
and management experience. Risk limits are in place for risk parameters viz. Value at Risk (VaR), Maximum tenor, 
deal size and Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP). Actual positions are monitored against these limits on a daily 
basis and breaches if any are reported promptly.
The Treasury has entered into derivative transactions with interbank counterparties. The Bank has an independent 
back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines. The MTM position of the derivative portfolio is monitored 
on a daily basis. The risk profile of the outstanding portfolio is reviewed by the Board at regular intervals.
Derivative transactions such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange swap and Interest rate 
swaps outstanding as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are fair valued. The resulting profit or loss 
on valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Derivatives which are not intended for trading such 
as, Foreign Exchange forward contracts and Forex swaps and which are outstanding at balance sheet date, are 
fair valued at the FEDAI closing rate. The premium or discount arising at the inception of such Forward contracts 
and Foreign Exchange swaps are amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract. Derivatives are 
classified as assets when the fair value is positive (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities when the fair 
value is negative (negative marked to market value). Bank has placed margin/collateral to Central Counterparty 
(CCIL) for various asset classes, wherever applicable.

18.32 Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS)
On July 26, 2017 the board of directors approved the Bandhan Bank Employee Stock Option Plan Series 1 for issue 
of stock options to eligible employees and directors of the Bank.
The Shareholders of the Bank at the meeting held on November 23, 2017 has approved the Employee Stock Option 
Plan Series 1 and the grant of Employee Stock Option to the employees of the Bank. The said approval accords the 
Board of Directors of the Bank or any Committee including the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which 
the Board has constituted, to create, offer, and grant at any time to permanent employees of the Bank, including 
any Director of the Bank, whether whole-time or otherwise but excluding Promoter(s), Independent Directors and 
Directors holding directly or indirectly more than 10% of the outstanding equity shares, employee stock options from 
time to time in one or more tranches.
This plan was framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme & Employee Stock Purchase 
Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting 
for the stock options has been in accordance with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 to 
the extent applicable.
Employee Stock Option Plan Series 1 provides for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding 
the date when options are granted. The closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the 
highest trading volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant set forth by the NRC at the time of grant. 
The period in which the options may be exercised cannot exceed five years from date of expiry of vesting period. 
However, if the participant’s employment terminates due to retirement (including pursuant to any early/ voluntary 
retirement scheme), the whole of the unvested options shall vest on the first vesting date relating to the said grant, 
immediately following the date of superannuation. During the years ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, few 
modifications were made to the terms and conditions of ESOPs as approved by the NRC.

Fair value methodology
The weighted average fair value of stock option granted during the year was ₹60.96. The fair value of options used 
to compute the proforma net profit and earnings per equity share have been estimated on the dates of each grant 
using the binomial option-pricing model. The Bank estimates the volatility based on the historical prices of its equity 
shares. The various assumptions considered in the pricing model for the ESOPs granted during the year ended 
March 31, 2025 are:
Particulars
As at March 31, 2025
Dividend yield (%)
0-0.93%
Expected volatility (%)
36.51%,37.95%,49.20%,49.11%
Risk-free interest rate (%)
6.53%, 6.56%, 6,58%, 6.61%
Expected remaining life of the options (yrs)
0.25-8.92 yrs
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The Bank measures the cost of ESOP using the Fair valuation method w.e.f April 01, 2021. Had the Bank used the fair 
value model to determine compensation for options granted before April 01, 2021, its profit after tax and earnings 
per share as reported would have changed as indicated below:
