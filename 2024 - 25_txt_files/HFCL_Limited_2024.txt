Data Privacy 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk and 
Opportunity
As a technology-driven Company, 
safeguarding 
sensitive 
and 
confidential information is critical 
to 
maintaining 
stakeholder 
trust 
and 
business 
integrity. 
Ensuring robust data security 
and upholding individuals’ rights 
to privacy in the collection, use, 
and sharing of personal data 
are 
essential 
to 
compliance, 
reputation, and risk mitigation. 
With increasing digitalisation and 
evolving regulatory frameworks, 
any lapse in data privacy or 
cybersecurity could expose the 
Company to legal, financial, and 
reputational 
risks. 
Therefore, 
managing 
data 
privacy 
and 
cybersecurity 
effectively 
is 
a 
top priority to ensure business 
continuity 
and 
long-term 
stakeholder confidence.
HFCL 
prioritises 
the 
implementation 
of 
robust 
measures 
and 
structured 
processes to protect sensitive 
information at every level of the 
organisation. We collect only 
the data necessary for business 
operations, ensuring it is handled 
securely and in compliance with 
applicable regulations. Our IT 
management system is certified 
under ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and 
ISO/IEC 27701:2019, reflecting 
our commitment to the highest 
standards of information and 
privacy security. Comprehensive 
policies 
and 
governance 
frameworks are in place to 
oversee 
data 
protection 
practices. 
In 
addition, 
we 
conduct 
regular 
compliance 
audits, 
update 
policies 
proactively in line with evolving 
regulations, 
and 
organise 
periodic risk awareness and 
training sessions to reinforce 
our cybersecurity posture and 
minimise vulnerabilities.

Climate 
Change
Risk
Climate change presents a risk to 
HFCL’s operations, supply chains, 
and long-term value creation. 
Physical risks such as extreme 
weather 
events 
can 
disrupt 
operations, damage assets, and 
impact supply chain continuity, 
leading to increased costs and 
operational delays. In parallel, 
transition 
risks, 
arising 
from 
evolving regulations, stakeholder 
expectations, and shifts toward 
low-carbon 
technologies, 
can 
affect market competitiveness, 
reduce 
asset 
value, 
and 
impact 
investor 
confidence. 
ESG 
disclosures 
help 
bring 
transparency to the Company’s 
climate risk exposure and outline 
the mitigation and adaptation 
strategies in place. Addressing 
climate risks is critical not only for 
regulatory compliance but also for 
safeguarding business resilience 
and long-term sustainability.
HFCL places strong emphasis 
on 
implementing 
strategies 
and actions aimed at mitigating 
climate-related 
risks 
while 
aligning its operations with 
principles 
of 
sustainable 
development. 
The 
Company 
integrates climate resilience into 
its decision-making processes 
and actively works to reduce its 
environmental impact through 
energy-efficient 
technologies, 
responsible 
resource 
management, and sustainable 
business practices.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk and 
Opportunity
HFCL recognises the sustainable 
supply chain as a strategic risk and 
opportunity to build resilience, 
enhance operational efficiency, 
and 
strengthen 
stakeholder 
trust. As a technology-driven 
manufacturing 
Company, 
aligning supply chain practices 
with 
ESG 
principles 
enables 
HFCL to reduce environmental 
impact, 
promote 
ethical 
sourcing, and ensure regulatory 
compliance. 
By 
collaborating 
with responsible suppliers and 
promoting transparency across 
the value chain, the Company can 
drive long-term value creation, 
mitigate potential disruptions, 
and 
unlock 
cost 
efficiencies 
through resource optimisation. 
A sustainable supply chain also 
supports 
HFCL’s 
commitment 
to circularity, innovation, and 
responsible growth, reinforcing its 
competitive position in a dynamic 
global market.
The 
Company’s 
integrated 
business model, both vertically 
and horizontally, supports a 
streamlined and efficient supply 
chain, 
helping 
to 
improve 
performance and lower costs. 
To 
strengthen 
resilience, 
the 
Company 
is 
adopting 
sustainable practices to address 
climate 
change, 
broadening 
its supplier base to mitigate 
geopolitical risks, and securing 
alternative sources to manage 
potential raw material shortages.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Effective occupational health and 
safety 
management 
presents 
both a critical risk and a strategic 
opportunity 
for 
HFCL. 
Given 
the manufacturing and field-
intensive nature of its operations, 
inadequate 
safety 
measures 
can lead to workplace incidents, 
regulatory violations, reputational 
harm, 
and 
disruptions 
in 
business continuity. Conversely, 
maintaining 
a 
strong 
OHS 
framework enhances workforce 
well-being, ensures compliance, 
improves 
productivity, 
and 
strengthens 
stakeholder 
confidence in the Company’s 
responsible business practices.
HFCL adopts a comprehensive 
and 
proactive 
approach 
to 
managing occupational health 
and safety risks across all its 
operations. 
The 
Company 
maintains safe, healthy, and 
hygienic working conditions for 
all employees, contractors, and 
temporary staff by aligning its 
Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System (OHSMS) 
with ISO 45001 standards. A 
Zero Tolerance (ZETO) approach 
is followed to eliminate unsafe 
practices and promote a risk-
aware 
culture. 
Regular 
risk 
assessments, 
medical 
check-
ups, safety drills, and visual 
inspections are conducted to 
prevent work-related injuries 
and illnesses. Employees are 
actively 
engaged 
in 
safety 
matters through consultation 
and capacity-building initiatives. 
Compliance with all applicable 
OHS laws and international best 
practices is strictly ensured, and 
continuous improvements are 
driven through audits, incident 
investigations, and corrective 
actions.

Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Ineffective waste management 
can 
result 
in 
environmental 
degradation, 
legal 
non-
compliance, 
and 
reputational 
risks. 
As 
a 
manufacturing 
company, 
HFCL 
generates 
various types of waste including 
hazardous, non-hazardous, and 
e-waste, which require proper 
handling and disposal. Poor waste 
management practices can lead to 
pollution, community concerns, 
and increased operational costs. 
Therefore, ensuring responsible 
waste disposal and minimisation 
is 
essential 
to 
maintaining 
environmental 
stewardship, 
regulatory 
compliance, 
and 
stakeholder trust.
HFCL 
has 
implemented 
a 
comprehensive 
waste 
management system across all its 
operations. Waste is categorised 
and segregated at source, with 
hazardous 
waste 
managed 
by Central Pollution Control 
Boards' 
(CPCB) 
authorised 
vendors. Non-hazardous waste 
is either recycled, reused within 
operations (where feasible), or 
sent to authorised recyclers.
All raw materials used in the 
manufacturing of Optical Fiber 
and Optical Fiber Cables are 
RoHS and REACH compliant. 
HFCL also proactively reduces 
hazardous materials through 
design innovations, such as 
shifting to dry-core cables to 
reduce petroleum based jelly, 
and promotes circular practices 
by recycling packaging materials 
and sending used spools and 
containers back to suppliers. 
Regular 
audits, 
training, 
and 
compliance 
monitoring 
are 
conducted 
to 
ensure 
continuous improvement and 
alignment with regulatory and 
sustainability goals.
Positive
8.
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity HFCL recognises diversity and 
inclusion as a strategic opportunity 
to foster innovation, enhance 
employee engagement, and build 
a resilient workforce. Embracing 
diverse perspectives and creating 
an inclusive work environment 
strengthens 
decision-making, 
drives creativity, and improves 
overall 
organisational 
performance. A diverse talent 
pool also enables the Company 
to better understand and serve a 
broad range of stakeholders. By 
promoting equal opportunities 
and inclusive practices, HFCL 
positions itself as an employer 
of choice, contributing to long-
term growth, social equity, and 
business sustainability.

facility. This transition from conventional microwave-based systems 
is projected to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 5,022 metric 
tons annually.
•	 Green Corridor Development: Continued efforts to preserve local 
biodiversity through the maintenance of a 10,200 square meter green 
corridor within the TSIIC Industrial Area, contributing to ecological balance 
and enhancing the industrial ecosystem.
At Goa Plant:
•	 Renewable Energy Transition: As part of our sustainability roadmap, Goa 
Plant has set a target to achieve a cumulative 40% transition to renewable 
energy by the FY 2026-27.

Governance, leadership, and oversight
7.	 Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
At HFCL, we view sustainability not merely as a responsibility but as a strategic imperative that drives long-term value 
creation. This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report reflects our continued commitment to embedding ESG 
principles across our operations, value chain, and stakeholder engagements.
	
Throughout FY 2024–25, we have taken significant steps to deepen our environmental stewardship. Our facilities are 
increasingly being modernised with advanced, energy-efficient technologies that promote resource optimisation and 
reduce environmental impact. We are proud to have achieved Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and Zero Waste to Landfill at 
several of our manufacturing units and are on track to scale these practices further. For instance, our Hyderabad Optical 
Fiber Plant is set to install a 1 MWp rooftop solar system in FY 2025–26, estimated to generate 1.5 million units of clean 
energy annually and reduce carbon emissions by over 1,200 metric tons. The plant has also adopted LED lighting and is 
working toward ZLD certification and green corridor development. Similarly, our Goa facility is targeting a 40% transition 
to renewable energy by FY 2026–27, and our Hyderabad Optical Fiber Cable Plant is working towards Zero Waste to 
Landfill certifications.
	
Social impact remains at the core of our sustainability journey. Internally, we prioritize employee well-being by 
implementing initiatives that support mental health and foster a safe, inclusive workplace environment. Externally, 
through the HFCL Social Services Society (HSSS) and other CSR partners, we harness technology to enhance access to 
healthcare and education in underserved communities, benefiting individuals via mobile medical clinics and e-learning 
platforms. These efforts embody our commitment to leveraging technology as a catalyst for inclusive development and 
social equity.
	
Strong governance remains the foundation of our ESG strategy. We have embedded sustainability considerations into 
our business planning, risk management, and decision-making processes. Oversight at the leadership level ensures that 
our ESG priorities are aligned with stakeholder expectations, guided by transparency, ethical conduct, and continuous 
improvement.
	
As we look ahead, we remain focused on advancing our sustainability roadmap with clear, measurable goals and deep 
accountability ensuring HFCL continues to deliver positive impact for people, the planet, and our broader ecosystem.

*The percentage contribution of purchases with RPTs to the total purchases has been revised from 10% to 11% due to a rounding error. This correction 
reflects the accurate proportion of RPT within the overall purchases.
**The ratio of Loans & Advances given to related parties to total Loans & Advances has been restated from 13% to 91%. This adjustment was made because 
the amount recorded previously reflected transactions during the year instead of the closing balance, which has now been corrected.

Yes.
	
As a part of its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Members of the Board of Directors (“Code”), the Company 
has instituted detailed provisions to address conflicts of interest. In addition to this, the Company has formulated 
internal policies and mechanisms that outline various safeguards and measures to manage conflicts of interests.

https://www.hfcl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Code-of-Business-Conduct-and-Ethics-Board-of-
Directors_22052025.pdf
	
To uphold transparency, integrity, and the prevention of conflicts of interest within the Company and its Board of 
Directors, following key provisions are in place:
•	 Employment & Outside Engagements: Whole-time Directors are prohibited from engaging in activities that 
may compromise their responsibilities to the Company or conflict with its interests. This includes refraining from 
simultaneous employment with suppliers, customers, or competitors, and from any activity that may support a 
competitor’s position. Any potential conflict must be disclosed to the Audit Committee.
•	 Outside Directorships: Directors are not permitted to accept assignments with companies or agencies that compete 
with HFCL without obtaining prior approval from the Company’s Audit Committee.
146
HFCL Limited  |  Annual Report 2024-25
•	 Business Interests: Directors must seek approval from the Audit Committee before entering into any business 
relationship with a customer, supplier or competitor of the Company, ensuring such involvement does not compromise 
their responsibilities to HFCL.
•	 Related Party Transactions: Directors are expected to avoid conducting Company business with relatives or with 
entities in which relatives hold a significant role. If such transactions are unavoidable, they must seek the approval of 
the Audit Committee, in accordance with applicable laws.
•	 Gifts and Hospitality: Directors must not accept payments, costly gifts or anything of significant value from 
customers, vendors or consultants that could be perceived as intended to improperly influence decisions. Modest, 
infrequent gifts, business meals or entertainment that do not create a perception of impropriety are permissible.
•	 Corporate Opportunities: Directors are prohibited from personally exploiting opportunities that arise through 
access to Company property, information or position. Any such opportunity must be fully disclosed in writing to the 
Board and may only be pursued with its explicit approval.
	
These measures uphold transparency, integrity, and the prevention of conflicts of interest within the Company and its 
Board of Directors.

HFCL has established a sustainable procurement process that integrates Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) compliance as a mandatory requirement during vendor onboarding and registration. The Company’s 
procurement decisions are guided by the principle of total cost of ownership, evaluating not just price, but 
also environmental, social, and lifecycle impacts to ensure long-term value and sustainability. All vendors and 
suppliers undergo a structured assessment designed to mitigate sustainability-related risks at the outset. HFCL 
Plants follow a comprehensive sourcing checklist as a fundamental criterion for supplier selection during raw 
material procurement. This checklist covers critical parameters including Quality, Environment, Health and 
Safety, Social responsibility, Sustainability, and Business Continuity. As part of this process, vendors are required 
to submit relevant compliance documentation and provide a formal undertaking affirming their commitment 
to ethical and sustainable business practices. This includes adherence to human rights principles, as well as 
applicable environmental and social standards and certifications, such as ISO quality management systems, 
OHSAS, or equivalent frameworks. Suppliers found to be non-compliant with HFCL’s sustainability requirements 
may face contract suspension or termination, unless appropriate corrective actions are taken within a 
reasonable timeframe.

Permanent Workers
Yes, HFCL fosters a culture of transparency and open communication between employees 
and management across all levels. The Company has put in place various measures to 
ensure a safe, inclusive, and supportive work environment for all employees and workers.
Employees and workers are encouraged to raise grievances in writing with their immediate 
supervisor, department head, or HR business partner. These concerns are addressed through 
a personal hearing, with efforts made to resolve them at the earliest stage. If unresolved, the 
grievance may be escalated to higher management, such as the Plant Head, Function or 
Business Head, or the Managing Director.
In addition, HFCL has appointed a Vigilance Officer under its Whistle Blower Policy, through 
whom employees and workers can confidentially report concerns. The Vigilance Officer 
reviews and investigates the complaints and submits findings to the Audit Committee for 
appropriate action.
To address incidents of sexual harassment, the Company has constituted Internal 
Complaints Committees (ICCs) at every workplace, in line with its Policy on Prevention of 
Sexual Harassment (POSH), ensuring timely and sensitive resolution of complaints.

environmental and social topics. As part of the Company’s materiality assessment, a structured stakeholder engagement 
process was carried out to consult all key stakeholder groups, including employees, workers, suppliers, customers, 
and NGO/CSR project partners. Through this process, HFCL identified and prioritised material environmental and 
social topics relevant to its business and value chain. The insights gathered were thoroughly reviewed and formed

In the area of healthcare, HFCL partnered with St. Stephen’s Patient Welfare Society to facilitate corrective orthopedic 
surgeries for 92 underprivileged individuals, primarily children, affected by polio-related deformities, clubfoot, 
and congenital musculoskeletal abnormalities. This initiative restored their mobility and independence, enabling 
beneficiaries to reintegrate into education and livelihood opportunities.
	
HFCL also collaborated with the National Heart Institute to support life-saving cardiac surgeries for 40 economically 
disadvantaged patients suffering from severe cardiovascular conditions. The goal of this initiative was to remove 
financial barriers to treatment and significantly improved survival outcomes.
	
To strengthen access to primary and preventive healthcare, HFCL deployed Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) across five 
geographies: Solan, Goa, Sardarshahar, Ghazipur, and Hyderabad. These units delivered free doorstep healthcare 
services including general checkups, essential medicines, diagnostic tests, maternal and child health support, and 
awareness programs. During FY 2024–25, the MMUs reached over 1.32 lakh individuals in underserved communities.

communities, equipping them with essential digital skills to improve employability and support participation in the

disadvantaged patients suffering from critical cardiovascular conditions, 
including congenital heart defects, valvular diseases, and ischemic heart 
ailments. These complex and costly procedures, often inaccessible to families 
below the poverty line, were fully funded, eliminating any expenses for the 
patients. The program played a vital role in preventing avoidable deaths, 
reducing long-term disabilities, and demonstrated a successful model of 
inclusive tertiary healthcare. All beneficiaries belonged to financially and 
socially marginalized communities, in alignment with HFCL’s commitment to 
healthcare equity.

HFCL primarily operates in the Business-to-Business (B2B) segment, where customer engagement and 
feedback mechanisms differ from conventional consumer-facing models. Instead of conducting formal 
surveys, HFCL gathers regular customer feedback through structured interactions such as business meetings, 
technical discussions, review calls, and follow-ups. These channels allow for real-time insights into customer 
expectations, satisfaction levels, and scope for improvement. This ongoing dialogue helps HFCL maintain 
high service standards, address specific client requirements promptly, and foster long-term partnerships.
