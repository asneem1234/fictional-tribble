Data Security 
Risk 
With the continued growth of the Company 
and its subsidiaries in delivering products 
and services through digital platforms, 
managing the dual priorities of data-driven 
innovation and customer privacy has 
become increasingly complex. The reliance 
on various forms of user data including 
personal, demographic, behavioural, and 
content-related 
information 
to 
tailor 
experiences and support business growth 
may lead to heightened oversight from 
global regulatory bodies. Furthermore, 
offering cloud-based solutions and IT 
In response to these challenges, the 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
are 
committed to adopting comprehensive 
data 
governance 
frameworks 
that 
emphasize regulatory compliance and the 
safeguarding of user privacy. Proactive 
oversight in this domain is essential to 
preserving stakeholder confidence and 
supporting long-term business resilience.

additional 
concerns, particularly around the possibility 
of government entities accessing user data, 
potentially leading to infringements of

Intellectual Property 
Protection & Competitive 
Behaviour 
Risk 
The Company and its subsidiaries have 
strategically invested in safeguarding their 
intellectual 
assets, 
including 
securing 
trademarks, copyrights, and other key forms 
of 
IP 
that 
underpin 
innovation 
and 
competitive advantage. Our ability to operate 
effectively depends on leveraging proprietary 
technologies while avoiding infringement on 
third-party 
rights. 
Nonetheless, 
there 
remains a risk of legal disputes arising from 
alleged violations of intellectual property or 
copyright laws. Unfavourable outcomes in

Recognizing the importance of mitigating 
intellectual property risks, the Company 
and its subsidiaries have instituted a robust 
framework 
to 
safeguard 
proprietary 
innovations. This includes well-defined 
protocols for handling confidential and 
sensitive 
information 
related 
to 
intellectual 
assets. 
When 
acquiring 
intellectual 
property, 
we 
undertake 
rigorous 
due 
diligence

where 
appropriate, secure indemnification from 
third-party developers. The agreements 
with employees, workers and external 
developers are carefully structured to 
ensure the assignment of rights for all IP

Managing Systemic Risks 
from Technology 
Disruptions 
Risk 
The Company and its subsidiaries understand 
the importance of proactively addressing 
systemic 
risks 
linked 
to 
technological 
disruption, especially in an industry heavily 
dependent on digital systems. Accelerating 
innovation, escalating cybersecurity threats, 
and the possibility of technical failures 
present tangible risks, including operational 
interruptions, compromised data integrity, 
and financial losses. Given our role in 
delivering 
cybersecurity, 
digital 
transformation, and enterprise solutions, any 
significant disruption in our technology 
ecosystem could trigger downstream effects - 
impacting business continuity not only 
internally but also across our client network 
and stakeholder community. 
To mitigate the impact of potential 
technology disruptions, the Company and 
its subsidiaries have established a multi-
layered 
approach 
on 
resilience 
and 
preparedness. 
This 
includes 
the 
deployment of advanced cybersecurity 
measures, 
real-time 
infrastructure 
monitoring, and frequent upgrades to 
address emerging threats. A detailed 
business continuity framework ensures 
rapid response and recovery in the face of 
unforeseen incidents. In addition, ongoing 
risk evaluations and scenario planning 
exercises enable the organization to 
anticipate 
challenges 
and 
maintain 
consistent service delivery, reinforcing trust 
among clients and stakeholders.

Customer Welfare 
Opportunity 
Placing customer welfare at the forefront 
presents a strategic opportunity for the 
Company and its subsidiaries to strengthen 
market differentiation and cultivate enduring 
client relationships. By embedding client 
satisfaction into the core of solution 
development, 
the 
company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries strive to deliver experiences that 
consistently 
surpass 
expectations. 
This 
customer-centric focus not only reinforces 
loyalty but also aligns with a broader global 
shift toward ethical, transparent, and user-
first business models. In turn, this approach 
enhances 
brand 
credibility, 
supports 
sustainable 
growth 
and 
contributes 
meaningfully 
to 
long-term 
revenue 
generation.
