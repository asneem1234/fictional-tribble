Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
Positive or negative 
implications)
1
Data privacy 
and Security
Risk
The identification of data 
privacy and security risks 
arises from the need 
to safeguard sensitive 
customer 
information, 
comply 
with 
legal 
obligations, protect the 
Company’s 
reputation, 
maintain continuity of 
business 
operations, 
and 
secure 
valuable 
intellectual property..
EaseMyTrip 
addresses 
the risk through a multi-
faceted approach. There 
is 
a 
comprehensive 
Risk 
Management 
policy and a dedicated 
Risk 
Management 
Committee to oversee 
data 
related 
matters. 
The company employs 
robust data protection 
measures, adheres to 
relevant 
regulations, 
and 
provides 
regular 
training to employees. 
EaseMyTrip has incident 
response protocols in 
place in the event of a 
breach.
These 
actions 
demonstrate 
their 
commitment 
to 
protecting 
customer 
data, 
ensuring 
compliance, 
and 
maintaining 
a 
secure 
environment.
Negative: 
A 
potential 
breach or mishandling 
of sensitive data could 
result 
in 
financial 
losses and reputational 
damage. 
Negative 
implications 
include 
the potential loss of 
sensitive data impacting 
the 
company’s 
brand 
image and trust among 
stakeholders.
Additionally, unmanaged 
threats to corporate data 
can lead to financial and 
reputational damages.
2
Business 
Ethics and 
Governance
Risk
The 
risk 
of 
business 
ethics and integrity at 
EaseMyTrip arises from 
the need to protect 
reputation, build trust, 
ensure legal compliance, 
maintain 
employee 
morale, attract investors, 
and preserve customer 
loyalty. 
Upholding 
high ethical standards 
is 
crucial 
to 
avoid 
legal 
consequences, 
reputational 
damage, 
and negative stakeholder 
perception.
EaseMyTrip 
has 
implemented measures 
like the establishment 
of a Code of Conduct, 
conducting 
regular 
ethics 
training 
for 
employees, maintaining 
a Whistleblower Policy 
to encourage reporting 
of concerns, monitoring 
compliance 
through 
internal 
controls, 
ensuring 
transparent 
governance 
practices, 
and 
potentially 
collaborating 
with 
external organizations. 
Both 
Negative 
and 
Positive: The negative 
financial 
implications 
of ethical risks involve 
legal 
consequences, 
reputational 
damage, 
and decreased employee
productivity.
However, the positive 
financial 
implications 
include 
enhanced 
stakeholder 
trust, 
investor confidence, and 
competitive advantage.

Note: Being a travel and tour operating company, our principal products and services are airline tickets, hotels and 
holiday packages, rail and bus tickets, taxi rentals and ancillary services such as travel insurance, visa processing and

travel package dealers. Given the large interface of our suppliers with the customers from all backgrounds, they are 
legally required to adhere to stringent norms related to environment, health and safety and therefore, do not require 
dedicated awareness programs on sustainability issues to be provided to them by us. However, we engage with our 
suppliers regularly to foster collaborative partnerships on all issues impacting the travel and tourism industry and 
promote sustainable travel for our customers.
