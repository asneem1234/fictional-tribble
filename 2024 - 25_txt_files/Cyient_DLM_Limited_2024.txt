Energy  
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk: Energy management is a significant risk due to its 
reliance on a stable energy supply. Disruptions such as 
power outages can severely impact production schedules 
and 
operational 
efficiency. 
Regulatory 
pressures 
to reduce carbon emissions and adopt sustainable 
practices can lead to substantial compliance costs and 
potential penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, the 
volatility of energy prices makes it challenging to predict 
and manage operational costs, further exacerbating 
financial risks. The environmental footprint, including 
greenhouse gas emissions, can attract negative attention 
from stakeholders, potentially harming the company’s 
reputation and market position.
Opportunity: Energy management offers a major 
advantage. Adopting energy-efficient technologies 
reduces consumption and costs, boosting profitability and 
competitiveness. Shifting to renewables like solar ensures 
cost stability and shields against fossil fuel price swings. 
Companies excelling in energy management enhance 
their reputation, attracting eco-conscious investors and 
customers. Additionally, proactive strategies help meet 
environmental regulations, avoiding fines and unlocking 
government incentives for sustainable practices.
We are adopting a multifaceted approach 
that 
emphasizes 
sustainability 
and 
efficiency. We are significantly increasing 
the proportion of renewable energy in 
our portfolio, particularly through the 
integration of solar power. Our commitment 
to promoting energy efficiency is evident 
in our upgrades to LED lighting and solar-
powered energy. Additionally, we are 
investing in a variety of energy efficiency 
measures across our facilities to minimize 
our environmental impact. This includes 
replacing 
traditional, 
energy-intensive 
devices with eco-friendly alternatives such 
as energy efficient equipment’s, optimizing 
manufacturing processes to reduce energy 
consumption and emissions. Motion sensor 
lights and usage of modular workstations 
which can contribute to energy conservation 
through efficient space utilization and 
reduced construction waste.
Negative / Positive

Hazardous 
Materials 
Management
Risk
Risk: Risk of inappropriate handling and disposal of 
hazardous waste, caused by insufficient training or 
lack of adherence to safety protocols. This may result 
in environmental pollution, health risks to employees 
and communities, and legal penalties. Compliance with 
regulations such as the ISO 14001 can help in avoiding 
fines and regulatory compliance. Employee training and 
engagement regarding waste management and disposal 
are also crucial.
Our facility uses segregated bins for different 
waste streams, processed by certified and 
authorized vendors to ensure compliance 
with waste management practices. The 
waste generated is segregated and disposed 
off to authorized vendors (certified by the 
respective PCB). Wastewater generated 
from the facility is recycled (in house STP 
plant) and this treated water is used for 
landscaping. The food waste and dry waste 
is collected and by way of vermicompost 
process, manure is generated and used 
for inhouse landscaping. We also conduct 
employee 
training 
and 
engagement, 
through educational programs that are 
crucial waste management.

Greenhouse 
Gases and 
Climate 
Change
Risk
Risk: The shift to a low-carbon economy presents 
significant risks due to its reliance on global supply chains 
and energy-intensive operations. Climate change can 
lead to severe weather events, disrupting supply chains 
and impacting raw material availability. Transitioning to 
renewable energy sources poses financial challenges, 
requiring 
substantial 
capital 
investment. 
Rapid 
innovation is necessary to keep pace with low-carbon 
technologies, posing risks for companies that lag. 
Additionally, climate change can exacerbate the scarcity 
of critical raw materials, increasing costs and supply 
chain vulnerabilities. Also, physical risks, such as extreme 
weather events and rising sea levels, which can damage 
facilities and disrupt supply chains.
Addressing climate transition and physical 
risks involves adopting cleaner technologies, 
implementing 
carbon 
management 
strategies, and investing in energy-efficient 
solutions. Our facilities are operating largely 
on LED - which reduces heat generation. 
Our Mysore facilities are operating 80% 
on renewable energy thereby reducing 
carbon emissions. We undertake periodic 
tree plantation drives across all our sites 
as part of the green initiative. Engaging 
with stakeholders to communicate climate 
strategies builds reputation and trust. 
Comprehensive 
employee 
training 
on 
safety protocols and sustainable resource 
management practices further mitigates 
risks.
Negative

Human 
Capital 
Management
Opportunity Opportunity: In the highly competitive landscape 
effective human capital and labour management present 
significant opportunities. Given the sensitivity to labour 
costs and the necessity to meet stringent production 
deadlines for new technology releases, maintaining 
positive relations is crucial. Poor management can lead to 
work stoppages and production disruptions, which not 
only reduce near-term revenue but also adversely affect 
long-term productivity due to diminished employee 
morale. By fostering good human relations, companies 
can mitigate these risks and ensure smooth operations. 
Furthermore, these practices enhance an entity’s brand 
value and social license to operate, as they demonstrate 
a commitment to ethical standards and employee 
well-being. Additionally, investing in human capital 
through continuous training and development equips 
employees with the latest skills, fostering innovation and 
adaptability in a rapidly evolving industry. Thus, strategic 
human capital and labour management are not merely 
operational necessities but pivotal opportunities for 
resilience and competitiveness.

Upholding a Zero-Violation Standard for Data Privacy Information: We ensure the highest 
standards of data privacy through continuous monitoring and annual audits, adhering to 
compliance and safeguarding sensitive information.
Increasing Community Engagement Programs: We are dedicated to fostering strong 
relationships with the communities we serve by increasing our involvement in community 
engagement programs that address local needs and promote social well-being.
Achieving Gender Diversity: We strive to create a diverse and inclusive workplace by setting 
and achieving gender diversity targets, ensuring equal opportunities for all employees.
Continuous Employee Training & Development: We prioritize the growth and development 
of our employees through continuous training programs that enhance their skills and 
knowledge, preparing them for future challenges.
Promoting Ethical Labour Practices and Fair Trade: We are committed to upholding ethical 
labor practices and promoting fair trade, ensuring that our operations are conducted with 
integrity and respect for human rights.
Strengthening Corporate Governance and Transparency: We aim to strengthen our 
corporate governance framework and enhance transparency in our operations, fostering trust

6.
Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals 
and targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
We have undertaken several initiatives aimed at meeting our commitments, goals, and targets. 
Here are the key actions and their outcomes in the FY 2024-25:
Installation of LED Lights: We have embarked on a significant initiative to replace outdated 
lighting fixtures with energy-efficient LED lights across all our sites. As of now, 90% of our sites 
are equipped with LED lighting. These lights not only reduce heat generation but also provide 
the required LUX levels, enhancing the effectiveness of air conditioning systems due to lower 
heat emissions.
Energy Audits: We conduct comprehensive energy audits for all critical equipment at our sites. 
Based on the audit reports, we initiate corrective actions and implement necessary steps to 
optimize power consumption, ensuring efficient energy use.
Installation of LED-Based Street Lights: As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiative, we have installed 25 solar-powered LED streetlights in Mysore. These fixtures are 
equipped with solar panels that store energy in batteries, providing illumination at night. The 
lights are sensor and timer-based, automatically switching on and off according to the set time, 
resulting in significant energy savings.
Renewable Energy: At our Mysore plant, we previously utilized 40% renewable energy (solar 
power) and 60% grid power. In the FY25, we installed 500 kWp of solar panels, which shall 
facilitate our Mysore Plant-1 to operate on 80% renewable energy from FY 26. Additionally, our 
plant at Abhitech Park relies on ~80% renewable energy since its commissioning.
Power Factor Correction for Better Energy Savings: We have upgraded our capacitor bank 
with new capacitors to improve the power factor, contributing to better energy savings.
Installation of New Air Compressor: We have replaced conventional compressors with 
Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) controlled compressors that adjust their operation based on 
load, thereby reducing power consumption.

for the business responsibility 
report, 
highlighting 
ESG 
related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement 
of this disclosure)
The Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) industry is navigating a rapidly evolving landscape 
marked by significant Environmental, Social, and Governance challenges, including high carbon 
emissions, complex global supply chains, and increasing cybersecurity threats. At Cyient DLM, 
we view these challenges as catalysts for transformation and have embedded ESG principles at 
the core of our strategic vision. Our environmental initiatives are focused on achieving net-zero 
emissions through the adoption of renewable energy, low-carbon manufacturing practices, 
and the use of environmentally certified materials such as RoHS and REACH-compliant 
components. These efforts have led to a measurable reduction in our environmental footprint. 
On the social front, we are committed to upholding responsible labor standards and enhancing 
worker welfare across our operations. Through the Cyient Foundation, we continue to support 
underprivileged children and unemployed women by providing access to education, skill 
development, and employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the socio-economic 
upliftment of communities.
In terms of governance, we have implemented stringent cybersecurity protocols and 
strengthened our internal controls to ensure data integrity and operational resilience. Our 
Design-led Manufacturing approach, which spans the entire product lifecycle from concept to 
certification, reflects our commitment to delivering high-reliability solutions that meet the most 
rigorous standards of safety, performance, and cost-efficiency. With advanced manufacturing 
facilities across India and a global footprint, we are well-positioned to deliver value-driven 
solutions that transform businesses through innovation and technology. As part of our ongoing 
evolution, we are transitioning our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee into a 
broader CSR and ESG Committee. This integrated governance structure will enable us to align 
our sustainability efforts more effectively and drive long-term value creation for all stakeholders. 
Our unwavering focus on excellence, accountability, and innovation continues to guide us as 
we build a more sustainable and inclusive future.

incident, our fire and safety departments are immediately alerted, ensuring swift response and intervention. Employees who 
report incidents receive automatic email notifications at the commencement of the investigation, along with regular updates

Installation of LED 
Light Fixtures
In a significant move towards enhancing energy 
efficiency, we have transitioned 95% of our lighting 
fixtures across all facilities to state-of-the-art, energy-
efficient LED technology. This upgrade not only 
underscores our commitment to reducing energy 
consumption but also takes advantage of the longer 
lifespan and lower maintenance requirements of LED 
lighting.
This comprehensive adoption of LED lighting has 
resulted in a marked decrease in our overall energy 
usage and a substantial reduction in maintenance 
costs. By embracing this advanced technology, we 
are not only cutting down on operational expenses 
but also reinforcing our dedication to sustainable 
and environmentally responsible practices.
3
Rainwater 
Harvesting System
Across all our sites, we have implemented advanced 
rainwater harvesting systems. These systems are 
meticulously designed to capture and channel 
rainwater into designated catchment areas, ensuring 
efficient collection and utilization of this precious 
resource.
This innovative approach not only significantly 
enhances our water conservation efforts but also 
plays a pivotal role in replenishing groundwater 
levels at our facilities. By adopting these sustainable 
practices, we are actively contributing to the 
preservation of natural resources and fostering a 
more resilient environmental ecosystem.
4
Improving Water 
Efficiency
In our ongoing quest to enhance water efficiency, 
we have outfitted all washrooms with sensor-based 
taps. These intelligent fixtures are designed to 
minimize water wastage by ensuring precise control 
over water flow. Additionally, we have implemented 
advanced Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) at our 
offices, enabling us to recycle wastewater effectively. 
This treated water is then repurposed for gardening 
and other non-potable uses.
The deployment of sensor-based taps and the 
integration of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) have 
markedly reduced our reliance on groundwater. By 
establishing robust water consumption controls, 
these initiatives have not only curtailed excess 
water usage but also promoted the sustainable 
utilization of water resources. This strategic 
approach ensures long-term ecological balance 
and enhances our operational efficiency.
5
Adopting 
Circularity
We have devised a comprehensive strategy to 
significantly reduce plastic usage across all facets 
of our operations. This initiative has already 
yielded impressive results. Additionally, we have 
implemented a robust system for converting garden 
and food waste into nutrient-rich vermicompost. 
This organic fertilizer is then utilized to nourish our 
gardens, promoting a circular economy within our 
facilities.
The transformation of food and garden waste into 
vermicompost has enriched our soil with essential 
nutrients, fostering healthier plant growth. This 
practice not only reduces our dependence on 
synthetic fertilizers but also diverts substantial 
amounts of organic waste from landfills. By 
embracing these sustainable practices, we are 
contributing to an eco-friendlier and resource-
efficient future.
