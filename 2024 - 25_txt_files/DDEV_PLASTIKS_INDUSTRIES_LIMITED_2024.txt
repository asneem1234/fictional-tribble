defined timelines, if any.
The Company is dedicated to improving performance in all

toilet flushing, and gardening, reinforcing a circular approach to 
water management. These measures collectively demonstrate the 
Company’s strong progress towards its ESG commitments.

As a responsible organisation in the plastics sector, the Company is committed to addressing ESG challenges while creating long-

strong emphasis on responsible manufacturing, ethical governance, and inclusive social development. Our leadership remains 
actively engaged in embedding sustainability across business operations, value chains, and community initiatives, ensuring that 
our practices are aligned with global sustainability standards.
	
During the year, we advanced our ESG journey through increased adoption of renewable energy, strengthened water stewardship, 
and implementation of circular economy practices such as recycling and sustainable sourcing. We have also reinforced our 
governance framework through a robust Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, ensuring transparency, fairness, and 
accountability. Going forward, the Company has set clear priorities to further enhance renewable energy integration, expand 
recycling initiatives, reduce waste, and work closely with stakeholders to promote sustainable polymer use. These commitments 
reflect our resolve to transform industry challenges into opportunities for building a resilient and sustainable plastics ecosystem.

strengthen these efforts by building structured awareness initiatives that will enable all value chain partners to actively participate in

Yes, the Company has a process to manage potential conflicts of interest involving Board members. The Board has approved a Code 
of Conduct that requires Directors to act objectively and fulfil their responsibilities when making decisions. The Code specifies that 
Directors should not have a financial interest in any agreements made by the Company. If a Director has or could have such an interest, 
it must be disclosed to the Board, and the Director should not participate in discussions, vote on, or influence decisions about these 
matters. Every year, the Board members and management confirm that they are following the Code of Conduct. The Company receives 
declarations from its Directors about related parties or parties in which they have an interest. These declarations are reviewed at Board 
meetings and help the Company and the Board to assess any current or potential conflicts of interest.

sustainability parameters, including traceability, environmental stewardship, and respect for human rights. Moving forward, the 
company is focused on capturing and disclosing this data in upcoming reporting cycles. By embedding ESG benchmarks into 
supplier evaluation, onboarding, and monitoring processes, the organisation is well-positioned to progressively increase the share 
of sustainably sourced inputs, thereby reinforcing its long-term vision of responsible and inclusive growth.
