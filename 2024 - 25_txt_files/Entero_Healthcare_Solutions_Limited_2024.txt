Creating a supportive workplace environment is key 
to attracting and retaining top talent while enhancing 
overall employee morale. By prioritizing well-being, 
we cultivate a motivated, loyal workforce and 
reinforce our standing as an industry leader. This 
commitment to our people not only strengthens our 
internal culture but also elevates our brand 
reputation—driving higher customer satisfaction and 
long-term business success.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions present a substantial 
risk to healthcare product distributors by potentially 
disrupting supply chains and increasing operational 
costs. As regulatory bodies around the world enforce 
stricter environmental standards, companies with 
high GHG emissions may face penalties, higher 
compliance expenses, and operational restrictions. 
Furthermore, climate change—driven by GHG 
emissions—can result in extreme weather events such 
as hurricanes and øoods, which threaten 
infrastructure, delay deliveries, and disrupt 
distribution networks.
The Company has a valuable opportunity to stand out 
in a competitive market by embracing strong business 
ethics. A commitment to ethical practices—such as 
transparent pricing, fair labor standards, and 
responsible sourcing of medical supplies—can help 
the Distributor establish a reputation for integrity and 
trust. Additionally, ensuring compliance with relevant 
regulations not only minimizes legal risks but also 
reinforces robust corporate governance.
Managing Fleet fuel presents a risk due to various 
factors such as Fluctuating fuel prices, ineﬃcient fuel 
consumption and the potential for environmental 
impact. These risks can result in increased operational 
costs, revenue losses, regulatory non-compliance and 
reputational damage.
Not Applicable
To mitigate these risks, 
we aim to implement 
strategies such as 
improving Energy 
eﬃciency, transitioning 
to renewable energy 
sources and enhancing 
supply chain resilience 
through diversiöcation 
and robust contingency 
planning. 
Not Applicable
To mitigate these risks, 
we aim to implement 
robust fuel management 
strategies, including 
monitoring Fuel usage, 
adopting Fuel-eﬃcient 
technologies and 
conducting Regular 
audits. Additionally, 
conducting Regular 
maintenance on Fleet 
vehicles, and promoting 
a culture of Fuel 
eﬃciency can help 
mitigate risks associated 
with Fleet fuel 
management.

The Company and its subsidiaries are in the process of reviewing the impact of diﬀerent standards 
on the operations.
The Company and its subsidiaries are committed to advancing ESG initiatives, with a focus on 
setting both short-term and long-term sustainability goals tied to key performance indicators (KPIs). 
These objectives cover a wide range of areas, including climate change mitigation, energy 
eﬃciency, water conservation, waste management, air emission reduction, and GHG mitigation. In 
addition, the Company places high priority on employee and worker well-being through stringent 
health and safety practices. It also upholds strong ethical values and transparency across its 
workforce, supported by a robust governance framework.
As the Company along with its subsidiaries is still evolving in terms of its ESG journey – we 
endeavour to set targets in coming years.
We recognize our responsibility to operate ethically, sustainably, and in alignment with the evolving 
expectations of our stakeholders. As a key player in the pharmaceutical distribution sector, our 
mission goes beyond eﬃcient delivery. We are committed to making a positive impact on health, 
society, and the environment. In the past year, we have made meaningful progress on our ESG 
priorities. Environmentally, we have taken steps to reduce our carbon footprint by optimizing cold 
chain logistics and improving energy eﬃciency in our distribution centers. On the social front, we 
continue to prioritize employee health and safety, ensure access to essential medicines in 
underserved regions, and uphold the highest standards of ethics and compliance across our supply 
chain. By integrating ESG principles into our core operations, we aim to build a more resilient, 
responsible, and forward-looking business—one that contributes meaningfully to sustainable
