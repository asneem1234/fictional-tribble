Change 
Risk 
Risk 
The ductile iron pipe & 
fittings 
production process involves energy-
intensive processes primarily during the 
conversion of iron ore to iron or 
subsequent refining of the iron to 
finished ductile iron products. These 
operations are primarily powered by 
fossil fuels, leading to significant 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a 
result, managing and reducing GHG 
emissions is a critical environmental 
priority for the organization 
 
ECL has commissioned an environment cell 
that prioritizes mitigating emissions with 
utmost importance adhering to ISO 14001 
standards. 
 
The Company has implemented a 12 MW 
power plant at the Haldia CDM (Clean 
Development 
Mechanism) 
project, 
enabling power generation through waste 
heat and significantly reducing GHG 
emissions. This project is also registered 
under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
as a CDM project.

Energy 
Management 
Risk & Opportunity 
Risk: 
The manufacturing processes of our 
products, such as ductile iron and cast-
iron pipes and fittings, require energy, 
which is sourced from captive power 
plants and the grid. Optimizing energy 
is key to ensuring efficient production, 
reducing costs, and improving financial 
stability.  
  
 Opportunity: 
Implementing 
energy-efficient 
technologies and processes to reduce 
energy consumption per unit of output 
also 
results 
in 
improved 
overall 
efficiency. 
 
 
The Company’s Khardah units are certified 
with the ISO 50001 energy management 
system (EMS) which enhances energy 
performance, increases energy efficiency, 
and 
reduces 
energy 
costs, 
thereby 
contributing to sustainability goals and 
reducing environmental impact. 
 
ECL, across facilities, has implemented 
initiatives to reduce fuel and electricity 
usage, 
harnessing 
waste 
gases, 
and 
enhancing renewable energy capabilities.

Water 
Management 
Risk & Opportunity 
Risk: 
The manufacturing process require 
water as a key input. Ineffective water 
management 
can 
lead 
to 
non-
compliance, impacting the company’s 
operations and creating reputational 
risks as well as ecological impacts on 
the water level in the surrounding 
region. 
 
Opportunity: 
Implementing water-saving measures 
not only reduces costs but also 
 
The environment management cell actively 
engages in implementing measures to 
minimize water consumption and prevent 
water wastage. 
The Company has set up a state-of-the-art 
effluent 
treatment 
plant 
(ETP). 
Additionally, it conducts regular effluent 
water analysis to ensure compliance, and 
reports are submitted to the authorities.

treatment through a sewage treatment 
plant (STP) and is utilized in the production 
process. This recycling initiative has 
resulted in significant conservation of 
freshwater resources.

Waste 
Management 
Risk & Opportunity 
Risk: 
The manufacturing process generates 
both hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste. Improper management of this 
waste 
can 
lead 
to 
negative 
environmental 
impacts, 
affect 
the 
workforce, and can harm nearby 
communities, potentially resulting in 
non-compliance with regulations. 
 
Opportunity: 
Implementing 
efficient 
waste 
management practices can lead to cost 
savings through reduced disposal costs 
and increased efficiency in resource 
utilization. Further, it ensures that the 
Company 
remains 
compliant 
with 
environmental regulations. 
 
 
The Company's facilities are ISO 14001-
certified, and it has adopted a systematic 
waste management method to ensure that 
waste materials are properly handled, 
stored, and disposed of. 
 
Most of the process waste generated 
during operations can be reprocessed and 
utilized as raw materials to manufacture 
different products.  
 
Hazardous waste such as used oil/waste 
lubricating oil, zinc dust, and used batteries 
are stored and disposed of by authorized 
recyclers in accordance with CPCB/SPCB 
rules.

including 
occupational 
health risks such as exposure to high 
temperatures and machinery accidents. 
Failure to address these risks can result 
in injuries and adversely impact the

Governance, leadership and oversight 
7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements  
At Electrosteel Castings Limited, we believe that true growth is only meaningful when it’s responsible and 
inclusive. This year, we continue to take purposeful steps transitioning our furnaces to cleaner Blast 
Furnace Gas, expanding our 12 MW waste heat recovery system, and conserving over 17 lakh kilolitres 
of water by recycling municipal sewage through advanced treatment plants. Our certifications under ISO 
50001, 14001, and 45001 reflect not just compliance, but a deep commitment to energy efficiency, 
environmental care, and workplace safety. We take pride in our SA8000-certified facilities that promote 
fairness and dignity for every worker. Our products now serve over 110 countries, and we continue to 
build strong relationships with our partners through sustainable procurement practices. These efforts are 
possible because of the trust and dedication of our people—employees, customers, communities, and 
stakeholders—who inspire us to keep moving forward. Together, we are shaping a future that’s not just 
efficient, but ethical and enduring.

There are no significant 
social or environmental 
risks arising from the 
production or disposal of 
the product. However, it is 
recognized that iron and 
steel manufacturing is 
inherently energy-intensive, 
with considerable reliance 
on fossil fuels and water 
resources. 
The 
Company 
has 
adopted 
waste-heat 
recovery systems, increased the use of scrap 
material, and shifted to renewable electricity to 
reduce its GHG footprint. These steps help 
lower energy consumption and emissions 
during production.

10. Health and safety management system: 
 
a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system? 
 
Yes, the Company’s occupational health and safety management system is aligned with ISO 45001:2018 
standards. Several initiatives have been implemented to achieve the Company’s objective of zero-harm 
working environment and zero health impairments to all employees and workers. The Occupational Health 
and Safety (OHS) system covers all operational facilities, supporting functions (e.g., maintenance, logistics, 
laboratories), and administrative offices. It applies to full-time and part-time employees, contract workers, 
on-site service providers, and visitors. Risk assessment and hazard control, supported by regular assurance 
initiatives and prompt corrective measures, are key elements of the system.  
 
The Company conducts regular training and awareness programmes on health and safety. Pre-employment 
and periodical medical check-ups are also conducted for its employees and workers. Third-party safety 
audits are conducted at all the facilities.  
 
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity? 
The Company employs various processes to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine 
and non-routine basis. All safety committees actively engage staff and worker representatives to identify 
workplace hazards and develop corrective actions within specified time frames. For each process, a trained 
team assesses and determines the risk. 
 
The Company has implemented the Japan Institute of Plant Management (JIPM) Total Productive 
Maintenance TPM methodology, specifically using the KYT (Danger Prediction Drill) as a continuous 
improvement tool to enhance the safety consciousness among workmen and supervisors. Mitigation 
includes proactive measures, such as safe operating procedures, Kaizen, Pokayoke and Safety Assurance 
Perfect Line (SAPL). The company also uses departmental and contractor safety risk registers to identify 
and eliminate work-related hazards. Employees receive training to recognize and report hazards, relaying 
any issues to their immediate supervisor. Policies are in place to safeguard against retaliation for reporting 
 
29 
 
hazards. Senior officials conduct plant inspections to detect deviations from standard safety practices and 
to address them promptly. These inspections also serve as opportunities to explore and implement 
advanced technologies recommended for eliminating safety risks in the workplace. No retaliatory actions 
are taken against workers who report incidents or take steps to protect themselves and their colleagues. 
Additionally, the company adheres to the standards set by SA 8000:2014. 
 
 
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)  
Yes, the Company has established procedures that enable workers to promptly report work-related 
hazards. Workers are encouraged to use various channels for reporting, and once reported, these hazards 
are promptly investigated. They have the right to remove themselves from unsafe situations without fear 
of reprisal. Regular training reinforces these procedures, fostering a proactive safety culture. 
 
d.  Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare

ECL has established clear policies outlining safety protocols and procedures for all employees to follow. 
Employees undergo regular training sessions and awareness programs to educate themselves about 
potential hazards and safe work practices. The organization has implemented occupational health and 
safety ISO 45001 to ensure that there is safe working environment. Regular safety assessments are

measures. 
Supervisors conduct short, focused discussions at the start of each shift. Topics include upcoming 
tasks, relevant safety precautions, and reminders about personal protective equipment (PPE) 
and safe work practices. Toolbox talks are also held daily. Workers are provided with information 
on hazards through material safety data sheets, operating procedures, hazard identification, and risk 
assessment. Staff, workmen, and contractors are involved as team members in hazard identification, risk 
assessment, and control measures determination. Staff, workers, and contractors receive regular updates 
and information on any changes. Health monitoring programs and access to medical facilities are offered 
 
30 
 
to ensure early detection and treatment of health issues among employees. Routine inspections and 
audits are conducted to monitor compliance with safety regulations and identify areas for improvement. 
Employees are encouraged to actively participate in safety committees, provide feedback, and report 
safety concerns to management. These measures collectively contribute to fostering a safe and healthy 
work environment for all employees.

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission?  
If yes, then provide details. 
Yes, the Company has undertaken the following measures, building on initiatives established in the previous 
year, to further reduce GHG emissions.  
• 
A 15 kW on-grid solar panel has been installed at Haldia to partially support the canteen load, and further 
expansion at Khardah has increased the total additional installed solar capacity to 54 kW on a year-on-year 
basis, resulting in an additional 30MWh of green electricity.  
• 
Conducted Energy Audit at three plants (Haldia, Srikalahasthi, and Khardah) to identify energy consumption 
hotspots to implement efficiency and reduction initiatives according to the PAT cycle. Specifically, at the 
Khardah, the audit involved water and waste metrics as well. 
• 
Conducted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for approximately 15 products to identify GHG footprint and initiate 
energy and water conservation measures aimed at reducing embodied emissions. 
• 
Captive power generation through waste heat recovery from coke ovens and utilization of blast furnace gas, 
reducing dependence on additional energy sources. Sensible heat from annealing furnace flue gas is also being 
effectively recovered for steam generation. Additionally, blast furnace gas is used as a fuel across multiple 
processes, including heat treatment, sinter making, and preheating applications. These integrated measures 
have led to process-level reductions in CO2 emissions by minimizing fossil fuel use and optimizing energy 
recovery.   
• 
A mechanized waste management system has also been implemented in the Fitting and Foundry works to 
control fugitive emissions, replacing the earlier manual waste sand and dust disposal method.

Note: In the current year, ETP sludge generation was minimal, as the ETP was not operated at one of the 
facilities; only neutralization and subsequent reuse of wastewater for evaporation were carried out. All other 
waste streams (e.g., oil filters, discarded containers/barrels, slag, slurry) have been consolidated and reclassified 
into hazardous and non-hazardous categories per CPCB guidelines & BRSR framework, and updated accordingly 
in our reporting format. This reclassification is driven by our efforts to streamline material disclosures and align 
with ISF guidance and industry norms.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
The Company has aligned itself with the ISO 14001 environmental management system and has 
established standard operating procedures for handling hazardous and non-hazardous waste. All units 
have dedicated waste management systems in place. Each respective division collects and segregates the 
 
46 
 
waste, storing it in designated locations. Major hazardous waste, such as zinc dust, is sent to authorized 
recyclers with a complete manifest system. Bitumen waste is collected safely and reused in the process, 
avoiding disposal. Other hazardous wastes are accumulated and disposed of according to a 90-day 
schedule with SPCB/CPCB authorized vendors. Hazardous and non-hazardous waste is recorded in SAP 
software to ensure accuracy and tracking. 
 
In an effort to minimize the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in products and processes, the Company 
adheres to Operation Control Procedures (OCP) and complies with legal directives. Further, plant 
inspections are conducted for hazardous waste and chemical handling compliance. These measures aim 
to reduce environmental impact and ensure responsible chemical management throughout the
