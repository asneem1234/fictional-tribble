Chairman’s Message
Dear Shareholders,
The Indian economy maintained a steady momentum in FY25, 
supported by strong domestic demand, stable governance and 
continued investment in infrastructure. Moderate inflation 
and effective policy interventions further contributed to a 
favourable macroeconomic backdrop in the country.
In contrast, the global geopolitical situation remained volatile 
and as a result supply chain disruptions persisted through 
the year and had a cascading effect on commodity prices 
and business sentiment in general. For the tyre industry in 
particular, raw material costs rose sharply in the first half – 
especially of natural rubber, which touched record highs. 
Although prices stabilised in the second half and some impact 
was offset through pricing actions, overall margins were 
subdued compared to the previous year. Despite this, CEAT 
delivered healthy growth across all key segments.
CEAT will mark a significant milestone during its 100th year 
and will be acquiring the CAMSO brand and its Off highway 
construction tyres business from Michelin. This acquisition 
will give multi-fold levers to CEAT across brand, product 
range, distribution network and OEM relationships and will 
significantly strengthen CEAT’s position in the global off 
highway tyres market.
We also continued to strengthen our brand through 
differentiated offerings and premium partnerships. 
Our new high performance product range is designed to meet 
evolving mobility needs and enhance CEAT’s positioning in 
high-value segments. 
I am pleased to share that our Chennai plant was inducted into 
the World Economic Forum’s prestigious Global Lighthouse 
Network – joining our Halol plant, which received this 
distinction in 2023. These recognitions reflect our commitment 
to world-class manufacturing practices, digital adoption and 
customer-centricity.
Sustainability remains a central part of our strategy. We are 
working towards Net Zero by 2050 and have made meaningful 
strides in that direction. Renewable energy now contributes 
49% of energy consumption at our manufacturing plants. 
As we look ahead, our focus remains on building premium, 
technology-led portfolio of products that deliver greater value 
to customers, scaling our global presence and deepening our 
commitment to sustainability and innovation. 
With robust fundamentals, disciplined execution and a stronger 
global presence, we are confident of navigating the evolving 
landscape and building a more resilient and future-ready CEAT.
Thank you for your continued trust and support.
H.V. Goenka
Chairman
Commemorating its 100th 
year, CEAT took bold strides 
for a promising future, 
while orchestrating a strong 
operating performance amidst 
a challenging environment.

Vice-Chairman’s Message
Dear Shareholders,
FY25 has been a defining year for CEAT - a year that reflects 
our focus on purposeful growth, operational progress and the 
expanding reach of our brand.
Industry
The Indian tyre industry grew at a stable 6–8% in FY25, 
supported by replacement demand and a modest recovery 
in exports. India’s mobility sector continues to evolve, with 
record-high passenger vehicle sales and a 17% increase in 
EV adoption. Policies such as PM E-Drive and PM e-Sewa are 
laying the groundwork for sustainable and inclusive mobility.
The Indian Union Budget 2025 set a supportive tone for 
our sector, with increased capital outlay on infrastructure, 
continued incentives for EV adoption through the Electric 
Mobility Promotion Scheme and rationalisation of customs 
duties on key inputs like rubber chemicals. These measures 
are expected to strengthen the ecosystem for sustainable 
mobility while improving logistics and cost structures across 
the value chain.
CEAT Performance
As CEAT marked its centenary milestone, we delivered 
consolidated revenues of Rs. 13,218 Crores - representing a 
10.7% growth over the previous year. This performance was 
achieved against the backdrop of global uncertainty, supply 
chain realignments and rising input costs - a testament to the 
strength of our fundamentals and the discipline with which 
we operate.
Our margins were impacted by the increase in raw material 
prices, but we were able to offset some of its effect through 
sharper focus on cost efficiencies, product mix and agile 
decision-making across the organisation.
Our investments in product premiumisation, manufacturing 
technology and digital capabilities have positioned us 
competitively. While the overall market grew at 6%, we were 
able to grow at double the rate. Our margin position within 
industry has also improved over the last year.
A significant milestone in FY25 was our entering into a 
definitive agreement with Michelin to acquire Camso brand’s 
Off-Highway Tyres (OHT) business. This will expand the 
Company’s presence in global specialty markets and allow us 
to offer a more comprehensive, premium product portfolio. 
We are focused on ensuring a smooth integration of Camso’s 
operations while creating long-term strategic value.
We continue to invest in improving our manufacturing 
infrastructure to ensure that we meet the growing demands of 
our markets while maintaining the highest standards of quality 
and efficiency in our production processes. We are investing in 
expanding capacities at our Ambernath & Chennai plants and 
upgrading capabilities at key locations.
The Chennai plant, following Halol, was recognised with the 
Lighthouse Certification from the World Economic Forum, 
highlighting our progress in adopting advanced manufacturing 
practices and digital transformation.
CEAT is committed to its sustainable journey. We are in the 
process of setting company-wide emission reductions in line 
with The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). CEAT was 
recently awarded a Silver Medal by EcoVadis, which places 
us among the top 15% of companies assessed globally. 
It’s a strong testament to our collective commitment to 
sustainability, responsible business practices and continuous 
improvement.
As we look to FY26, our priorities are clear - integrate the Camso 
business, deepen our global presence and stay focused on 
innovation that adds value for customers. We will continue to 
improve margins, manage capital prudently and balance our 
growth ambitions with a sound financial approach. 
CEAT enters this next chapter with confidence - built on 
a century of learning, a strong portfolio and committed 
leadership. As always, our goal is to deliver sustainable, 
profitable growth and create long-term value for you - our 
shareholders and partners.
I thank you for your continued partnership with us.

disruptions, geopolitical conflicts, economic uncertainties, 
regulatory changes, evolving business models, pandemics and 
climate change. The Company has responded with agility and 
robust strategies, improving resource utilisation and efficiency. 
With a keen awareness of the dynamic business environment, 
the focus remains on creating stakeholder value through 
evolved business practices grounded in Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) principles.
Net Zero: The Company is progressing steadily toward its Net 
Zero targets by 2050, contributing to the global effort against 
climate change.
Renewable Energy Progress: The Company is on track to 
increase the renewable electricity usage year-on-year with the

The Company remains strategically 
focused to grow the business 
consistently and profitably through 
efficient deployment of capital in its core 
area of business.
Background 
The tyre industry is a capital-intensive 
business 
across 
the 
world. 
The companies will have to have hard 
assets on the ground to produce tyres 
of various categories and customers 
adding capacities come in the form of 
brownfield capacity additions in existing 
manufacturing locations and greenfield 
capacity additions in new locations. 
Considering large capital outlay required, 
the Company carries out a very rigorous 
rolling 5-year long-term supply and 
demand plan ever year. The Company 
develops detailed financial capital 
allocation plans to support the business 
growth and vision. Considering scale 
plays a role in bringing cost efficiencies 
in operations and also in distributing 
the fixed cost over larger volume, right 
allocation of capital not only helps in the 
revenue growth of the business but also 
in the profitability of the business.

Deployment of Capital 
	
The Company needs capital 
to meet its growth related 
requirement such as capacity 
additions, R&D to develop new 
products and in manufacturing 
& process technology. The 
Company has been allocating 
and spending approximately 
Rs. 900-1,000 Crores per annum 
for the last 3 to 5 years 
	
The Company also needs capital 
for the purpose of working capital 
which consists of inventories, 
receivables 
and 
payables. 
Over the last 7 years, the Company 
undertook various initiatives to 
bring efficiencies in all elements 
of working capital leading to 
negative working capital which is 
uncommon in the tyre industry
	
The Company also needs capital/
cashflow to meet the needs 
of dividend. The Company has 
stepped up the dividend outflow 
in the last 2 years arising out of 
improvement in profits leading 
to distribution of 300% dividend 
in FY 2023-24 and the Board has 
recommended 300% dividend 
for FY 2024-25 for shareholders’ 
approval. The annual outflows on 
account of dividend have been to 
the tune of Rs. 121 Crores
	
The fourth area of capital 
allocation is towards inorganic/ 
M&A opportunity. During the 
FY 2024-25, the Company identified 
an opportunity to acquire compact 
construction business of globally 
well-known brand Michelin along 
with the brand "Camso" involving 
capital outlay of approx. Rs. 2,000 
Crores over the next 3 years 
Key Focus Areas - Cashflow 
Management 
	
The Company has a robust 
cashflow planning and monitoring 
processes to bring in efficiencies 
across all business verticals
	
The 
Company 
drives 
cost 
efficiencies and improvements 
across the organisation through 
"zero based" approach, leveraging 
technology and advanced analytics 
under various project umbrellas, 
viz., ‘Project Spring’, ‘Lighthouse’ 
and ‘Project Leap’ covering end-to-
end processes, in the last 5 years, 
which has helped the business to 
manage and mitigate pressures 
during adverse commodity cycle 
	
Capital 
Asset 
productivity 
improvement programs were 
carried out in key factories to 
unlock capital using Industry 
4.0 technology, particularly in 
upstream equipment(s) involving 
large capital expenditure
	
Efficiencies in working capital over 
the last 5 years or more has helped 
the Company to unlock over 
Rs.1,000 Crores. The Company 
has currently reached the 
position of negative working 
capital without compromising on 
customer service
Management of Capital 
The Company strives to maintain 
healthy capital structure that parallelly 
ensures strong balance sheet and 
access to capital at competitive terms. 
The Company has been supporting

Cricket Rating
United States
In FY 2025-26, the US economy is expected to witness a 
slowdown, with real GDP growth forecasted to decelerate to 
2.1%. This moderation is largely attributed to the imposition 
of tariffs, which are anticipated to disrupt trade and elevate 
prices for both consumers and businesses. Although there has 
been some easing, inflation remains a concern, as tariffs could 
further exacerbate price increases.
Europe
The EU economy is presently facing a mixed outlook, 
with a slight improvement projected for CY 2025 amidst 
global uncertainties and internal challenges. GDP growth is 
anticipated to rise from 0.8% in CY 2024 to 1.3% in CY 2025. 
According to the OECD, the EU is set for a modest recovery, with 
growth reaching 1.5% by CY 2026. While inflation has eased 
across many member states, persistent inflation in services 
continues to pose a challenge, potentially slowing the overall 
disinflation process.
LATAM
Latin America’s economic growth is projected to decelerate 
to approximately 2% by CY 2025, according to both the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. 
This slowdown is attributed to structural challenges, such as 
inadequate infrastructure, low investment levels and rising 
debt, which hinder the region’s competitiveness and growth 
potential.
In response, the tyre industry is focusing on enhancing 
operational efficiency and optimising supply chains to 
navigate these economic challenges. Emphasising innovation 
and expanding into underserved markets are identified as key 
strategies for growth. By leveraging local partnerships and 
advancing digital capabilities, the sector aims to strengthen its 
competitive position and demonstrate resilience amid regional 
economic uncertainties.
Global Economy Outlook
The global economy is experiencing moderate growth 
amid ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties. 
The IMF projects global growth to stabilise at 3.3% in 
CY 2025 and CY2026, with inflation easing to 4.2% and 3.5% 
respectively,  citing trade barriers and policy uncertainties 
as key challenges. Increased tariffs and disrupted supply 
chains have fuelled inflation and dampened investment, 
particularly affecting emerging markets facing policy risks 
and potential disinflation.

Emerging Markets and Developing Economies
In CY 2025, numerous emerging economies are anticipated 
to experience a deceleration in growth, attributable to factors 
such as diminished investment, declining commodity prices 
and global trade uncertainties. China, Brazil, Mexico and South 
Africa are facing slowdowns. Overall, emerging economies 
are forecasted to grow at 3.7%, significantly influenced by 
prevailing global conditions. India is expected to show robust 
growth, propelled by strong domestic demand, infrastructure 
investment and economic reforms.
Indian Economy Outlook
Despite substantial global challenges, the Indian economy 
continued to be the fastest-growing major economy in 
FY 2024-25. The resilience of domestic economic activity 
is attributed to positive consumer sentiment and strong 
investment demand. India’s economy is well-positioned to 
withstand global challenges arising from the tariff war, owing 
to its robust macroeconomic framework, moderating inflation 
and strong domestic growth engines. Despite concerns about 
weakening global growth due to escalating trade tensions and 
financial market volatility, India’s domestic growth drivers are 
resilient and less vulnerable to external pressures. The recent 
repo rate reductions by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are 
expected to boost lending and investment.

Global Automobile Industry
In the reporting year, the global automobile sector faced 
challenges from commodity inflation, geopolitical tensions and 
shifting regulations. Despite this, it saw strong growth driven 
by rising demand, improved semiconductor availability and 
increased adoption of electric vehicles. Key industry priorities 
include building a resilient, sustainable value chain and 
integrating smart mobility. Consumer preferences are shifting 
toward SUVs and EVs, while India is gaining traction as a key 
manufacturing hub amid global supply chain diversification.
Indian Automobile Industry
The Indian Automobile Industry showed strong growth in 
FY 2024-25, with a 7.3% increase in domestic sales and a 
19.2% rise in exports, fuelled by global demand and supportive 
government policies. Passenger Vehicles reached record sales 
of 4.3 million units, with Utility Vehicles leading the growth. 
The Two-Wheeler segment saw 19.6 million units sold, driven 
by rural demand and a rise in electric vehicle sales, which 
now make up over 6%. Three-Wheelers hit record sales and 
Commercial Vehicles showed recovery in Q4. With stable 
macroeconomic conditions and government support for 
electric vehicles, the industry’s outlook for FY 2025-26 
remains positive, focusing on sustainable mobility and global 
competitiveness.
Electrification 
India is advancing in its efforts to cut greenhouse gas 
emissions and air pollution through increased electric vehicle 
(EV) adoption. With plans to achieve 80% electrification of 
2-wheelers by 2030, the move aims to reduce reliance on 
fossil fuels. Responding to the growing demand for EVs, the 
automobile industry has shifted its focus, also prompting the 
Company to introduce new tyre platforms like EnergyDrive for 
passenger cars, EnergyRide for two-wheelers and WinEnergy 
for truck radials. 
The FY 2025‑26 Union Budget accelerates India’s EV 
agenda by enhancing funding for Auto PLI, PM E‑DRIVE and 
SMEC/SPMEPCI schemes, offering incentives and customs 
exemptions to foster local lithium-ion cell production and 
prioritising EV charging and battery-recycling infrastructure.
Premiumisation
The Indian automotive industry is shifting towards premium 
models in both two-wheeler and four-wheeler segments, 
driven by consumer demand for advanced features, superior 
technology and enhanced performance. Companies are 
responding by expanding their offerings, particularly in super 
sport, sport biking and adventure segments for two-wheelers 
and luxury and SUV segments for four-wheelers.
The Company is focusing on expanding its product range, 
particularly in the specialty and off-highway segments and 
targeting premium car brands. By developing advanced tyre 
technologies such as ZR-rated, CALM, and Run-Flat tyres, 
the Company aims to boost its share in the high-performance 
luxury vehicle market. Additionally, it launched SPORTRAD 
and CROSSRAD steel radial tyres for high-performance 
motorcycles, capitalising on the growing adventure biking 
trend. These initiatives align with the Company’s strategy to 
strengthen its position in the premium and two-wheeler tyre 
markets, driving higher margins and customer satisfaction 
through superior technology and performance.
Internationalisation
Internationalisation is fuelling growth in the automobile and 
tyre sectors, as companies expand globally, strengthen supply 
chains through localisation and diversified sourcing and adopt 
international standards for quality, safety and sustainability. 
Additionally, they are setting up research centres worldwide to 
innovate and tailor products to local markets. The Company’s 
international business strategy includes targeting premium 
markets in the EU, Middle East and LATAM. The Company has 
been working on obtaining OEM approvals from international 
brands. During FY 2024-25, it witnessed an increase in 
demand and recorded an increase in sales in Middle East, Latin 
American and European countries. The Company intends to 
increase its global market penetration and increase share of 
exports to about one-fourth of its total revenues. 
Digitalisation
The Company is driving a digital transformation to improve 
manufacturing efficiency and customer experience. 
In partnership with AWS, it has created smart factories and 
intelligent tyres with telemetry sensors to monitor pressure 
and temperature, predicting failures and reducing downtime. 
The adoption of SAP S/4HANA ERP on AWS enables real-time 
analytics for better decision-making in sales and consumer 
experience. Digital initiatives like IoT-enabled controls and 
operator touchpoint digitisation have significantly reduced 
cycle times, scrap and energy consumption, solidifying 
Company’s leadership in digital manufacturing.
Sustainability in the tyre industry 
The auto component industry, including the tyre sector, is 
progressing towards greater sustainability by addressing 
climate-related risks and enhancing supply chain resilience. 
Companies are actively working to reduce emissions, conserve 
water and adopt circular economy practices. Within the tyre 
industry, sustainability efforts span the entire product lifecycle 
– from responsible sourcing to end-of-life disposal, leading 
to use of recycled material into making new tyres – focusing 
on fuel efficiency, low rolling resistance, noise reduction and 
safety. The Company continues to invest in workforce upskilling 
and waste minimisation through advanced technologies. As a 
member of the GPSNR, the Company is committed to reducing 
material sourcing from deforested or degraded forest areas, 
aligning readiness with the  EUDR.

Relationship Capital.
Global Tyre Industry
In FY 2024-25, the global tyre industry saw strong growth. 
China leads with nearly 50% market share, but India is emerging 
as the third-largest market, driven by domestic demand and 
export growth. The global market is expected to grow from 
$200.97 billion in CY 2024 to $211.22 billion in CY 2025.
Indian Tyre Industry
The Indian tyre industry is set for strong growth in FY26, driven 
by robust demand in the replacement market and a recovering 
OE segment. Passenger vehicle tyre demand is expected to 
grow by 6-8%, following a 5-7% increase this year, with key 
players expanding capacity. Challenges include volatile raw 
material costs and import reliance, while the market remains 
competitive. On a positive note, tyre exports are rising, 
strengthening India’s global market presence.

Imports and Exports
Indian tyres are exported to over 170 countries, with the United States, Brazil, Germany, the UAE, France and Italy as key markets. 
While domestic demand remains solid, driven by stable replacement markets, export growth might be tempered by difficulties 
in major markets.
Raw material trends
Rubber
The tyre industry is expected to face ongoing raw material 
challenges in FY 2025-26, with elevated natural rubber 
prices due to supply constraints and strong demand. 
Geopolitical factors and logistical issues, such as the Red 
Sea crisis, could further impact imports and logistics costs. 
Major producers like Thailand and Indonesia will remain key to 
global supply chains and any shifts in their policies may affect 
prices. To mitigate these challenges, tyre companies must 
strengthen supply chain strategies, de-risk geographically, 
maintain strategic supplier relationships and pursue 
technological innovations. 
Carbon Black and Silica
As sustainability becomes the key focus area within the 
tyre industry, it has seen a shift from the use of carbon 
black towards recovered carbon black and Rice Husk silica 
(RHA) which are sustainable raw materials used in the tyre 
production process. 
Business Review
The Company ended FY 2024-25 on a positive note and 
witnessed recovery in volumes in the second half of the year 
in replacement and international markets with improvement 
in margins in Q4. The growth was largely attributable to share 
gain in passenger categories both in 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler 
segment on overall basis and strong double digit growth in 
replacement market.

Risk and Mitigation Plan
Risks
Mitigation
Margin impact due to raw materials price 
volatility and inability to increase prices to 
offset RM price increase.
Profit margins can be impacted by the fluctuation 
of raw material prices, as well as the presence of 
low-cost domestic and international competitors 
who engage in aggressive pricing behaviour. 
Such factors may have an adverse effect on 
profitability.
The Company is implementing strategic measures to foster long-term 
partnerships and enhance its margin profile. It is expanding its supplier 
base while strengthening relationships with existing suppliers. Strong ties 
with OEMs and high product quality bolster brand recognition.
The Company has been carrying out various cost-saving measures, 
leading to improvements in specific consumption of utilities, reduction 
of wastage in manufacturing, reduction in the prices of indirect material, 
efficiencies in procurement, overall distribution costs and operating 
expenses. This is expected to vastly mitigate impact of increase in costs 
in addition to getting benefits of scale.
To differentiate itself from competitors, the Company is broadening 
its distribution channels, improving after-sales services and offering 
superior quality products with warranties. Efforts are focused on growing 
high-margin segments, implementing price increases, developing capacity 
for new products and establishing a premium segment in new markets. 
The Company leverages its deep domain knowledge, technological 
prowess, brand recall, and reach to maintain a competitive edge.
Cyber Security Risk
The Company periodically assesses the risks of cyber-attacks and 
implements preventive and detective measures for mitigation. External IT 
consultants are engaged to offer insights into safeguarding systems 
against cyber threats. Additionally, a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is 
developed to ensure preparedness against unplanned exigencies.
ESG Risk
The Company has an ESG council that regularly evaluates ESG-specific 
risks, plans mitigation and ensures implementation. For governance, 
a web-based compliance tool monitors all relevant compliances. 
Additionally, there are policies in place addressing human rights, diversity 
and other obligations.
Geopolitical Disruption
The emergence of a big risk, due to factors such 
as a debt crisis, war, trust deficit in inter-state 
relations and uncertainty leads to supply 
disruptions and an overall increase in prices.
To mitigate risk, the Company is taking proactive measures in several areas: 
1. Ensuring supply chain agility 
2. Reviewing and acting upon balance sheet ratios 
3. Developing long-term supply and demand plans 
4. Expanding into new geographies and OEMs/sizes
Slowdown in Economy impacting the business 
growth plans
A slowdown in the economy can reduce 
consumer spending. This may lead to a drop 
in sales volume, decreased demand from 
OEMs, export customers and fleets.
The Company has developed a mitigation plan that includes working 
capital and CAPEX management, maintaining the debt-equity ratio within 
target, optimising cash flow and improving operational efficiency and 
flexibility.
M&A Risk – CAMSO
Challenges of integration, cultural differences, 
and regulatory and legal issues
The mitigation plan includes comprehensive measures for smooth 
operational merging, change management and knowledge transfer.

increase in activity levels.
Increase in advertisement and sales promotion expenses is because of increase in markerting activities lead by IPL, WPL and 
other initiatives.

State of Company’s Affairs
During the Financial Year 2024–25, the Company continued

across key business segments. On a standalone basis, 
the Company recorded revenue from operations of Rs. 
13,17,165 lakhs, higher by 10.76% compared to Rs. 
11,89,260 lakhs during last financial year. On a consolidated 
basis, the Company recorded revenue from operations of 
Rs. 13,21,787 lakhs, higher by 10.67% compared to Rs. 
11,94,348 lakhs during last financial year.
The replacement business delivered a robust performance, 
especially in the commercial vehicle segment, which witnessed 
double-digit growth. The two-wheeler segment also registered 
10.8% growth, while the passenger vehicle segment recorded 
a 6.8% growth. The OEM segment also reported 7.1% growth, 
led by Passenger Car Utility Vehicles (PCUV) and 2/3-wheeler 
categories. The Company received new model approvals

in PCUV. Despite macroeconomic challenges, including 
substantial freight rate hikes and container shortages in Q1,

Notably, both the PCUV and 2/3-wheeler categories within this 
segment recorded about 19% growth.
The consolidated gross margin declined to 37.72%, compared 
to 42.02% in the previous fiscal year due to higher raw material 
costs. However, the Company continued to focus on effective 
cost controls, which resulted in a reduction in operating 
expenses as a percentage of turnover. On a standalone 
basis the Company recorded a net profit of Rs. 48,210 lakhs 
against a net profit of Rs. 65,430 lakhs of the last financial 
year. The Company’s EBITDA stood at Rs. 1,48,616 lakhs, a 
decrease of 10.24% over EBITDA of Rs. 1,65,568 lakhs of the

While computing median remuneration, remuneration of all the employees including the Managing Director and CEO,

2)	
Directors’ remuneration includes commission and sitting fees for FY 2024-25. While Commission is determined based 
on the contribution and tenure served by Non-executive Directors during the year, the sitting fees are paid based on 
the number of meetings of Board and Committee attended by them respectively.

Ceased to be directors due to completion of second term w.e.f September 26, 2024.
	
4)	
Resigned as an Independent director w.e.f April 1, 2024. Thus, the percentage increase/ decrease in the remuneration 
is not comparable.
	
5)	
Appointed w.e.f March 14, 2024 and hence percentage increase / decrease is not comparable.
	
6)	
Appointed during the year, therefore the remuneration paid only for part of the year and hence percentage increase / 
decrease is not comparable.
	
7)	
Mr. Gaurav Tongia was appointed as the Company Secretary and Compliance Officer with effect from July 1, 2024, 
hence percentage increase / decrease is not comparable. Ms. Vallari Gupte resigned, effective from the close of 
business hours on May 7, 2024.
b.	
The percentage increase in the median remuneration of employees in the financial year is (14.8%).
c.	
The number of permanent employees on the rolls of Company are 9,205.
d.	
The average increase in salaries of employees (other than managerial personnel) is 7.93 percentile for FY 2024-25 and that 
of managerial personnel is 11.54 percentile as compared to FY 2023-24 in view of evolving external benchmarks.

on the Board, a formal letter of appointment is issued to such Director. The requirement of obtaining declarations from 
a Director under the Act, Listing Regulations and other relevant regulations are also explained in detail to the Director 
and necessary affirmations are received from them in respect thereto.

Company's structure, market share and internal processes. Directors are periodically invited to visit the Company's 
plants for insights into manufacturing, R&D and the social environment. The Board is regularly updated on economic

effluents are reused in toilets, cooling 
towers, and boilers, and five plants operate 
with Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems. 
The Bhandup facility is ISO 46001:2019 
certified for water efficiency. Rainwater 
harvesting systems are in place at Bhandup, 
Nashik and Chennai, while Halol has 
recharge capacity. Chennai also uses TTRO 
water to reduce freshwater dependency. 
Water-related risks are assessed across 
operations to ensure long-term resilience 
and sustainability.

the 
Chennai 
plant, 84% of water 
consumption 
is 
met 
by 
Tertiary 
Treatment Reverse 
Osmosis

for manufacturing and supply chain initiatives. In line with these commitments, the Supplier Manual requires suppliers 
to align with the Quality System Requirement IATF 16949, ensuring quality standards that include environmental 
protection, human rights and compliance. Suppliers must produce cost-effective, competitive products, maintaining 
high quality and safety standards while minimising environmental impact. This approach ensures that the products,

certifications. In FY 2024–25, these approved suppliers provided 100% of the raw materials. The Company has set a 
target to use 40% sustainable materials by 2030, with an achievement of 30.5% as of March 2025, as against target 
of 30% for that period. Additionally, the carbon footprint is being reduced through network optimisation by opting for 
coastal shipment routes for 23% of local rubber requirements.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
The Company’s strategy for achieving substantial emission reductions is centered on transitioning to cleaner energy sources 
and enhancing operational efficiency. By reducing dependency on conventional fossil fuels, the Company is increasing the 
use of renewable energy such as briquettes, solar and wind power. This transition is complemented by a series of energy 
efficiency initiatives. Key operational enhancements include interlocking the cooling line pump with line speed, automating 
HT motor blowers, installing VFD panels and conducting regular air leak detection and correction. To improve processes, the 
Company is reducing the idle run time of mixer motors, implementing automatic cut-off mechanisms for air conditioners, 
optimising hot water recovery cycle times, minimising cycle times for better efficiency and enhancing both insulation and 
steam quality. Additionally, the Company is undertaking retrofits that enable better energy management across plants, 
such as installing aerodynamic fans in cooling towers, modifying hot exhaust air ducting for thermal energy recovery and 
making circuit modifications in hydraulic pump systems. Collectively, these measures aim to lower emissions, conserve 
energy and promote sustainable industrial practices.

To the Members of CEAT Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of CEAT 
Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the standalone 
balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the standalone 
statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive 
income), standalone statement of changes in equity and 
standalone statement of cash flows for the year then ended, 
and notes to the standalone financial statements, including 
material accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs 
of the Company as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and other 
comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its cash flows for 
the year ended on that date.
Independent Auditor’s Report
Key audit matter
See Note 26 to standalone financial statements
Revenue recognition on Sale of Products
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company recognises revenue from the sale of products 
when control over goods is transferred to the customer 
based on specific terms and conditions of sale contracts 
with respective customers. Revenue is a key performance 
indicator and there is a presumed fraud risk of revenue being 
overstated through manipulation of the timing of transfer of 
control due to pressures to achieve performance targets as 
well as meeting external expectations.
Revenue is measured net of any discounts and rebates. 
Recognition and measurement of off-invoice discounts and 
rebates accruals, involves judgement and estimates. This 
leads to a risk of revenue being misstated due to inaccurate 
estimation over off-invoice discounts and rebates.
Hence, revenue recognition is considered to be a key audit 
matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to 
obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence:
	
Assessed the appropriateness of the policies in respect 
of revenue recognition including discounts and rebates 
by comparing with applicable accounting standards.
	
Performed testing of design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the Company’s general 
Information Technology (‘IT’) controls and key IT 
application controls over revenue recognition by involving 
our IT specialists.
	
Performed testing of design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the Company’s key manual 
controls around revenue recognition including accruals 
and actualization of discounts and rebates.
	
Performed substantive testing of recognition of revenue 
in the correct period by selecting statistical samples of 
revenue transactions recorded during and at the end of the 
financial year and examining the underlying documents 
such as sales invoices/ contracts and dispatch/ shipping 
documents for the selected transactions.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of the 
Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.

Performed substantive testing by agreeing statistical 
samples of discounts and rebate accruals and 
disbursements to underlying documents.
	
Performed a retrospective assessment of discounts and 
rebate accruals with prior period to evaluate the historical 
accuracy.
	
Tested a selection of payments made after 31 March 
2025 and where relevant, comparing the payment to the 
related rebate accrual.
	
Scrutinised journal entries related to revenue recognised 
during the year based upon specified risk-based criteria, 
to identify unusual or irregular item.

Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s annual 
report, but does not include the financial statements and 
auditor’s report thereon. The Company’s annual report is 
expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
When we read the Company’s annual report, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, applicable under the applicable 
laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, 
profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 
133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial  controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board 
of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of standalone financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

in the previous year, the audit trail has been 
preserved by the Company as per the statutory 
requirements for record retention.

Report on the internal financial controls with reference 
to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on 
Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of 
our report of even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements of CEAT Limited (“the Company”) as of 
31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended on 
that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such internal financial controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 
“Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the 
standalone financial statements of CEAT Limited 
for the year ended 31 March 2025
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements were established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference 
to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements include those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

Standalone Statement of Changes in Equity
for the year ended March 31, 2025
Note 1: Corporate Information
CEAT Limited (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company 
domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions 
of the Companies Act applicable in India. The Company’s 
principal business is manufacturing of automotive tyres, 
tubes and flaps. The Company started operations in 1958 
as CEAT Tyres of India Limited and was renamed as CEAT 
Limited in 1990. The Company caters to both domestic and 
international markets. The Company is listed on the Bombay 
Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). 
The registered office of the Company is located at RPG House, 
463, Dr Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai, Maharashtra 
400030. The financial statements were approved for issue 
in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 
April 29, 2025.
Note 2: Basis of preparation, measurement and 
material accounting policies.
2.1	 Basis of preparation and measurement
	
2.1.1	Basis of preparation
	
	
These financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified 
by Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 
of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time and 
presentation requirements of Division II of revised 
Schedule III of the Companies Act 2013 (Ind AS 
compliant Schedule III).
	
	
The financial statements have been prepared on 
accrual and going concern basis. The accounting 
policies are applied consistently to all the periods 
presented in the financial statements.
	
	
The financial statements are presented in “C”, the 
functional currency of the Company. Items included 
in the financial statements of the Company are 
recorded using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Company operates (the 
‘functional currency’).
	
	
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements 
and notes have been rounded off to the nearest 
lacs as per the requirements of Schedule III of the 
Companies Act, 2013, unless otherwise stated. 
Wherever the amount represented ‘0’ (zero) 
construes value less than Rupees fifty thousand.
	
2.1.2	Basis of Measurement
	
	
These financial statements are prepared under the 
historical cost convention except for the following 
assets and liabilities which have been measured at 
fair value:
	
	
	
Derivative financial instruments and
	
	
	
Investment in others (refer accounting policy 
regarding financial instruments)
	
	
In addition, the carrying values of recognised assets 
and liabilities designated as hedged items in fair 
value hedges that would otherwise be carried at 
amortised cost are adjusted to record changes in 
the fair values attributable to the risks that are being 
hedged in effective hedge relationships.
2.2	 Current versus non-current classification
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance 
Sheet based on current / non-current classification. 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
	
	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle.
	
	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading.
	
	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or
	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period. All other assets are 
classified as non-current.
	
A liability is current when:
	
	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle.
	
	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading.
	
	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
	
	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period.
	
The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and 
cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve 
months as its operating cycle.

2.3	 Revenue from operation
	
2.3.1	Revenue from contracts with customers
	
	
Revenues from contracts with customers 
are 
recognised 
when 
the 
performance 
obligations towards customer have been met. 
Performance obligations are deemed to have 
been met when control of the goods or services 
are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the Company 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods 
or services. The Company acts as the principle in all 
of its revenue arrangements since it is the primary 
obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it has 
pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and 
credit risks.
	
	
An entity collects Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’) 
on behalf of the government and not on its own 
account. Hence it is excluded from revenue, i.e. 
Revenue is net of GST.
	
2.3.2	Sale of Goods
	
	
Revenue from sale of goods (Tyres, tubes and flaps) 
is recognised at the point of time when control of 
the goods is transferred to customer depending on 
terms of sales.
	
	
The Company considers whether there are 
other promises in the contract that are separate 
performance obligations to which a portion of 
the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g. 
Sales related obligations). In determining the 
transaction price for the sale of goods, the Company 
considers the effects of variable consideration, the 
existence of significant financing components, if any.
	
	
2.3.2.1 Variable consideration
	
	
	
Variable consideration includes various forms 
of discounts like volume discounts, price 
concessions, incentives, etc. on the goods 
sold to its dealers and distributors. In all 
such cases, accumulated experience is used 
to estimate and provide for the variability in 
revenue, using the expected value method and 
the revenue is recognised to the extent that it 
is highly probable that a significant reversal in 
the amount of cumulative revenue recognised 
will not occur in future on account of refund or 
discounts.
 
 
2.3.2.2 Significant financing component
	
	
	
Generally, the Company receives short-term 
advances from its customers. Using the 
practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company 
does not adjust the promised amount of 
consideration for the effects of a significant 
financing component if it expects, at contract 
inception, that the period between the transfer 
of the promised good or service to the customer 
and when the customer pays for that good or 
service will be one year or less.
	
2.3.3	Contract balances
 	
	
Trade receivables
	
	
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an 
amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., 
only the passage of time is required before payment 
of the consideration is due). Refer to note 2.14 – 
Financial Instruments in accounting policies.
	
2.3.4	Dividend Income
	
	
Dividend income from investments is recognised 
when the shareholder’s right to receive payment has 
been established (provided that it is probable that 
the economic benefits will flow to the Company and 
the amount of income can be measured reliably).
2.4	 Investments in subsidiaries and associates
	
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried 
at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying 
amount of the investment is assessed and written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, the difference 
between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts 
are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.5	 Government grants, subsidies and export 
incentives
	
Government grants / subsidies are recognised in 
statement of profit and loss as per income approach 
when there is reasonable assurance that the Company 
will comply with all the conditions attached to them and 
that the grant / subsidy will be received.
	
The Company has determined that reasonable assurance 
is established upon receipt of sanction letter approving 
the incentive amount in accordance with the respective 
State Industrial Promotion Subsidy.
	
The Company has chosen to adjust grant under the 
Export Promotion Capital Goods (‘EPCG’) scheme from 
the carrying value of non-monetary asset pursuant to 
amendment in Ind AS 20.
2.6	 Taxes
	
2.6.1	Current tax
	
	
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted 
or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in 
India where the Company operates and generates 
taxable income.
	
	
Current tax relating to items recognised outside 
the Statement of Profit and Loss is either in 
Other Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’) or in equity. 
Current tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate.
	
	
Interest expenses and penalties, if any, related to 
income tax are included in finance cost and other 
expenses respectively. Interest Income, if any, 
related to income tax is included in Other Income.
	
	
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation 
of complex tax regulations and the amount and 
timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range 
of business relationships and the long-term nature 
and complexity of existing contractual agreements, 
differences arising between the actual results 
and the assumptions made, or future changes 
to such assumptions, could necessitate future 
adjustments to tax income and expense already 
recorded. The Company establishes provisions, 
based on reasonable estimates, for possible 
consequences of audits by the tax authorities 
of the respective countries in which it operates. 
The amount of such provisions is based on various 
factors, such as experience of previous tax audits 
and differing interpretations of tax regulations by 
the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. 
Such differences of interpretation may arise on a 
wide variety of issues depending on the conditions 
prevailing in the Company’s domicile.
	
2.6.2	Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
	
	
	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit and loss.
	
	
	
In respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and interests in joint ventures when the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences 
can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised, except:
	
	
	
When the deferred tax asset relating to the 
deductible temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit and loss.
	
	
	
In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the 
Statement of Profit and Loss is recognised either in 
OCI or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised 
in correlation to the underlying transaction either in 
OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity 
and the same taxation authority.
2.7	 Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing 
part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for 
long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria 
are met. When significant parts of plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company 
depreciates them separately based on their specific useful 
lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its 
cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant 
and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria 
are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs 
are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as 
incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the 
decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in 
the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria 
for a provision are met. Subsequent expenditure is 
capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the 
Company and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 
April 2015, the company’s date of transition to Ind AS, 
was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as 
at the date of transition to Ind AS.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognised is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready 
for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are 
disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet 
date is classified as capital advances under “Other 
non-current assets”.
	
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the 
straight-line method based on useful life estimated by the 
management and supported by independent assessment 
by professionals which may not be necessarily in the 
alignment with the useful lives prescribed by schedule 
II to the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation commences 
when the asset is ready for its intended use. The Company 
has used the following useful lives to provide depreciation 
on its fixed assets.
Asset Class
Useful life
Freehold land
Non depreciable
Buildings
(including temporary structures)
1 year - 60 years
Plant & Equipment
1 year - 20 years
Furniture & Fixture
1 year - 10 years
Vehicle
1 year - 8 years
Office Equipment
1 Year- 5 years
	
The identified components are depreciated over their 
useful lives, the remaining asset is depreciated over the 
life of the principal asset.
	
The management believes that the depreciation rates 
fairly reflect its estimation of the useful lives and residual 
values of the fixed assets.
	
The residual values, useful life and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate.
2.8	 Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
	
Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and the related 
expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable 
that the future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. The cost of intangible 
assets at 1 April 2015, the Company’s date of transition 
to Ind AS, was determined with reference to its carrying 
value recognized as per the previous GAAP (deemed 
cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over 
the useful economic life and assessed for impairment 
whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset 
may be impaired. The amortisation expense on intangible 
assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss unless such expenditure forms part of 
carrying value of another asset.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible 
asset are measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
when the asset is derecognised.
	
Intangible assets are amortised on a pro-rata basis on the 
straight-line method based on useful life estimated by the 
management as under:
Asset Class
Useful life
Software
1 Year – 6 years
Brand (refer 2.8.1)
20 years
Technical know-how (refer 2.8.1)
20 years
Product development (refer 2.8.2)
6 - 20 years
Design and Patent
4 – 25 years
2.8.1	 Technical know-how and Brand
	
Technical know-how: The Company has originally 
generated technical know-how and assistance from 
International Tire Engineering Resources LLC, for 
setting up of Halol radial plant. Considering the life of 
the underlying plant / facility, this technical know-how, 
is amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 
twenty years.
	
Brand: The Company has acquired global rights of “CEAT” 
brand from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said 
acquisition, the Company was the owner of the brand 
in only a few Asian countries including India. With the 
acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, 
new and hitherto unexplored markets will be accessible 
to the Company. The Company will be in a position to fully 
exploit the export market resulting in increased volume 
and better price realisation. Therefore, the management 
believes that the Brand will yield significant benefits for a 
period of at least twenty years.
2.8.2	 Research and development costs (Product development)
	
Research costs are charged to P&L as and when they 
are incurred. Development expenditures on an individual 
project are recognised as an intangible asset when the 
Company can demonstrate:
	
	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale.
	
	
Its intention to complete and its ability and intention 
to use or sell the asset.
	
	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits.
	
	
The availability of resources to complete the asset.
	
	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during 
development.
	
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are 
treated as changes in accounting estimates.
2.8.3	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
	
At the end of each reporting year, the Company reviews 
the carrying amounts of its tangible assets and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible 
to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation 
can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to 
individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are 
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units 
for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis 
can be identified.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible 
assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment 
at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that 
the asset may be impaired.
	
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money

and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates 
of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
	
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial 
assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss, if any.
2.9	 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale (‘qualifying asset’) are capitalised 
as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing 
costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that 
an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. 
Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the 
extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
	
To the extent that the Company borrows funds specifically 
for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the 
Company determines the amount of borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalisation as the actual borrowing costs 
incurred on that borrowing during the period less any 
investment income on the temporary investment of those 
borrowings.
	
To the extent that the Company borrows funds 
generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a 
qualifying asset, the Company determines the amount 
of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying 
a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on that asset. 
The capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the 
borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the 
Company that are outstanding during the period, other 
than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of 
obtaining a qualifying asset.
2.10 Leases
	
The Company has entered into various arrangements 
like lease of premises and outsourcing arrangements 
which has been disclosed accordingly under Ind AS 
116. At inception of a contract, the Company assesses 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration. The assessment of 
whether a contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset depends on whether the Company 
obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the 
use of the asset and whether the Company has the right 
to direct the use of the asset.
	
Company as a lessee
	
The Company applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. 
The Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease 
payments and right-of-use assets representing the right 
to use the underlying assets.
	
2.10.1 Right-of-use assets
	
	
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date 
the underlying asset is available for use). The cost 
of right-of-use assets includes the amount of 
lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs 
incurred, and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, 
less any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over shorter of the lease term 
or the estimated useful life of the underlying asset 
as follows:
Asset Class
Useful life
Building
1 – 11 years
Land
95 Years
Others (includes buildings & Plant 
& machinery)
2 – 10 years
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to 
the Company at the end of the lease term or the 
cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, 
depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful 
life of the asset. The Company presents right-of-use 
assets separately in the Balance Sheet.
	
	
In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically 
reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted 
for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. 
When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a 
corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in 
profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-
use asset has been reduced to zero.
	
2.10.2 Lease liabilities
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the 
Company recognises lease liabilities measured at 
the present value of future lease payments to be 
made over the lease term. The lease payments 
include fixed payments (including in-substance 
fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, 
variable lease payments that depend on an index 
or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase option 
reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company 
and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, 
if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the 
option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do 
not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as 
expenses (unless the cost is included in the carrying 
value of inventories) in the period in which the event 
or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
	
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at 
the lease commencement date because the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
After the commencement date, the amount of 
lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion 
of interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease 
liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, 
a change in the lease term, a change in the lease 
payments (e.g., changes to future payments 
resulting from a change in an index or rate used to 
determine such lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the underlying 
asset.The Company’s lease liabilities are included 
in current and non-current financial liabilities. 
Lease liability has been separately presented in 
the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been 
classified as financing cash flows.
	
2.10.3 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
	
The Company applies the short-term lease 
recognition exemption to the contracts which have 
a lease term of 12 months or less from the date of 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase 
option. It also applies the lease of low-value assets 
recognition exemption to the lease contracts that 
are considered to be low value. Lease payments on 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are 
recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
2.11	Inventories
	
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value on item by item basis.
	
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in 
acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs 
and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present 
location and condition. Cost is determined on a weighted 
average basis:
	
	
Cost of raw materials includes the transfer of 
gains and losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, 
recognised in OCI, in respect of the purchases of raw 
materials. Raw materials and other items held for 
use in the production of inventories are not written 
down below cost if the finished products in which 
they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at 
or above cost.
	
	
Work-in-progress and finished goods includes direct 
materials, labour and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal operating capacity but 
excluding borrowing cost.
	
	
Traded goods and stores & spares include cost of 
purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale.
2.12	Provisions
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a 
past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. When the Company expects 
some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, 
under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset, but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating 
to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time 
is recognised as a finance cost.
	
2.12.1 Sales related obligations
	
	
The estimated liability for sales related obligations is 
recorded when products are sold. These estimates

are established using historical information on the 
nature, frequency and average cost of obligations 
and management estimates regarding possible 
future incidence based on corrective actions on 
product failure. The timing of outflows will vary as 
and when the obligation will arise - being typically up 
to three to seven years. Initial recognition is based 
on historical experience. The initial estimate of sales 
related obligations (related costs) is revised annually.
	
2.12.2 Decommissioning liability
	
	
The 
Company 
records 
a 
provision 
for 
decommissioning costs of land taken on lease at 
one of the manufacturing facility for the production 
of tyres. Decommissioning costs are provided at 
the present value of expected costs to settle the 
obligation using estimated cash flows and are 
recognised as part of the cost of the particular 
asset. The cash flows are discounted at a current 
pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the 
decommissioning liability. The unwinding of the 
discount is expensed as incurred and recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance cost. 
The estimated future costs of decommissioning 
are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. 
Changes in the estimated future costs or in the 
discount rate applied are added to or deducted from 
the cost of the asset.
	
2.12.3 Litigations
	
	
The Company is party to various lawsuits that are 
at administrative or judicial level or in their initial 
stages, involving tax and civil matters. The Company 
contests all claims in the court / tribunals / appellate 
authority levels and based on their assessment and 
that of their legal counsel, records a provision when 
the risk or loss is considered probable. The outflow 
is expected on cessations of the respective events.
2.13 Employee benefits
	
2.13.1 Defined contribution plan
	
	
Retirement benefit in the form of Provident Fund, 
Superannuation, Employees State Insurance 
Contribution and Labour Welfare fund are defined 
contribution scheme. The Company has no 
obligation, other than the contribution payable to the 
above mentioned funds. The Company recognises 
contribution payable to these funds / schemes as 
an expense when an employee renders the related 
service. If the contribution payable to the scheme 
for service received before the Balance Sheet date 
exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable is recognised as a liability after deducting 
the contribution already paid. If the contribution 
already paid exceeds the contribution due for 
services received before the Balance Sheet date, 
then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent 
that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a 
reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
	
2.13.1.1 Defined benefit plan
	
	
For defined benefit plans, the amount recognised 
as ‘Employee benefit expenses’ in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss is the cost of accruing employee 
benefits promised to employees over the year 
and the costs of individual events such as past / 
future service benefit changes and settlements 
(such events are recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss). The amount of net 
interest expense calculated by applying the liability 
discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or 
asset is charged or credited to ‘Finance costs’ in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. Any differences 
between the expected interest income on plan 
assets and the return achieved, and any changes 
in the liabilities over the year due to changes in 
actuarial assumptions or experience adjustments 
within the plans, are recognised immediately in OCI 
and subsequently not reclassified to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
	
	
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the 
Balance Sheet date comprises fair value of plan 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit 
liabilities using a discount rate by reference to 
market yields on Government bonds at the end of 
the reporting period.
	
	
All defined benefit plans obligations are determined 
based on valuations, as at the Balance Sheet 
date, made by independent actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. The classification 
of the Company’s net obligation into current and 
non-current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
	
	
When the benefits of a plan are changed or 
when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in 
benefit that relates to past service (‘past service 
cost’ or ‘past service gain’) or the gain or loss on 
curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or 
loss. The Company recognizes gains and losses on 
the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the 
settlement occurs.
	
2.13.2 Termination benefits
	
	
Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary 
retirement benefits or termination benefits 
arising from restructuring are recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company 
recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates:
	
	
	
When the Company can no longer withdraw the 
offer of those benefits; or
	
	
	
When the Company recognises costs for a 
restructuring that is within the scope of Ind 
AS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets and involves the payment 
of termination benefits.
	
	
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the 
end of the reporting period are discounted to their 
present value.
2.14	Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
2.14.1 Financial assets
	
	
Financial assets are recognized when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
 
 
2.14.1.1 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
On initial recognition, a financial asset is 
recognised at fair value. In case of financial 
assets which are recognised at fair value 
through profit and loss (FVTPL) except for 
trade receivables without financing component 
which are measured at transaction price, its 
transaction cost is recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. In other cases, the 
transaction cost is attributed to the acquisition 
value of the financial asset.
 
 
2.14.1.2 Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified in two categories:
	
	
	
2.14.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
	
2.14.1.2.2 Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI
 
 
 
2.14.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
	
	
A debt instrument is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
	
	
	
	
	
The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows; and
	
	
	
	
	
Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are Solely Payments of Principal 
and Interest (‘SPPI’) on the principal 
amount outstanding.
	
	
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included in finance income 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. This category generally applies 
to other receivables, loans and other 
financial assets.
 
 
 
2.14.1.2.2 Equity instruments
	
	
	
	
All investments in equity instruments 
within the scope of Ind AS 109 are initially 
measured at fair value. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading are classified as 
FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, 
the Company may make an irrevocable 
election to present in the OCI subsequent 
changes in the fair value. The Company 
makes such election on an instrument-by-
instrument basis. The classification 
is made on initial recognition and is 
irrevocable.
	
	
	
	
In case of equity instrument classified 
as FVTOCI, all fair value changes on 
the instrument, excluding dividends, are 
recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling 
of the amounts from OCI to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss, even on derecognition 
of investment. However, the Company 
may transfer the cumulative gain or loss 
within equity.
	
	
	
	
Equity instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.14.1.3 Derecognition
	
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a 
part of a financial asset or part of a group 
of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised when:
	
	
	
	
The rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset have expired; or
	
	
	
	
The Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset or has 
assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Company 
has transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
	
	
	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered 
into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates 
if and to what extent it has retained the risks 
and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred 
control of the asset, the Company continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the extent 
of the Company’s continuing involvement. 
In that case, the Company also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and 
the associated liability are measured on a basis 
that reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Company has retained.
	
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form 
of a guarantee over the transferred asset is 
measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum amount 
of consideration that the Company could be 
required to repay.
 
 
2.14.1.4 Impairment of financial assets
	
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company 
applies Expected Credit Loss (‘ECL’) model for 
measurement and recognition of impairment 
loss on the following financial assets and credit 
risk exposure:
	
	
	
(i)	
Trade receivables
	
	
	
(ii)	
Financial assets measured at amortised 
cost (other than trade receivables)
	
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI).
	
	
	
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on 
trade receivables. The application of simplified 
approach does not require the Company 
to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it 
recognises impairment loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right 
from its initial recognition.
	
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other 
financial assets [i.e. (ii) and (iii) above] and 
risk exposure, the Company determines that 
whether there has been a significant increase 
in the credit risk since initial recognition. 
If credit risk has not increased significantly, 
12 month ECL is used to provide for 
impairment loss. However, if credit risk has 
increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. 
If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of 
the instrument improves such that there is no 
longer a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, then the entity reverts to 
recognising impairment loss allowance based 
on 12 month ECL.
	
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses 
resulting from all possible default events over 
the expected life of a financial instrument. 
The 12 month ECL is a portion of the lifetime 
ECL which results from default events that 
are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date.
	
	
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual 
cash flows that are due to the Company in 
accordance with the contract and all the cash 
flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original 
EIR. When estimating the cash flows, an entity 
is required to consider:
	
	
	
	
All contractual terms of the financial 
instrument (including prepayment, 
extension, call and similar options) over the 
expected life of the financial instrument. 
However, in rare cases when the expected 
life of the financial instrument cannot 
be estimated reliably, then the entity is 
required to use the remaining contractual 
term of the financial instrument.
	
	
	
	
Cash flows from the sale of collateral 
held or other credit enhancements that 
are integral to the contractual terms.
	
	
	
As a practical expedient, the Company uses a 
provision matrix to determine impairment loss 
allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. 
The provision matrix is based on its historically 
observed default rates over the expected life 
of the trade receivables and is adjusted for 
forward-looking estimates. At every reporting 
date, the historical observed default rates and 
changes in the forward-looking estimates are 
updated. For assessing increase in credit risk 
and impairment loss, the Company combines 
financial instruments on the basis of shared 
credit risk characteristics with the objective 
of facilitating an analysis that is designed to 
enable significant increases in credit risk to be 
identified on a timely basis.
	
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognised during the period is recognised as 
income / expense in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. This amount is reflected under the 
head ‘other expenses’ in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
The Balance Sheet presentation for various 
financial instruments is described below:
	
	
	
	
Financial assets measured at amortised 
cost and contractual revenue receivables: 
ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e. 
as an integral part of the measurement 
of those assets in the Balance Sheet. 
The allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Company does not reduce 
impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
	
The Company does not have any purchased or 
originated credit-impaired financial assets, i.e., 
financial assets which are credit impaired on 
purchase / origination.
	
2.14.2 Financial liabilities
 
 
2.14.2.1 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are recognized when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. All financial 
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and in the case of borrowings net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
 
 
2.14.2.2 Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends 
on their classification, as described below:
 
 
 
2.14.2.2.1 Financial liabilities at amortised cost
	
	
	
	
This is the category most relevant to 
the Company. After initial recognition, 
financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR 
method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss when 
the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process.
	
	
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance costs 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
2.14.2.3 Derecognition
	
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
2.14.3 Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
	
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward currency contracts, to manage its 
foreign currency risks. These derivative instruments 
are designated as cash flow, fair value or net 
investment hedges and are entered into for period 
consistent with currency. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the 
fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when 
the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising 
from changes in the fair value of derivatives are 
taken directly to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.14.3.1 Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the 
cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Profit or Loss.
	
	
	
The Company uses forward currency 
contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign 
currency risk in forecast transactions and firm 
commitments. The ineffective portion relating 
to foreign currency contracts is recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred 
to the Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
hedged transaction affects profit and loss, i.e. 
when the hedged financial income or financial 
expense is recognised or when a forecast sale 
occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a 
non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the 
amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to 
the initial carrying amount of the non-financial 
asset or liability.
	
	
	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement 
or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), 
or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
or when the hedge no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in OCI 
remains separately in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs or the foreign currency firm 
commitment is met.
	
2.14.4 Fair value measurement
	
	
The Company measures derivatives instruments 
like forward contracts at fair value at each Balance 
Sheet date.
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
	
	
	
In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
	
	
	
In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or 
liability.
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Company.
	
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole:
	
	
	
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
	
	
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable
	
	
	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement is unobservable
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the 
fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
2.14.5 Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities can be offset 
and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.
2.15	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the Balance Sheet comprises 
cash at banks and on hand. For the purpose of cash flow 
statement, Cash & Cash equivalent consists of cash & 
short term deposits as defined above. The Cash flow 
statement is prepared using indirect method.
2.16	Dividend distribution to equity shareholders
	
The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend to 
equity shareholders of the Company when the distribution 
is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in 
India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by 
the shareholders.
2.17	Foreign currencies
	
The Company’s financial statements are presented in C, 
which is also the Company’s functional currency.
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by 
the Company at C spot rate at the date the transaction first 
qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the 
reporting date.
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation 
of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the 
gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair value gain 
or loss is recognised in OCI or profit and loss are also 
recognised in OCI or the Statement of Profit and Loss, 
respectively).
2.18	Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’)
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit 
for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year.
	
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the 
profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 
after adjusting impact of dilution shares by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year plus the weighted average number of equity shares 
that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive 
potential equity shares into equity shares.
2.19	Segment Reporting
	
The Executive Management Committee evaluates the 
Company’s performance and allocates the resources 
based on an analysis of various performance indicators 
by business segments.
	
The Company prepares its segment information in 
conformity with the accounting policies adopted for 
preparing and presenting the financial statements of the 
Company as a whole.
2.20	Contingent liabilities and assets
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non—occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the Company 
or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is 
not probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in 
extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot 
be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. 
The Company does not recognise a contingent liability 
but discloses its existence in the financial statements.
2.21	Significant accounting judgments, estimates and 
assumptions
	
The preparation of the financial statements requires 
management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates 
could result in outcomes that require an adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in future 
periods. Difference between actual results and estimates 
are recognised in the periods in which the results are 
known / materialised.

The key assumptions concerning the future and other 
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year, are described 
below. The Company has based its assumptions and 
estimates on parameters available when the financial 
statements were prepared. Existing circumstances 
and assumptions about future developments, however, 
may change due to market changes or circumstances 
arising that are beyond the control of the Company. 
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when 
they occur.
	
Information about critical judgments in applying 
accounting policies, as well as estimates and 
assumptions that have the most significant effect to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are included in the following notes:

The capacity expansions undertaken is modular in nature, wherein civil work and major upstream capex are incurred, followed 
by downstream capex to ramp up production in line with anticipated market demand. Based on long term demand and supply 
planning, management estimates the annual capex requirement and project timelines which are approved by the Board. There are 
no projects which are overdue based on such timelines or which have exceeded cost compared to plans.

Significant Judgements in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options:
	
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an 
option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the 
lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
	
The Company has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Company applies judgement 
in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it 
considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the 
commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances 
that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.
Note 3: Property, plant and equipment and Capital work-in-progress (Contd..)
	
The Company included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of buildings and other with shorter 
non-cancellable period. The Company typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be a 
significant negative effect on the operations if a replacement asset is not readily available. The renewal periods for leases 
of building and others with longer non-cancellable periods are not included as part of the lease term as these are not 
reasonably certain to be exercised. Furthermore, the periods covered by termination options are included as part of the 
lease term only when they are reasonably certain not to be exercised.
d) 	
The Company has lease contracts for plant & machinery that contains variable payments amounting to C 19,435 lakhs 
( C 18,215 lakhs in March 31, 2024) shown under other expenses.
e) 	
The Company has recognised C 1,034 lakhs as miscellaneous expenses during the year ( C 917 lakhs in March 31, 2024) 
which pertains to short term lease/ low value asset which was not recognised as part of ROU.

Refer note 30 for Company’s contribution to the defined contribution plans with respect to provident fund and other funds.
b) 	 Defined benefit plan – Gratuity
	
Description of plan
	
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan which is funded with an Insurance Company in the form of a qualifying 
Insurance policy. The Company’s defined benefit gratuity plan is a salary plan for employees which requires contributions 
to be made to a separate administrative fund. The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the 
act, every employee who has completed five years of service gets a gratuity on separation at 15 days of last drawn salary 
for each completed year of service.
	
Governance
	
The fund has the form of a trust and it is governed by the Board of Trustees, which consists of employer and employee 
representatives. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the 
investment strategy. Each year, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding.
	
Investment Strategy
	
The Board of trustees have appointed LIC of India, Birla Sun Life Insurance, India First Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life 
Insurance & HDFC Life Insurance to manage its funds. The Board of Trustees aim to keep annual contributions relatively 
stable at a level such that no plan deficits (based on valuation performed) will arise. Every year, the insurance Company 
carries out a funding valuation based on the latest employee data provided by the Company. Any deficit in the assets arising 
as a result of such valuation is funded by the Company. In case of death, while in service, the gratuity is payable irrespective 
of vesting.

These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Demographic 
Risk, Market Risk, Regulatory Risk and Salary Risk.	
Risk
Exposure
Interest
The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest 
rates will result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit 
and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial 
statements).
Investment
The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on 
any particular investment.
Demographic
The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of 
the liability. The Company is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be 
worse compared to the assumption.
Salary Escalation
The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of 
salary increase rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase 
of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used to 
determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan’s liability.
Asset Liability Mismatching 
or Market Risk
The duration of the liability is longer compared to duration of assets, exposing the 
Company to market risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.
Regulatory Risk
Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of 
Gratuity Act, 1972 (as amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in 
regulations requiring higher gratuity payouts (e.g. Increase in the maximum limit on 
gratuity of C 20,00,000).
 
x) 
Weighted average duration and expected employers contribution for the next year for the defined benefit plan
	
	
The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash flows) of defined benefit obligation is 11 years.

d. 	 Material demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Company
	
The Company has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central Excise 
Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and 
tied up through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central 
Excise Act, read with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty 
amounting to C 27,672 lakhs. i.e., the difference between the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value 
and duty payable on the basis of MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April 2011 to June 2017. The Company believes 
that Set of TT / TTF (Tyre and Tube / Tyre, Tube and Flap) is not a pre-packaged commodity in terms of provisions of Legal 
Metrology Act, 2009 read with Central Excise Act and Rules made thereunder. The Company has a strong case on the ground 
that, the said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal Metrology Department vide its letter dated May 01, 1991 
that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be treated as a pre-packed commodity within the 
meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities), Rules, 1977”. The above clarification 
has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.

* The trade payables / short term borrowings are naturally hedged (off-set) to the extent of exposure under trade receivables / advances for 
respective currencies.
The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable forecast transactions. As a 
result, no hedge ineffectiveness arise requiring recognition through the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The cash flow hedges as at March 31, 2025 were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of C 2,810 lacs, with 
a deferred tax asset of C 707 lacs relating to the hedging instruments, is included in OCI. Comparatively, the cash flow hedges 
as at March 31, 2024 were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of C268 lacs, with a deferred tax asset of C 
67 lacs relating to the hedging instruments, was included in OCI.
Note 42: Fair values
The management considers that the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities which are recognised at amortised 
cost are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Note 41: Hedging activities and derivatives (Contd..)
Note 43: Fair value hierarchy
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note 42 above have been classified into three categories depending on 
the inputs used in the valuation technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows:
• 	
Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market;
• 	
Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
• 	
Level 3: Inputs which are not based on observable market data.

Calculation of Fair Values
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions 
used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used for the year ended March 31, 2025.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at Balance Sheet date:
Derivative financial instruments: The fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation 
techniques with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, 
foreign exchange forward rates, etc.

Note 44 : Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. 
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets 
include trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Company also enters 
into derivative transactions.
The Company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are 
identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for 
risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. 
The Board of Directors through its Risk Management Committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, 
which are summarised below
a) 	 Market risk
	
The Company’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial 
instruments:
	
• 	
Interest rate risk;
	
• 	
Foreign currency risk;
	
• 	
Equity price risk; and
	
• 	
Commodity risk
	
The above risks may affect the Company’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The Company’s 
exposure to and management of these risks are explained below.
	
The sensitivity of the relevant Statement of Profit or Loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market 
risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 including the 
effect of hedge accounting.
Note 43: Fair value hierarchy (Contd..)
	
i. 	
Interest rate risk	
Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value 
or future cash flows of 
a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because 
of changes in market 
interest rates.
Relates 
primarily 
to the 
Company’s 
long-
term debt 
obligations 
with floating 
interest rates.
The Company manages its interest rate risk pertaining to domestic 
borrowings by maintaining a balanced portfolio of borrowings linked to 
various tenor benchmark of MCLR, Repo rate and T-Bills. The Company 
enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at 
specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest 
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal 
amount.
As at March 31, 2025, after taking into account the effect of interest rate 
swaps, approximately 45% of the Company’s total borrowings are at a 
fixed rate of interest (March 31, 2024: 34%).

ii. 	
Foreign currency risk	
Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value 
or future cash flows 
of an exposure will 
fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign 
exchange rates.
Relates 
primarily to 
the Company’s 
operating 
activities 
(when revenue 
or expense is 
denominated 
in a foreign 
currency).
For the committed transactions, The Company manages its foreign 
currency risk by hedging transactions till the actual date of inflow & 
outflow. When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a 
hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match 
the terms of the hedged exposure. For hedges of forecast transactions, 
the derivatives cover the period of exposure from the point the cash 
flows of the transactions are forecasted up to the point of settlement 
of the resulting receivable or payable that is denominated in the foreign 
currency.
As at March 31, 2025, the Company has hedged 82% (March 31, 2024: 
88%) of its foreign currency receivables / payables.

Foreign currency sensitivity
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EURO rates, with all other 
variables held constant. The impact on the Company’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary 
assets and liabilities. The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

The movement in the pre-tax effect is a result of a change in the fair value of the financial asset / liability due to the 
exchange rate movement. The derivatives which have not been designated in a hedge relationship act as an economic 
hedge and will offset the underlying transactions when they occur. The same derivatives are not covered in the 
above table.
	
	
In Management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because 
the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
	
iii. 	 Equity price risk
	
	
There is no material equity risk relating to the Company’s equity investments which are detailed in note 6. The Company’s 
equity investments majorly comprise of strategic investments rather than trading purposes.

The following table approximately details the Company’s sensitivity to a 5% movement in the input price of rubber and 
carbon black. The sensitivity analysis includes only 5% change in commodity prices for quantity sold or consumed 
during the year, with all other variables held constant. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity 
where the commodity prices decrease by 5%. For a 5% increase in commodity prices, there would be a comparable 
impact on profit or equity, and the balances below would be negative.

b) 	 Credit risk
	
Trade receivables
 
Risk:
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading 
to a financial loss.
 
Risk Management:
	
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management.
	
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 27 days to 60 days credit term. Credit limits are established 
for all customers based on internal rating criteria. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. An impairment 
analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of 
minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Company has no 
concentration of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.
	
Export receivables are against Letter of Credit, bank guarantees, payment against documents. For open credit exports 
insurance cover is taken. Generally deposits are taken from domestic debtors under replacement segment. The carrying 
amount and fair value of security deposit from dealers amounts to C 59,130 lakhs (March 31, 2024: C 53,862 lakhs) as it 
is payable on demand. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of 
financial assets.

Any surplus is invested in appropriate mutual funds or bank deposits. The Company also monitors the liquidity on a longer 
term wherein it is ensured that the long term assets are funded by long term liabilities. The Company ensures that the duration 
of its current assets is in line with the current liabilities to ensure adequate liquidity in the 3-6 months period. The table below

Note 45: Capital management
For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity 
reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to 
maximise the shareholder value. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in 
economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company 
may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Company monitors 
capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Company includes within net debt, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets 
financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in 
meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches 
in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended March 31, 2025 
and March 31, 2024.
Note 46: Material foreseeable losses
The Company has a process whereby periodically all long term contracts (including derivative contracts) are assessed for material 
foreseeable losses. At the year end, the Company has reviewed and ensured that adequate provision as required under any law 
/ accounting standards for material foreseeable losses on such long term contracts (including derivative contracts) has been 
made in the books of accounts.
Note 47: Acquisition of Camso Off-Highway Business
The Group has entered into definitive agreement(s) on December 6, 2024 with associate companies in the Michelin Group for 
acquisition of Camso brand’s Off-Highway construction equipment tyre and tracks business, through one or more subsidiaries

To the Members of CEAT Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of CEAT 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) 
and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as “the Group”) and its joint ventures, which 
comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, 
and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows 
for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, including material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration 
of reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements 
of such subsidiaries and joint ventures as were audited by the 
other auditors, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group and 
its joint ventures as at 31 March 2025, of its consolidated profit 
Independent Auditor’s Report
Key audit matter
See Note 24 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group recognises revenue from the sale of products 
when control over goods is transferred to the customer 
based on specific terms and conditions of sale contracts 
with respective customers. Revenue is a key performance 
indicator and there is a presumed fraud risk of revenue being 
overstated through manipulation of the timing of transfer of 
control due to pressures to achieve performance targets as 
well as meeting external expectations.
Revenue is measured net of any discounts and rebates. 
Recognition and measurement of off-invoice discounts and 
rebates accruals, involves judgement and estimates. This 
leads to a risk of revenue being misstated due to inaccurate 
estimation over off-invoice discounts and rebates.
Hence, revenue recognition is considered to be a key audit 
matter. 
In view of the significance of the matter we’ll apply the 
following audit procedures in this area, among others to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:
 
 Assessed the appropriateness of the policies in respect 
of revenue recognition including discounts and rebates 
by comparing with applicable accounting standards
 
 Performed testing of design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the Company’s general 
Information Technology (‘IT’) controls and key IT 
application controls over revenue recognition by involving 
our IT specialists.
 
 Performed testing of design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the Company’s key manual 
controls around revenue recognition including accruals 
and actualization of discounts and rebates.
and other comprehensive loss, consolidated changes in equity 
and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group and its joint ventures in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by 
us along with the consideration of reports of the other auditors 
referred to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.

and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements by the Management 
and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group and the respective 
Management and Board of Directors of its joint ventures 
are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for 
overseeing the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint 
ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial statements of such entities or business 
activities within the Group and its joint ventures to express 
an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements 
of such entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by other auditors, 
such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried out by 
them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in 
paragraph (a) of the section titled “Other Matters” in this 
audit report.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Holding Company of which we are the independent auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical

Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s

materially misstated.
When we read the Holding Company’s annual report, if we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged with 
governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under 
the relevant laws and regulations
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference 
to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements include those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements insofar as it 
relates to three subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of 
the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.
The internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements insofar as it relates to one subsidiary company, 
which is a company incorporated in India and included in 
these consolidated financial statements, have not been 
audited either by us or by other auditor. In our opinion and 
according to the information and explanations given to us by 
the Management, such unaudited components is not material 
to the Holding Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of above matters.

Report on the internal financial controls with reference 
to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of 
the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on 
Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of 
our report of even date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of CEAT Limited (hereinafter referred to as 
“the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 31 
March 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company 
and such companies incorporated in India under the Act which 
is its subsidiary companies, as of that date.
In our opinion, and based on the consideration of reports of 
the other auditors on internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements of subsidiary companies, as were 
audited by the other auditors the Holding Company and such 
companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary 
companies, have, in all material respects, adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements and 
such internal financial controls were operating effectively as 
at 31 March 2025, based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria established 
by such companies considering the essential components 
of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 
“Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the respective companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, 
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the 
consolidated financial statements of CEAT Limited 
for the year ended 31 March 2025
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the Holding Company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements were established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant 
subsidiary companies, in terms of their reports referred to in the 
Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements.

2.2	 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at March 31, 
2025. The Group’s investment in jointly controlled entities 
and associate are accounted for using the equity method. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and 
only if the Group has:
	
Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give 
it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of 
the investee)
	
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee, and
	
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect 
its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting 
rights result in control. To support this presumption and when 
the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar 
rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts 
and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an 
investee, including:
	
The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders 
of the investee
	
Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
	
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
	
The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to 
the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other voting 
rights holders.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee 
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation 
of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over 
the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of 
the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a 
subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included 
in the consolidated financial statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control 
the subsidiary.
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other 
events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group 
uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the 
consolidated financial statements for like transactions and 
events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are 
made to that group member’s financial statements in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity 
with the group’s accounting policies.
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of 
consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of 
the parent company, i.e., year ended on March 31. When the 
end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that 
of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation 
purposes, additional financial information as of the same date 
as the financial statements of the parent to enable the parent 
to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, 
unless it is impracticable to do so.
Consolidation procedure:
	
Combine items like of assets, liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its 
subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of 
the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets 
and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements at the acquisition date.
	
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s 
investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion of 
equity of each subsidiary. Business combinations policy 
explains how to account for any related goodwill.
	
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between entities of the group (profits or losses resulting 
from intragroup transactions that are recognised in 
assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated 
in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment 
that requires recognition in the consolidated financial 
statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes applies to temporary 
differences that arise from the elimination of profits and 
losses resulting from intragroup transactions.
	
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having 
a deficit balance.

Note 2: Basis of preparation, measurement and 
material accounting policies
2.1	 Basis of preparation and measurement
2.1.1. Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in 
accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 
read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time and 
presentation requirements of Division II of revised Schedule 
III of the Companies Act 2013 (Ind AS compliant Schedule III).
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
on accrual and going concern basis. The accounting policies 
are applied consistently to all the periods presented in the 
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in “C”, the functional currency of the 
Group. Items included in the financial statements of the Group 
are recorded using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates (the ‘functional 
currency’).
All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
and notes have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs as per 
the requirements of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013,

recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment 
is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net 
assets of joint venture or associate since the acquisition date. 
Goodwill relating to joint venture or associate is included in 
the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for 
impairment individually.
The consolidated statement of profit and loss reflects the 
Group’s share of the results of operations of joint venture and 
associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented 
as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been 
a change recognised directly in the equity of joint venture or 
associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, 
when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. 
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions 
between the Group and joint venture or associate are eliminated 
to the extent of the interest in joint venture or associate.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of a joint 
venture and associate is shown on the face of the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
The financial statements of joint venture and associate 
are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in its joint venture or associate. At each reporting 
date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence 
that the investment in joint venture or associate is impaired. 
If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of 
impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount 
of joint venture or associate and its carrying value, and then 
recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of a joint venture and 
associate’ in the statement of profit or loss.
2.5	 Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance sheet 
based on current/ non-current classification. An asset is 
treated as current when it is:
	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current 
assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
2.6	 Revenue from operation & other income
2.6.1 Revenue from contracts with customers
	
Revenues from contracts with customers are when the 
performance obligations towards customer have been 
met. Performance obligations are deemed to have 
been met when control of the goods or services are 
transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. The Group acts as 
the principle in all of its revenue arrangements since it is 
the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it 
has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and 
credit risks.
	
An entity collects Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’) on behalf 
of the government and not on its own account. Hence it 
is excluded from revenue, i.e. Revenue is net of GST.
2.6.2 Sale of Goods
	
Revenue from sale of goods (Tyres, tubes and flaps) is 
recognised at the point of time when control of the goods 
is transferred to customer depending on terms of sales.
	
The Group considers whether there are other promises in 
the contract that are separate performance obligations 
to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be 
allocated (e.g. Sales related obligations). In determining 
the transaction price for the sale of goods, the Group 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a 
loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the 
Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
	
Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and 
liabilities of the subsidiary
	
Derecognises 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
any 
non-controlling interests
	
Derecognises the cumulative translation differences 
recorded in equity
	
Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
	
Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
	
Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
	
Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously 
recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, as 
appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly 
disposed of the related assets or liabilities
2.3	 Business Combination
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured 
at fair value as on acquisition date and the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the Group elects whether to measure the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and 
the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date 
fair values.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability 
that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind 
AS 109 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. If the 
contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 
109, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind 
AS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequently 
its settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous 
interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. Any gain on a bargain purchase is 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in equity as capital reserve if there exists clear evidence, of the 
underlying reasons for classifying the business combination 
as resulting in a bargain purchase; otherwise the gain is 
recognised in equity as capital reserve.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for 
goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit 
and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included 
in the carrying amount of the operation when determining 
the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these 
circumstances is measured based on the relative values of 
the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.
2.4	 Investment in joint venture and associate
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights 
to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, 
which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities 
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is 
not control or joint control over those policies.
The considerations made in determining whether joint control 
are similar to those necessary to determine control over the 
subsidiaries.
The Group’s investments in joint venture and associate are 
accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity 
method, the investment in a joint venture or associate is initially

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit and loss.
	
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and interests in 
joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
	
When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss.
	
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised 
only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each 
reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside consolidated 
statement of profit and loss is recognised either in OCI or in 
equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a 
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to 
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
2.9	 Non-current assets held for sale
The Group classifies Non-current assets or disposal groups 
comprising of assets and liabilities are classified as ‘held for 
sale’ when all of the following criteria are met
	
Decision has been made to sell;
	
The assets are available for immediate sale in its present 
condition;
	
The assets are being actively marketed; and,
	
Sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded 
within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups 
classified as ‘held for sale’ are measured at the lower of it carrying 
value and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held 
for sale are not depreciated or amortised.
2.10	 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant 
and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction 
projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant 
parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at 
intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on 
their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection 
is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition 
criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for 
the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in 
the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a 
provision are met. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. The cost of property, plant and 
equipment at 1 April 2015, the company’s date of transition 
to Ind AS, was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the 
date of transition to Ind AS.
considers the effects of variable consideration, the 
existence of significant financing components, if any.
2.6.3 Variable consideration
	
Variable consideration includes various forms of 
discounts like volume discounts, price concessions, 
incentives, etc. on the goods sold to its dealers and 
distributors. In all such cases, accumulated experience is 
used to estimate and provide for the variability in revenue, 
using the expected value method and the revenue is 
recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a 
significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue 
recognised will not occur in future on account of refund 
or discounts.
2.6.4 Significant financing component
	
Generally, the Group receives short-term advances from 
its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 
115, the Group does not adjust the promised amount of 
consideration for the effects of a significant financing 
component if it expects, at contract inception, that the 
period between the transfer of the promised good or 
service to the customer and when the customer pays for 
that good or service will be one year or less.
2.6.5 Contract balances-Trade receivables
	
A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of 
consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage 
of time is required before payment of the consideration 
is due). Refer to note 2.17 Financial Instruments in 
accounting policies.
2.6.6 Dividend Income
	
Dividend income from investments is recognised when 
the shareholder’s right to receive payment has been 
established (provided that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of 
income can be measured reliably).
2.7	 Government grants, subsidies and export incentives
Government grants / subsidies are recognised in statement 
of profit and loss as per income approach when there is 
reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with all the 
conditions attached to them and that the grant / subsidy will 
be received.
The Company has determined that reasonable assurance 
is established upon receipt of sanction letter approving the 
incentive amount in accordance with the respective State 
Industrial Promotion Subsidy.
The Group has chosen to adjust grant under the Export 
Promotion Capital Goods (‘EPCG’) scheme from the carrying 
value of non-monetary asset pursuant to amendment in 
Ind AS 20.
Export Incentive under Merchandise Export from India Scheme 
(‘MEIS’) is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss as a part of other operating revenues on receipt basis.
2.8	 Taxes
2.8.1 Current Tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date in India where the Group operates and 
generates taxable income.
Current tax relating to items recognised outside the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss is either in Other 
Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’) or in equity. Current tax items 
are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in consolidated statement of profit and loss or directly 
in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes 
provisions where appropriate.
Interest expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax 
are included in finance cost and other expenses respectively. 
Interest Income, if any, related to income tax is included in 
Other Income.
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex 
tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. Given the wide range of business relationships and 
the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual 
agreements, differences arising between the actual results and 
the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, 
could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and 
expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions, 
based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences 
of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in 
which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based 
on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits 
and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable 
entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of 
interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending 
on the conditions prevailing in the Group’s domicile.
2.8.2 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

and 
development 
costs 
(Product 
development)
	
Research costs are charged to P&L as and when they 
are incurred. Development expenditures on an individual 
project are recognised as an intangible asset when the 
Group can demonstrate:
	
	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale.
	
	
Its intention to complete and its ability and intention 
to use or sell the asset.
	
	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits.
	
	
The availability of resources to complete the asset.
	
	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during 
development.
	
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are 
treated as changes in accounting estimates.
2.11.3 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
At the end of each reporting year, the Company reviews the 
carrying amounts of its tangible assets and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount 
of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be 
identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual 
cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the 
smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable 
and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible 
assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at 
least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to 
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, 
then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
2.12	 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or 
sale (‘qualifying asset’) are capitalised as part of the cost of the 
asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in 
which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of 
funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to 
the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
To the extent that the Group borrows funds specifically for the 
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Group determines 
the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as 
the actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during 
the period less any investment income on the temporary 
investment of those borrowings.
To the extent that the Group borrows funds generally and 
uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, 
the Group determines the amount of borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalisation by applying a capitalisation rate to 
the expenditures on that asset. The capitalisation rate is the 
weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the 
borrowings of the Group that are outstanding during the period, 
other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of 
obtaining a qualifying asset.
2.13	 Leases
The Group has entered into various arrangements like lease 
of premises and outsourcing arrangements which has 
been disclosed accordingly under Ind AS 116. At inception 
of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or 
contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
The assessment of whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset depends on whether the 
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant 
part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the 
asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the asset 
is derecognised.
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended 
use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital 
work-in-progress”.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified 
as capital advances under “Other non-current assets”.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight-line 
method based on useful life estimated by the management 
and supported by independent assessment by professionals 
which may not be necessarily in the alignment with the useful 
lives prescribed by schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. 
Depreciation commences when the asset is ready for its 
intended use. The Group has used the following useful lives to 
provide depreciation on its fixed assets.
Asset Class
Useful life
Freehold land
Non depreciable
Leasehold land
Lease term – 95 years
Buildings  
(including temporary structures)
1 year - 60 years
Plant & Equipment
1 year - 20 years
Furniture & Fixture
1 year - 10 years
Vehicle
1 year - 8 years
Office Equipment
1 Year- 5 years
The identified components are depreciated over their useful 
lives, the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the 
principal asset.
The management believes that the depreciation rates fairly 
reflect its estimation of the useful lives and residual values of 
the fixed assets.
The residual values, useful life and methods of depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial 
year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
2.11	 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses.
Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and the related 
expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that 
the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure 
will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. The cost of intangible assets at 1 April 2015, 
the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined 
with reference to its carrying value recognised as per the 
previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of transition 
to Ind AS.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there 
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite 
lives is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible 
asset are measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss 
when the asset is derecognised.
Intangible assets are amortised on a pro-rata basis on the 
straight line method based on useful life estimated by the 
management as under:
Asset Class
Useful life
Software
1 Year – 6 years
Brand (refer 2.11.1)
20 years
Technical know-how (refer 2.11.1)
20 years
Product development (refer 2.11.2)
6 – 20 years
Design and Patent
4 – 25 years
2.11.1 Technical know-how and Brand
	
Technical know-how: The Group has originally generated 
technical know-how and assistance from International 
Tire Engineering Resources LLC, for setting up of Halol 
radial plant. Considering the life of the underlying plant 
/ facility, this technical know-how, is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over a period of twenty years.
	
Brand: The Group has acquired global rights of “CEAT” 
brand from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said 
acquisition, the Group was the owner of the brand in only 
a few Asian countries including India. With the acquisition 
of the brand which is renowned worldwide, new and 
hitherto unexplored markets will be accessible to the 
Group. The Group will be in a position to fully exploit the 
export market resulting in increased volume and better

overheads based on normal operating capacity but 
excluding borrowing cost.
	
Traded goods and stores & spares include cost of 
purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and 
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
2.15 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision 
to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, 
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time 
is recognised as a finance cost.
2.15.1 Sales related obligations
The estimated liability for sales related obligations is recorded 
when products are sold. These estimates are established using 
historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost 
of obligations and management estimates regarding possible 
future incidence based on corrective actions on product failure. 
The timing of outflows will vary as and when the obligation 
will arise - being typically up to three years. Initial recognition 
is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of sales 
related obligations (related costs) are revised annually.
2.15.2 Decommissioning liability
The Group records a provision for decommissioning costs of 
land taken on lease at one of the manufacturing facility for 
the production of tyres. Decommissioning costs are provided 
at the present value of expected costs to settle the obligation 
using estimated cash flows and are recognised as part of the 
cost of the particular asset. The cash flows are discounted 
at a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the 
decommissioning liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
expensed as incurred and recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss as a finance cost. The estimated 
future costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually and 
adjusted as appropriate. Changes in the estimated future costs 
or in the discount rate applied are added to or deducted from 
the cost of the asset.
2.15.3 Litigations
The Group is party to various lawsuits that are at administrative 
or judicial level or in their initial stages, involving tax and civil 
matters. The Group contests all claims in the court / tribunals 
/ appellate authority levels and based on their assessment 
and that of their legal counsel, records a provision when the 
risk or loss is considered probable. The outflow is expected on 
cessations of the respective events.
2.16 Employee benefits
2.16.1 Defined contribution plan
Retirement benefit in the form of Provident Fund, 
Superannuation, Employees State Insurance Contribution 
and Labour Welfare fund are defined contribution scheme. 
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution 
payable to the above mentioned funds. The Group recognises 
contribution payable to these funds / schemes as an 
expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme for service received before 
the Balance Sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, 
the deficit payable is recognised as a liability after deducting 
the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid 
exceeds the contribution due for services received before the 
Balance Sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset 
to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a 
reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
2.16.2 Defined benefit plan
For defined benefit plans, the amount recognised as ‘Employee 
benefit expenses’ in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss is the cost of accruing employee benefits promised to 
employees over the year and the costs of individual events 
such as past / future service benefit changes and settlements 
(such events are recognised immediately in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss). The amount of net interest 
expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to 
the net defined benefit liability or asset is charged or credited to 
‘Finance costs’ in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
Any differences between the expected interest income on plan 
assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the 
liabilities over the year due to changes in actuarial assumptions 
or experience adjustments within the plans, are recognised 
immediately in OCI and subsequently not reclassified to the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the Balance 
Sheet date comprises fair value of plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit liabilities using a discount rate by 
Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the 
use of the asset and whether the Group has the right to direct 
the use of the asset.
Group as a lessee:
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to 
make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the 
right to use the underlying assets.
2.13.1 Right-of-use assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement 
date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available 
for use). The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount 
of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets 
are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on 
a straight-line basis over shorter of the lease term or the 
estimated useful life of the underlying asset as follows:
Asset Class
Useful life
Building
1 – 11 years
Land
95 Years
Others (includes buildings & Plant & 
machinery)
2 – 10 years
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the 
end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a 
purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated 
useful life of the asset. The Group presents right-of-use assets 
separately in the Balance Sheet.
In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced 
by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain 
remeasurements of the lease liability. When the lease liability is 
remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made 
to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded 
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset 
has been reduced to zero.
2.13.2 Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises 
lease liabilities measured at the present value of future lease 
payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments 
include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) 
less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments 
that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to 
be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably 
certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties 
for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 
exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments 
that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as 
expenses (unless the cost is included in the carrying value of 
inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that 
triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect 
the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease 
term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate 
used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in current and 
non-current financial liabilities. Lease liability has been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing cash flows.
2.13.3 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption 
to the contracts which have a lease term of 12 months or less 
from the date of commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option. It also applies the lease of low-value 
assets recognition exemption to the lease contracts that are 
considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.14 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value on item-by-item basis.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in 
acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and 
other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location 
and condition. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
	
Cost of raw materials includes the transfer of gains 
and losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, recognised 
in OCI, in respect of the purchases of raw materials. 
Raw materials and other items held for use in the 
production of inventories are not written down below cost 
if the finished products in which they will be incorporated 
are expected to be sold at or above cost.

risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of 
the asset.
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises 
an associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects 
the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the 
maximum amount of consideration that the Group could 
be required to repay.
2.17.1.4 Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies Expected 
Credit Loss (‘ECL’) model for measurement and recognition of 
impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit 
risk exposure:
(i)	
Trade receivables
(ii)	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost (other than 
trade receivables)
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of 
impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The application 
of simplified approach does not require the Group to track 
changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right 
from its initial recognition.
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets 
[i.e. (ii) and (iii) above] and risk exposure, the Group determines 
that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit 
risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased 
significantly, 12 month ECL is used to provide for impairment 
loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime 
ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the 
instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity 
reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 
12-month ECL.
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all 
possible default events over the expected life of a financial 
instrument. The 12 month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL 
which results from default events that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date.
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that 
are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all 
the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all cash 
shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. When estimating the 
cash flows, an entity is required to consider:
	
All contractual terms of the financial instrument (including 
prepayment, extension, call and similar options) over the 
expected life of the financial instrument. However, in rare 
cases when the expected life of the financial instrument 
cannot be estimated reliably, then the entity is required 
to use the remaining contractual term of the financial 
instrument
	
Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit 
enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms
As a practical expedient, the Group uses a provision matrix to 
determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade 
receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically 
observed default rates over the expected life of the trade 
receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. 
At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates are updated. 
For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the 
Group combines financial instruments on the basis of shared 
credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an 
analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in 
credit risk to be identified on a timely basis.
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised 
during the period is recognised as income / expense in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. This amount is 
reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
The Balance Sheet presentation for various financial 
instruments is described below:
reference to market yields on Government bonds at the end of 
the reporting period.
All defined benefit plans obligations are determined based 
on valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, made by 
independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
The classification of the Group’s net obligation into current and 
non-current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is 
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past 
service (‘past service cost’ or ‘past service gain’) or the gain or 
loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a 
defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
2.16.3 Termination benefits
Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement 
benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates:
	
When the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those 
benefits; or
	
When the Group recognises costs for a restructuring that 
is within the scope of Ind AS 37: Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets and involves the 
payment of termination benefits.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the 
reporting period are discounted to their present value.
2.17 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
2.17.1 Financial assets
Financial assets are recognized when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
2.17.1.1 Initial recognition and measurement
On initial recognition, a financial asset is recognised at fair 
value. In case of financial assets which are recognised at 
fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) except for trade 
receivables without financing component which are measured 
at transaction price, its transaction cost is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. In other cases, the 
transaction cost is attributed to the acquisition value of the 
financial asset.
2.17.1.2 Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets 
are classified in two categories:
2.17.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.17.1.2.2 Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI
2.17.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
A debt instrument is measured at the amortised cost if both 
the following conditions are met:
	
The asset is held within a business model whose objective 
is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and
	
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates 
to cash flows that are Solely Payments of Principal and 
Interest (‘SPPI’) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included 
in finance income in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss. This category 
generally applies to trade and other receivables, loans and 
other financial assets.
2.17.1.2.2 Equity instruments
All investments in equity instruments within the scope of Ind 
AS 109 are initially measured at fair value. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading are classified as FVTPL. For all 
other equity instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable 
election to present in the OCI subsequent changes in the fair 
value. The Group makes such election on an instrument-by-
instrument basis. The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable.
In case of equity instrument classified as FVTOCI, all fair 
value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are 
recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts 
from OCI to the consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
even on derecognition of investment. However, the Group may 
transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are 
measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.17.1.3 Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised when:

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in 
their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the asset 
in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in 
the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:
•	
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•	
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
•	
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and 
the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
2.17.5 Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities can be offset and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is 
a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.18	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the Balance Sheet comprises cash 
at banks and on hand. For the purpose of cash flow statement, 
Cash & Cash equivalent consists of cash & short term deposits 
as defined above. The Cash flow statement is prepared using 
indirect method.
2.19 Dividend distribution to equity shareholders
The Group recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity 
shareholders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. 
As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised 
when it is approved by the shareholders.
2.20 Foreign currencies
The Group’s financial statements are presented in C, which is 
also the Group’s functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the 
Group at C spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies 
for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date 
when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the 
change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences 
on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or 
profit and loss are also recognised in OCI or the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss, respectively).
2.21 Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the 
year attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit 
attributable to equity holders of the Group after adjusting 
impact of dilution shares by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted 
	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost and 
contractual revenue receivables: ECL is presented as an 
allowance, i.e. as an integral part of the measurement of 
those assets in the Balance Sheet. The allowance reduces 
the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Group does not reduce impairment allowance 
from the gross carrying amount.
	
The Group does not have any purchased or originated 
credit-impaired financial assets, i.e., financial assets 
which are credit impaired on purchase / origination.
2.17.2 Financial liabilities
2.17.2.1 Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and in the case of borrowings net of directly attributable 
transaction costs.
2.17.2.2 Subsequent measurement
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification, as described below:
2.17.2.2.1 Financial liabilities at amortised cost
This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial 
recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through 
the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated 
by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance costs in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
2.17.2.3 Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under 
the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference 
in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.17.3 
Derivative 
financial 
instruments 
and 
hedge 
accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as 
forward currency contracts, to manage its foreign currency 
risks. These derivative instruments are designated as cash 
flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into 
for period consistent with currency. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities 
when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.17.3.1 Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, 
while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its 
exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and 
firm commitments. The ineffective portion relating to foreign 
currency contracts is recognised in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss.
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss when the hedged transaction 
affects profit and loss, i.e. when the hedged financial income or 
financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. 
When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI are 
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial 
asset or liability.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised without replacement or rollover (as part of the 
hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction 
occurs or the foreign currency firm commitment is met.
2.17.4 Fair value measurement
The Group measures derivatives instruments like forward 
contracts at fair value at each Balance Sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
•	
In the principal market for the asset or liability or
•	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group.

2.22 Segment Reporting
The Executive Management Committee evaluates the Group’s 
performance and allocates the resources based on an analysis 
of various performance indicators by business segments.
The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with 
the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting 
the financial statements of the Group as a whole.
2.23 Contingent liabilities and assets
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non—occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the Group or 
a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely 
rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not 
recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the consolidated financial statements.
2.24 Significant accounting judgments, estimates and 
assumptions
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates 
could result in outcomes that require an adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
Difference between actual results and estimates are recognised 
in the periods in which the results are known / materialised.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are described below. The Group has based 
its assumptions and estimates on parameters available 
when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. 
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market changes 
or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the 
Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when 
they occur.
Information about critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies, as well as estimates and assumptions that have the 
most significant effect to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year, are included in the 
following notes:
(a)	 Measurement of defined benefit obligations – Note 41
(b)	 Measurement and likelihood of occurrence of provisions 
and contingencies – Note 22
(c)	
Recognition of current tax and deferred tax 
assets – Note 23
(d)	 Key assumptions used in fair valuations – Note 46

Significant Judgements in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options: 
	
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an 
option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the 
lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
	
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in 
evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it 
considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the 
commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that 
is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.
	
The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of buildings and other with shorter non-cancellable 
period. The Group typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be a significant negative effect 
on the operations if a replacement asset is not readily available. The renewal periods for leases of building and others 
with longer non-cancellable periods are not included as part of the lease term as these are not reasonably certain to be 
exercised. Furthermore, the periods covered by termination options are included as part of the lease term only when they 
are reasonably certain not to be exercised.
d)	
The Group has lease contracts for plant & machinery that contains variable payments amounting to C 19,435 lakhs (C 18,215 
lakhs in March 31, 2024) shown under other expenses.
e)	
The Group has recognised C 1,100 lakhs as miscellaneous expenses during the year ( C 1,110 lakhs in March 31, 2024) 
which pertains to short term lease/ low value asset which was not recognised as part of ROU.

a) 	 Defined contribution plan
	
Refer note 32 for Group’s contribution to the defined contribution plans with respect to provident fund and other funds.
b) 	 Defined benefit plan – Gratuity
	
Description of plan
	
The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan which is funded with an Insurance Company in the form of a qualifying 
Insurance policy. The Group’s defined benefit gratuity plan is a salary plan for employees which requires contributions to 
be made to a separate administrative fund. The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the 
act, every employee who has completed five years of service gets a gratuity on separation at 15 days of last drawn salary 
for each completed year of service.
	
Governance
	
The fund has the form of a trust, and it is governed by the Board of Trustees, which consists of employer and employee 
representatives. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the 
investment strategy. Each year, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding.
	
Investment Strategy
	
The Board of trustees have appointed LIC of India, Birla Sun Life Insurance, India First Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life 
Insurance & HDFC Life Insurance to manage its funds. The Board of Trustees aim to keep annual contributions relatively stable 
at a level such that no plan deficits (based on valuation performed) will arise. Every year, the insurance Company carries out 
a funding valuation based on the latest employee data provided by the Group. Any deficit in the assets arising as a result of 
such valuation is funded by the Group. In case of death, while in service, the gratuity is payable irrespective of vesting.

c. 	 Others
	
The Group has availed the Sales Tax Deferral Loan and Octroi refund from the Directorate of Industries for Nashik Plant. 
Hence, the Group has to take prior permission of the appropriate authority for removal/transfer of any asset (falling under the 
above Schemes) from Nashik Plant. In case of violation of terms & conditions, the Group is required to refund the entire loan/
benefit along with the interest @ 22.50% on account of Sales Tax deferral Loan and @ 15% on account of Octroi refund.
d. 	 Material demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Group
	
The Group has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central Excise 
Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and 
tied up through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central 
Excise Act, read with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty 
amounting to C 27,672 lakhs. i.e., the difference between the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value and 
duty payable on the basis of MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April 2011 to June 2017. The Group believes that Set 
of TT / TTF (Tyre and Tube / Tyre, Tube and Flap) is not a pre-packaged commodity in terms of provisions of Legal Metrology 
	
	
These plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Demographic Risk 
and Salary Risk.
Risk
Exposure
Interest
The plan exposes the Group to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates 
will result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will 
thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial statements).
Investment
 The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on 
any particular investment.
Demographic
The Group has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the 
liability. The Group is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse 
compared to the assumption.
Salary Escalation 
The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of 
salary increase rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase 
of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used to 
determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.
Asset Liability Mismatching 
or Market Risk
The duration of the liability is longer compared to duration of assets, exposing the 
Company to market risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.
Regulatory Risk
Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity 
Act, 1972 (as amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations 
requiring higher gratuity payouts (e.g. Increase in the maximum limit on gratuity of C 
20,00,000).
	
x)	
Weighted average duration and expected employers contribution for the next year for the defined benefit plan
	
	
The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash flows) of defined benefit obligation is 8-11 years.

* The trade payables / short term borrowings are naturally hedged (off-set) to the extent of exposure under trade receivables / advances for 
respective currencies.
The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable forecast transactions. 
As a result, no hedge ineffectiveness arises requiring recognition through statement of profit and loss.
The cash flow hedges as at March 31, 2025 were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of C 2,810 lakhs, with 
a deferred tax asset of C 707 lakhs relating to the hedging instruments, is included in OCI. Comparatively, the cash flow hedges 
as at March 31, 2024 were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of C268 lakhs, with a deferred tax asset of 
C 67 lakhs relating to the hedging instruments, was included in OCI.
Note 46: Fair values
The management considers that the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities which are recognised at amortised 
cost are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Note 47: Fair value hierarchy
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note 46 above have been classified into three categories depending on 
the inputs used in the valuation technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows:
• 	
Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market;
• 	
Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
• 	
Level 3: Inputs which are not based on observable market data.
The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2025 and

Note 48: Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. 
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include 
trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group also enters into 
derivative transactions.
The Group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, 
measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for risk management 
purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. The Board of 
Directors through its Risk management committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are 
Summarized below.
a) 	 Market risk
	
The Group’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial 
instruments:
	
• 	
Interest rate risk;
	
• 	
Foreign currency risk;
	
• 	
Equity price risk; and
	
• 	
Commodity risk
	
The above risks may affect the Group’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The Group’s exposure 
to and management of these risks are explained below.
	
The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is 
based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 including the effect of 
hedge accounting.
	
i. 	
Interest rate risk	
Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value 
or future cash flows of 
a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because 
of changes in market 
interest rates.
Relates 
primarily to 
the Group’s 
long-
term debt 
obligations 
with floating 
interest rates.
The Group manages its interest rate risk pertaining to domestic borrowings 
by maintaining a balanced portfolio of borrowings linked to various tenor 
benchmark of MCLR, Repo rate and T-Bills. The Group enters into interest 
rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the 
difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by 
reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. 
As at March 31, 2025, after taking into account the effect of interest rate 
swaps, approximately 45% of the Group’s total borrowings are at a fixed 
rate of interest (March 31, 2024: 34%).

Calculation of Fair Values
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions 
used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used for the year ended March 31, 2025.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at Balance Sheet date:
Derivative financial instruments: The fair values of the derivative financial instruments have been determined using valuation 
techniques with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, 
foreign exchange forward rates, etc.
Investment: The fair value is calculated using the Discounted Cashflow method where the significant unobservable input used 
is discount rate - 18.64%.

Note 48: Financial risk management objectives and policies (Contd..)
	
	
The movement in the pre-tax effect is a result of a change in the fair value of the financial asset/liability due to 
the exchange rate movement. The derivatives which have not been designated in a hedge relationship act as an 
economic hedge and will offset the underlying transactions when they occur. The same derivatives are not covered in 
the above table.
	
	
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because 
the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
	
iii. 	 Equity price risk
	
	
There is no material equity risk relating to the Group’s equity investments which are detailed in note 6. The group equity 
investments majorly comprise of strategic investments rather than trading purposes.
	
iv. 	 Commodity price risk

Commodity price sensitivity
	
	
The following table approximately details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% movement in the input price of rubber and 
carbon black. The sensitivity analysis includes only 5% change in commodity prices for quantity sold or consumed 
during the year, with all other variables held constant. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity 
where the commodity prices decrease by 5%. For a 5% increase in commodity prices, there would be a comparable 
impact on profit or equity, and the balances below would be negative.

Trade receivables
	
Risk:
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading 
to a financial loss.
	
Risk Management:
	
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management.
	
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 27 days to 60 days credit term. Credit limits are established 
for all customers based on internal rating criteria. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. An impairment 
analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of minor 
receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Group has no concentration 
of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.

Foreign currency risk	
Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value 
or future cash flows 
of an exposure will 
fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign 
exchange rates. 
Relates 
primarily to 
the Group’s 
operating 
activities 
(when revenue 
or expense is 
denominated 
in a foreign 
currency) 
For the committed transactions, The Group manages its foreign currency 
risk by hedging transactions till the actual date of inflow & outflow. When 
a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Group 
negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the 
hedged exposure. For hedges of forecast transactions, the derivatives 
cover the period of exposure from the point the cash flows of the 
transactions are forecasted up to the point of settlement of the resulting 
receivable or payable that is denominated in the foreign currency.
As at March 31, 2025, the Group has hedged 82% (March 31, 2024: 88%) 
of its foreign currency receivables / payables. 
	
	
Foreign currency sensitivity
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EURO rates, with all other 
variables held constant. The impact on the Group’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary 
assets and liabilities. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

Note 49: Capital management
For the purpose of the Group capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity 
reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximise

of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by 
total capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, 
less cash and cash equivalents.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets 
financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in 
meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches 
in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended March 31, 2025 
and March 31, 2024.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
VALUE CREATION
STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTICE
Mr. Harsh Goenka, has been a key enabler and even a differentiator for the Company. His extensive reach and network built 
during his time as past-CEO of CEAT, past-President of IMC (Indian Merchant Chambers), India’s premier business body, and as a 
revered industry leader of India Inc., have lent a crucial edge to CEAT. Mr. Goenka, as Chairman of the $5.2 Billion RPG Enterprises 
is instrumental in opening doors to several opportunities for CEAT. His significant contributions over the years to CEAT cannot 
be overlooked and continue to remain a key success factor for the Company given the extremely intense competition among 
Indian tyre companies.
Mr. Goenka has also been actively involved with:
•	
Meeting key customers of the Company and initiatives towards customers and business development.
•	
Strategic initiatives, long-term vision of the Company and growth actions including M&A.
•	
Reviewing capex decisions and ensuring balanced growth with prudence in capital structuring.
•	
Building and coaching the leadership team, motivating the team towards outperformance.
•	
Fostering a culture of Happiness that is unique to RPG Group. This goes a long way in talent retention and laying the 
foundation for a performance driven organisation.
During the year, the Company also benefitted from the multi-generational M&A (mergers and acquisitions) experience and 
acumen of Mr. Goenka. The Company signed definitive agreements for acquiring the CAMSO brand and segments of off-highway 
business of Michelin (a global leader in tyres) – which is expected to create significant growth vectors for the Company. This an 
unprecedented transaction for the Indian tyre industry. In the coming years, the Company will look to draw on the strengths and 
experience of Mr. Goenka to integrate the acquired business successfully and harness full potential.
At the operational level, Mr. Goenka invests considerable time reviewing the operations and performance of the Company and 
his interactions with the senior leaders and his role in building a talent pool in the Company has been significant in maximizing 
stakeholder value. Over the years, he has been a vital contributor in the stable success of the Company, despite a challenging 
macro-environment, geo-political issues, competitive dynamics with multiple disruptions and headwinds that have been 
witnessed in the post-pandemic era.
In light of the contributions even as a non-executive Chairman of the Company with profound impact on the performance of the 
Company which had led to industry leading performance metrics besides creating value for all the stakeholders, the director’s 
commission paid to Mr. Goenka of Rs. 3.0 Crores for FY25 is commensurate given the responsibility and time commitments 
as described above. Also, the time spent by Mr. Goenka is significantly higher vis-à-vis other non-executive directors, which is 
a factor in proposing the commission.
Both Mr. Harsh Goenka and Mr. Anant Goenka bring different skills and expertise to the Company as Directors and are involved 
accordingly. Their contributions are highly complementary in nature. As notable industry leaders, the experience of these two 
industry leaders and their contributions, one a respected and recognized senior leader of India’s industrial arena and the other, a 
young dynamic and future captain of the country’s corporate landscape, augur well for CEAT. This also reflects in the remuneration 
that the NRC finds reasonable for the said directors.
Considering the above factors, the Board, based on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) 
has paid commission to Mr. Goenka to the tune of about 0.43% of Profit After Tax (PAT) as per section 198 of the Companies Act, 
2013, which is well within the limits already approved by the shareholders. The commission paid is also well within the limits as 
per Regulation 17 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘SEBI LODR’).

#Additional Information
As the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Harsh Goenka has steered the sustained and steady growth of CEAT over the past several 
years. His vision and thought leadership has helped the Company achieve high standards of corporate governance, innovation, 
brand visibility, and overall growth. The following points merit specific mention:
During FY25, the company achieved a strong consolidated revenue growth of 10.7% year-over-year, with revenues reaching INR 
13,218 Crores. EBITDA stood at INR 1,496 Crores, while Profit After Tax (PAT) was INR 471 Crores. The EBITDA and PAT margin 
was at 11.3% and 3.6% respectively, showcasing sustained performance. Over the same period, the Debt to Equity and Debt to 
EBITDA ratios remained at comfortable levels of 0.44 and 1.29 respectively. CEAT continued to deliver healthy double-digit ROCE. 
Consequent to the consistent performance over the last 5 years, we have seen the market capitalisation increase by over 300% 
to around Rs. 14,000 crore, resulting in significant value creation for all stakeholders.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
The Company has integrated comprehensive biodiversity protection measures across its operations, focusing on safeguarding 
crucial ecosystems and promoting sustainable practices. This involves conducting Environmental Impact Assessments to 
monitor local biodiversity, managing risks associated with proximity to Key Biodiversity Areas and adhering to global conservation 
standards.
The Company employs WWF filters, using satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies, to assess tree cover loss and 
identify areas with significant canopy reduction. This approach enables targeted conservation and reforestation efforts, mitigating 
environmental damage and fostering sustainable land-use practices.
The Company acknowledges protected and conserved areas as crucial for biodiversity conservation and sustainable ecosystems. 
By utilising WWF filters like the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) from UNEP-WCMC and assesses its operations' 
proximity to these zones, ensuring effective risk management and compliance with international biodiversity standards.
Proximity to Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) poses a reputational risk, as these critical habitats are essential for global biodiversity. 
The Company uses the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), to monitor its operations' impact on these sites. 
Additionally, it recognizes important ecosystems outside legally protected zones and KBAs. These areas contribute significantly 
to biodiversity by maintaining ecological balance, providing habitat corridors and supporting local biodiversity, even if not officially 
designated as protected.
The RPG Group pledges to plant one million trees by 2030, supporting the 1t.org global reforestation agenda and the UN Decade 
on Ecosystem Restoration. In FY 2023-24, the group planted 100,000 saplings in Nagpur and Chhattisgarh, with Company 
contributing 25,000 trees. The Company aims to plant over 60,500 trees so as to reclaim degraded land, create habitats for 
endangered species and uplift rural communities by providing sustainable livelihoods. It would generate 2,000 workdays and 
the growing trees are expected to absorb 500,000 kilograms of CO2 annually.
The Company is ready for compliance with the EUDR by ensuring that all sourced rubber tyres are deforestation-free and 
produced in line with applicable legal requirements. Partnering with TRST01, it ensures sustainable and traceable supply chains, 
leveraging the Footprint® tool for AI-enabled ESG reporting. This initiative is supported by the Rubber Board and the Automotive 
Tyre Manufacturers' Association, aligning with global anti-deforestation efforts.
