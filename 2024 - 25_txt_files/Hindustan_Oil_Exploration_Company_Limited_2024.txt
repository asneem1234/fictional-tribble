segregated containers based on its classification. HOEC places strong emphasis on the 'Reduce,
Reuse, Recycle' policy across its operations. In compliance with regulatory requirements, an Annual
2 Return detailing waste generation is submitted to the relevant State Pollution Control Board by
June 30 each year for the reporting period of April to March. An annual Environmental Statement
is also submitted. Employees receive regular training on waste management practices, labelling
standards, and the importance of the 3R policy. An emergency response plan is in place to address
hazardous waste incidents, including measures for spill containment and cleanup.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
Public hearings are a crucial component of the environmental clearance process. They provide a
platform for stakeholders to engage directly regarding their concerns about proposed projects.
This interactive process allows individuals to express their objections, offer suggestions, and
influence the decision-making process related to the project.
Stakeholder Engagement: Public hearings enable the community to voice their opinions and concerns,
ensuring that their perspectives are considered in the decision-making process. This engagement
can lead to more informed and balanced project outcomes.
Project Proponent's Advantages: For project proponents, public hearings serve as an opportunity
to communicate the results of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to the community.
They allow for the verification of EIA findings against real-world conditions and confirm that
stakeholders have been adequately consulted and involved in the process.
