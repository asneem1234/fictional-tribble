(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with 
a comprehensive view of a company's non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and 
accountability.)

Safety and

 Risk
Prioritising consumer health and 
safety is crucial for fostering trust 
and upholding transparency. 
Failure to comply with regulations 
related to product information, 
labelling, and marketing can 
result in significant negative 
consequences. Moreover, 
emphasising health and safety 
practices helps mitigate potential 
risks and safeguards consumers 
from harm, thereby strengthening 
their trust in the brand.
1.	
 We have an active CRM 
team in place to monitor 
consumer feedback and 
ensure timely responses.
2.	 We proactively conduct 
consumer satisfaction 
surveys to gather valuable 
insights and feedback.
3.	 We carry out clinical trials 
on our products prior to 
their launch to ensure they 
meet safety standards.
4.	 We implement strict 
quality control protocols, 
including batch-level 
quality checks and routine 
inspections conducted 
through accredited third-
party laboratories.

transparency, and accountability, 
thereby strengthening stakeholder 
trust. Proactively identifying and

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Valued Stakeholders, 
I am delighted to connect with you and share some remarkable achievements and initiatives undertaken by Honasa 
over the past year. This year marks our second year of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR). We 
have collected and reported data from our locations across the country, ensuring transparency and accountability. 
Our dedication to sustainability has been recognised through various certifications and awards, including Made Safe 
certification, Cruelty-Free certification by PETA.
Through our partnership with the SankalpTaru Foundation, we implemented the We Plant Goodness Initiative under the 
Mamaearth brand. This initiative promoted afforestation and enhanced farmer livelihoods, reflecting our commitment 
to fostering sustainable coexistence with nature. As part of the initiative, we have planted 9L+ trees.
In terms of plastic recycling, we recycled 11,500+ tones of plastic waste since FY 2020-21, proudly recycling more plastic 
than we use. 
Our collaboration with Bhumi NGO brought the Young Scientists Program to life under The Derma Co. brand. The programme 
has so far instilled a scientific understanding of climate change among 30,000+ school children, empowering them 
to become ambassadors for environmental sustainability. The Water for All initiative, executed by Sehgal Foundations 
under the Aqualogica brand provided clean water access to remote rural areas, benefiting over 900+ families so far 
and significantly improving their quality of life. In partnership with the Sambhav Foundation, we are running the BBlunt 
Shine Academy initiative. This programme has so far empowered over 15,000+ women through vocational training in 
hairstyling, promoting skill development and financial independence. Our hiring policy emphasises on equal opportunity 
to candidates with a focus on diversity, Women constitute more than 45%+ of our current workforce which includes our 
off-roll employees as well. We are equally committed to our team’s welfare, with over 72.37% of our staff receiving skill 
development training and more than 81.47% undergoing performance reviews. We have also drafted a robust BRSR policy 
and established a strong governance system to guide our efforts. Our journey is a testament to the collective effort of 
our team, partners, and stakeholders. We remain committed to making positive changes, fostering sustainability, and 
making a tangible impact on the communities we serve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in our Company. 
Together, we will continue to build a better, more sustainable future.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders.
(This principle highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement. Companies should consider the interests and 
perspectives of all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which 
they operate. They should also be responsive to stakeholder concerns and feedback.)
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The process of identifying key stakeholders involves recognising and evaluating individuals, groups, or organisations 
that are crucial to the company’s operations. Seven key stakeholder groups have been identified, chosen for their 
importance to the business’s success and long-term viability. The company ensures consistent and meaningful 
interaction with these stakeholders to address their concerns, resolve complaints, and gather input. Their feedback is 
carefully incorpo-rated into the company’s decision-making process. The identification of stakeholders is driven by the 
principle of mutual influence, considering both the impact they have on the company and the impact the company 
has on them.
