Health and 
Safety 
R 
Given the complex nature of 
chemical manufacturing, 
safeguarding the well-being of 
employees and nearby 
communities is crucial. 
Focusing on this material topic 
helps ensure safe and resilient 
working conditions, protects 
our stakeholders, and maintains 
compliance with relevant 
health and safety regulations. 
At GSFC, we are dedicated to 
upholding rigorous quality and 
safety standards throughout the 
entire product lifecycle—from 
manufacturing and storage to 
end-use and disposal. Our 
commitment to comprehensive 
product stewardship aims to 
proactively mitigate 
environmental and safety risks 
associated with our products. 
The Company places top 
priority on ensuring the 
Health and Safety of its 
workforce. The Safety 
department drives a strong 
safety culture through: 
 
i. Conducting plant safety 
inspections, safety audits, 
and addressing unsafe 
actions or conditions. 
 
ii. Regular 'Toolbox talks' 
focused on safety norms 
and Learning from 
Incidents (LFI), along with 
periodic training and 
awareness sessions.  
 
iii. Providing appropriate 
personal protective 
equipment (PPE) to 
employees.

maintaining high standards 
of workplace health and

Operational 
Efficiency 
R 
Operational efficiency is a 
critical focus for our industry 
due to the significantly high 
energy and resource intensity 
of manufacturing. Also, several 
of our facilities are legacy units 
that require careful 
maintenance and optimized 
operations to ensure 
operational soundness and 
safety. Enhancing efficiency 
directly influences cost control, 
uninterrupted and compliant 
operations, and significantly 
reduces our environmental 
footprint. It also plays a key 
role in managing our impact on 
external stakeholders, 
including regulatory bodies, 
local communities, and the 
broader ecosystem. 
 
The Company mitigates 
these risks by: 
 
• Periodically revamping 
and refurbishing plants to 
maintain operational 
efficiency. 
 
• Following a scheduled 
maintenance plan to prevent 
unexpected breakdowns. 
 
• Upgrading infrastructure 
with the latest equipment to 
implement modern 
manufacturing technology. 
 
• Conducting regular safety 
audits and inspections to 
identify and rectify 
potential hazards. 
 
• Carrying out periodic risk 
assessments, with senior 
management reviewing and 
ensuring the 
implementation of 
necessary mitigation 
measures.

waste management as a key 
material topic. 
 
A key aspect of our 
sustainability efforts 
involves converting a 
significant portion of our 
chemical byproducts into 
valuable fuel sources. This 
not only minimizes waste 
generation but also 
enhances resource 
efficiency and reduces 
operational costs. 
We also invest in research 
and development to 
improve the sustainability 
and performance of our 
products. Also, we are 
certified under ISO 14001 
and Responsible Care, 
reinforcing our adherence to 
global standards in 
environmental 
management.

Governance, leadership and oversight 
7. Statement by director 
responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement 
of this disclosure)  
Dear Stakeholders, 
At Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited (GSFC), our growth 
strategy is firmly anchored in environmental stewardship, social 
responsibility, and robust governance. Guided by our vision of 
harmonizing operations with the environment, we are embedding 
sustainable practices across our value chain, ensuring cleaner energy 
solutions and operational transparency at every step. As a Government 
of Gujarat promoted enterprise, we are deeply accountable to statutory 
compliance, public interest, and responsible business conduct. 
Aligned with India’s energy transition goals, we have steadily scaled 
up our renewable energy capacity. In FY 2024-25, nearly 40% of our 
electricity consumption was met through captive wind and solar 
power. Our current installed capacity stands at 152.8 MW of wind 
energy and 65.13 MW of solar power, following the successful 
commissioning of a 37.5 MW solar project during the reporting 
period. This milestone advances our ambition to meet 50% of our total 
electricity needs through renewable sources, significantly reducing 
our reliance on conventional power and lowering greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Our commitment to circularity is reflected in our efforts to reduce 
reliance on conventional carbon-rich fossil fuels and replace them with 
alternative fuels while simultaneously enhancing our renewable energy 
portfolio. These collective efforts have led to a 10% reduction in fossil 
fuel consumption and an 8.82% decrease in Scope 1 GHG emissions
compared to the previous year. This initiative not only optimizes energy 
efficiency but also reduces process residues that would otherwise 
require additional post-treatment handling. Furthermore, we maintain 
air and noise pollution levels well within prescribed regulatory limits 
across all operations. 
Water conservation remains a priority, with systems in place to treat 
and reuse wastewater, particularly for horticulture and landscaping 
within our facilities. On the waste management front, we have achieved 
a 17% reduction in total waste generation compared to FY 2023-24, 
by strengthening recycling and material recovery processes. Our 
hazardous waste is managed through a rigorous process of on-site 
segregation, secure storage, authorized transportation, and compliant 
disposal, adhering strictly to statutory regulations and industry best 
practices. In FY 24-25, even though our production has increased, our 
hazardous waste generation has decreased by 26% compared to the 
previous year. Additionally, our solid waste management system 
effectively handles kitchen waste, horticultural residues, housekeeping 
 
18 
 
waste, and construction debris across our sites, ensuring efficient 
collection and channelization to authorized recyclers. 
On the social front, we are dedicated to fostering a culture of 
continuous learning and safe working conditions. Training coverage 
increased from 70% in FY 2023-24 to 84.23%, with 95.6% of our 
employees receiving dedicated training on human rights. We 
continue to ensure 100% coverage in assessments related to health, 
safety, working conditions, and human rights. GSFC is proud to 
have been honoured with the World Safety Organization (WSO) 
India (State) Award for OHS&E Excellence in the Manufacturing 
Sector – “Fertilizers & Chemicals” category, a distinction achieved for 
the third consecutive year. This recognition underscores our systematic 
approach to workplace safety and commitment to operational 
discipline. Furthermore, our CSR initiatives are strategically focused 
on vulnerable and marginalized communities, with 72% of 
beneficiaries under our education programs belonging to these 
groups. 
From a governance perspective, GSFC operates under a structured ESG 
framework, overseen by the Board and aligned with BRSR disclosure 
requirements. Our management systems are certified under ISO 9001, 
ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 50001, and the Responsible Care 
initiative, ensuring consistency in our quality, environmental, energy, 
and safety management practices. We are proud to report zero 
incidents of cybersecurity breaches, product recalls, or regulatory 
non-compliance during the year. 
Our sustainability commitment extends beyond business operations to 
encompass community development. We continue to invest in 
education, sanitation, and rural development initiatives around our 
manufacturing sites, contributing directly to local well-being and long-
term regional growth. 
Across all these dimensions, we are taking deliberate and measurable 
actions to embed sustainability deeper into our core functions. With a 
strong focus on decarbonization, occupational health and safety, 
resource efficiency, local sourcing, and stakeholder engagement, we 
are creating sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
We recognize the critical role our operations play in the environmental 
and social fabric of our communities. With this responsibility in mind, 
we remain steadfast in our journey towards inclusive, transparent, and 
environmentally responsible growth. By embedding sustainability into 
everyday decision-making, we aim to ensure long-term operational 
resilience and contribute meaningfully to a sustainable future. 
Thank you.

In-house 
utilization of 
waste 
Ground sulphur muck has been reused either as a filler in ASP 
or by mixing it with phosphogypsum. This process enhances 
the nutrient content by adding elemental sulphur. 
Additionally, waste Nylon-6 is converted into recycled chips 
through external vendors and reused in the production 
process to ensure maximum material recovery.
