1
Climate and 
Energy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk - Climate change poses multiple 
physical risks like flooding, temperature 
rise, water stress etc. Emerging and 
potential regulations may introduce or 
escalate regulatory risks. These extreme 
weather events can cause infrastructure 
damage, may hinder the supply chain 
network affecting timely delivery of raw 
materials and finished products. It may 
also cause power outages and affect the 
manufacturing processes.
Opportunity - Energy cost is a major 
cost in cement manufacturing. We 
continuously strive to reduce our specific 
thermal energy consumption and 
specific electrical energy consumption 
to optimize our energy costs. In addition, 
it is directly related to carbon emissions 
and by optimising energy consumption, 
we can lower our carbon emissions.
The Company has 
approximately 35% of 
products in its portfolio 
which are blended 
products with lower 
carbon footprint. 
Further, we are investing 
more and more in 
renewal energy and 
green energy from 
WHRS. In addition, we 
have set ambitious 
targets for Thermal 
Substitution Rates (TSR) 
by using alternate fuels.

(Indicate

2
Air quality
Risk
Exposure to dust, SOx, NOx and other 
pollutants from cement plants can lead 
to respiratory issues among employees 
and nearby communities. This may lead 
to increased costs associated with 
healthcare for affected employees, and 
insurance premiums. The company may 
also face opposition, protests and even 
legal restrictions on its operations.
We focus on improving 
air quality in the plant 
& surrounding area. We 
monitor the plants’ stack 
emissions through the 
Continuous Emission 
Monitoring System. We 
work on upgradation 
of electrostatic 
precipitators and 
replacement of damaged 
bags to control dust 
emissions. We take 
primary and secondary 
measures to control NOx 
emissions.
Negative
3
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
Circular economy offers great 
opportunity to lower the use of  
natural resources and fossil fuels in 
cement production and reduces  
carbon emissions.
_
Positive
4
Water 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk - Water being a shared resource, 
it is essential for business to use it in a 
responsible way. These risks comprise 
conflicts with local communities and 
stakeholders over water rights and 
usage, potential water scarcity or 
quality issues due to over-extraction or 
pollution, and regulatory constraints on 
water abstraction permits or discharge 
standards. 
Opportunity - By demonstrating 
commitment to conserving water 
resources, we can build stronger 
relationships with local communities 
and government. This will help us in 
securing and maintaining social license 
to operate, especially in water-stressed 
regions. 
The company has 
long been dedicated 
to mitigating water 
scarcity through various 
initiatives, including 
rainwater harvesting, 
restoring village ponds, 
constructing check 
dams, conserving 
water at closed 
mines, and recharging 
groundwater. The 
company withdraws 
only harvested water 
for its usage and uses 
desalinated water solely 
for cooling purposes. 
Water used in the plant 
for industrial cooling 
is recycled through 
cooling towers to 
ensure effective reuse.

Biodiversity
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Land disturbance and habitat 
fragmentation from operational 
activities can lead to biodiversity 
degradation. 
Opportunity- Restored ecosystems 
can provide long-term environmental 
benefits, including enhanced 
ecosystem services such as water 
filtration, carbon sequestration, and 
soil preservation. These benefits 
not only contribute to global 
environmental goals but also can have 
positive economic implications for the 
company and local communities in the 
long run.
We adhere to Indian 
national regulations 
and assess the impacts 
on biodiversity and 
ecosystem services 
through set KPIs. This 
helps in conservation of 
ecosystem.
Negative/
Positive
6
Sustainable 
Construction
Opportunity
Intervention of sustainable practices 
and technologies such as substitute 
cementitious materials, CO2 capture 
in the built environment, and efficient 
concrete use help drive down carbon 
emissions from cement production 
and hence help to reduce the carbon 
footprint.
_
Positive
7
Human 
Capital 
Development
Opportunity
Through continuous learning and 
development and strengthened 
employee relations, we can mitigate 
succession planning risks, address 
skills gaps and ensure continuity 
of leadership and expertise. It will 
also help in being competitive in the 
marketplace and stay ahead of trends. 
Human Capital development will also 
contribute to an overall learning culture 
in the organisation.

Positive
8
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Employee diversity leads to increased 
creativity and innovation, improved 
communication and teamwork, and a 
greater understanding and appreciation 
of different cultures. Additionally, a 
diverse workforce can help to attract 
and retain top talent and can provide a 
competitive advantage for organisations.

Human  
Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk - Concerns related to child/forced 
labour, discrimination or any other 
human rights-related aspects within the 
workforce and value chain may lead to 
statutory violations which may negatively 
impact the brand image. 
Opportunity - Alignment with the human 
rights principles and procedures safeguard 
the employees and value chain partners 
and ensure zero incidents of non-
compliance with regards to International 
and National Human Rights Standards 
and Regulations.
We are committed to 
respecting and promoting 
human rights across the 
value chain by inculcating 
a human rights policy. 
The policy is in line with 
The Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, Social 
Accountability 8000 
(SA8000) Standard and 
International Treaties & 
Conventions related to 
Human Rights. 
Negative/
Positive
10
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk - Failure to protect workers from 
occupational hazards can result in legal 
action, fines, and compensation claims 
against the company. These risks can 
lead to significant financial liabilities 
and damage the company's reputation. 
Also, potential employees may hesitate 
from joining the company, and 
current employees may leave if they 
perceive their health and safety are 
not adequately protected, leading to 
challenges in attracting and retaining a 
skilled workforce.
Opportunity - By prioritising the well-
being of all employees and workers, 
the company can enhance its employer 
brand, making it a more attractive 
place to work. Employees are more 
likely to join and stay with a company 
that prioritises their well-being, leading 
to lower turnover rates and higher 
employee satisfaction.
We have developed 
safety initiatives 
including competency 
development, training, 
audits, inspections, 
surveys, WeCare 
initiatives, Critical 
Control Management 
to prevent unwanted 
events, and especial 
cross-functional teams 
to drive process safety. 
Also, we conduct safety 
audits across our 
manufacturing sites to 
ensure that the actions 
are timely closed and 
implemented
Negative/
Positive
11
Community 
Relations
Opportunity
Uplifting livelihood opportunities 
improves community relations which is 
essential for the social license to operate. 
Also, a healthy community will ensure 
availability of strong local labour force, if 
required at any given point of time.

Customer

 Opportunity
CRM empowers to build a positive 
customer experience based on relevant, 
real-time information and customer needs 
that matters to the business. It would

improved customer experience and hence 
drive growth in business by increasing

to stay one step ahead and ensure 
business continuity and regulatory 
resilience.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk - Improper usage of resources, 
human rights violations, non-compliance 
with Supplier Code of Conduct, zero 
adoption of sustainable practices by 
suppliers can adversely impact the 
environment, social well-being, value 
chain and brand image. Additionally, it 
might also lead to cases of regulatory 
non-compliances and fines.
Opportunity - The company can 
leverage suppliers near operations 
to reduce costs, for greater control, 
quicker response and helps in cutting 
down significant emissions related to 
transportation.
Supply chain and 
sourcing process has 
a direct impact on 
the environment and 
communities such as 
emissions, circular 
economy, water usage, 
biodiversity, material 
usage and human 
rights. We have taken 
measures to ensure 
an optimum supply 
chain with competent 
suppliers. 
Negative/
Positive
16
Information 
technology 
and data 
privacy
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk - Instances of information security 
breaches could lead to loss of sensitive 
data of customers including personal 
information. It could also lead to 
increased media scrutiny resulting in 
a loss of stakeholder trust, company 
reputation and regulatory fines or 
penalties.
Opportunity- In the ever-evolving 
landscape of digitalization and 
innovation, monitoring and analysis 
of data in real time would lead to 
quicker identification and resolution 
of issues. As a result, this will ensure 
management of systems and processes 
more effectively.
With increased 
digitization, and 
heavy dependence on 
technology systems, 
it has become critical 
for us to ensure 
implementation of SOPs 
and policies, conduction 
periodic internal and 
external (third-party) 
audits and tests to 
check the resilience of 
the IT infrastructure 
from hackers, cyber-
attacks, malware etc.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The successful involvement of our stakeholders is essential to the achievement of our strategic goals because 
it provides us with the opportunity to understand their expectations, respond to their concerns, and assist us 
in prioritising the areas in which we should be concentrating our efforts. Our mechanism for engaging with 
stakeholders is governed by our Stakeholder Engagement Policy (https://www.sanghicement.com/wp-content/
uploads/Stakeholder-Engagement-Policy.pdf), which is further aligned with global best practises.
	
SIL identifies its stakeholders as groups and individuals, who can influence or/are impacted by our operations/ activities, 
change in technology, regulations, market and societal trends either directly or indirectly. Stakeholders comprise of 
communities, employees, supply chain partners, customers, investors, regulators, industrial organisations etc.
	
Against each group, the potential ways in which stakeholders will be affected as well as the magnitude of both the 
actual and perceived impacts have been determined. This assists the company in developing a bespoke plan for 
engaging with stakeholders, which can then be kept up to date as and when is necessary.
	
Throughout the course of the year, we maintain ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders by utilising a variety of 
channels of contact. The insights that we gain from these projects are tremendously helpful, because they allow us 
to continually enhance both our strategy and our operations. The process of engaging stakeholders also includes 
regular feedback and grievance redressal methods, both of which are vital components of the process.

disclose any potential conflict of interest that could compromise the independence or neutrality of their 
assessments. TUVI diligently identifies any relationships, affiliations, or financial interests that could 
potentially cause conflict of interest. We proactively implement measures to mitigate or manage these 
conflicts, ensuring independence and impartiality in our assurance engagements. We provide clear and 
transparent disclosures about any identified conflicts of interest in our assurance statement. We recognize 
that failure to address conflict of interest adequately could undermine the creditability of the assurance 
process and the reliability of the reported information. Therefore, we strictly adhere to SEBI guidelines and 
take necessary measures to avoid, disclose, or mitigate conflicts of interest effectively.
