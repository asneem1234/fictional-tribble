management of HSE risks. An internal review 
mechanism is in place to assess performance, 
with audits conducted on a timely basis.

approach to identifying work-related hazards 
and assessing risks. Routine hazard identification 
is conducted through programs such as the 
Proactive+ Program and Managerial Safety 
Visits, encouraging employees to report 
hazardous conditions (Safety risks reporting) 
and ensuring strict adherence to safety rules. 
Non-routine hazard identification involves 
joint safety walkdowns and HSE risk profiling 
before undertaking new activities. Monitoring 
and governance are achieved through real-
time safety monitoring and periodical reviews.
By incorporating these processes into its HSE 
Management System and ESG framework, the 
company effectively manages both routine and 
non-routine hazards, minimizing occupational 
health and safety risks and creating a strong 
safety culture.

that all employees must adhere to, reinforcing 
our commitment to maintaining a secure and 
safe working environment. The company’s 
Proactive+ Program and Safety Risk Reporting 
program encourages the early detection and 
correction of safety risks, documenting and 
tracking incidents and near-misses. Employees 
are trained to report hazardous conditions via an 
internal safety management system, with safety 
reports undergoing risk evaluation and corrective 
actions. All employees are empowered to stop 
any unsafe conditions, and report. Leadership 
ensures adherence to life-saving rules, allowing 
employees to escalate concerns. Managerial 
safety visits involve regular safety dialogues with 
employees. These processes create a strong 
safety culture, empowering everyone to report 
hazards and STOP unsafe work.

from assessments of health & safety practices and

Sanofi India Limited has implemented corrective 
actions to address safety-related incidents, focusing 
on a proactive safety culture. Following the 2023 
safety culture assessment, the “Leading Safety” 
Program introduced seven key safety rituals, including 
leadership involvement in safety decisions, hazard 
reporting, joint safety walkdowns, compliance with 
life-saving rules, the Proactive+ Program, managerial 
safety visits, and road safety coaching. The Safety & 
Leadership Upskilling Program aims to train leaders 
in hazard identification, incident prevention, and 
emergency response, regularly updating to include 
emerging safety concerns. Strengthening safety 
governance and accountability, the HSE policy and 
management system have been updated to align 
with global best practices, with regular audits and 
compliance checks.
The company targets zero serious injuries and 
fatalities (SIFs) by 2024 and a Total Reportable Injuries 
Frequency Rate (TRIFR) of 1.5 by 2025. Real-time 
safety monitoring tools and root cause analysis ensure 
targeted safety improvements. We have also partnered 
with the United Nations Decade of Action for Road 
Safety to collaborate with community stakeholders on 
road safety initiatives. Road Safety Program includes 
training programs, defensive driver training, helmet 
distribution, and preventive maintenance Continuous 
improvement and risk mitigation involve short-, mid, 
and long-term action plans, periodic audits, and 
near-miss tracking. The Safety by Design approach 
integrates strict safety requirements from the design 
phase of new projects. Overall, these corrective 
actions aim to achieve a zero-injury workplace while 
enhancing safety culture and compliance.

Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, including safety 
metrics, environmental performance, and overall

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation. 
	
At our Goa site, we have installed a state-of-the-art effluent treatment plant to responsibly manage wastewater 
from production processes thereby ensuring zero liquid discharge. The treated effluent is repurposed for gardening, 
reinforcing our commitment to sustainable water management. Similarly, at our Mumbai site, we have implemented 
a sewage treatment plant to efficiently treat domestic sewage. The treated sewage is reused for toilet flushing and 
gardening, reducing environmental impact and optimizing resource use. Any excess wastewater beyond internal needs 
at the Mumbai office is discharged in compliance with Pollution Control Board regulations, ensuring adherence to 
environmental standards. Through these initiatives, we remain committed to environmental stewardship and sustainable 
business practices, contributing to the preservation of natural resources and the well-being of our communities.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Sanofi is committed to creating a cleaner and more sustainable environment through the implementation of a robust 
waste management strategy. Aligned with our dedication to environmental stewardship, we have adopted the 3R 
approach—Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle—which has significantly minimized waste generation and promoted a culture 
of circularity across our operations.
At our Mumbai office, we are advancing sustainability by embracing digitalization to enable paperless transactions 
and electronic payments. For hazardous waste generated on-site, including ETP sludge, e-waste, used oil, batteries, 
and biomedical waste, we ensure safe and responsible disposal through methods such as co-processing, recycling, 
refining, or incineration, based on the waste category. Importantly, we have completely eliminated the practice of 
landfilling hazardous waste from our operations.
For non-hazardous waste, including plastic, paper, wood, glass, and metal, we adhere to recycling practices in line 
with applicable Plastic Waste Management Rules. We also comply with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) by 
collecting post-consumer plastic waste and ensuring its approved disposal, as mandated by the Central Pollution 
Control Board. Furthermore, all non-saleable pharmaceutical products at distributor locations are securely collected 
and sent for incineration, reinforcing our commitment to sustainable waste management practices.
