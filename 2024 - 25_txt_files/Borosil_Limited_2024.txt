Financial implications of the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative implications)
1.
Climate Change
We are exposed to the physical and transitional risks associated 
with climate change. Rising temperatures and extreme weather 
events have the potential to disrupt our supply chain, affecting 
both the availability and cost of raw materials, which in turn impacts 
our production and could lead to product shortages. Additionally, 
stricter environmental regulations and the growing consumer 
demand for sustainable products require us to decarbonize our 
operations and transition to a low-carbon business model to 
maintain our competitive advantage and market share. Addressing 
climate change is crucial for us to mitigate financial risks and meet 
the evolving expectations of our investors, customers, and regulators 
in an increasingly climate-conscious world.
Our mitigation plan for addressing climate change involves 
investing in energy-efficient technologies and renewable 
energy sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
from our manufacturing processes. We are committed to 
implementing sustainable sourcing practices to ensure 
the resilience of our supply chain. Additionally, we will 
explore the development of eco-friendly products to 
meet the evolving demands of our consumers. We aim to 
engage with stakeholders to promote climate awareness 
and collaborate on initiatives that focus on mitigating 
climate risks and transitioning towards a low-carbon, 
sustainable business model.
Negative:
Climate change can lead to increased operational costs and 
disruptions in our supply chain, which may result in production 
delays, loss of market share, and decreased revenue for us.
Positive:
By adopting sustainable practices, we can enhance our brand 
reputation and operational efficiency. This approach may also 
attract environmentally conscious customers and investors. 
Furthermore, by developing eco-friendly products, we can 
open new market opportunities and drive revenue growth, 
ensuring long-term financial resilience and profitability for our 
company.
2.
Circular Economy
The shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns 
provides us with an opportunity to enhance our brand value and 
customer loyalty by aligning our operations with circular economy 
principles. By designing products for longevity, incorporating 
recycled materials, and embracing circularity, we can foster 
customer loyalty, reduce costs by optimizing resource use, and drive 
innovation. This approach can lead to new revenue streams and give 
us a distinct competitive advantage.
-
Positive:
By embracing circularity, we have the potential to enhance our 
financial performance by attracting eco-conscious consumers 
who are willing to pay a premium, leading to increased sales 
and revenue. Through resource optimization, recycling, and 
efficient design, we can reduce production costs, thereby 
boosting our profit margins. Our strengthened brand image, 
resulting from our sustainability efforts, will help cultivate 
customer loyalty, driving repeat business. Furthermore, the 
innovation inspired by circular principles can unlock new 
revenue streams for us.
3.
Water and Effluent 
Management
Water and effluent management are particularly crucial for us, 
considering the demographics of our manufacturing operations. 
The scarcity of water resources increases the risk of operational 
disruptions and potential damage to our reputation. It is vital for us 
to implement effective effluent treatment to prevent additional strain 
on the already fragile ecosystem and to ensure we comply with 
evolving regulations.
We are committed to mitigating these risks through a 
comprehensive approach. This includes implementing 
water conservation measures across our operations, 
investing in rainwater harvesting systems, exploring the 
use of recycled water, and adopting advanced effluent 
treatment technologies to minimize our environmental 
impact.
Negative:
While our current wastewater recycling efforts help reduce our 
freshwater demand, the high costs associated with advanced 
treatment for industrial reuse present a financial challenge 
for us. Balancing our immediate operational needs with long-
term sustainability goals requires us to explore cost-effective 
solutions for managing water usage and effluents effectively.
4.
Energy Efficiency 
and Management
Energy efficiency and management are central to our sustainability 
strategy. By optimizing energy consumption across our operations, 
we aim to achieve substantial cost reductions while contributing to 
a greener future.
-
Positive:
By implementing a diversified energy strategy, which includes 
adopting renewable energy sources and energy-efficient 
technologies, we can achieve a dual financial advantage. This 
approach will enable us to save on power costs and enhance 
operational stability, ultimately leading to improved profitability 
and long-term growth for our company.

5.
GHG Management
Managing greenhouse gas emissions is a crucial concern for 
us because of the inherent carbon footprint associated with 
our manufacturing operations, especially as we plan to expand 
production. Balancing our growth with efforts to reduce emissions 
is a significant challenge. If we fail to address emissions effectively, 
it could lead to reputational damage and impact on our long-term 
sustainability goals.
We plan to leverage innovation and collaboration to 
address our greenhouse gas emissions. We will implement 
energy-efficient technologies, work with partners to 
promote sustainability across the value chain and explore 
diversified energy sources. Regular monitoring and 
reporting will ensure transparency and drive continuous 
improvement.
Negative:
If we fail to manage our emissions efficiently, it could negatively 
affect our financial performance. Additionally, any reputational 
damage resulting from a perceived lack of environmental 
responsibility might lead to decreased consumer confidence 
and a potential loss of market share, ultimately impacting both 
our revenue and profitability.
6.
Ecosystems and 
Biodiversity
As a manufacturing company, we understand that our operations 
inherently interact with the environment. Our ongoing success 
is intrinsically linked to the health of the ecosystems in which we 
operate. Any potential degradation of these ecosystems, along with 
the resulting loss of biodiversity, presents a significant risk to our 
brand image and the resilience of our operations.
We are committed to preserving the ecological balance 
and vitality of the environments where we conduct our 
business. We have established a process of ongoing 
evaluations to track and understand any potential 
impacts on the environment surrounding our plants and 
operational locations. This helps us identify and address 
any adverse effects on local ecosystems, ensuring that 
our activities coexist harmoniously with the environment.
Negative:
This risk could negatively impact our profitability and overall 
financial performance due to potential financial penalties for 
non-compliance with environmental regulations. Additionally, 
reduced consumer trust might affect our sales, and we could 
face increased operational costs due to resource scarcity or 
the need for remediation efforts.
7.
Product 
Development and 
Innovation
The consumer products market is transforming, and we’re witnessing 
a shift towards non-toxic and sustainable materials. Customers are 
increasingly favoring premium, innovative, and aesthetically pleasing 
products that emphasize functionality. This trend is being driven 
by rising disposable incomes, evolving lifestyles, and the growth of 
nuclear families. By capitalizing on these trends through product 
development and innovation, we can enhance our brand appeal, 
expand our customer base, and achieve sustainable growth in the 
long term.
-
Positive:
Our focus on product development and innovation can lead 
to significant financial gains for us. By introducing premium, 
innovative products, we could command higher prices, thereby 
increasing our revenue and profit margins. At the same time, 
by meeting the evolving desires of consumers, we can expand 
our customer base and strengthen our market presence.
8.
Sustainable 
Packaging
The growing consumer preference for sustainable products and 
eco-friendly practices presents a valuable opportunity for us. This 
shift aligns with global efforts to reduce environmental impact and 
supports our long-term sustainability goals. Key areas where we can 
make a positive impact include using recyclable or biodegradable 
materials, reducing packaging waste, and optimizing logistics to 
lower carbon emissions.
-
Positive:
By implementing sustainable packaging practices, we can 
reduce packaging costs while potentially increasing sales due 
to our enhanced brand reputation and stronger customer 
appeal. This approach can lead to improved profit margins and 
better overall financial performance for us.
9.
Product Quality
In an increasingly competitive market where consumer expectations 
for durability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal are constantly rising, 
our commitment to superior product quality presents a strategic 
opportunity for us. By actively incorporating feedback from our 
customers and stakeholders, we can continuously enhance our 
offerings, exceed expectations, and foster brand loyalty.
-
Positive:
By enhancing our product quality, we can increase customer 
satisfaction and foster brand loyalty, which drives higher sales 
volumes and improves our pricing power. This translates into 
revenue growth, expanded profit margins, and ultimately 
enhanced long-term shareholder value for our company.

10.
Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security
In our increasingly interconnected world, where consumer data is 
a valuable asset, we face inherent risks related to data privacy and 
cybersecurity. Any breach or mishandling of sensitive customer 
information could lead to significant financial losses, damage to 
our reputation, and legal consequences. Additionally, the growing 
prevalence of cyberattacks constantly threatens our operational 
continuity and intellectual property.
We implement a robust cybersecurity framework and 
guidelines to protect customer data.
Positive:
By avoiding potential financial losses from data breaches, 
legal penalties, and reputational damage, we can allocate 
our resources more efficiently towards growth initiatives and 
innovation. This approach results in increased profitability and 
long-term value for all our stakeholders.
11.
Human Rights
Prioritizing human rights offers us a chance to enhance our brand 
reputation and achieve long-term sustainability. By ensuring fair labor 
practices and ethical sourcing, we build trust with stakeholders. This 
approach fosters a positive work environment, helps us attract talent, 
and reduces operational risks.
-
Positive:
By fostering a motivated workforce and maintaining a positive 
work environment, we can enhance productivity and uphold 
our ethical organizational values. This approach contributes to 
improved operational efficiency and cost savings for us.
12.
Health, Safety and 
Employee Wellbeing
Health and safety risks within our operations are a significant concern 
for us. Accidents and hazardous exposures can result in disruptions, 
increased costs, and legal challenges. If we neglect the well-being 
of our employees, it impacts morale, productivity, and turnover, 
ultimately affecting our financial performance and brand reputation.
Building a safe and healthy workplace is essential for 
our sustained success. We mitigate these risks through 
rigorous safety protocols, comprehensive employee 
training, and proactive health and wellness initiatives. By 
conducting regular safety audits and risk assessments, we 
can identify potential hazards and implement preventive 
measures. Fostering a culture of safety and well-being 
helps us create a more engaged and productive 
workforce.
Negative:
Health and safety issues can result in increased costs for us 
due to accidents, compensation, and legal fees. Operational 
disruptions from absenteeism and low productivity can 
impact our output and sales. Additionally, reputational damage 
and difficulty in attracting talent further hinder our financial 
performance.
13.
Code of Conduct
By actively promoting adherence to our code of conduct, we can 
strengthen our relationships with all the stakeholders. This reflects our 
commitment to ethical practices, transparency, and accountability, 
reinforcing our reputation as a trustworthy and values driven leader 
in the market.
-
Positive:
We recognize the strong correlation between ethical practices 
and performance. By adhering to our code of conduct, we 
can improve our company’s ESG ratings, potentially attracting 
investment from socially responsible funds. Increased 
trust enhances our relationships with stakeholders, leading 
to operational efficiencies and opportunities for market 
expansion.
14.
Labor Management
Labor management issues present a significant risk for us. Disputes, 
strikes, or high turnover rates can disrupt our operations, resulting in 
production delays, increased costs, and potential harm to our brand 
reputation. Maintaining a skilled and motivated workforce is essential 
for our continued success, and any labor-related challenges can 
directly affect our financial performance.
We mitigate labor management risks by fostering 
a 
positive 
work 
environment, 
encouraging 
open 
communication, and offering competitive compensation 
and benefits packages. We invest in the development and 
training of our employees and workers to enhance their 
skills and job satisfaction.
Negative:
We face challenges in labor management that could negatively 
impact our financial performance. Events like strikes or high 
employee turnover may lead to decreased productivity, 
increased operational expenses, and potential legal liabilities. 
These issues could affect our sales and reduce investor 
confidence, further jeopardizing our financial stability.

Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion
A homogeneous workforce can hinder our innovation and growth, 
limiting our ability to adapt to changing market trends. It can also 
make it challenging for us to attract and retain top talent, resulting in 
a less skilled and disengaged workforce.
-
Positive:
Our strong commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
(DE&I) can positively impact our financial performance. By 
fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, we can attract 
and retain top talent, leading to increased innovation and 
productivity.
16.
Talent Development, 
Attraction, 
Engagement and 
Retention
In the competitive landscape of our industry, we face a significant risk 
in managing talent. Our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain 
skilled employees is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. If we 
fail to do so, we could end up with a less capable workforce, which 
would hinder our innovation, productivity, and overall business 
growth. To ensure our continued success, we must prioritize talent 
management strategies to build a skilled and engaged workforce 
capable of driving us forward.
We mitigate these risks through a multifaceted approach. 
This includes offering competitive salaries and benefits 
packages, implementing robust employee development 
and training programs, and fostering a positive and 
inclusive 
work 
culture. 
Additionally, 
we 
prioritize 
transparent communication and recognition programs to 
enhance employee engagement and retention.
Positive:
Our effective talent management directly contributes to our 
financial success. With a skilled and engaged workforce, we 
experience increased productivity, innovation, and improved 
customer satisfaction. These factors help drive improvements 
in our top line and bottom line.
17.
Customer Relations
Customer relations are paramount for us as they align with our 
vision of becoming the most customer-centric company in the 
world. By nurturing positive connections with our customers 
through exceptional service and personalized experiences, we 
create powerful opportunities. This approach fosters brand loyalty, 
encourages repeat business, and generates positive word-of-mouth.
-
Positive:
Our strong customer relations directly contribute to our financial 
success. By fostering increased brand loyalty and encouraging 
repeat business, we drive revenue growth and expand our 
market share. Positive word-of-mouth recommendations 
serve as organic marketing for us, effectively reducing our 
customer acquisition costs.
18.
Regulatory Issues 
and Compliance
We recognize that operating within legal and regulatory frameworks 
is not just an obligation for us, but a cornerstone of our business 
strategy. By upholding these standards, we safeguard our financial 
stability and ensure uninterrupted operations. Prioritizing compliance 
allows us to build credibility with stakeholders, protect our brand 
reputation, and demonstrate our commitment to responsible 
business practices.
We mitigate regulatory and compliance risks through a 
robust compliance program. This involves conducting 
regular 
internal 
audits, 
providing 
comprehensive 
employee training on relevant laws and regulations, and 
proactively engaging with regulatory bodies. We have 
established communication channels that allow for the 
reporting of potential compliance concerns, ensuring 
swift and effective corrective action.
Negative:
Non-compliance with regulations can significantly affect our 
financial health. We could face substantial fines and penalties, 
engage in expensive legal disputes, and experience production 
disruptions that result in lost revenue. Furthermore, damage 
to our reputation may diminish consumer trust and investor 
confidence, ultimately impeding our growth and profitability.
19.
Supply Chain 
Management
The effective management of our supply chain is crucial for us to 
mitigate risks related to raw material costs and availability, supplier 
reliability, and logistics efficiency. We must actively address product 
quality, workplace safety, environmental impacts, and social issues 
like human rights and fair compensation within our supply chain.
We mitigate supply chain risks by diversifying our suppliers 
and reducing our reliance on imports. By strengthening 
our supplier relationships and establishing contingency 
plans, we can better manage disruptions. We enforce 
strict quality control, workplace safety, and compliance 
with environmental and social standards. Through regular 
audits and continuous monitoring, we ensure adherence 
to these measures.
Negative:
Interruptions or disruptions in our supply chain can lead to 
production delays and increased operational costs, which may 
directly negatively impact our financial performance.

Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
	
At Borosil Limited, we perceive ourselves as more 
than a mere glassware manufacturing company; 
we are devoted to integrating glass into the daily 
lives of our consumers. Established decades ago, 
Borosil has grown into a prominent name in the glass 
industry, known for its pioneering spirit and relentless 
innovation. Our dedication to customer-centricity 
goes hand-in-hand with our unwavering commitment 
to sustainability. Glass, the very cornerstone of our 
manufacturing process, is a recyclable material made 
from naturally abundant resources, reflecting our 
ethos of environmental responsibility.
	
Over the years, we have made substantial investments 
in 
energy-efficient 
technologies, 
sustainable 
packaging 
solutions, 
and 
responsible 
sourcing 
practices. These efforts underscore our commitment 
to reducing our carbon footprint while enhancing 
the quality of life for present and future generations. 
In pursuit of carbon neutrality, we have encountered 
challenges such as transitioning to renewable energy 
sources and optimizing our supply chain for reduced 
emissions. Nonetheless, we remain steadfast in our 
resolve to achieve these targets through continued 
innovation and collaboration.
	
We 
believe 
that 
Environmental, 
Social, 
and 
Governance (ESG) principles are not just compliance 
regulations but are an integral part of our foundational 
values 
and 
business 
philosophies. 
Our 
ESG 
initiatives also prioritize gender diversity and ethical 
business practices, striving to create an inclusive 
and fair workplace that mirrors our commitment 
to societal progress. While achieving these goals 
poses challenges, such as overcoming existing 
workplace biases and ensuring comprehensive policy 
implementation, we are driven by the desire to create 
a significant impact within the communities we serve 
through initiatives that span sports, art and culture, 
healthcare, environmental sustainability, education, 
and skill development.
	
Guided by an unwavering dedication to transparency, 
ethical practices, and robust corporate governance, 
Borosil views its ESG journey as an ongoing endeavor. 
This journey is deeply rooted in purpose and propelled 
by a vision to nurture lasting positive change for society 
and the environment alike. As we continue to expand 
our legacy, we remain committed to upholding the 
highest standards of integrity and excellence, ensuring 
that our glassware not only enhances everyday life 
but also contributes to a greater cause. Through 
innovation and responsible practices, Borosil Limited 
aspires to set benchmarks that inspire others to follow 
in our footsteps, fostering a brighter, more sustainable 
future for all.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
Our company has established procedures for sustainable sourcing, reflecting our firm commitment to promoting

and governance, setting strict standards for environmental stewardship, occupational health and safety, and ethical 
conduct. We encourage our suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, advocating for sustainable practices 
in every aspect of operations.
	
To ensure the sustainable sourcing of raw materials, we implement comprehensive measures. Imports are conducted 
solely through registered vendors, with rigorous inspection protocols both at the point of dispatch and upon arrival at 
our plant, ensuring compliance with specified contract requirements. To reduce reliance on imports, we have created 
a local procurement supply chain, prioritizing raw materials from Indian manufacturers and maintaining stringent 
contracts and quality inspections to uphold our desired product standards. Our transportation logistics are optimized 
through effective inventory management, adopting preferential procurement practices to minimize our transportation 
footprint.
	
We enforce contracts and Codes of Conduct (COC) to prohibit child labor, forced labor, and other human rights violations 
within the supply chain, aligning with Borosil Limited’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which emphasizes environmental, 
social, and ethical guidelines. For more details, please refer to our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy.

R&D
CAPEX
To expand Borosil’s existing product portfolio, a novel food-
safe coating composition has been developed specifically 
for opal and borosilicate glassware. This innovative 
formulation enhances durability, chemical resistance, 
and regulatory compliance, representing a significant 
advancement in the domain of food-safe glass coatings. 
The coating is applied via spray painting, followed by a 
tempering-based curing process that ensures superior 
adhesion, mechanical strength, and chemical resistance 
compared to conventional methods. This not only elevates 
the aesthetic appeal of the glassware but also preserves 
its inherent quality and performance, maintaining the 
premium look and feel of the final product.
By leveraging advanced surface treatment technologies, 
Borosil strengthens its position as a leader in sustainable 
manufacturing. This spray coating composition aligns 
with global sustainability goals, demonstrating how eco-
conscious process improvements can generate both 
environmental and commercial value. This thoughtful 
blend of design, efficiency, and sustainability sets a new 
standard for environmentally responsible manufacturing 
in the glass industry, highlighting that product excellence 
and ecological stewardship can coexist seamlessly.
We installed a 7.227 MWp solar plant in Phase-2, 
specifically designed to supply power to our Opal Glass 
Furnace-1 and Opal Glass Furnace-2 facilities. This 
strategic initiative substantially enhanced our utilization 
of green energy, raising it to a commendable 28%. The 
anticipated additional availability of green energy from this 
solar installation is projected to be 10,000 MWh annually.
Secondly, we implemented an advanced Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP) system to optimize our waste 
management 
processes. 
This 
comprehensive 
undertaking included the installation and commissioning 
of several essential components. We integrated collection 
and transfer pumps, skimmers, and a bio-reactor blower 
to ensure efficient processing. Furthermore, the system 
will incorporate ultrafiltration (UF), a softener, and reverse 
osmosis (RO) technologies to enhance the quality of 
treated water. The configuration of all treatment units 
has been meticulously planned to ensure optimal 
performance and reliability.

Plastics 
(Including packaging)
We securely store and transport all of our plastic waste, ensuring that it is sent to recyclers for 
proper recycling.
E- Waste
We store all e-waste in designated areas and ensure it is disposed of through authorized e-waste 
recyclers, in compliance with e-waste guidelines. To monitor and ensure the proper handling 
and processing of e-waste, we maintain detailed E-waste Generation and Disposal Records 
(Form 2 and 3).
Hazardous Waste
We store hazardous waste in designated, isolated, and covered areas. Used liquid oil is kept in sealed 
containers with secondary containment to prevent spills. We label the waste according to statutory 
requirements and ensure disposal occurs within 90 days of generation, following strict guidelines. 
Our personnel handling hazardous waste are equipped with proper Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE), and we maintain stringent supervision throughout the storage and handling processes.
We ensure that waste is transported solely by authorized handlers who have been approved by 
State Pollution Control Boards, and we use vehicles that meet the necessary approvals. We diligently 
maintain comprehensive records, including manifests and disposal authorizations, to comply with 
statutory guidelines. The types of hazardous waste we generate include used oil (Category-5.1), 
waste or residues containing oil (Category-5.2), and ETP sludge (Category-35.3).
Other Waste
Our waste management initiatives include:
•	
Achieving 100% utilization of broken or waste glass (culets) by reintegrating them into our 
manufacturing process, thereby maintaining a zero-waste glass manufacturing facility.
•	
Effectively managing and disposing of wet waste from our kitchens and gardens through 
systems like composting facilities, converting waste into manure.
•	
Carefully segregating, storing, and disposing of biomedical waste at our plants in line with 
regulatory guidelines to ensure safety and environmental compliance.
•	
Selling the waste generated at all our plants to registered recyclers approved by relevant 
government authorities, ensuring responsible recycling and disposal.
•	
Continuously working towards integrating circular economy principles by minimizing waste, 
reusing materials, and ensuring that resources remain in use for as long as possible.

10.	 Health and Safety Management System
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/No). If 
yes, the coverage of such a system?
	
We have implemented an occupational health and safety management system across all our facilities, which are certified 
with ISO standards for both Occupational Health and Safety Management and Environmental Management Systems. 
Fire safety measures, including fire and smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and sprinkler systems, are installed at each 
of our plants. These installations undergo regular maintenance, supported by service contracts. To enhance fire safety 
awareness, we routinely conduct fire drills. We test our drinking water biannually using certified laboratories, while air 
quality assessments are performed annually. Each of our plants is equipped with a first aid kit to address medical needs, 
and we have wheelchairs and foldable stretchers available for emergencies. Emergency contact information, such as 
police, ambulance, hospitals, and building management, is prominently displayed at every workstation.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
	
We adopt a structured and proactive approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks for both routine and 
non-routine activities. Our key processes include:
	
•	
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): We conduct formal risk assessments periodically, where we 
identify hazards, evaluate the likelihood and severity of risks, and implement appropriate control measures.
30
31
ANNUAL REPORT    2024-25
ANNUAL REPORT    2024-25
	
•	
Workplace Inspections and Safety Walks: Our EHS team and safety committee members regularly carry out site 
inspections and safety observations to identify unsafe conditions or behaviors in real-time.
	
•	
Permit-to-Work (PTW) System: For high-risk non-routine activities such as hot work, confined space entry, 
working at heights, and chemical unloading, we utilize a PTW system. This ensures thorough risk evaluation, proper 
authorization, and clear communication of safety requirements before work begins.
	
•	
Employee Reporting and Feedback Mechanism: We encourage our workers to report unsafe conditions, near 
misses, and potential hazards through a structured system. We analyze these reports and take appropriate 
measures to prevent recurrence.
	
•	
Incident Investigation: We thoroughly investigate all incidents and near misses to identify root causes and any 
underlying or hidden hazards. We use the findings to strengthen our hazard identification and risk assessment 
processes.
	
•	
Toolbox Talks: Before starting work, especially for non-routine or high-risk tasks, we conduct toolbox talks to 
discuss job-specific hazards and the necessary precautions with our team.
c.	
Whether you have processes for employees to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
	
We have established processes that empower our workers to report work-related hazards and remove themselves 
from situations involving imminent risk. Our key processes include:
	
•	
Hazard Reporting Mechanism: Our workers can report unsafe conditions, near misses, and potential hazards 
through multiple channels, such as email, WhatsApp messages, or directly to our EHS team. We promptly review 
these reports and take appropriate corrective actions.
	
•	
Stop-Work Authority (SWA): We empower our workers with the right to stop work immediately if they perceive 
any unsafe condition or imminent danger to themselves or others. This authority applies to both routine and non-
routine tasks, and no disciplinary action is taken against workers for exercising this right in good faith.
	
•	
Training and Awareness: We conduct regular training sessions to educate our workers about recognizing hazards, 
how to report them, and the procedure to follow if they need to withdraw from a risky situation. We also ensure that 
our employees are informed about their rights related to workplace safety.
	
•	
Follow-Up and Corrective Action: We log, investigate, and address all reported hazards within defined timelines. 
We keep our workers informed of the actions taken, ensuring transparency and building trust in the system.
d.	
Do the employees of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No).
	
We ensure that our employees have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services, providing a 
comprehensive range of healthcare options beyond just occupational health requirements. Our offerings include:
	
•	
General Health Check-ups: We organize periodic medical camps and health screenings to monitor the overall 
well-being of our employees. Primary Healthcare Access: We provide on-site or partner medical facilities to 
address common illnesses, consultations, and treatments.
	
•	
Emergency Medical Support: Our first-aid centers and emergency response systems are set up to manage 
sudden health issues, whether work-related or not.
	
•	
Employee Wellness Programs: We offer initiatives such as stress management sessions, mental health awareness 
programs, lifestyle counseling, and fitness activities to promote overall wellness.
	
•	
Health Insurance Coverage: Our group medical insurance policies typically cover not only occupational injuries 
but also personal illnesses, hospitalizations, and care for dependents.
	
•	
Family Care Services: Depending on our company’s policy, we may provide access to healthcare services for 
employees’ families.

Assessments.
	
vi.	
HIRA/JSA/On-the-Job Training: We use HIRA (Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment) to identify hazards 
and assess the intensity of risks, followed by creating mitigation plans. Periodic reviews and on-the-job training 
enhance our employees’ awareness of operational hazards and safety measures.
	
vii.	
Work Permit System: We implement the Permit to Work (PTW) system to ensure worker safety during hazardous 
and non-standard operations. Various permits are issued for activities such as work at height, hot work, and 
confined space work, monitored by our process owners, maintenance, and EHS departments.
	
viii.	 HAZOP Studies: We conduct HAZOP studies to identify potential hazardous situations, assess vulnerable zones, 
and suggest mitigation measures.
	
Additionally, we have formed a dedicated plant safety committee, regularly conducted mock drills, and organized 
motivational programs like National Safety Week celebrations to promote safety awareness among our employees.

In collaboration with Calcutta Social Project, we have actively engaged with and supported vulnerable and marginalized 
groups, including women, children, underprivileged youth, and the elderly. Key programs such as Shikshya have provided 
supplementary online education to students, helping bridge conceptual gaps for children from economically disadvantaged 
backgrounds. The Drop-Out Prevention Program (DPP) and Post Board and Career Support initiatives have extended financial 
aid and career counseling to youth at risk of discontinuing education, while the English Crossover (ECO) program has 
enabled deserving students to access English-medium education. The SAHAY program has delivered critical food aid and 
support to abandoned elderly individuals in remote areas like the Sunderbans, improving both their physical sustenance and 
emotional wellbeing. For women and adolescent girls living in high-risk zones, the RAKSHA initiative has offered self-defense 
training in martial arts, fostering both confidence and personal safety. Additionally, Sports Sponsorships have empowered 
talented youth from rural and semi-urban regions by providing kits, travel allowances, and entry to tournaments. Across 
these interventions, 100% of beneficiaries have been from marginalized or vulnerable backgrounds, with efforts strategically 
distributed across multiple districts of West Bengal, including Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Hooghly, and Nadia. 
The Milk Distribution to Needy Patients Program provided essential nutritional support to patients in the Gynaecology, 
Orthopaedic, and Surgical wards of the Government Hospital in Bharuch, Gujarat. Supported by the Company, the program 
was implemented across 328 villages in Jhagadia, Ankleshwar, and Bharuch during FY 2024–25. It focused on malnourished 
and hospitalized individuals, supplying milk, a recognized complete food as a source of Vitamin B12, calcium, protein, and 
healthy fats, all administered under medical supervision. In regions like Bharuch, where malnutrition remains a significant 
challenge, this initiative played a vital role in bridging nutritional gaps and aiding patient recovery. Feedback from beneficiaries 
reflected marked improvements in health, reinforcing the critical role of CSR in enabling impactful, community-focused 
healthcare interventions.
We also supported the restoration of the Jai Garh Fort, a 
historic heritage property, under our CSR initiatives through 
Saat Saath Arts, an implementing agency. The project not 
only revived the fort’s historical and cultural value but also 
generated employment for local artisans and workers, 
boosting livelihoods. The restored site attracted over 
25,000–30,000 visitors, benefiting local tourism service 
providers such as guides and vendors. Students of heritage 
and culture also gained valuable insights. This initiative 
promoted cultural awareness, preserved national heritage, 
and strengthened Jaipur’s position as a centre of art and 
tourism, thereby creating a multifaceted social impact.
Under direct CSR implementation, we supported the 
Ladesar Nutrition Programme to address malnutrition 
among 
children 
in 
the 
underserved 
communities 
surrounding our Jaipur plant. The initiative distributed 
essential food kits to over 500 beneficiaries, ensuring 
access to basic nutrition in areas where undernourishment 
remains a critical challenge. Approximately 95% of the 
recipients belonged to vulnerable and marginalised 
groups.

We commenced the construction of a dedicated public library for girls at Anantpura Gram Panchayat, Jaipur, reaffirming 
our commitment to education and gender equity. The project was formally approved by the CSR Committee and the Board 
of Directors in February 2025. Given the limited timeframe available in the financial year, the focus thus far has been on 
procurement of raw materials and the initiation of groundwork. The initiative underscores the enduring commitment to 
advancing education by creating meaningful access to learning spaces and opportunities.
Through these initiatives, we addressed the concerns of vulnerable and marginalized groups by providing essential support, 
education, and empowerment opportunities. Our actions reflect a dedication to fostering resilience, promoting health and 
well-being, and enabling economic independence among these communities. These efforts not only improve the lives of 
individuals but also contribute to the overall development and upliftment of society.
In addition to the community-based initiatives, we have partnered with the Inspire Institute of Sport (IIS) to support over 300 
athletes from rural, semi-urban, and underserved communities through a robust Food and Nutrition Program. Implemented 
at India’s premier high-performance training center in Vijayanagar, Karnataka, the initiative ensures equitable access to 
personalized nutrition planning, dietary support, and supplement provision for aspiring junior and elite-level athletes. Many 
beneficiaries come from modest socio-economic backgrounds and are now being empowered to compete nationally 
and internationally in sports such as wrestling, boxing, judo, athletics, and swimming. With over 350,000 nutritious meals 
served and personalized nutrition plans prepared for more than 300 athletes, the program also integrates injury recovery, 
performance enhancement, and awareness on hydration and anti-inflammatory diets. Through workshops, competitions, 
and the launch of a Hydration Bar, the initiative combines science-led nutrition with grassroots impact.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
	
We are deeply committed to environmental sustainability and have implemented a comprehensive Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) Policy to meticulously manage our wastewater effluent. Under this policy, the raw influent generated 
from our plant undergoes stringent treatment processes to ensure that no liquid waste is discharged into the 
environment without proper treatment. Our advanced effluent treatment plant (ETP) begins with chemical treatment to 
neutralize and eliminate contaminants, followed by biological treatment to further degrade organic matter. The effluent 
then undergoes tertiary treatment stages, including dual media filtration and activated carbon filtration (ACF), ensuring 
the highest level of purification. Subsequently, the treated water undergoes additional polishing through ultrafiltration 
and reverse osmosis (RO) at three stages to meet stringent quality standards.
	
Once treated, the water is seamlessly reintegrated into our operations for various processes, such as cooling towers, 
chiller units, and forming machine cooling, effectively closing the loop on water consumption. With a robust capacity 
of 120 kiloliters per day (KLD), our ZLD system exemplifies our unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship. 
Additionally, complementing our ZLD system, we have an 80 KLD Sewage Treatment Plant based on Membrane 
Bioreactor (MBR) technology to treat wastewater from toilets and bathrooms, which we reuse in garden irrigation and 
toilet flushing. This holistic approach not only reduces the burden on groundwater extraction but also promotes water 
recycling, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6). Through these initiatives, we continue to lead by 
example in environmental responsibility and sustainability.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such waste.
	
Our organization employs a systematic and sustainable approach to waste management, emphasizing the principles 
of reduce, reuse, and recycle. We segregate waste at the source into biodegradable, recyclable, hazardous, and non-
hazardous categories. Recyclable materials are directed to authorized recyclers, while hazardous waste is securely 
stored and disposed of through authorized Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF) agencies, adhering to 
environmental regulations.
	
To minimize the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products and processes, we have implemented a substitution 
strategy, replacing harmful substances with eco-friendly alternatives whenever possible. Our comprehensive strategies 
include rigorous selection criteria for raw materials and suppliers, prioritizing non-toxic options wherever feasible. 
Additionally, we have established protocols for the safe handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous chemicals to 
ensure compliance with regulatory standards and prevent environmental contamination.
