Risk
	
●Climatic hazards have the 
ability to inflict physical 
damage to offices, data 
centers, cloud services 
infrastructure, and the 
electricity grid, which may 
disrupt operations at eClerx
	
●Disruptions to a city’s 
functional infrastructure, 
such as transportation 
systems, can severely 
impact daily operations. 
These disruptions may 
involve road closures, public 
transport breakdowns, or 
gridlock caused by natural 
disasters, extreme weather, or 
infrastructure failure, leading 
to delays, safety risks.
	
●Extreme events like 
heatwaves, floods, or 
snowstorms can severely 
impact employees’ health 
and commute. Health risks 
include heat-related illnesses, 
respiratory issues from poor 
air quality, and mental stress 
from disasters.
	
●Transitional risks resulting 
from shifts in climate-related 
policies, local or national 
regulations, emission 
standards, net-zero initiatives, 
or increased use of renewable 
energy may demand 
significant investments or 
lead to penalties for non-
compliance.
Opportunity
	
●Positioning itself as an 
environment friendly 
organization helps eClerx in 
improving the brand image
	
●Savings from low carbon 
fuel transport, low emission/
renewable energy sources, 
green buildings reduces 
OPEX
	
●eClerx has a dedicated 
Business Continuity 
Management (BCM) Policy 
and is an ISO22301 certified 
company for BCMS.
	
●Climate action and net zero

with the business strategy
	
●eClerx has reinforce data 
centres and office buildings 
to withstand extreme 
weather. Uses backup power 
systems and improved 
cooling technologies.
	
●Established an emergency 
preparedness plan 
for disasters such as 
earthquakes, floods, cyclones, 
etc.
	
●Developed remote work 
capabilities and flexible work 
arrangements to minimize 
dependence on physical 
infrastructure. Expanding 
remote operations can 
enhance productivity 
during times of disruption 
and increase employee 
satisfaction by providing 
more flexible working 
options.
	
●Preparedness to mitigate or 
withstand transition risks 
involves proactive strategies 
to adapt to changing climate 
policies, regulations, and 
energy standards. eClerx has 
implemented sustainable 
practices, invested in 
low-carbon technologies, 
and adopted renewable 
energy sources to reduce 
dependency on fossil fuels.
Negative
	
●Investments in renewable 
energy and low carbon 
fueled transportation 
services for our employees 
are significant which may 
result in increased costs 
and reduced profitability
	
●Floods, fire damages, 
droughts and extreme 
weather events may cause 
shut-downs, repair costs, 
operational disruption and 
reduced productivity
	
●Poor employee health due 
to environmental damage 
may hamper long term 
growth and profitability
Positive
	
●Positioning eClerx as a 
climate resilient company 
opens a plethora of new 
business opportunities 
both from existing and new 
clients.
	
●Savings from lower energy 
bills increases profit and 
leads to a higher valuation

Customer 
Centricity
Opportunity
	
●A customer centric approach 
increases loyalty & retention. 
Personalized, responsive 
service builds long-term 
client relationships.
	
●Satisfied clients lead to 
upselling, cross-selling, and 
positive referrals thereby 
aiding revenue growth
	
●Provides a competitive 
advantage
Not considered a risk. However 
poor customer centricity can 
pose a threat to business 
sustainability. eClerx follows a 
strong governance approach 
towards maintaining customer 
delight. It has a stakeholder 
relationship committee at the 
board level to oversee client 
relations. Our business leaders 
are in constant touch with 
the clients to seek feedback 
which is then passed on to the 
delivery teams enabling them 
to provide best-in-class service 
delivery
Positive
	
●Increased client lifetime 
value through loyalty and 
repeat business
	
●More revenue per 
client through deeper 
relationships
	
●Referrals and positive 
word-of-mouth reduces 
marketing costs

Note: eClerx operates in services, primarily digital operations, analytics, automation, and consulting, rather than manufacturing 
physical products. This means the scope to invest in environment-related process technologies (e.g., cleaner production, 
emissions control) is limited or non-material. Being an office-based company, eClerx has limited direct environmental impact 
(Scope 1 emissions). Most emissions come from indirect sources like electricity use (Scope 2) and supply chain (Scope 3). These 
are typically managed through energy efficiency, green office initiatives, or sustainable procurement, rather than R&D-heavy 
technologies. Most technology improvements are made through adoption or customization of existing platforms, not via capex-
heavy innovation pipelines. These involve OPEX (operational expenditures) and policy/process improvement, not R&D or capex 
investments.

sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
Yes
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced 
sustainably?
	
60%
	
As a part of sustainable sourcing initiative, 53 of 
our vendors, accounting for 60% of total input 
(by value) have signed the compliance certificate 
with ESG clauses. Also, all critical vendors 
(determined by business value) are required to 
complete an ESG commitment questionnaire 
and acknowledge the Supplier Code of Conduct, 
which adheres to UNGC principles. As of FY 2024-
25, a total of 1655 registered vendors existed in 
the system out of which 441 vendors signed the 
sustainable supplier code of conduct. Efforts 
are being made to strengthen the data capture 
and increase this share in future years. The Code 
now forms a part of the purchase order and is 
mandatory for vendors to acknowledge while 
accepting the purchase order. Also, starting 
September 2024, filling up the ESG questionnaire 
has been integrated with the vendor onboarding 
process which makes it mandatory for all 
vendors to fill up the questionnaire prior to doing 
business with eClerx. Out of the 335 new vendors 
on-boarded last financial year, 161 have already 
filled the ESG questionnaire (48%).

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/
Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for 
manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service 
industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
	
eClerx, a provider of Business Process Management 
services, offers virtual products that have minimal 
environmental 
impact. 
Operating 
from 
leased 
facilities also limits its control over office product use. 
Therefore, lifecycle assessment is not a key focus area 
for the company due to its operational model.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental 
concerns and/or risks arising from production or 
disposal of your products / services, as identified 
in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) 
or through any other means, briefly describe 
the same along-with action taken to mitigate the 
same. 
	
None. There are no significant social or environmental 
concerns arising from the company’s products since it 
is not a manufacturing organization. All the products 
are virtual in nature and life cycle assessment is not 
applicable. 
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material 
to total material (by value) used in production (for 
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for

Not Applicable. eClerx categorizes its entire workforce as ‘employees’
Other than Permanent Workers
Not Applicable. eClerx categorizes its entire workforce as ‘employees’
Permanent Employees
Yes. eClerx’s grievance redressal process occurs in four stages, beginning 
with the raising of the grievance. Employees are encouraged to promptly 
bring their grievances to the attention of their managers and/or HR 
Business Partner (HRBP), providing factual details and supporting evidence. 
This is followed by an investigation of the grievance, during which the HRBP 
ensures that all involved parties receive a fair hearing. In the third stage, 
known as the ‘closure’ stage, the HRBP receives the final recommendations 
from the investigating authorities (as outlined in the Conduct and Discipline 
Policy), communicates these recommendations to the immediate manager, 
and ensures they are implemented within one working day. The final stage, 
‘appeal,’ allows employees who are dissatisfied with the decision to appeal 
to the vertical head or HR head within three working days of receiving the 
decision. If it is determined during the investigation that the grievance was 
fabricated with malicious intent, strict punitive action will be taken against 
the employee, as approved by both the Head of HR and the Vertical Head.

contact and escalation details for the respective 
points of contact. Fire exit plans are prominently 
displayed on all work floors, and unobstructed 
exit doors are provided for easy evacuation.

Board 
on 
economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation 
is 
delegated, 
how 
is 
feedback 
from 
such 
consultations provided to the Board.
	
eClerx holds periodic discussions between the 
Board committees and management to identify 
critical stakeholder concerns and align priorities with 
their expectations. The Stakeholders’ Relationship 
Committee of the Board provides guidance and 
oversees the mechanism for addressing grievances 
and complaints from stakeholders and aligning 
Stakeholder priorities with the Company’s business 
strategy. 
The 
committee 
reviews 
associate, 
vendor, and customer satisfaction survey reports, 
and 
oversees 
the 
mechanism 
for 
addressing 
stakeholders’ grievances. The committee also reviews 
the Company’s environmental, health and safety 
obligations towards the stakeholders. The inputs 
received influence the creation of appropriate policies 
and practices that govern responsible business.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to 
support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, 
provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, inputs received from stakeholders are important 
building blocks that help the company shape its 
ESG policy. An inclusive approach through continual 
engagement with stakeholders helps prioritize the 
key material issues. There is constant communication 
between the stakeholders and the business leaders 
highlighting critical improvement areas, emerging 
risks and new opportunities for the organization. 
	
In 
FY 
2024-25, 
eClerx 
conducted 
its 
first 
comprehensive materiality assessment with the 
help of an external agency. A four step approach was 
taken for the assessment which involved identifying 
the potential material topics based on peer reviews, 
benchmarking, sectoral scans and media reports. 
This was followed by stakeholder engagement via 
online surveys and in-person meetings to prioritize 
the material ESG topics. Results were calibrated by 
analyzing stakeholder responses synthesizing the 
collected data. Finally risk and opportunity evaluation 
was done in line with the identified material topics.
	
These final material topics based on the inputs and 
feedback received from our stakeholders are thus 
incorporated into eClerx’s ESG plan. The company’s 
emission 
reduction 
targets 
mentioned 
in 
the 
environmental policy are set taking the customer’s 
net-zero targets into consideration. eClerx has also 
consulted with different stakeholders and adopted 
newer technologies to help itself transition to a 
low carbon economy. Pulse polls and engagement 
surveys are conducted annually to understand the 
pain points of its most important stakeholders – 
its people. These inputs help the company design 
policies 
and 
procedures 
that 
drive 
employee 
satisfaction. 
	
The company’s regular connect with governing and 
regulatory bodies helps ensure compliance and 
consensus oriented decision making. The company 
is committed towards transparent and timely 
resolution of issues so that it continues to do right by 
all its stakeholders.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, 
and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Through its various CSR initiatives, eClerx engages 
with the vulnerable and marginalized sections 
of the local community. These are typically rural 
women, 
students 
from 
economically 
weaker 
sections, unemployed youth from under-represented 
communities, persons with disabilities and children 
with special needs. This is governed by the CSR policy

Does the entity have any project related to reducing 
Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
eClerx has undertaken several initiatives to reduce 
GHG emissions across its operations. Some of them 
are as following:
	
Scope 1 reduction efforts
–	 eClerx has minimal Scope 1 emissions, given its 
reliance on leased office spaces and outsourced 
employee transportation. Nevertheless, the company 
is committed to further reducing these emissions by 
transitioning to refrigerants with lower global warming 
potential (GWP). As part of this initiative, eClerx has 
replaced traditional air conditioning gases such as R22 
with more environmentally friendly alternatives like 
R410A. This Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) offers higher heat 
transfer efficiency, improved system performance, 
greater cooling capacity, and significantly lower GWP 
compared to R22, making it a more sustainable choice.
	
Scope 2 reduction efforts
–	 All office floors use energy-efficient LED lighting, with meeting 
rooms featuring motion-sensor controls. The technical facility 
management team ensures optimal ambient temperatures 
to reduce overall energy consumption.
–	 As of the fiscal year ending March 2025, 93% of eClerx’s 
total office space in India is situated in LEED/IGBC 
certified buildings. The company has also established 
a global facility selection guideline to standardize 
criteria for choosing new sites worldwide. This initiative 
reflects a holistic strategy for reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions and addressing climate change. eClerx 
remains committed to shifting to renewable electricity. 
While just 9% of electricity consumed across our India 
locations came from renewable sources in FY2019–20, 
this share has risen to 64% by the end of FY2024–25..
	
Scope 3 reduction efforts
–	 To help lower its Scope 3 emissions, eClerx is 
adopting electric vehicles for daily employee 
commutes and business-related intercity travel. 
eClerx uses a proprietary platform called ‘Fleet Star’ 
to roster employees and vehicles on specific routes 
with a remarkable accuracy percentage of 98%. 
The company also prioritizes booking direct or non-
stop flights for both domestic and international 
trips whenever possible to reduce emissions 
linked to layovers. Employees are encouraged 
to hold virtual meetings, webinars, and training 
sessions to limit travel needs. Additionally, eClerx 
books accommodations close to event venues 
to cut down on secondary transportation. Over 
96% of sourcing is domestic helping to reduce 
emissions from transporting input materials. We 
have also upgraded our travel portal through which 
employees can view their GHG footprint to better 
understand their environmental impact and plan 
their travel. 
Notes: 
-	 Independent assessment/evaluation/assurance has been carried out by TUV SUD South Asia Pvt. Ltd.
-	 The above table includes the emissions from our Indian operations only. Data for FY 2023-24 differs from the previous year’s report because 
last year’s report covered data for India and Manila locations, whereas in the current year, reporting is restricted to India locations only.
-	 Scope 1 emissions for eClerx includes the GHG emissions from refrigerant leakage from the AC systems owned and operated by eClerx and 
from fire extinguishers. eClerx has no company owned assets like DG set, vehicles etc.
-	 The Scope 2 emission in table above has been calculated based on emission factor provided by CEA (Central Electricity Authority of India).
-	 *For Scope 2, emission factors of 0.842 kg-CO2/kWh and 0.823 kg-CO2/kWh have been considered according to CEA version 20 and version 
19 for FY 2024-25 and FY 2023-24 respectively for all India locations.
-	 Revenue from operations at our India locations is considered for intensity calculation: ₹24,843.63 Million (FY 2024-25), ₹21,946.95 Million (FY 
2023-24).
-	 PPP factor of 20.20 considered for adjustment.

–	 Data for FY 2023-24 in the current report differs from the previous year’s report because last year’s report covered global data, 
whereas in the current year, reporting is restricted to India locations only.
–	 The rise in waste numbers for FY 2024-25 compared to FY 2023-24 reflects the increase in headcount across all our locations 
and opening of new offices at existing locations. 
–	 All the waste generated is either sent to the landlords for disposal (plastic, bio-medical, construction and demolition, paper 
and food wastes) or to certified vendors/re-cyclers for re-cycling (e-waste and battery waste) hence have been considered 
under other methods of disposal.
–	 Since eClerx is a services company, it does not generate any radioactive or hazardous waste. Hence these categories are not 
applicable.
–	 Other non-hazardous wastes majorly include paper waste and organic/food waste from cafeteria.
–	 Revenue from operations at our India locations is considered for intensity calculation: ₹24,843.63 Million (FY 2024-25),

strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
	
As an IT-enabled services and data analytics 
organization, eClerx does not manufacture physical 
products, so the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in manufacturing processes is not applicable. The 
waste generated from operations primarily includes 
e-waste, battery waste, biomedical waste, and other 
non-hazardous waste such as paper and food.
	
Recognizing that waste management is a global 
concern, eClerx is committed to promoting a 
81
ECLERX SERVICES LIMITED  |  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
sustainable waste management system as part of 
its environmental responsibility. The company has 
implemented a comprehensive waste segregation 
program 
across 
all 
office 
locations, 
featuring 
designated bins for recyclables, organic waste, and 
general waste. Training sessions are held to educate 
employees and housekeeping staff about the 
importance of segregation at the source. Additionally, 
eClerx carefully tracks and maintains records of the 
waste generated at its offices.
	
E-waste, including personal computers (desktops 
and laptops), mobile phones, printers, cartridges, 
and batteries, is returned to the original vendors 
or authorized resellers, who provide certificates 
confirming the successful recycling and recovery 
of materials. Compliance with e-waste legislation is 
rigorously evaluated to ensure all requirements are 
met before disposal.
	
eClerx has also taken significant steps to enhance 
health and hygiene for its female employees by 
installing hygiene bins and vending machines for 
material procurement and safe disposal. These 
machines have been placed in all female restrooms 
at our facilities in Mumbai, Pune and Chandigarh and 
are being gradually expanded to other locations. The 
company has tied-up with organizations who provide 
eco-friendly disposal and recycling of sanitary 
pads. Under their menstrual hygiene management 
process, they take care of recycling used sanitary 
napkins, from collection to processing. Sanitary 
pads are collected from all locations and brought 
to a material recovery facility which, in 20 minutes, 
recovers close to 99 percent of the material at low 
cost, separating it into pulp and plastic. This pulp 
can be used across various industries such as paper, 
packaging etc. thereby saving quite a good amount 
of GHG emissions.
11.

–	 Scope 3 includes data for our global offices
–	 Consolidated revenue from operations is considered for 
intensity calculation: ₹33,658.65 Million (FY 2024-25) & 
₹29,255.43 Million (FY 2023- 24). Global headcount has 
been considered for intensity per employee.
–	 The ambit of Scope 3 covers all the categories as per the 
details mentioned below:
	
●Category 1: Purchased goods and services and 
Category 2: Capital goods.
Emission: 4,042  MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: Spend based method has 
been used to estimate the emissions from our 
purchased goods and services and capital goods. 
United States Environmentally-Extended Input-
Output (USEEIO) emission factors published 
by

●Category 3: Fuel and electricity related emission.
This is included in Scope 2 calculation above.
	
●Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution.
Emissions are not reported separately to avoid 
double counting, as they are already included in 
the cradle-to-shelf emissions of purchased goods 
and services.
	
●Category 5: Waste generated in operations.
Emission: 0.73 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: Emissions from this category 
are relatively less since eClerx is a service 
organization and does not produce any physical 
goods. Major types of waste are e-wastes, battery 
wastes, plastic, paper and organic wastes. 
Waste-type-specific emission factors have been 
considered as per DEFRA 23 for estimation. 
The same is available at:  https://www.gov.uk/
government/publications/greenhouse-gas-
reporting-conversion-factors-2023.
	
●Category 6: Business travel. 
Emission: 1,954  MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: Distance based method 
of estimation is used for all domestic and 
international air travels and surface travels 
originating from India. ‘Travelution’, an internal 
web portal provides an integrated solution for all 
travel needs for travels originating from India and 
captures the mode and distance. Additionally, 
data from claims made by employees post travel 
have been considered for estimation. 
Spend based method is used for estimating 
emissions from travels for outside India offices. 
Emission factors from ESEEIO, ICAO and DEFRA 
are considered for estimation. https://www.icao.
int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/
Pages/default.aspx. The links for USEEIO and 
DEFRA are mentioned above.
	
●Category 7: Employee commute.
Emission: 7,498 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: eClerx had carried out 
an extensive survey to gather data regarding 
employee commuting habits. The survey was 
conducted across the offices in India and Manila 
that covers more than 90% of our workforce. The 
survey covered various aspects such as mode of 
transport, fuel types of personal vehicles used, 
work from home requests, carpool, etc. The 
results from the survey are used for estimating 
emissions for self-travelling employees.  
Additionally, eClerx has a centralized internal tool 
called “Fleetstar” to capture data of employees 
using company provided transport. The data 
from “Fleetstar” is used to calculate the distance 
and mode of transport (car/bus) which was 
provided by the Transport team.  
Further, distance-based methods have been 
used to estimate the emissions from employee 
commute using DEFRA and CEA emission 
factors.
	
●Category 8: Upstream Leased Assets.
Emission: 679 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: In the context of eClerx, this 
includes emissions form the leased office spaces 
outside India, since these are relatively smaller 
offices spaces with less than 10% of the overall 
headcount.
Electricity consumption for USA offices are 
estimated based on office area and climate zone 
wise per square foot consumption from US EPA 
commercial building consumption survey data. 
For France and Germany, electricity consumption 
taken 
from 
ODYSSEE-MURE 
database. 
For 
Bangkok office, OECD (2024): Clean Energy 
Finance and Investment Roadmap of Thailand 
report has been referred. (https://www.eia.gov/
consumption/commercial/data/2018/index.
php?view=consumption) 
Asset specific method based on floor space area 
and lease contracts shared by on-site POCs has 
been used to estimate the emissions. DEFRA and 
US EPA emission factors have been considered.
	
●Categories 9 to 15 are not applicable to eClerx 
since it is an IT enabled service organization and 
does not manufacture any physical products 
to be sold to consumers. Also, eClerx does not 
have any franchises nor has it invested in any 
company/asset that generates carbon emissions.
