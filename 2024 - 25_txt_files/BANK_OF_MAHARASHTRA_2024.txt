Data Privacy  
Risk  
The possibility of a data breach 
presents a significant risk to the 
exposure of our customers' 
personally identifiable information. 
This, in turn, could affect our 
business relationship with them, 
putting at stake the confidentiality, 
integrity, and security of sensitive 
customer data. Such a breach has 
the potential to erode trust and 
harm our reputation. 
BOM has a customer data privacy policy in place-  
https://bankofmaharashtra.in/privacy-policy.  
They are  ISO 27001:2005 certified as well. The ISO 27001 
certification is an endorsement of the Bank’s achieving its 
commitment to protect and safeguard the critical information in 
order to ensure secure banking operations by building the 
processes complying with the highest International standards. 
They have tested certain critical aspects of cyber security on 
network security management mechanism, operational security 
of key information infrastructure, data and client information 
management, monitoring and emergency management through

and comparing the required results. They have also assessed 
areas including password policies, security configuration, system 
interface controls over changes to applications and databases 
and that business users and controls to ensure that developers 
and production support did not have access to change 
applications, the operating systems or databases in the 
Negative: If a data breach 
occurs, the Bank would 
suffer negative 
consequences on its 
business operations, such as 
service disruptions, financial 
losses, reputation damage, 
and a loss of customer 
trust. Furthermore, these 
incidents would heighten 
the risk of regulatory 
scrutiny and potential 
penalties from regulatory 
authorities.

Business 
Continuity 
Risk 
The absence of business continuity 
or disaster management systems 
may lead to financial losses and 
disruptions in critical operations at 
the bank, including personnel, 
information, infrastructure, and 
facilities.  
BOM has assessed the requirement of the implementation of 
Business Continuity Plan initiated by the Bank due to impact of 
COVID-19 pandemic and ensured 
sustainability and growth under COVID -19 circumstances. 
Negative: Failing to respond 
effectively to contingencies 
can lead to financial losses 
and negative impacts on 
workforce productivity, as 
well as hinder the 
company's long-term 
growth plans. 
3 
Ethical 
Behaviour 
Risk 
The Bank is committed to upholding 
ethical standards, demonstrating its 
dedication to integrity in all 
transactions. By placing emphasis on 
ethical behaviour, the Bank not only 
seeks to retain its current clientele 
but also to draw in new customers. 
This commitment to ethical conduct 
builds trust, enhances relationships, 
and solidifies the Bank's image as a 
reputable and dependable financial 
entity. 
BOM's Code of Conduct sets forth the guiding principles on 
which the Bank shall operate and conduct its daily business with 
its multitudinous stakeholders, government and regulatory 
agencies, media and anyone else with whom it is connected. It 
recognises that the Bank is a trustee and custodian public money 
and in order to fulfill its fiduciary obligations and responsibilities, 
it has to maintain and continue to enjoy the trust and confidence 
of public at 
large. The Bank acknowledges the need to uphold the integrity 
of every transaction it enters into and 
believes that honesty and integrity in its internal conduct would 
be judged by its external behaviour. The Bank shall be 
committed in all its actions to the interest of the countries in 
which it operates. The Bank is conscious of the reputation it 
carries amongst its customers and public at large and shall 
endeavour to do all it can to sustain and improve upon the same 
in its discharge of obligations. The Bank shall continue to initiate 
policies, which are customer centric and which promote financial 
prudence.

Negative: Unethical conduct 
has the potential to directly 
harm the bank's reputation 
and diminish employee 
morale and productivity, 
thus impacting overall 
growth. By maintaining 
ethical standards and 
treating both customers and 
employees with integrity 
and respect, the bank 
fosters a positive workplace 
atmosphere and enhances 
customer relationships.

Systematic 
Risk 
Management 
Risk  
This guarantees financial stability, 
adherence to regulations, and 
safeguarding of stakeholders. It 
promotes uninterrupted business 
operations, reputation preservation, 
and enduring viability by proficiently 
identifying, evaluating, and 
addressing potential risks. These 
risks can originate from diverse 
factors such as financial, 
technological, or lending 
uncertainties. Such occurrences or 
series of events have the potential to 
compromise the overall system's 
stability. 
The Bank has put in place Risk Management Policies and 
Strategies which enables it to identify, measure, monitor and 
manage risk efficiently and establishes control systems in line 
with the Bank’s aggregate Risk Appetite. Bank has constituted 
Risk Management Committee at Board level to monitor the risk 
at Bank level in accordance with RBI Guidelines. Bank has also 
constituted sub-committees headed by Top Management of 
Bank. From a more operational perspective, it will also review 
the risk profile of the Bank and issue instructions/ guidelines to 
the concerned department (s) to better manage the risk. It also 
supervises and monitors the functioning of the Asset Liability 
Management (ALM) System in the Bank. The Bank is compliant 
to the RBI guidelines on disclosure requirements under Basel III 
Capital Regulations. 
Negative: Neglecting to 
address any unchecked risk 
that could escalate into a 
systemic threat could 
severely impact the Bank's 
performance. These risks 
endanger the stability and 
trustworthiness of the 
financial system, potentially 
causing disruptions, 
financial setbacks and harm 
to the reputation. 
5 
Financial 
Inclusion 
Opportunity 
Broadening financial inclusion 
extends access to banking services 
to marginalized and underprivileged 
communities, generating a positive 
societal impact and fostering 
broader economic development and 
stability. Enhanced business lending 
results in increased turnover and 
broader outreach. 
Bank is committed to the national agenda of ensuring financial 
inclusion of all Indians across the country by providing them 
access to banking products and services at their doorstep. 
During the year, the Bank and its subsidiary – Maharashtra 
Gramin Bank opened 10.85 lakh new Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan 
Yojana (PMJDY) accounts and met or exceeded all allocated 
targets. The Company is also diversifying its services by 
introducing additional business verticals of Corporate Direct 
Selling Agent, Corporate Business Correspondent and Recovery 
Agent services to be provided to Banks/ Financial Institution and 
will also give value addition in implementation of Govt. Security 
Schemes like PMJJBY, PMSBY, APY, SCSS, Sukanya Samriddhi 
Yojna, etc. after the approval from the RBI. Bank has been 
declared ‘Runner up’ under award category –‘Digital Financial 
Inclusion’ on 03.12.2022 during IBA Technology Awards 2022. 
Positive: Financial inclusion 
enhances the bank's 
profitability through 
customer base expansion, 
deposit growth, and product 
diversification, concurrently 
bolstering its reputation.  
Bank of Maharashtra is 
actively integrating 
Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) into its 
business strategies, 
focusing on areas like 
financial inclusion, 
renewable energy financing, 
and support for sustainable 
agriculture. The bank also 
supports state-sponsored 
programs aligned with 
SDGs, like MGNREGA, which 
promotes livelihood security. 
Bank of Maharashtra's 
approach aligns with the 
state's commitment to

Customer 
fairness and 
right-selling 
Risk 
The lack of customer-centric product 
offerings, value-added services, or 
unethical behaviour can erode trust 
and tarnish the bank's reputation. 
This highlights the importance of 
aligning products and services with 
customer needs, while maintaining 
ethical standards to preserve trust 
and safeguard the bank's image with 
stakeholders. 
BOM has a code of conduct for direct selling agents- 
https://bankofmaharashtra.in/writereaddata/documentlibrary/7fc
5e915-e019-462f-90bc-133ce7ef147a.pdf  
Negative: Mis-selling of 
products can detrimentally 
impact banks by causing 
reputational harm, legal 
repercussions, financial 
setbacks, customer loss, 
operational disturbances, 
and morale issues among 
employees. 
7 
Employee 
Benefits & 
Development 
Opportunity 
This increases efficiency, minimizes 
employee turnover, enhances 
capabilities and creativity within the 
bank, and promotes diversity, 
consequently enriching the customer 
experience. 
Defined Benefit Plans: All eligible employees are entitled to 
receive benefits under the Bank’s Gratuity, Pension & Privilege 
Leave schemes which are valued based on the principles laid 
down in AS -15, Employees Benefit (Revised) issued by Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. Bank’s liabilities towards 
defined benefit schemes are determined by way of provisions 
and adjusted on the basis of an actuarial valuation report 
provided by the Actuaries appointed by the bank and made at 
the end of each quarter/financial year. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognized in the Profit & Loss Account. Other Employee 
Benefits such as Leave Fare Concession, Silver jubilee Award, 
resettlement allowance, and retirement benefit are provided 
based on Actuarial valuation. 
Positive: A robust workforce 
characterized by heightened 
engagement, retention, and 
diversity brings forth fresh 
perspectives, varied 
experiences, and innovative 
ideas. This fosters 
performance enhancement 
and cultivates a positive 
organizational culture, 
showcasing the company's 
commitment to establishing 
an enabling work 
environment. 
8 
Regulatory & 
Legal 
Compliances 
Risk   
The risk of non-compliance exposes 
the bank to legal penalties and 
financial losses stemming from its 
failure to adhere to industry laws 
and regulations. Banks that prioritize 
compliance typically experience 
enhanced performance and 
improved process efficiency. 
Compliance offers assurance and 
offers investors a deeper 
The Code of Conduct for Board of Directors and Senior 
Management Personnel i.e. Core Management team comprising 
all General Managers of the Bank has been approved by the 
Board of Directors in compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. The said Code 
of Conduct is available on the Bank’s website 
https://bankofmaharashtra.in/policies. All the Board Members 
and Senior Management Personnel of Bank have affirmed the 
compliance of the code. 
Negative: Failure to comply 
would result in reputation 
damage, subsequently 
impacting business 
operations. Banks that 
adhere to regulatory laws 
have a greater capacity to 
manage risks and foster a 
culture of fairness and 
loyalty among employees.

GHG 
Emissions 
Management 
Opportunity 
Evaluating the environmental impact 
of the Bank's operations is a key 
priority. If these risks are not 
effectively managed, they could 
adversely affect operations and 
profitability. This also invites scrutiny 
from stakeholders/investors and 
shapes the public perception of the 
bank. 
As part of our ongoing efforts to adopt renewable energy, we 
installed 
solar panels at the Bank’s Head Office and Bank-owned 
premises. The Bank undertook multiple tree plantation drives at 
over 50 locations 
across the country. 
Positive: Managing the GHG 
emissions enables banks to 
mitigate risks and invest in 
low-carbon systems, 
thereby promoting 
sustainability and 
distinguishing themselves in 
the market. 
10 
ESG 
Oversight 
Opportunity 
Establishing effective ESG oversight 
at the board level will enhance the 
overall ESG performance and 
demonstrate the bank's dedication to 
incorporating responsible business 
practices into its growth strategy. 
Integrating ESG principles into 
business operations would enhance 
risk management, governance, 
accountability reporting, and 
decision-making processes. This 
integration would enhance the 
bank's capacity to identify and 
address risks and opportunities 
associated with environmental and 
social impacts, fostering trust and 
transparency among investors and 
stakeholders. 
 BoM's flagship sustainability initiative, MAHA GREEN PEHAL, 
focuses on reducing environmental impact through Paper 
Reduction, Single-Use Plastic Ban, Green Financing, E-Waste 
Management,  
BoM operates various Rural Development Centres, including 
Gramin Mahila Va Balak Vikas Mandal (GMVBM) 
Positive: Leadership 
oversight on the ESG 
strategy, action plan, and 
performance promotes a 
positive environmental and 
community impact. It also 
empowers the bank to

INFORMATION ON BRSR CORE IN BANK OF MAHARASHTRA 
To, 
The Board of Directors, 
BANK OF MAHARASHTRA 
Pune – Maharashtra, India 
 
We (“Kirtane and Pandit LLP” or “the firm”) have undertaken to perform a reasonable assurance 
engagement, for Bank of Maharashtra (“BOM” or “the Bank”) in respect of the agreed Sustainability 
Information, listed below (the “Identified Sustainability Information”) pertaining to Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report Core (“BRSR Core”), as notified by SEBI vide Circular dated 
12th July, 2023. This Sustainability Information is as included in the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (“BRSR” or “the report”) of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025. 
This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, 
environmental engineers and specialists. 
 
Identified Sustainability Information  
Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to 
our report. The reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General 
Disclosure of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the 
BRSR, where applicable 
 
 
Reporting Criteria 
 
• 
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is BRSR 
Core –  
• 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;  
• 
Framework issued by SEBI Circular dated 12th July, 2023. 
• 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities per 
Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/ CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024 (the “SEBI 
Master Circular”);  
• 
SEBI Press Release PR No.36/2024 dated December 18, 2024; z Industry Standards on 
Reporting of BRSR Core as per SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD- 1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated 
December 20, 2024; and 
• 
SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD - PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42 dated March 28, 2025. 
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 only 
unless otherwise stated and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods 
or any other elements included in the report and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
The Bank’s Management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
Sustainability Information on BRSR Core, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, 
related to reporting on the Sustainability Information, Identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in 
accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR (including BRSR Core) and the measurement 
of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
 
 
Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement 
techniques and can affect comparability between entities. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint, 
waste. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the 
uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
 
 
Our Independence and Quality Control 
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code 
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and have the required 
competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.

and Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services

standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  
 
Our Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability 
Information limited to BRSR Core listed in Annexure I, based on the procedures we have performed 
and evidence we have obtained. 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance 
Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, issued by the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This 
standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Identified Sustainability Information are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the Reporting Criteria. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of 
material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances. 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records. Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed
