1. 
 
GHG emission 
Risk 
The production of iron and steel, along 
with on-site fuel combustion, releases 
substantial amounts of carbon dioxide 
and methane into the atmosphere. 
However, 
advancements 
in 
steel 
manufacturing technology have led to a 
reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions per ton of steel produced. In 
response to climate change concerns, 
To 
effectively 
address 
these 
challenges, 
the 
company 
has 
implemented a range of strategies to 
reduce GHG-related risks. These 
include 
adopting 
energy-efficient 
technologies, 
transitioning 
to 
renewable 
energy 
sources, 
optimizing transportation logistics, 
promoting 
sustainable 
practices

among suppliers, investing in carbon 
offset 
initiatives, 
conducting 
comprehensive 
climate 
risk 
assessments, 
and 
maintaining 
transparent 
communication 
with 
stakeholders. Through these efforts, 
the 
company 
has 
successfully 
minimized its environmental impact 
and 
strengthened 
its 
resilience 
against climate-related risks. 
2.  
Air risk quality 
Risk 
Air quality is identified as a critical 
concern due to its significant impact on 
both 
health 
and 
operational 
performance. Poor air quality can lead to 
serious health issues affecting not only 
the local community but also the 
workforce. These health challenges can, 
in turn, influence business operations 
through increased healthcare costs, 
reduced productivity, and potential legal 
liabilities. 
To address the risks associated with 
air quality, our company adopts a 
proactive 
approach 
focused 
on 
prevention 
and 
continuous 
improvement. We aim to reduce 
emissions by implementing advanced 
technologies, optimizing operational 
processes, and monitoring air quality 
in real-time. Our strategy also 
includes collaborating with local 
communities 
and

experts, transitioning to renewable 
energy 
sources, 
investing 
in 
sustainable infrastructure, ensuring 
compliance 
with 
environmental 
regulations, and providing education 
and training for employees. Through 
this comprehensive approach, we 
demonstrate our commitment to 
mitigating air quality risks and 
promoting 
a 
cleaner, 
healthier 
environment for all. 
3.  
Waste & risk 
hazardous 
materials 
management 
Risk 
The 
management 
of 
waste 
and 
hazardous materials is recognized as a 
critical risk due to its potential to harm 
the environment, create legal liabilities, 
damage 
reputations, 
and 
disrupt 
business operations. Inefficient waste 
management can lead to pollution, 
regulatory challenges, and health risks, 
all of which can significantly impact both 
environmental 
sustainability 
and 
organizational performance. 
To address these risks, the company 
takes a proactive and comprehensive 
approach to managing hazardous 
waste. Our focus is on reducing waste 
generation and ensuring the safe, 
responsible disposal of hazardous 
materials in strict adherence to 
regulatory requirements. We also 
promote recycling initiatives, utilize 
advanced technologies, and provide

thorough training for employees to 
support these practices. 
Furthermore, we have established 
robust 
emergency 
response 
protocols and work closely with our 
suppliers to enhance preparedness 
and uphold ethical standards. Regular 
audits are conducted to ensure 
compliance 
and 
continuous 
improvement, 
reinforcing 
our 
commitment 
to 
building 
and 
maintaining 
stakeholder 
trust. 
Through 
this 
multidimensional 
strategy, we aim to minimize risks, 
foster sustainability, and protect both 
the environment and the communities 
in which we operate.

encompasses several key areas, such as

depth training programs, clear and 
standardized procedures, ergonomic 
workplace designs, proper handling of 
hazardous 
materials, 
emergency 
preparedness, wellness and health 
initiatives, continuous monitoring, and 
more. Through these measures, we

Yes, the company carefully monitors its water management practices. Independent 
assessment in conducted by Dwece Management Private Limited, an external agency 
authorized by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA). The agreement with Dwece 
Management Private Limited ensures that the company’s water management processes are 
closely monitored and are in adherence with the regulatory compliance.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide 
details of its coverage and implementation.  
Yes, the company has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system in three of its 
operational units. In the remaining three units, treated wastewater is responsibly 
discharged into industrial drainage systems, strictly adhering to regulatory norms. This 
reflects the company’s commitment to responsible water management and sustainable 
environmental practices. 
The wastewater treatment process is comprehensive and multi-stage, incorporating 
advanced technologies to ensure efficient effluent management. The process begins with 
primary settling in a septic tank, followed by flow equalization. Biological treatment is 
then carried out using a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR), which enables efficient 
degradation of organic matter through aeration. Clarification occurs in a decanting tank, 
and further filtration is conducted through multi-grade and activated carbon filters to 
remove suspended solids, colour, and odour. The treated water is collected in a 
dedicated storage tank and reused for non-potable purposes like gardening and toilet 
flushing. 
A parallel treatment stream includes pH adjustment in a neutralization tank using lime, 
after which the effluent is sent to a filter press for sludge dewatering. The resulting solid 
sludge is securely packed in High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bags and stored in a 
designated solid waste area. The filtrate from the dewatering process is further treated 
through a pressure sand filter, activated carbon filter, micron filtration, and finally 
reverse osmosis (RO) for desalination. The RO reject is managed using a multiple-effect 
evaporator (MEE), which reduces waste volume by concentrating the brine and 
recovering water through evaporation.

The Company has a comprehensive business continuity and disaster management plan 
with defined protocols and responsibilities. Employees are trained to respond to fire 
incidents by using CO₂, ABC, or foam extinguishers, activating hydrant systems if needed, 
and informing EHS, Security, and external agencies. Flood preparedness includes 
maintaining drainage systems and testing dewatering pumps, while during storms 
access is restricted, and staff remain indoors. Earthquake measures involve activating 
the control room, ensuring communication, and post-event inspections. In civil unrest, 
entry points are secured and authorities informed. Responsibilities are assigned to 
Security, EHS, and Admin teams, ensuring swift, safe, and effective response.
