Performance of the Company against the specific 
commitments, goals and targets along with reasons, 
in case the same are not met.
ARE&M has continued significant progress in its sustainability initiatives*:
Renewable Energy: The Company has increased its reliance on renewable 
energy sources, such as solar power. Currently, renewable energy accounts for 
26.91% of the overall energy mix.
Energy Conservation: The Company’s energy conservation measures have 
led to a 6.57% decrease in energy intensity.
Carbon Emissions: There has been 8.27% decrease in emission intensity.
Recycled Lead Usage: The Company has used recycled lead for 85.32% of all 
lead consumed, leading to avoided abiotic depletion.
Recycled Polypropylene Copolymer usage: The Company has used recycled 
Polypropylene Copolymer for 11.35% of all Polypropylene Copolymer 
consumed.
Battery recycling collection rate: Overall EPR liability as defined under 
BWMR, 2022 has been met.
Waste Intensity: Waste intensity has been reduced by 10.72%.
Water Conservation: Zero Liquid Discharge systems have been commissioned 
at all facilities, leading to an increase in the effluent recycling rate and a 
reduction in freshwater consumption. Rainwater harvesting structures have 
been developed for the collection and usage of rainwater as an alternative 
source, replacing freshwater withdrawn from surface and ground sources. 
Due to these initiatives, water intensity has decreased by 18.34% and achieved 
Water Positivity of 11.94.
Safety & Occupational Health: ARE&M has maintained its status as a 
zero-fatality organization throughout the year. The Company has initiated 
Behaviour Based Safety (BBS) programme and quarterly assessment of critical 
risks. Due to these initiatives the LTIFR has reduced from 0.93 in FY 2023-24 
to 0.40 in FY 2024-25.
Diversity: The gender diversity at ARE&M currently stands at 11.59%. 
Diversity targets are included in the business score cards and KRAs of Key 
Leaders. Organization vide sensitization workshops have been conducted.
Community Projects: Completed the Construction of accommodation hall for 
NCC boy’s cadets, Veterinary hospital, milk collection center and Deployment 
of Smart Classrooms in schools.
(*Targets for FY 2024-25 were established excluding sustainability data of 
Battery Component division which was acquired in February 2024. Hence, 
Performance against targets mentioned above have been measured by 
excluding sustainability data of Battery Component division.)

In FY2025, we made strong progress across key pillars of our sustainability roadmap:
 
 
We remain committed to our Net Zero Plan, targeting a 30% absolute reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions by FY 2026-27 
(baseline: FY 2021-22). So far, we’ve achieved a 19% reduction in absolute emissions and a 43% reduction in emission 
intensity. Our renewable energy capacity stands at 67 MW, accounting for over 25% of our energy use. While process 
changes and the upcoming TBD plant may temporarily impact emissions, we continue to drive energy efficiency and 
expand RE sourcing to stay on track.
 
 
On water, we achieved 12x water positivity during the year through a combination of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
systems, rainwater harvesting reservoirs, and community water restoration efforts such as check dams and ponds. We 
also achieved a 28% reduction in absolute water consumption and a 60% reduction in water intensity, compared to the 
FY 2021-22 baseline.
 
 
Our commitment to circularity is reflected in Amara Raja Circular Solutions, which now operates India’s largest greenfield 
lead-acid battery recycling plant with eventual capacity of 1.5 LTPA. We currently recycle 94% of our manufacturing waste, 
and over 85% of our key raw materials (lead and alloys) come from recycled sources. We’ve reduced waste intensity by 
34% over FY 2021-22, and by FY 2026-27, we aim to become a zero landfill organization, enabled by paddle dryers for ETP 
sludge and MEE salts, and co-processing of other residual waste.
 
 
We are integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into both new and existing products, with a goal to cover 50% of all SKUs 
during the year.
 
 
Our supplier engagement programme included on-site sustainability assessments at 18 critical supplier locations, 
capability-building sessions, and a Supplier Summit to share best practices and recognise top performers.
 
 
We’ve repositioned Occupational Health as a strategic pillar, with the launch of the Personal Vitality Program—a data-
driven approach to monitor employee health and proactively promote active lifestyles and preventive interventions so our 
people can live healthier and get more from life.
 
 
We continue to maintain zero fatalities and have achieved a 49% reduction in LTIFR over FY 2021-22. Over 3,900 employees 
across the group have been trained in Defensive Driving Techniques (DDT). Safety performance is now reviewed quarterly 
and integrated into the Sustainability Index, which feeds into our Balanced Scorecard.
 
 
On governance, we are aligning with ISO 27001 for information security and are rolling out the Amara Raja Group 
Sustainability Framework to harmonise ESG implementation across all group companies.
Our efforts have earned external recognition:
 
 
CDP ‘B’ Rating for Climate Action
 
 
S&P CSA score improved from 28 to 74 – ranked #1 in India, #2 in Asia Pacific, #6 globally in our sector
 
 
NSE ESG rating of 69, ahead of several peers and customers
 
 
Awards include the ICAI Sustainability Reporting Award, FE Green Sarathi for Climate Leadership, CII CAP 2.0° Resilience 
Award, and the Arogya World Platinum Healthy Workplace Award
As we look ahead, our focus is on decoupling growth from emissions, strengthening safety performance, especially in off-work 
and road safety, advancing Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI), embedding best sustainability practices across subsidiaries, and 
expanding sustainability integration into our supplier ecosystem and franchisee networks.
We remain committed to accelerating impact, building resilience, and creating long-term value for our business, people, and 
the planet.

vulnerable communities in proximity to its operational 
facilities. Regular on-site discussions are conducted by CSR 
personnel to feedback and suggestions on community-
related issues, which are promptly addressed. These 
initiatives are spearheaded by the Rajanna Foundation 
and encompass the following areas:
	
Primary Health: ARE&M’s CSR is committed to 
providing access to healthcare for vulnerable sections 
of society who lack the resources for quality healthcare. 
It extends primary healthcare services to nearly 20,000 
individuals, including children, women, senior citizens, and

Centre (ARDC), established in 2014, has a dedicated team 
that works with the youth, particularly in rural areas, to 
enhance their skills and provide them with non-migratory 
employment opportunities. Currently, a total of 1724 
students are receiving on-the-job training through this 
skill development programme.

vegetation regeneration through social forestry schemes. 
Social forestry encourages forest expansion, which can 
be utilised by tribal and forest-dependent people for 
harvesting forest produce, a daily necessity for these 
vulnerable sections.

its active participation in 11 trade and industry chambers or associations. Among these, eight operate at the national level, one 
at the state level, and two have an international presence. These affiliations enable the company to contribute meaningfully to 
policy discussions relevant to energy storage and other domains critical to its operations.
The industry bodies with which ARE&M is associated include the Indian Battery Manufacturing Association, the Auto 
Component Manufacturers Association, and the Recycling and Environment Association of India. At the national level, the 
company is engaged with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), while its global engagements include associations such 
as the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Additionally, ARE&M maintains direct interactions with statutory authorities to engage in regulatory policymaking processes.
