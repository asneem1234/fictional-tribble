1.
Products 
Quality and 
Safety
Risk &  
Opportunity
Product safety and quality pose 
risks to Nykaa due to the need 
for stringent quality control over 
ingredients and products sourced 
from 
third-party 
suppliers, 
as 
any lapse can lead to regulatory 
penalties and loss of consumer 
trust. 
Conversely, 
maintaining 
rigorous quality assurance enables 
Nykaa to build a reputation as a 
reliable platform offering genuine, 
high-quality 
products, 
thereby 
strengthening customer confidence 
and loyalty.
Nykaa mitigates product safety and 
quality risks through ethically sourced 
ingredients, environmentally friendly 
formulations, and rigorous safety 
testing 
throughout 
development. 
All products also undergo annual 
safety testing. The Company follows 
low carbon footprint manufacturing 
practices 
aligned 
with 
Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and 
uses 
eco-conscious 
packaging. 
Extensive consumer testing ensures

suppliers maintain strict standards. 
These measures collectively uphold 
Nykaa’s commitment to delivering 
safe, 
reliable, 
and 
high-quality 
products.
2.
Talent 
Attraction & 
Retention
Risk & 
Opportunity
While high attrition and competitive 
hiring dynamics present challenges 
in attracting and retaining skilled 
talent, 
Nykaa 
counters 
these 
pressures 
through 
focused 
employee 
development, 
robust 
engagement 
initiatives, 
and 
a 
compelling 
employer 
brand. 
These efforts collectively foster 
a 
motivated, 
high-performing 
workforce that is aligned to the 
Company’s values and instrumental 
in driving sustained growth.
At Nykaa, we adopt a strategic 
and consistent approach to talent 
acquisition, focusing on experienced 
professionals 
across 
critical 
domains - including product design, 
technology, sales, digital marketing, 
brand management, omni-channel 
retail, customer experience, supply 
chain, 
operations, 
and 
corporate 
functions. We actively strengthen our 
senior management by onboarding 
key market leaders, bolstering our 
leadership depth and capability. This 
deliberate focus on high-calibre talent 
enables us to stay competitive, foster 
innovation, and uphold operational 
excellence, thereby supporting our 
long-term growth aspirations.
Negative & 
Positive
3.
Responsible 
Marketing 
& Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risks arise from potential service 
failures, misleading claims, and the 
need to comply with regulations 
such as ASCI advertising guidelines, 
the 
Consumer 
Protection 
Act, 
etc. 
However, 
they 
also 
offer 
opportunities to build trust, deepen 
customer 
relationships, 
and 
strengthen brand loyalty through 
transparent 
communication, 
personalised 
experiences, 
and 
responsive service.
Nykaa has adopted a diversified 
360-degree marketing strategy that 
reduces dependence on any single 
channel 
and 
ensures 
compliance 
with industry labelling standards. The 
platform’s extensive product rating 
and review system enables transparent 
consumer 
feedback, 
while 
our 
grievance mechanism systematically 
tracks 
and 
analyses 
customer 
complaints and satisfaction surveys. 
By continuously monitoring product 
reviews and post-resolution feedback, 
we identify areas for improvement to 
better meet customer expectations.
Negative & 
Positive
4.
Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk & 
Opportunity
Nykaa’s supply chain faces risks 
from disruptions due to geopolitical 
events, 
extreme 
weather, 
infrastructure failures, and the 
growing demand for sustainable 
practices. These risks can impact 
revenue, customer satisfaction, and 
brand reputation. On the other hand, 
sustainable sourcing and a resilient 
supply chain present opportunities 
to reduce environmental impact, 
strengthen ESG performance, build 
partnerships with ethical suppliers 
and investors, and enhance overall 
brand value.
The 
Company 
operates 
a 
decentralised supply chain strategy 
focused 
on 
localised 
fulfilment, 
which 
optimises 
shipment 
costs, 
inventory management, and reduces 
environmental impact. Nykaa supports 
social 
responsibility 
by 
procuring 
packaging from small and medium-
scale enterprises, fostering the MSME 
ecosystem. 
Furthermore, 
Nykaa 
endeavours to either recommend or 
contractually impose compliance with 
human rights standards by its business 
partners and suppliers, including child 
labour, forced labour, harassment 
prevention, and
non-discriminatory 
employment 
practices, thereby working towards 
the strengthening of supply chain
resilience and ethical integrity.

Data Privacy, 
Digitisation

Innovation
Risk
Data 
privacy 
and 
fraud 
risks 
threaten Nykaa due to its role as 
an e-commerce platform handling 
sensitive customer data, potentially 
leading to financial losses, legal 
penalties, and a loss of consumer 
trust if breaches occur.
Nykaa employs advanced cybersecurity 
technologies, 
conducting 
regular 
internal and third-party IT system 
assessments, and working towards 
ISO 
27001 
certification. 
The 
Company closely monitors high-risk 
activities, evaluates sellers based on 
transactional histories, and enforces 
restrictions 
when 
necessary 
to 
prevent fraud. Additionally, Nykaa 
fosters a culture of security through 
Company-wide awareness sessions, 
ensuring best practices are upheld to 
protect customer data and enhance 
overall satisfaction.

6.
Climate 
Change, GHG 
Emissions 
and Energy 
Efficiency
Risk & 
Opportunity
Extreme weather events due to 
climate change have the potential to 
disrupt operations, while regulations 
relating to emissions management 
can 
add 
to 
the 
Company’s 
operating costs. Improving energy 
efficiency provides an opportunity 
to adopt advanced AI-driven tools 
for inventory management and 
automation, which can contribute 
to improving customer experience 
via reduced delivery times and 
enable the Company to optimise 
logistics costs.
The Company is integrating renewable 
energy sources at its facilities. We are 
also consistently striving to improve 
our operational and energy efficiency.
Negative & 
Positive
7.
Packaging 
and Waste 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Packaging and waste management 
pose a risk to Nykaa due to regulatory 
requirements 
environmental 
impact, and potential damage to 
brand reputation from excessive 
or 
non-sustainable 
packaging. 
At the same time, it presents an 
opportunity for Nykaa to lead in 
sustainability by adopting eco-
friendly 
packaging, 
optimising 
logistics, and engaging consumers 
in recycling initiatives, thereby 
enhancing operational efficiency 
and strengthening customer loyalty.
Nykaa incorporates recycled plastics 
in 
tertiary 
packaging 
used 
for 
e-Commerce delivery and sources 
packaging materials from eco-friendly 
suppliers. All of our e-Commerce 
packaging is composed of recycled 
plastics and paper. We ensure proper 
recycling of an equivalent quantity of 
the plastic waste generated via CPCB 
registered recyclers and have been 
compliant with EPR regulations since 
2021. We have further launched 
initiatives to reduce the amount of 
waste we generate, such as reduction 
in the amount of BOPP tape used 
for packaging.

shape and enhance the Nykaa 10x10 platform, strengthening our overall ESG strategy through deeper cross-functional engagement and alignment with evolving business 
priorities.
A critical part of this journey has been improving the quality and granularity of our data. This year, we made significant progress in establishing standardised measurement 
systems across locations - for instance, installing water meters at most of our operational sites has allowed us to shift from estimated to actual water consumption. Similarly, 
we have expanded our tracking of different waste streams, including paper and wood waste, which will support better monitoring and targeted reduction efforts going 
forward.
We also continue to advance waste management across our operations. In FY25, we recycled over 159.73 tonnes of plastic across locations and re-used 17.23 tonnes of 
carton waste within our Owned Brand warehouses and superstores. Our approach to packaging remains firmly rooted in sustainability, with a consistent preference for Eco-
friendly materials wherever feasible.
Recognising the importance of extending our ESG focus beyond our operations, we have adopted a Sustainable Sourcing Policy along with a Supplier Code of Conduct, both 
of which signal our commitment to responsible practices throughout our value chain. In parallel, we are also working towards ISO 27001 certification as we strengthen our 
information security and governance standards. Our shift towards cleaner energy is underway, with renewable energy expected to be operationalised at multiple warehouses  
in FY 26. 
Nykaa continues to strengthen internal people-centric initiatives through ongoing investments in employee engagement, leadership development, and inclusive workplace 
practices. On the community front, we deepened our social impact through targeted CSR programmes. We supported 4000+ students through the STEM SPARK Programme 
with the American India Foundation and enabled vocational training for young women in partnership with the Delhi Council for Child Welfare. We also continued our 
longstanding partnerships with the Indian Deaf Cricket Association and SlumSoccer, empowering young athletes from marginalised communities with opportunities for skill 
development, confidence building, and inclusion through sport.
Together, these initiatives reflect our steady and deliberate progress towards building a more sustainable and responsible business.

environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities. ESG considerations are becoming an integral part of our operational approach, informing decision-making processes and contributing to our 
evolving definition of long-term business success.
 
Over the past year, we have taken important steps to build the internal infrastructure needed to embed ESG more deeply into our operations. This has included setting up data collection processes 
across multiple locations, conducting internal assessments to identify material issues, and initiating goal-setting exercises in consultation with relevant functions. 
 
We also continue to invest in responsible practices across our value chain - from sustainable sourcing and waste management to employee engagement and workplace inclusion. While we are still 
at an early stage in our ESG journey, we are laying a strong foundation for consistent and transparent performance tracking in the years to come.
 
As we move forward, our focus remains on driving improvement through structured initiatives, meaningful stakeholder engagement, and targeted investments. We remain committed to building 
a sustainable business that creates long-term value for our shareholders, employees, customers, and the broader community.

and performance monitoring. ESG criteria are embedded into supplier onboarding and selection processes and business 
partners are required to adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct. Evaluations will be conducted using a Sustainable Supply 
Chain Questionnaire, and assessments on critical partners will be undertaken to ensure alignment with the Company’s

minimise environmental impact. Product formulations are developed with eco-friendliness in mind, while production follows Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and incorporates low-carbon footprint methods. This commitment extends to packaging, where 
environment friendly materials are prioritised to support sustainability goals.
Ensuring product safety and quality is paramount at Nykaa. All products undergo rigorous safety testing to meet strict regulatory 
standards, alongside extensive consumer testing to guarantee a positive user experience before launch. Social responsibility is 
further reflected in Nykaa’s wide range of offerings that exclude parabens and mineral oils, adhere to cruelty-free practices, and 
include many vegan and naturally derived products. This comprehensive dedication to ethical sourcing and sustainable development 
highlights Nykaa’s commitment to the wellbeing of both society and the environment.

10. Health and safety management system:
 
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
 
 
Yes, Nykaa has implemented a comprehensive occupational health and safety management system that covers all its 
operations, including workplaces, warehouses, logistics, and related activities. This system is founded on a robust Health, 
Safety, and Environment (HSE) Policy that prioritises the health and safety of employees, customers, business partners, 
suppliers, and visitors.
 
 
The management system emphasises proactive risk management by continuously identifying and mitigating potential 
safety and environmental hazards. Regular evaluations and benchmarking against industry standards ensure ongoing 
improvement. Incident response procedures are well-established to enable effective reporting, investigation, and learning 
from safety incidents, preventing recurrence.
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Corporate Overview
 |  223
 
 
Continuous improvement is embedded in the culture 
through regular audits, enhancement programmes, 
and active employee engagement in safety initiatives. 
Comprehensive 
training 
and 
communication 
programmes equip employees with the necessary 
knowledge and skills to comply with policies and best 
practices, while lessons learned from past incidents 
are shared company-wide.
 
 
Nykaa maintains and upgrades its HSE systems across 
all facilities, with Emergency Response Teams (ERTs) 
established in every warehouse. These teams conduct 
bi-monthly inspections and lead emergency evacuation 
drills, supported by multiple training sessions 
throughout the year to reinforce safety awareness.
 
 
To ensure compliance with safety regulations, regular 
HSE & electrical safety audits are conducted at all 
locations, with recent audits confirming adherence 
to electrical and general safety standards. Additional 
safety measures include weekly training sessions on 
16 critical HSE topics across all warehouses, safety 
incident case study discussions, and a monthly review 
meeting with all relevant stakeholders to monitor HSE 
progress and provide support.
 
 
In this year, our HSE management has been 
strengthened by the institution of safety inductions 
for all new contract workers in our warehouses. 
Programmes addressing behavioural aspects of 
safety are planned for implementation in the future. 
Microlearning videos, fire safety mock drills in all 
warehouses, customised safety posters in critical 
areas, and weekly safety awareness sessions are 
some other initiatives undertaken to enhance our 
safety culture. Standardised guidelines for carrying 
out HSE related trainings have also been developed, 
leading to an increase in training coverage. We are 
further planning to carry out activity-based Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), framing 
corrective and preventive actions (CAPA), and preparing 
emergency evacuation plans across warehouses.
 
 
There have been zero major safety incidents in the 
current financial year.
 
b. 
What are the processes used to identify 
work-related hazards and assess risks 
on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity?
 
 
The Company is dedicated to ensuring a safe and 
secure work environment for all employees. Due to 
the nature of our operations, the risk of exposure to 
hazardous materials remains minimal. There were no 
significant incidents or workplace accidents reported 
throughout the year. By monitoring workplace incidents 
on a monthly basis, we are able to quickly identify and 
address potential hazards.
 
 
Understanding the importance of proactive safety 
initiatives, Nykaa remains committed to continually 
enhancing workplace safety and implementing further 
improvements in this area.
 
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers 
to report the work-related hazards and to 
remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
 
 
Nykaa is committed to promoting a culture of safety 
and transparent communication throughout the 
organisation. To support this goal, we have established a 
robust incident reporting system that operates across 
all our workplaces.
 
 
At each site, a dedicated Health, Safety, and 
Environment (HSE) Single Point of Contact (SPOC) 
is assigned. Employees are encouraged to promptly 
report any incidents, including near misses or unsafe 
conditions, directly to their designated HSE SPOC. 
These SPOCs play a key role in the process by:
•	
Receiving and recording all incident reports
•	
Leading investigations into reported issues
•	
Implementing corrective measures to address 
hazards and prevent recurrence.
 
 
To promote awareness of this reporting process, regular 
training sessions are held for all staff. Additionally, 
QR codes are displayed throughout our workplaces 
enabling employees to quickly report near misses, 
unsafe conditions and unsafe act using their mobile 
devices. This comprehensive strategy empowers our 
workforce to take an active role in sustaining a safe 
and healthy workplace environment.
 
d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity 
have access to non-occupational medical 
and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
 
 
Yes, although Nykaa does not operate an on-site 
healthcare centre due to the non-hazardous nature of 
its business activities, first-aid kits are easily accessible 
in all workplace areas. Additionally, the Company has 
arranged a partnership with a medical professional to 
ensure employees can access necessary healthcare 
services whenever required. During this year, a new 
employee wellness programme has been launched. It 
offers discounted gym memberships, onsite well-being 
programmes, and unlimited teleconsultations with 
doctors across 32+ specialties for employees and their 
immediate families. Other benefits include diet and 
therapist consultations, in-person counsellor visits to 
all offices, discounted in-clinic visits and health tests, 
24/7 helpline support, and access to wellness content 
like videos and events-all designed for convenient, 
accessible holistic employee wellness management.
