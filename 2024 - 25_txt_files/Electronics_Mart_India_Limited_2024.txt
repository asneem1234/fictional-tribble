BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practise of companies disclosing 
information about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial 
reporting to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and 
contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social 
responsibility, and governance practises, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.

The energy consumption in stores and

At our company, energy efficiency is

multiple initiatives to reduce overall

sources to power our operations, thereby 
contributing positively to environmental 
sustainability.

enhanced transparency and sustainability, 
we have expanded our core policies to 
cover the entire value chain. This approach 
ensures that all partners and suppliers align

network. Through collaborative efforts, 
we strive to reduce environmental impact,

Occupational

safety
Occupational health and safety risks in retail

Employee safety remains our highest 
priority. We perform regular internal audits 
to proactively identify and mitigate potential 
occupational 
risks. 
These 
thorough 
evaluations enable us to address critical 
hazards before they affect our workforce. 
This preventive strategy has effectively 
reduced the incidence of work-related 
injuries and illnesses. By emphasising 
consistent internal audits, we continuously 
enhance workplace safety and reaffirm our 
commitment to employee well-being.

Data 
Management 
and Cyber 
security
The handling of vast customer data, 
including sensitive personal and payment 
information, means that any data breach 
could have severe consequences, including 
financial loss, legal penalties, and damage to 
reputation. Furthermore, failure to uphold 
privacy standards can erode customer trust, 
leading to potential loss of business and 
affecting the Company's long-term viability.
Our approach to privacy protection and 
data security is comprehensive and multi-
layered. We have established a robust IT 
policy that governs every stage of the 
data lifecycle, from acquisition and use to 
storage and disposal, ensuring protection 
at all levels. Our ‘Defence in Depth’ 
strategy implements multiple security layers 
to strengthen our overall defenses. We 
prioritise the security of both employee and 
customer data by training staff on safe data 
handling practises and utilising advanced 
encryption 
technologies. 
Additionally, 
we adhere strictly to all applicable local 
and international data privacy laws and 
regulations to uphold the highest standards 
of data security.

Specific commitments, goals and targets set by the 
entity with defined timelines, if any.
The Company has taken a structured approach to integrating Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) factors by implementing key policies, including 
the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) Policy, the 
Suppliers' Code of Conduct, and a comprehensive Waste Management Policy. 
These policies demonstrate the Company’s long-term commitment to 
responsible and sustainable business practises. To manage and guide these 
efforts, the Company  has set up an Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) Committee made up of two independent directors.
The Committee has conducted a thorough review of the Company’s ESG 
practises and has identified important areas to focus on, such as managing a 
sustainable supply chain, conducting materiality assessments, and providing 
ESG-related training for employees.
In line with its sustainability goals, the Company 
has set and achieved the following specific objectives:
•	
Ensuring suppliers comply with the Suppliers' Code of Conduct,
•	
Providing annual ESG training for employees on principles and regulatory 
requirements,
•	
Raising awareness about IT phishing and potential security risks.
The Company is continually working to align its internal processes and operations 
with global ESG best practises. The ESG Committee regularly reviews and 
suggests improvements to reduce environmental impact and increase resource 
efficiency. These actions are part of the Company’s broader goal to contribute 
to national and global sustainability efforts.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of  interests involving members of  the Board? 
(Yes/No) 	
	
Yes
	
If Yes, provide details of the same.
Our Board is comprised of a 
substantial number of independent 
directors who provide objective 
perspectives and unbiased oversight 
of the Company’s operations. These 
directors are empowered to question 
decisions made by the Chair or senior 
executives when necessary, ensuring 
that decisions are made with the 
Company’s best interests in mind.
We have clearly defined the roles 
and responsibilities of the Chair 
and senior executives, which are 
documented in official company 
records. This ensures transparency 
and prevents any overlap in 
functions that could lead to conflicts.
Independent Board members regularly 
evaluate the performance of the Chair/
Managing Director. These evaluations 
assess both their effectiveness in their 
executive roles and their commitment 
to upholding strong governance 
practises.
Independent Board Members:
Clear Role Definitions:
Regular Evaluations:
All Directors are required to disclose 
their interests in other entities using 
Form MBP-1 under the Companies 
Act, 2013, and to promptly inform the 
Company of any changes, ensuring 
transparency at all times.
Board members and senior 
management are required to submit 
annual declarations confirming their 
compliance with the Company’s 
Code of Conduct, affirming that 
there are no undisclosed conflicts of 
interest.
Directors who have a potential or 
actual conflict of interest are required 
to recuse themselves from relevant 
discussions or decisions where their 
impartiality could be affected. These 
recusals are recorded in the meeting 
minutes for full transparency.
Mandatory Declarations: 
Annual Affirmations: 
Recusal from Discussions and 
Decisions:
EMIL has established various 
Board Committees to oversee key 
governance and operational areas, as 
outlined in their terms of reference. 
For example:
•	
The Audit Committee 
monitors related party 
transactions and any situations 
that could result in a conflict 
of interest.
•	
The Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee 
(NRC) ensures that 
all appointments and 
compensation decisions are fair 
and impartial.
•	
The Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee 
(CSR) manages and executes 
the Company’s CSR initiatives.
EMIL has formalised policies for 
Related Party Transactions and Conflict 
of Interest Guidelines, offering a 
structured approach to the approval, 
documentation, and resolution of any 
potential conflicts.

At EMIL, open communication is a fundamental aspect of our company culture. We 
encourage employees to feel comfortable raising and discussing any concerns they may 
have, whether directly with their supervisors, relevant department heads, or the Human 
Resources department.
To ensure accessibility and accommodate diverse communication preferences, we offer 
multiple channels for reporting grievances. Employees can opt for a direct conversation 
with their supervisor or department head, promoting a more personal approach. 
Alternatively, the Human Resources department is available to address any concerns via 
multiple platforms, including a web link or email, offering flexibility in communication.
We have dedicated email addresses for both general HR inquiries (http://
electronicsmartindia.net/add-grievance) 
and 
compliance-related 
concerns 
(hr.
compliance@bajajelectronics.in). By providing these accessible communication 
channels, we aim to foster a safe and supportive environment where employee concerns 
can be addressed effectively.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of  the entity.
	
At EMIL, we follow a structured approach to identify and prioritizise our key stakeholders. This process is essential for fostering long-
term trust, ensuring compliance with legal requirements, and advancing our sustainability objectives.
	
We begin by mapping stakeholders based on their impact from and influence on our business. Our primary stakeholders include 
customers, employees, investors, suppliers, communities, and online platforms.
	
As a retail-driven company, our customers are our top priority. We actively gather feedback through point-of-sale systems, online 
reviews, and CRM analytics to better understand their needs and enhance our services.
	
Internal teams, including HR, Operations, Compliance, and Customer Service, collaborate to ensure that we address the concerns of all 
relevant stakeholder groups. We also adhere to guidelines set by regulatory bodies such as SEBI and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
(MCA).
	
As we grow and adapt to new regulations, customer needs, and community expectations, we continuously update our stakeholder list to 
ensure we remain aligned with evolving priorities.
	
This organised and flexible process enables EMIL to effectively engage with stakeholders, respond proactively to their concerns, and 
maintain responsible, sustainable business practises.
(This principle highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement. Companies should consider the interests and perspectives of all 
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate. They should also be responsive 
to stakeholder concerns and feedback.)

driven organisation. The Committee understands that strong ESG performance adds long-term value and demonstrates EMIL’s 
commitment to responsible growth, governance, and inclusive decision-making.
	
The ESG Committee is tasked with regularly monitoring and reviewing key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, 
ensuring that the Company stays aligned with changes in the business environment. It integrates ESG factors into the Company’s 
strategic decision-making and reports these matters to the Board.
	
The Board maintains direct engagement with stakeholders, particularly investors, through regular quarterly meetings, both one-on-
one and in group settings. These meetings provide a forum to discuss the Ccompany’s economic performance, ESG objectives, and 
governance practises.
	
For broader stakeholder groups such as employees, suppliers, customers, and communities’ management teams or the CSR 
Committee conduct consultations. Feedback gathered from surveys, community engagements, and other channels is documented 
and reported to both the ESG and CSR Committees. These committees review the information and share relevant findings with the 
Board, ensuring stakeholder concerns and expectations are considered in decision-making.
	
The CSR Committee also identifies key areas for social development through stakeholder consultations and proposes CSR initiatives 
aligned with the approved CSR budget.

feedback, and embeds economic, environmental, and social factors into its long-term strategy.

during quarterly meetings, the Company improved its reporting practises and periodic disclosures. 
	
Customer feedback, gathered through various channels, plays a vital role in enhancing customer satisfaction and driving operational 
improvements.
	
Through community consultations led by the CSR Committee, EMIL identified a need for digital literacy and vocational training in 
underserved regions, with a focus on promoting health and well-being. This insight led to the launch of targeted CSR programmes 
focused on skill development, education, and healthcare.
	
Employee suggestions, collected through structured engagement channels like surveys and feedback sessions, contributed to the 
strengthening of workplace safety measures and the introduction of well-being programmes, further reinforcing our commitment to a 
supportive and inclusive work environment.
	
All of these inputs are reviewed by the relevant Committees and designated employees, then reported to the Board, ensuring that

thereby reducing the need for bottled water 
consumption.
The implementation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems 
at our retail outlets, a measure set to significantly 
reduce waste generated from disposable plastic bottles. 
This decision directly supports our commitment to 
sustainability, as it drastically decreases the volume of 
plastic waste entering our ecosystems. Furthermore, by 
curtailing the need for bottled water, we will indirectly 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 
transportation of these products.
-
Use of 
Sustainable 
Packaging Bags
We have started using biodegradable  cloth 
bags for packaging in place of  plastic bags 
across our operations.  These cloth bags are 
reusable,  eco-friendly, and contribute to our 
commitment toward reducing single-use plastic 
in our supply chain.
This initiative has significantly  reduced our plastic 
consumption and promotes a green environment 
by  supporting the use of reusable, biodegradable 
materials in our packaging efforts.
