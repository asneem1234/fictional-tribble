About us 
Hemisphere Properties India Limited - Company Overview & Land Holdings 
Hemisphere Properties India Limited (“HPIL” or “the Company”) was incorporated in 2005 as a 
real estate entity with the mandate to hold, manage, and monetize surplus land identified 
during the disinvestment of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), presently known as Tata 
Communications Limited (TCL). These surplus land parcels were earmarked for transfer to a 
separate company to ensure their optimal utilization in a transparent and structured manner. 
 
In 2012, the President of India, acting through the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), 
acquired a majority shareholding in HPIL, granting it the status of a Central Public Sector 
Enterprise (CPSE). Subsequently, a Scheme of Arrangement between Tata Communications 
Limited and HPIL was formulated and approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) 
in 2018 and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in August 2019, enabling the legal transfer 
of 
the 
identified 
land 
parcels 
to 
HPIL. 
 
Following the approvals, the Administrative Ministry of HPIL was transferred from the 
Department of Telecommunications to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). 
At present, HPIL owns approximately 2.99 million square metres (equivalent to 739.69 acres) of 
prime land located across four states and five locations in India. These parcels, with significant 
development potential, are strategically situated in key urban and semi-urban areas, offering 
opportunities for residential, commercial, mixed-use, and institutional development.

Hemisphere Properties India Limited 
A N N U A L  R E P O R T   
 
 
Chairperson’s Message 
Dear Stakeholders, 
It gives me great pride and honor to present the 21st  Annual Report of your Company, 
Hemisphere Properties India Limited (HPIL), marking yet another year of progress, perseverance, 
and commitment towards building long-term value. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the 
entire team of HPIL, I extend a very warm welcome to all of you to the 21st Annual General 
Meeting of your Company. 
The Annual Report for the financial year ended 31st March 2025, along with the Board’s Report, 
Audited Financial Statements, Auditor’s Report, and the Comments of the Comptroller & Auditor 
General of India (C&AG), are with you and, with your permission, I take them as read. 
Allow me now to share with you the Company’s performance during the year under review, the 
present status of our land assets, and our vision for the future. 
Economic & Future Outlook 
Amidst this environment, India remains a beacon of growth, with a real GDP growth rate of 
6.5% in FY 2024–25, as reported by the National Statistics Office. The IMF projects India to 
maintain a growth trajectory of 6.2% in 2025 and 6.3% in 2026, underscoring the strength of its 
fundamentals.  
In the real estate sector, demand has remained robust across residential and commercial 
segments, supported by urban reforms, infrastructural development, and a rising preference for 
premium, sustainable living and working spaces. This provides HPIL with a favorable backdrop 
to unlock the value of its large land bank located in some of the most strategic cities of India. 
Company Performance 
During FY 2024–25, the Company recorded a net loss of ₹751.85 lakhs, as compared to a loss of 
₹981.85 lakhs in the previous year. The reduction in losses reflects our continued efforts 
towards financial discipline, despite ongoing obligations such as statutory payments, 
maintenance expenses, and other operating costs. 
We have initiated several steps to generate sustainable revenues, including leasing 
opportunities and monetization of land parcels. While the process of unlocking value from our 
extensive land holdings is complex and time-consuming, we remain committed to pursuing it in 
a structured and transparent manner, aligned with shareholder interests and regulatory 
requirements. 
Land Bank and Development Activities 
Your Company holds 739.69 acres of land, located in prime urban areas across four cities: 
 
Dighi (Pune, Maharashtra) 
 
Chattarpur (Delhi) 
 
Greater Kailash (Delhi) 
 
Padianallur (Chennai, Tamil Nadu) 
 
Halisahar (Kolkata, West Bengal)

HPIL 
Hemisphere Properties India Limited 
A N N U A L  R E P O R T   
 
These land parcels were transferred to HPIL pursuant to the Demerger Scheme approved by the 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs from Tata Communications Limited. Each parcel presents unique 
opportunities for monetization and development, subject to statutory approvals and market 
conditions. 
Major Activities Undertaken 
During the year under review, your Company undertook several key initiatives across its land 
parcels with the objective of strengthening ownership rights, unlocking land value, and 
initiating infrastructure development. 
1. Mutation of Land Parcels Completed 
 
Mutation successfully completed for Kolkata, Pune, and Chattarpur (Delhi) land parcels. 
 
Re-initiated the Mutation process of Chennai (Padianallur) land parcel after the 
dismissal of on-going writ appeals. 
2. Appointment of Transaction Advisors 
To maximize value creation, professional Transaction Advisors have been appointed for the 
Pune and Kolkata land parcels. Their expertise will assist in evaluating market opportunities, 
structuring deals, and attracting credible investors and partners. 
3. Revenue Generation through Leasing 
The Company initiated revenue generation from its Pune land parcel through leasing of land 
and buildings, representing the first step towards operationalizing its assets. 
4. Demarcation and Land Use Approvals 
 
Completed demarcation of Pune land, including the Bopkhel area, in coordination with 
Government authorities. 
 
Change in Land Use (CLU) approval for Bopkhel village, converting land classification 
from Public Semi-Public (PSP) to Residential, thereby enhancing its development 
potential. 
 
Layout approval for the Bopkhel parcel through competent authorities. 
 
Conducted regular meetings with Pune authorities to expedite approvals and resolve 
land use matters. 
5. Infrastructure Development Initiatives 
 
Commenced infrastructure development on Pune land as per the approved layout. 
 
At the Kolkata land parcel, a Kaccha Road was constructed and encroachments cleared, 
enabling further evaluation and development planning. 
6. E-Auction of Land at Bopkhel, Pune 
A landmark achievement during the year was the successful initiation of an E-auction process 
for the Bopkhel land in Pune. 
 
This milestone marks the beginning of the Company’s monetization journey, 
establishing a transparent, market-driven mechanism for unlocking land value. 
 
The E-auction demonstrates the Company’s ability to convert non-revenue generating 
land parcels into income-generating assets, while ensuring compliance with regulatory 
standards. 
 
It also sets a precedent for similar processes to be undertaken across other land parcels, 
thereby significantly enhancing shareholder value.

websites of Depositories / Depository Participants. Demat account holders would be able to cast 
their vote without having to register again with the ESPs, thereby, not only facilitating seamless

Board’s Report 
Greater Kailash Land Parcel, Delhi (69.46 acres) 
The Greater Kailash land parcel, measuring 69.46 acres, is one of the most premium and 
strategically important properties in HPIL’s portfolio. Located near the Outer Ring Road in 
South Delhi, the parcel is approximately 20 kilometres from Indira Gandhi International Airport 
and enjoys excellent connectivity to the capital’s central business districts, cultural hubs, and 
residential neighbourhoods. This parcel is among the highest-value real estate holdings of HPIL 
and is designated as Public & Semi-Public (PSP) under the Master Plan of Delhi 2021. Owing to 
its strategic location in an upscale residential zone, it holds immense potential for institutional, 
cultural, or public utility development projects in the long term. 
Fencing and digital surveys of the site have already been completed, and ownership rights are 
secured. However, physical demarcation of the entire land remains pending due to ongoing 
litigations. HPIL continues to pursue these matters with diligence, recognizing that resolution 
will significantly enhance the potential monetization of this prestigious asset. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Padianallur Land Parcel, Chennai (53.04 acres) 
The Padianallur (Chennai) land parcel, measuring 53.04 acres, is located in the northern part of 
Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The site enjoys excellent connectivity, being accessible from the Chennai–
Vijayawada Highway, which links further to the Chennai Outer Ring Road. It is also within 
reasonable distance from Korattur railway station (14.5 km) and Thirumangalam Metro station 
(16.5 km). Surrounding neighbourhoods include Red Hills, Ambattur, Madhavaram, and Puzhal, 
which are well-developed residential and commercial hubs. 
This parcel is zoned as Mixed Residential under the CMA Master Plan 2026. It is properly fenced 
with a 7-foot-high boundary wall and is free from encroachments, with 24x7 security personnel 
deployed. The land is moderately vegetated but otherwise undeveloped. The locality is 
predominantly residential, with some clustered commercial activity, making the site ideal for 
group housing development and data centre facilities, which are incentivized by the State 
Government. 
HPIL has already paid stamp duty of ₹7.73 crore towards this parcel. However, while the 
mutation process was initiated, the State Revenue Authority rejected the application for patta 
transfer citing an ongoing litigation over possession. One of the litigation is disposed off by the 
Hon’ble High Court and the Company has reinitiated the mutation process, which is under 
consideration. This parcel has significant potential for monetization given its strategic location, 
connectivity, and suitability for large-scale residential and infrastructure projects.

Pune land parcel, Maharashtra (524 acres) 
The Pune land parcel is by far the largest in HPIL’s portfolio and represents the Company’s most 
significant monetization opportunity. The land is spread across four villages—Dighi, Kalas, 
Bopkhel, and Bhosari—and is situated along the Pune–Alandi Road, offering superior visibility 
and accessibility. Its proximity to Pune International Airport, Pune Railway Station, and the 
industrial and IT hubs of the city further enhances its attractiveness. 
The land is fully secured, fenced, and demarcated, with no encroachments. It includes two 
existing buildings, Opal A2 and Renaissance, constructed prior to the disinvestment of VSNL. 
Surrounding establishments include Tata Communications Limited and STT Global Data Centres 
India Pvt. Ltd., underlining the strategic location of the property within a developed ecosystem. 
Ownership of the parcel has been successfully updated in Revenue Records, with mutation 
completed for the entire 524 acres. Municipal records have also been updated for the Bopkhel 
portion, while applications are in progress for the other villages. 
To maximize value, HPIL appointed Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) as Transaction Advisor. During the 
year, a Stakeholders’ Meet was held, which attracted enthusiastic participation from real estate 
developers, education providers, and corporate investors. This reinforced the strong demand 
for the parcel across multiple sectors. 
A landmark achievement was the change of land use of land parcel falls under Bopkhel village 
from PSP to Residential. A tentative layout plan has been approved under the Unified 
Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPR 2020), and a Request for Proposal for 
e-auction of land at Bopkhel has been floated, with a reserve price of approximately ₹576.12 
crore.

scheduled 
for

For the remaining land, the Company is actively exploring an Integrated Township Development 
approach, which could include residential, commercial, and institutional facilities. This strategy 
aligns with Maharashtra’s urban planning objectives and is expected to unlock substantial value 
in the medium to long term.

Management Discussion and Analysis Report 
 
ECONOMY & INDUSTRY OUTLOOK 
i. Global Economy  
The global real estate sector in 2024 was shaped by macroeconomic headwinds, rising interest 
rates, and geopolitical uncertainties, yet it remained resilient with an estimated market size of 
around USD 4–7 trillion. The residential segment continued to dominate demand, while 
commercial real estate, logistics, and alternative assets such as data centres gained traction due 
to urbanization, e-commerce growth, and digital transformation. Regionally, Asia-Pacific, 
particularly India and China, emerged as high-growth markets, whereas the US and Europe 
grappled with housing shortages and weaker office demand. Investor interest was driven 
toward luxury housing, mixed-use developments, and sustainable green buildings, with ESG 
compliance and smart technologies becoming key differentiators. However, regulators 
highlighted risks in the USD 12 trillion commercial property market, citing rising debt levels 
and distress in office and retail segments. Despite these challenges, global capital flows showed 
signs of recovery, especially in housing, logistics, and luxury real estate, reflecting a cautious but 
steady growth trajectory for the sector. 
The global economy grew by 3.3% in 2024 (IMF, World Economic Outlook), showing resilience 
despite uneven momentum across regions. Inflation moderated to 5.8%, enabling initial policy 
rate cuts in major economies, while labour markets remained tight with unemployment near 
historic lows. Wage growth and easing price pressures supported real incomes, though private 
consumption stayed subdued amid weak sentiment. Rising geopolitical tensions in Eastern 
Europe and the Middle East disrupted trade and investment flows, weighing on business 
confidence and long-term investment prospects. 
ii.  Indian Economy 
India continues to stand out as a bright spot of economic growth amid global headwinds. 
According to the National Statistics Office, the economy recorded a robust 6.5% real GDP 
growth in FY 2024–25, reflecting its underlying resilience. Looking ahead, the IMF projects 
India’s growth at 6.2% in 2025 and 6.3% in 2026, reinforcing its position as one of the fastest-
growing major economies. The Reserve Bank of India has also noted an improvement in 
inflation expectations, which supported a reduction in benchmark interest rates. 
The sector’s growth reflects not only strong demand for housing and office spaces but also its 
extensive linkages with more than 200 allied industries, including cement, steel, logistics, 
finance, and consumer goods. Sustained momentum across residential, commercial, and 
industrial segments, coupled with the expansion of India’s corporate sector and a services-
driven economy, continues to reinforce the long-term prospects of real estate. 
As India progresses towards inclusive and sustainable urban development, the real estate sector 
will remain a vital enabler—shaping cities, generating employment, and building the physical 
and social infrastructure essential for a rapidly evolving population.

US$ 200 billion in 2021 and contribute 13% to the country’s GDP by 2025. Retail, hospitality, 
and commercial real estate are also growing significantly, providing the much-needed 
infrastructure for India's growing needs. 
The Indian real estate market is projected to experience a substantial increase, potentially 
reaching a value of US$ 5-7 trillion by the year 2047, with the possibility of surpassing US$ 10 
trillion. Housing sales across the top seven Indian cities saw a slight dip of 4% in 2024, with 
around 4.59 lakh units sold compared to 4.76 lakh in 2023, as per ANAROCK data. 
In the first quarter of CY25 (January–March), India’s residential real estate market experienced 
a notable slowdown, with total housing sales across the top seven cities declining by 28% year-
on-year to approximately 93,280 units, down from over 1.30 lakh units in CY2024.

all-time high of Rs. 3.47 lakh crore (US$ 42 billion), marking a robust 48% YoY increase. The 
volume of sales also exhibited a strong growth trajectory, with a 36% rise to 379,095 units sold. 
Indian real estate developers operating in the country’s major urban centers are poised to 
achieve a significant feat in 2023, with the completion of approximately 558,000 homes. 
In previous years, demand for residential properties surged in the top 8 Indian cities, driven by 
mid-income, premium, and luxury segments despite challenges like high mortgage rates and 
property prices. India's physical retail landscape is poised for a substantial boost, with nearly 41 
million sq. ft of retail developments set to be operational between 2024 and 2028 across the top 
7 cities, encompassing projects in various stages from construction to planning.

compared to the previous year. Notably, the December quarter emerged as the busiest quarter 
on record, with gross leasing hitting 20.94 million sq ft. 
CBRE anticipated 14% increase in gross leasing transactions for office spaces across nine major 
cities in calendar year 2024, with a projected total of 70 million square feet. This growth is 
attributed to increased demand from both global and domestic corporate entities. Technology 
companies held the highest share in leasing activity at 22% during first quarter of 
2024.Engineering and manufacturing (E&M) companies accounted for 13%, and banking, 
financial services and insurance account for 12%. Flexible space operators increase by 48%, 
showcasing their notable contributions. 
According to Savills India, real estate demand for data centers is expected to increase by 15-18 
million sq. ft. by 2025. India’s office sector had a record-breaking 2024, clocking 89 million sq. 
ft. of gross leasing across the top 8 cities the highest ever. This marks a 19% jump over 2023, 
surpassing the previous peak by 14 million sq. ft.

a) Residential Segment 
India’s residential real estate sector continued its strong performance in 2024. According to 
Anarock, housing sales across the top seven cities stood at approximately 4.59 lakh units, while 
the overall sales value rose by 16% year-on-year to ~₹5.68 lakh crore. This reflects sustained 
demand momentum and a clear shift in consumer preference towards premium and luxury 
housing. Inventory overhang across these cities improved significantly, declining to 14 months 
as of year 2024, compared to 30 months in year 2019, highlighting a healthier market balance. 
b) Office Segment 
The Indian office real estate market witnessed record activity in 2024. Gross leasing across nine 
major cities grew by 14%, reaching about 70 million sq. ft., driven by demand from both global 
and domestic corporations. Within leasing activity, technology companies led with a 22% share, 
followed by engineering & manufacturing (13%) and banking, financial services and insurance 
(12%), while flexible space operators registered a sharp 48% growth, underscoring their rising 
relevance. 
Overall office absorption during CY 2024 touched an all-time high of ~7.34 million sq. m. (79 
million sq. ft.), largely propelled by Global Capability Centres (GCCs), BFSI, and flexible space 
operators. Bengaluru accounted for the largest share of leasing, followed by Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, 
and Hyderabad, which together contributed more than 70% of total volumes. New supply 
during the year was estimated at ~4.86 million sq. m. (52.3 million sq. ft.). Demand continued to 
be underpinned by India’s skilled workforce, cost competitiveness, and occupiers’ growing 
preference for high-quality, sustainable, and wellness-oriented workplaces. 
c) Retail Segment 
India’s retail real estate sector witnessed steady growth in 2024, supported by rising urban 
consumption, expansion of organized retail, and strong demand from both domestic and 
international brands. Major cities observed a surge in mall leasing activity, with fashion, food & 
beverages, and entertainment players accounting for a significant share of demand. According 
to CBRE, retail leasing across key cities touched new highs, driven by premium malls and high-
street formats. Vacancy levels continued to decline, while rental values in prime retail corridors 
registered healthy appreciation. The growth was further fuelled by omnichannel strategies of 
retailers and robust consumer sentiment during festive periods. 
d) Logistics & Industrial Segment 
The logistics and industrial real estate segment maintained its strong growth trajectory, 
supported by the expansion of e-commerce, 3PL (third-party logistics) players, and 
manufacturing activities under the Government’s Make in India initiative. According to industry 
estimates, leasing activity in the warehousing sector across major hubs such as Delhi-NCR, 
Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Pune remained buoyant, with Grade-A supply witnessing healthy 
absorption. Demand was particularly strong from e-commerce, retail, FMCG, and manufacturing

occupiers, leading to sustained rental growth in key markets. The segment also saw rising 
interest in multi-storey warehouses and tech-enabled facilities, reflecting occupiers’ focus on 
efficiency, automation, and proximity to consumption centres. 
e. Commercial market Segment 
Commercial Real Estate Segment (2024–25) 
India’s commercial real estate market demonstrated strong resilience in FY 2024–25, supported 
by sustained occupier demand, robust office absorption, and healthy investment inflows. Gross 
leasing activity across major cities crossed 70 million sq. ft., marking one of the highest volumes 
in recent years. The growth was primarily driven by Global Capability Centres (GCCs), 
technology firms, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), and flexible space operators, 
which together accounted for a significant share of leasing activity. 
Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Hyderabad continued to dominate, collectively contributing 
over 70% of total office space demand. New supply additions remained steady at ~52 million 
sq. ft., aligning with demand and ensuring stable vacancy levels. Occupiers increasingly 
preferred Grade-A, sustainable, and wellness-focused workplaces, reflecting the shift towards 
ESG-compliant and employee-centric infrastructure. 
On the investment side, the commercial segment remained a key focus for institutional and 
foreign investors, with strong interest in office parks, IT campuses, and co-working platforms. 
India’s competitive cost structures, skilled talent pool, and growing service-sector base are 
expected to underpin demand, making commercial real estate a cornerstone of the country’s 
growth story in the medium to long term. 
Urban Reforms in 2024–25 
The Government of India advanced a broad set of urban reforms during FY 2024–25, aimed at 
promoting sustainable, inclusive, and resilient city development. Flagship programmes such as 
Smart Cities Mission, AMRUT 2.0, Swachh Bharat Mission–Urban 2.0, and PM Awas Yojana 
(Urban) remained central to improving housing, sanitation, water supply, and digital 
governance across urban India. 
A strong thrust was placed on affordable housing, with continued support under PMAY (Urban), 
which targeted faster approvals, interest-linked subsidies, and partnerships with state 
governments and private developers to accelerate supply. Incentives for green and energy-
efficient housing were introduced to align with India’s climate commitments. 
In the area of urban infrastructure financing, multiple reforms were introduced to expand 
funding sources: 
 
Sovereign Green Bonds were deployed to channel funds into environmentally 
sustainable urban projects, including renewable energy, clean mobility, and waste 
management. 
 
Municipal Bonds gained momentum, with several Urban Local Bodies tapping capital 
markets to finance water, sanitation, and mobility projects. 
 
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) continued to attract institutional and foreign 
capital into commercial real estate, while the framework is being expanded to support 
urban infrastructure assets. 
 
Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs) were actively encouraged to drive investments in 
metro rail, affordable rental housing, and integrated townships.

Additionally, reforms emphasized digital governance through GIS-based planning, real-time 
service delivery, and e-mobility platforms, improving both transparency and efficiency. 
Collectively, these initiatives reinforced the government’s vision of building resilient, climate-
friendly, and investment-ready cities to support India’s rapid pace of urbanization. 
 
OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY 
In 2002, the Government of India conducted a disinvestment exercise in respect of 25% of its 
shareholding in the equity share capital of VSNL (currently known as Tata Communications 
Limited), wherein in terms of the bid for the disinvestment required a separate value to be 
ascribed to lands to be retained with VSNL and to exclude the value of certain Land parcels, held 
by VSNL. Panatone was the successful bidder in the disinvestment process and subsequently, 
entered into the VSNL SPA and the VSNL SHA. In terms of the disinvestment bid, the VSNL SHA 
and VSNL SPA, the Land parcels identified were required to be hived off or demerged into a 
separate entity.  
As a result, Hemisphere Properties India Limited was incorporated in 2005 as a real estate 
company. During FY 2012-13, Government of India acquired 51.12% equity stake in HPIL after 
the decision of the Cabinet. Earlier, the Company was in administration of Department of 
Telecommunications and further after the Cabinet decision dated April 06th, 2018 the 
administration of HPIL was transferred from Department of Telecommunication to Ministry of 
Housing & Urban Affairs. The Mumbai Bench of National Company Law Tribunal and Ministry of 
Corporate Affairs approved Scheme of Arrangement & Reconstruction between Tata 
Communications Limited & Hemisphere Properties India Limited on 12.07.2018 and 05.08.2018 
respectively.

SEGMENT-WISE PERFORMANCE 
The Company does not have any other segment. 
Development Opportunities 
Housing Demand 
India’s housing market continues to offer significant development opportunities, underpinned 
by rapid urbanization, rising household incomes, favorable demographics, and a growing 
preference for home ownership. The Government’s sustained push through PM Awas Yojana 
(Urban) and various state-level affordable housing schemes has further expanded the potential 
for both affordable and mid-income segments. 
At the same time, there is a notable shift towards premium and luxury housing, driven by rising 
aspirations, increasing HNI/ULTRA-HNI wealth, and demand for larger, amenity-rich homes in 
metropolitan areas. The work-from-home culture, hybrid work models, and lifestyle-driven 
choices have boosted demand for spacious residences and integrated townships. 
With housing sales in top cities touching record levels in 2024, developers are well-positioned 
to capitalize on sustained end-user demand, supportive government policies, and access to 
diversified financing models, making the residential real estate sector a key driver of long-term 
growth. 
Affordable housing 
Affordable housing remains one of the largest growth opportunities in India’s real estate sector, 
driven by the twin forces of rapid urbanization and the Government’s commitment to “Housing 
for All.” The PM Awas Yojana (Urban) has been a key enabler, providing subsidies and 
incentives for both buyers and developers, thereby expanding access to home ownership for 
low- and middle-income groups. 
The demand base is further supported by migration to urban centres, rising disposable incomes, 
and a growing young workforce aspiring to own homes. At the same time, state governments 
are increasingly partnering with private developers under public–private partnership (PPP) 
models to fast-track affordable housing projects. 
With innovations in construction technology, green building practices, and modular designs, the 
segment is evolving to deliver quality housing at scale while remaining cost-efficient. Backed by 
strong demand fundamentals and policy support, affordable housing is set to remain a 
cornerstone of India’s residential real estate growth in the coming years.

Other Opportunities 
1. Commercial Real Estate 
India’s commercial real estate segment continues to attract strong demand, especially from 
Global Capability Centres (GCCs), IT/ITeS, BFSI, and flexible workspace operators. With gross 
leasing volumes crossing record highs, cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi-NCR, and 
Mumbai remain key hubs. Rising occupier preference for Grade-A, ESG-compliant, and wellness-
oriented office spaces presents a long-term growth opportunity for developers. 
2. Retail Real Estate 
The retail sector is benefiting from growing consumer spending, rising urban middle-class 
demand, and expansion of both domestic and international brands. Premium malls, high-street 
retail, and mixed-use developments are increasingly sought after, while omnichannel retail 
strategies are driving new formats. This creates scope for developers to capture demand in both 
metropolitan and Tier-II cities. 
3. Logistics & Industrial Real Estate 
The e-commerce boom, 3PL expansion, and government initiatives like Make in India and PLI 
schemes are driving demand for modern warehouses and industrial parks. Developers have the 
opportunity to cater to requirements for Grade-A, tech-enabled, and sustainable facilities, 
including multi-storey warehousing near consumption centres. This segment is emerging as one 
of the fastest-growing in Indian real estate. 
4. Emerging Asset Classes 
Newer formats such as student housing, senior living, co-living, and data centres are gaining 
traction, driven by shifting demographics, technology adoption, and lifestyle changes. Investors 
are increasingly exploring these alternative asset classes for higher returns and diversification. 
 
RISKS AND CONCERNS 
The Company operates in a dynamic environment and is exposed to multiple risks that can 
potentially affect its business, financial performance, and long-term growth prospects. These 
risks primarily relate to economic, regulatory, financial, and operational challenges, along with 
uncertainties inherent to the real estate sector. Key risks are outlined below: 
1. Regulatory and Policy Risks 
The real estate sector in India is highly regulated, with multiple clearances required at central, 
state, and local levels. Delays in land acquisition, land-use conversion, project approvals, and 
construction permits are common. Retrospective policy changes or sudden shifts in regulations 
can adversely affect profitability, project timelines, and overall sector attractiveness. 
2. Funding and Liquidity Risks 
Access to capital remains uneven across the sector. Established developers with low leverage 
continue to attract funding, while weaker players face challenges in raising capital. Rising 
interest rates, inflationary pressures, and tighter monetary policies may increase borrowing 
costs, affecting both developers’ margins and housing demand.

STATUTORY REPORT 
3. Statutory Approvals and Title Risks 
Pursuant to the Demerger Scheme, various land parcels were transferred to the Company. 
However, in revenue records and registries, several parcels continue to reflect the name of 
erstwhile VSNL or its successor, TCL. While the Scheme directs the transfer of titles to the 
Company, additional compliances are required to perfect ownership. The absence of title 
insurance in India further compounds the risk of disputed or faulty titles, potential 
encumbrances, and lengthy litigations that may impact valuation, development, and 
transferability of land. 
4. Land-Use Approval Risks 
Development of land parcels requires land-use change approvals from local authorities, which 
vary across states and jurisdictions. Delays in obtaining such approvals may result in 
rescheduling of project timelines and could affect the pace of project execution. 
5. Litigation and Encroachment Risks 
Certain land parcels are subject to disputes relating to ownership, title, or third-party claims. 
Any adverse outcome could lead to loss of land, financial compensation liabilities, or delays in 
development. Further, the risk of encroachment on land parcels can result in additional costs 
and prolonged legal processes to clear titles, thereby impacting project feasibility. 
6. Financial and Market Risks 
The Company’s performance is closely tied to macroeconomic trends, monetary policy, and 
overall demand for real estate. Inflationary pressures, rising input costs, and higher interest 
rates can weaken affordability and reduce sales. Additionally, increased supply of alternative or 
lower-cost land parcels in certain markets may exert pressure on land valuations and 
development potential. 
7. Concentration Risk – Pune Land Parcel 
The Company’s largest landholding of ~524 acres is located in the Pune Metropolitan Region 
(PMR). Consequently, the business is significantly dependent on real estate demand and market 
conditions in this region. Any adverse economic, regulatory, or demand-related developments 
in PMR could materially affect business performance and valuations. 
8. Partnering and Collaboration Risks 
The Company’s ability to identify credible partners or customers for land development is 
critical. Risks include inadequate due diligence, unreliable financial capacity of partners, or 
disagreements on commercial terms. Failure of joint venture or joint development partners to 
meet obligations could delay or derail projects, placing additional financial and operational 
burden on the Company. 
9. Land Valuation and Development Right Risks 
The availability of cheaper or alternate land in competing markets may impact the pricing and 
marketability of the Company’s land parcels. Restrictions on land use, such as agricultural 
zoning, may further delay or limit development potential unless requisite approvals are 
secured.

STATUTORY REPORT 
10. Joint Development Risks 
Where land development is undertaken through joint ventures, joint development, or 
management agreements, the Company may have limited control over execution timelines, 
costs, and compliance. Any failure by partners to perform could adversely affect the project and 
the Company’s financial results. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The Company recognises these risks and has implemented a robust risk management 
framework to identify, monitor, and mitigate them. While certain risks are inherent to the real 
estate sector, the Company remains committed to safeguarding stakeholder interests through 
prudent financial management, strong governance practices, and a proactive approach to 
compliance and litigation management. 
HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT 
The Company recognises that its people are its most valuable asset and a critical driver of long-
term growth. As on date, the Company has a lean team comprising five employees, supported by 
a few specialised consultants engaged to handle specific assignments. This structure has 
allowed the Company to remain agile, cost-efficient, and focused during its formative stage of 
operations. 
At the same time, the Board and Management are conscious of the growing scale and complexity 
of the Company’s business. With the planned development of our land bank and increasing 
operational requirements, the need for a more robust and skilled workforce has become 
imperative. Accordingly, the Company is in the process of strengthening its human resource 
base by onboarding professionals with diverse expertise in project development, finance, 
compliance, legal, and operations. 
Looking ahead, the Company plans to expand its human resource strength in a phased manner 
to meet its operational and strategic goals. Building a competent and motivated team will not 
only enable smooth execution of our projects but also help us establish a strong foundation for 
sustained growth. 
The Company remains committed to fostering a work culture built on professionalism, integrity, 
inclusiveness, and innovation. By doing so, we believe our people will continue to be a 
cornerstone of our success and a key differentiator in a competitive industry.

Auditor’s responsibility 
 
Based on audit, our responsibility is to express an opinion on the compliance with the applicable laws and 
maintenance of records by the Company. We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing 
standards CSAS 1 to CSAS 4 (“CSAS”) prescribed by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (“ICSI”). 
These standards require that the auditor complies with statutory and regulatory requirements and plans 
and performs the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about compliance with applicable laws and 
maintenance of records. 
 
Due to the inherent limitations of an audit including internal, financial and operating controls, there is an 
unavoidable risk that some misstatements or material non-compliances may not be detected, even though 
the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the CSAS. Our report of even date is to be 
read along with this letter. 
1. Maintenance of secretarial records is the responsibility of the management of the Company. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these secretarial recorods based on our audit. 
2. We have followed the audit practices and processes as were appropriate to obtain reasonable 
assurance about the correctness of the contents of the secretarial records. The verification was done 
on a random test basis to ensure that correct facts are reflected in secretarial records. We believe 
that the processes and practices we followed provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
3. We have not verified the correctness and appropriateness of the financial records and Books of 
Accounts of the company and for which we relied on the report of statutory auditor. 
4. Wherever required, we have obtained the Management representation about the compliance of 
laws, rules and regulations and happening of events etc. 
5. The compliance of the provisions of Corporate and other applicable laws, rules, regulations, 
standards is the responsibility of management. Our examination was limited to the verification of 
procedures on random test basis.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
 
To the Members of 
Hemisphere Properties India Limited 
 
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Opinion 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Hemisphere Properties India Limited 
(“herein after called as The Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31 2025, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss, the statement of cash flows and the statement of changes in equity for the 
year then ended and notes to the financial statement including the summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information. 
 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, 
as amended, (“IND AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of 
affairs of the Company as at 31 March,2025, and its profit/(Loss), total comprehensive income, its cash 
flows and changes in equity for the year ended on that date. 
 
Basis for Opinion 
 
We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. (Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made 
thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements. 
 
Emphasis of Matter 
 
1. Note No. 30 of the financial statements, regarding the accounting of Equity Components of 
Compound Financial Instrument in accordance with IND AS 109. The Company has received an 
amount of Rs. 130 crores during the financial year 2021-22, by way of issue of 0.01% Non-
Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares of Rs. 10 each, (Converted to 0.01% Cumulative 
Redeemable Preference Shares in FY 2023-24, as approved by Shareholders on 31st March 2024) 
redeemable after 20 years. The said financial instruments have been accounted for in the 
accompanying financial statements on the assumption of the Redemption at Par Value, which is 
uncertain and indefinite in nature. As per Ind AS 109, the company provisioned for a preference 
dividend of Rs. 130,000 and transferred the equity component of Rs. 110,56,56,520 to Debt 
adjustment reserve for which the treatment has been properly recognized in the books of 
accounts. 
 
2. Note No. 21 read with Note No. 34(a) regarding Provision for Stamp Duty Payable towards 
registration/mutation of the complete land parcels in all states, amounting to Rs. 65,100 lacs, 
which has been computed based on the circle rates prevailing in Financial Year 2016-17. The 
actual liability in this regard may vary, being dependent upon the Circles rates/stamp duty rates

prevailing at the time of transfer of titles of land in future. The Company has paid an amount of 
Rs. 774.30 lacs (out of the above provision of Rs. 65,100 lacs) during the financial year 2022-23 
for the Chennai Land and the Conveyance Deed has been executed for the said land. Further, 
during the previous financial year 2023-24, an amount of Rs. 316.02 lacs, being the Development 
Fees/Mutation Charges on Mutation of Kolkata land parcel has been appropriated out of Rs. 
65100 lacs, and paid in May 2024. 
 
However, the management has not re-assessed/reviewed the remaining outstanding liability of 
Rs. 64009.68 lacs as of March 31, 2025, in view of the Mutations/Execution of Conveyance 
Deed of certain land parcels post FY 2020-21 till March 31, 2025. 
 
3. Note No. 34(c) of the financial statements, regarding Non-Recognition/Accounting of Property 
Tax/Urban Land Tax Liability by the Company in relation to the Land Parcel of 53.04 acres in 
Chennai. The management is of the view that the Liability for the said cost is not presently 
determinable, and shall be accounted for only when the demand is ascertained from the said local 
revenue authority. 
 
4. During the Financial Year, the Company has not complied, with the provisions contained in 
Section 149 of the Companies Act read with Rule – 4 of the Companies (Appointment and 
Qualification of Directors) Rules, 2014 and Regulation 17(1)(b) & 2(A), Regulation 18(1)(b)(d) & 
2(b), Regulation 19(1)(c),(2) & 2(A), Regulation 20(2A), Regulation 25(3)of SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015 in respect of the Appointment of 
the Independent Directors. The NSE and BSE have imposed penalties in respect of the said 
Non-Compliances. 
 
            Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter(s). 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
a. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. We have determined the matters prescribed below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report. 
 
Sr. 
No. 
Key Audit Matter 
Auditor’s Response 
A. 
Assessment of fair value of the land parcel (as 
described in Note No. 33 of the financial 
statements)  
 
The management has initiated the process of 
calculation of fair value of land parcels located 
in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Chattarpur and 
Greater Kailash. The Market Valuation of 
all the land parcels as on date of 
consideration and declaration of the 
financial results by the Board of Directors, 
has 
been 
assessed 
and 
valued 
at 
₹10,588,86/- lakhs. However, the report 
being received from a single Valuation 
Agency is not a complete reliable measure of 
the fair value of the Investment Property. 
 
As per IND AS 40, Investment Property, 
when the fair value of the property (not under 
Our audit procedures related to the key audit matters 
included the following: 
 
 
We evaluated the details of the land parcels as 
available in the Schedule I of the order of MCA dated 
05.08.2019 pursuant to which the Scheme of 
Arrangement and Reconstruction was approved.  
 
In addition, we have considered the Valuation 
Reports of various Land parcels dated 31.03.2024.  
 
 
We assessed the disclosures made in the financial 
statements.

construction) is not reliably measurable, the 
entity shall disclose: 
Description of the 
Investment property 
Refer Note 
No.33 of the 
financial 
Statements. 
Explanation of why 
fair value cannot be 
measured reliably 
If possible, the range of 
estimates within which 
fair value is likely to fall. 
 
Further as per Ind AS 40 There is a rebuttable 
presumption that an entity can reliably 
measure the fair value of an investment 
property on a continuing basis. However, in 
exceptional cases, there is clear evidence when 
an entity first acquires an investment property 
(or when an existing property first becomes 
investment property after a change in use) 
that the fair value of the investment property 
is not reliably measurable on a continuing 
basis. This arises when, and only when, the 
market for comparable properties is inactive 
(eg-there are few recent transactions, price 
quotations are not current or observed 
transaction prices indicate that the seller was 
forced to sell) and alternative reliable 
measurements of fair value (for example, 
based on discounted cash flow projections) 
are not available. 
 
B. 
Litigation, claims and disputes pertaining to 
the surplus land (as described in Note No. 
35(b) of the financial statements)  
 
There are total 27 cases of litigation, claims 
and disputes pertaining to the surplus land 
and Company, known as on 31.03.2025 which 
are pending under various forums. These 
litigations claim and disputes, where earlier 
TCL was a party, subsequent to approval of 
Scheme and transfer of land, have now been 
transferred and belong to the Company.  
The Company is in the process of contesting 
all such litigations, claims and disputes. 
 
The financial implications associated with all 
such litigations, if any, is undeterminable as of 
March 31, 2025. 
Our audit procedures related to the key audit matters 
included the following: 
 
 
 
We obtained the list of total cases of litigation, claims 
and disputes, and analyzed the progress in all the said 
cases, including evaluation of any financial impact, 
due to any order of the court during the financial year 
2024-25.  
 
We assessed and have made the relevant disclosures 
in the financial statements. 
 
Further, it has been observed that Claim of the 
Company in respect of Execution of Sale Deed of 
Chattarpur Land Parcel (in lieu of Shortage of 0.4 
acres of Chennai Land Parcel)has not yet been 
executed by TCL, in favour of the Company as of 
March 31, 2025.

Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate 
Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. 
 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
 
6. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. 
 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
7. The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the 
Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and 
fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive income, Cash flows of 
the Company, changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the IND AS and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Ind-AS financial statements that give a true and 
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
8. In preparing the financial statements, Management of the Company is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
9. The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements 
 
10. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Companies 
Act, 2013 we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such

and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company 
to cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and

ANNEXURE - A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Referred to in paragraph 13 (f) of the Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the members 
of Hemisphere Properties India Limited on the standalone financial statements for the year 
ended March 31, 2025 
 
1. We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Hemisphere Properties 
India Limited (“the Company”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025, in conjunction with 
our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
2. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
3.   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respect. 
      Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and

Auditors’ Report 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  
      We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the Company`s internal financial controls system over financial reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
4.  A Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that: - 
(i) 
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  
(ii) 
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  
(iii) 
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
5.  Because of the inherent limitations of the internal financial controls over financial reporting, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due 
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of the changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion 
6.   In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India however it is needed to be further strengthened to

According to the information and explanations given to us and on the basis of the financial 
ratios, ageing and expected dates of realization of financial assets and payment of financial 
liabilities, other information accompanying the financial statements, our knowledge of the 
Board of Directors and management plans and based on our examination of the evidence 
supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our attention, which causes us to believe that 
any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report that the Company is not 
capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due 
within a period of one year from the balance sheet date.  
 
We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We 
further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we 
neither give any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one 
year from the balance sheet date, will get discharged by the Company as and when they fall due.

In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us, the provisions

3.1.1 
Recognition and measurement

A N N U A L  R E P O R T      
Items of property, plant and equipment, are measured at cost (which includes capitalised 
borrowing costs, if any) less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes its purchase price, duties, taxes, after 
deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing the item to its 
working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item 
and restoring the site on which it is located 
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment comprises the cost of 
materials, direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the item to its 
intended working condition and estimated costs of dismantling, removing and restoring the site 
on which it is located, wherever applicable. 
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then 
they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. 
 
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit 
or loss. 
 
3.1.2 
Subsequent expenditure 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits 
associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company 
 
3.1.3 
Depreciation 
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated 
residual value using straight line method over the useful lives of assets estimated by the Company 
based on an internal technical evaluation performed by the management and is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. Assets acquired under finance lease are depreciated over the shorter 
of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term. Depreciation for assets purchased / sold during the 
period is proportionately charged. 
 
3.1.4 
Reclassification to investment property 
When the use of a property changes from owner-occupied to investment property, the property 
is reclassified as investment property at its carrying amount on the date of classification. 
 
3.1.5 
Capital work in progress 
Projects under which assets are not ready for their intended use and other capital work-in-
progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost, related incidental expenses and attributable 
interest. 
 
 
3.2 
Investment Property  
Land parcel held by the Company is classified as investment property when it is held to earn rental 
income, for capital appreciation, or both. Investment property is initially measured at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the investment property is measured using the 
cost model, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and is carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation (if applicable) and any accumulated impairment losses. The classification of 
land as investment property is reviewed at each reporting date. Transfers to or from investment 
property are made only when there is a change in use, evidenced by: Commencement of development 
with a view to sale, for a transfer to inventories

The title deed of the land parcel at Chennai is executed in the name of Hemisphere Properties India 
Limited as on March 31, 2025. The value of land (as investment property) has been shown at the 
value shown in the books of Tata Communications Limited as per order of demerger passed by 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs. 
 
 
3.3 
Income Tax 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to a business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income. 
 
3.3.1 
Current tax 
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for 
the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The 
amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or 
received after considering the uncertainty, if any related to income taxes. It is measured using tax 
rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
 
3.3.2 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for 
taxation purposes. Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses and tax 
credits. 
 
3.4 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, other short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
 
3.5 
Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash 
receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash 
flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating activities), investing and financing 
activities of the Company are segregated. 
 
3.6 
Earnings per share 
Basic Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted 
earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit by the weighted average number of equity 
shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted average number of 
equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. 
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the year, unless issued at 
a later date. In computing diluted earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and 
that either reduces earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. The number of shares 
and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for the 
share splits. 
 
3.7 
Provisions and contingent liabilities 
3.7.1 
General

A N N U A L  R E P O R T      
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the expense 
relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-
tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
 
3.7.2 
Contingent liabilities 
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made where there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may probably not require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible or a 
present obligation where the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made. 
 
3.7.3 
Onerous Contracts 
Provision for onerous contracts i.e. contracts where the expected unavoidable cost of meeting 
the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it, 
are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle a present obligation as a result of an obligating event based on a reliable 
estimate of such obligation. 
 
3.8 
Borrowing Costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of those property, plant and 
equipment which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are 
capitalised. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they incur in the statement 
of profit and loss. 
 
3.9 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue from renting/access of land is recognised, when the right to use of the asset have been 
transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs, if any, with 
regard to the use of the asset, can be estimated reliably and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably.  
 
3.10 
Financial instruments – initial recognition, subsequent measurement and impairment 
 
3.10.1 
Financial Assets 
Financial Assets are measured at amortised cost or fair value through Other Comprehensive 
Income or fair value through Profit or Loss, depending on its business model for managing those 
financial assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities contractual cash flow characteristics. 
Subsequent measurements of financial assets are dependent on initial categorisation. For 
impairment purposes significant financial assets are tested on an individual basis, other financial 
assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. 
 
3.10.1.1 Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. 
Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash 
shortfalls over the expected life of financial assets. The estimated impairment losses are

recognised in a separate provision for impairment and the impairment losses are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses. 
Subsequent changes in assessment of impairment are recognised in provision for impairment 
and the change in impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
within other expenses. 
For foreign currency trade receivable, impairment is assessed after reinstatement at closing 
rates. 
Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the 
carrying amount of trade receivable and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to other Income. 
 
3.10.1.2 
Investment in equity shares 
Investment in equity securities are initially measured at fair value and are recognised through 
Profit and Loss account. 
 
3.10.2 
Financial Liabilities 
At initial recognition, all financial liabilities other than fair valued through profit and loss are 
recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are attributable to the issue of financial 
liability. Transaction costs of financial liability carried at fair value through profit or loss is 
expensed in profit or loss. However, borrowings, which is likely to be assigned or negotiated are 
initially measured at fair value through profit and loss account. Other borrowings are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of 
the Effective rate of interest (EIR). The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
3.10.2.1 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 
12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 
3.10.2.2 
Redeemable preference shares 
The Company’s redeemable preference shares were classified as compound financial 
instruments, comprising both a financial liability and an equity component. This 
classification is made in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms and the 
definitions set out in applicable financial reporting standards. 
Upon initial recognition, the fair value of the liability component is determined by 
discounting the contractual stream of future cash flows using the market interest rate 
applicable to an instrument of similar non-compound instrument. This liability component is 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method until it is 
settled or redeemed.The residual amount, representing the difference between the issue price 
of the instrument and the fair value of the liability component at inception, is recognised as 
equity. This component is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition. 
Following the conversion, the modified instrument continues to be accounted for as a 
financial instrument, with appropriate re-evaluation of its liability components where 
applicable, based on the revised terms.

3.11.1 
Financial Assets 
The Company recognises loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the 
financial assets which are not fair valued through Statement of Profit and Loss. Loss allowance 
for trade receivables with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to 
lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount 
equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial 
recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL. The amount of expected credit 
losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the 
amount that is required to be recognised is recognised as an impairment gain or loss in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
3.11.2 
Non-Financial Assets 
An asset is considered as impaired when at the date of Balance Sheet there are indications of 
impairment and the carrying amount of the asset, or where applicable the cash generating unit to 
which the asset belongs exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the net asset selling 
price and value in use).The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the 
reduction is recognized as an impairment loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The 
impairment loss recognized in the prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimate of recoverable amount. Post impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised 
carrying value of the impaired asset over its remaining useful life. 
 
3.12 
In accordance with Ind AS 36, an entity is required to test intangible assets with indefinite useful life 
for impairment. Goodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess 
of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in 
the acquire, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition 
date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in purchase business combination and determined to 
have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more 
frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be 
performed. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible assets with an indefinite life on our 
balance 
sheet.

*Note: During the current year, the Company has transferred certain investment properties to inventories (stock-in-trade), following a 
change in use, in accordance with Paragraph 57(c) of Ind AS 40 – Investment Property. As per Ind AS 40, when an entity adopts the cost 
model, the carrying amount of the investment property at the date of change in use shall be deemed to be its cost for subsequent 
accounting under Ind AS 2 – Inventories. Therefore the transferred property is now classified as stock-in-trade under current assets and 
has been accounted for as per the requirements of Ind AS 2 – Inventories. There was no gain or loss recognized at the time of transfer 
since the cost model was applied and the carrying amount becomes the deemed cost under Ind AS 2.

On May 17, 2021, the Company has issued non-cumulative redeemable preference shares 1,000 lakhs preference shares @10/- i.e. ₹ 10,000.00 lakhs  for a tenure of 20 years to 
Government of India (i.e. Promoter) maintained with Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs on private placement with dividend of 0.01% per annum. Further, on November 12, 
2021, the Company issued non-cumulative redeemable preference shares 300 lakhs preference shares @10/- i.e. ₹ 3,000.00 lakhs  to Government of India (i.e Promoter) on 
private placement with dividend of 0.01% per annum. The company has converted its 0.01% Non-Cumulative preference shares to 0.01% of Cumulative preference shares and 
the  approval of shareholders has been taken on 31.03.2024.  This change in terms has significant implications for the accounting treatment and classification of the preference 
shares 
under 
the 
applicable 
Ind 
AS 
standards. 
 
Initially, as of 31.03.2024, the preference shares were bifurcated into two components: the equity component and the liability component. The liability component was primarily 
based on the redemption value and interest obligations, excluding dividends, which were not recognized as a liability under the non-cumulative terms. However, following the 
change to cumulative preference shares, the treatment of dividends changed, with dividends now becoming an obligation, even if not declared, which required recalculating the 
liability component. As per Ind AS 109, the company provisioned for preference dividend of ₹1,30,000 and transferred the equity component of ₹1,10,56,56,520/- to Debt 
adjustment reserve for which the treatment has been properly recognised in the books of accounts.
