Introduction
ABOUT THIS REPORT
This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) outlines Signatureglobal (India) Limited’s performance on 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects for the financial year 2024–25. Aligned with the SEBI-mandated BRSR 
framework and the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC), the report highlights our ongoing efforts 
toward sustainable development, responsible corporate governance, and value creation for all stakeholders.
It includes disclosures across general, management, and principle-wise performance parameters, in line with evolving 
expectations from investors, regulators, and the broader ecosystem.
VISION MISSION STATEMENT
To lead with sustainability by building energy-efficient and eco-friendly spaces, fostering inclusive and thriving communities, 
and upholding the highest standards of transparency, accountability, and governance to inspire trust and create lasting value 
for all stakeholders.
OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT AND MARKET PRESENCE
Signatureglobal (India) Limited operates predominantly in the Delhi-NCR region, one of India’s fastest-growing urban corridors. 
With a strong focus on mid-market and premium segment residential housing, the Group also develops select commercial 
and retail spaces.
While our business operations are rooted locally, we align our practices with global Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) benchmarks. Certifications such as Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) and our association with the 
Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) reflect our integration of international sustainability standards into our real estate model.
ESG COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING PRACTICES
While this report adheres to the format mandated by SEBI under the BRSR guidelines, we have ensured alignment with 
internationally recognized ESG frameworks to enhance transparency and benchmark our performance globally.
•	
GRI (Global Reporting Initiative): Used as a reference to structure and expand environmental and social disclosures.
•	
UN SDGs (United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals): Mapped against Signatureglobal (India) Limited’s CSR 
and community development initiatives.
This alignment supports comprehensive, comparable, and decision-useful disclosures for all stakeholders.
Commitment to Responsible and Sustainable Growth
At Signatureglobal (India) Limited, sustainability is a core business principle, not a standalone initiative. We are committed to 
minimizing our environmental footprint through energy-efficient buildings, responsible material sourcing, and integrated waste 
and water management.
Robust governance mechanisms, inclusive workplace policies, and a proactive approach to stakeholder engagement underpin 
our ethical business conduct. We aim to generate long-term, shared value for investors, customers, employees, suppliers, and 
the communities in which we operate.
This report reflects our commitment and showcases our progress and accountability as a responsible real estate developer.

Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
The company is exposed to 
regulatory 
risk 
arising 
from 
the 
evolving 
environmental, 
health, safety, and construction 
standards. 
Inadequate 
compliance 
monitoring 
may 
result in financial penalties, legal 
liabilities, and project execution 
delays.
Implementation 
of 
a 
structured

Climate 
Change 
Adaptation
Risk
Increasing 
frequency 
and 
severity 
of 
climate-induced 
events such as floods and 
heatwaves pose significant risks 
to construction timelines, cost 
efficiency, and the structural 
durability of real estate assets of 
the company.
Integration of climate-resilient 
design principles, advanced 
stormwater 
management 
systems, 
and 
adaptive 
green building solutions to 
safeguard asset integrity and 
ensure long-term resilience 
against 
extreme 
weather 
events by the company.

GHG 
Emissions 
Management
Risk
Construction activities are a 
major source of CO₂ emissions, 
exposing 
the 
company 
to 
increasing 
regulatory 
and 
stakeholder 
pressure 
for 
transparent carbon disclosures 
and 
robust 
decarbonization 
strategies.
Deployment of low-carbon 
materials 
such 
as 
PPC 
cement, prioritization of local 
sourcing, adoption of energy-
efficient 
technologies, 
and strict compliance with 
recognized green building 
certification frameworks to 
minimize embodied carbon 
and 
promote 
sustainable 
construction practices.

Biodiversity 
Conservation
Risk & 
Opportunity
Construction 
activities 
may 
contribute to habitat degradation 
and biodiversity loss, potentially 
impacting regulatory compliance 
and 
community 
perception. 
However, proactive preservation 
of green zones and integration of 
natural landscapes can enhance 
brand 
reputation, 
support 
regulatory 
alignment, 
and 
improve long-term asset value.
Ecological 
risks 
can 
be 
addressed 
through 
native 
plantations, 
integrated 
landscaping, 
and 
comprehensive 
environmental due diligence 
before 
construction, 
supporting 
biodiversity 
preservation and long-term 
asset value enhancement.

Collaboration
Risk
Inadequate engagement with 
local communities and regulatory

and 
significant 
delays 
in 
project 
approvals and execution.
Establishment of dedicated 
stakeholder

mechanisms 
to 
foster 
transparency, 
trust, 
and 
timely resolution of concerns.

Health and 
Safety
Risk
Workplace 
injuries 
expose 
operations to legal liabilities, 
ethical concerns, and potential 
disruptions, 
impacting 
both 
compliance 
and 
workforce 
morale.
Ensuring 
ISO 
45001 
compliance through on-site 
safety 
audits, 
consistent 
provision 
of 
personal 
protective equipment (PPE), 
and 
regular 
workforce 
training to uphold health 
and safety standards across 
construction sites.
Negative
8
Waste 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Inefficient waste management 
can result in regulatory non-
compliance, reputational harm, 
and environmental degradation. 
Conversely, 
effective 
recycling and waste reduction 
initiatives offer cost savings, 
enhance 
resource 
efficiency, 
and 
contribute 
to 
achieving 
sustainability certifications and 
green credits.
Implementation 
of 
construction and demolition 
(C&D) 
waste 
segregation 
protocols, 
collaboration 
with authorized recyclers, 
and reuse of inert materials 
to 
ensure 
regulatory 
compliance 
and 
promote 
circular 
construction 
practices.

SECTION B: MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS DISCLOSURES
This section is aimed at helping businesses demonstrate the structures, policies, and processes put in place towards adopting 
the NGRBC Principles and Core Elements.
It represents how the company integrates sustainability and responsible business practices into its governance structures, 
internal policies, stakeholder relationships, and grievance mechanisms. It highlights the systems and processes that ensure 
our long-term value creation is ethical, inclusive, and environmentally conscious.
At Signatureglobal (India) Limited, our sustainability governance is driven by formal oversight at the senior management levels. 
We have established policies that reflect our environmental and social commitments, and we actively engage stakeholders to

with global sustainability expectations.
The National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC), as prescribed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 
Government of India, advocate a framework of nine principles (P1–P9) that serve as the foundation for responsible and 
sustainable business practices in India. These principles are embedded into the BRSR framework and are outlined below:
•	
P1 – Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that is ethical, transparent, 
and accountable.
•	
P2 – Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.
•	
P3 – Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their value chains.
•	
P4 – Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all their stakeholders.
•	
P5 – Businesses should respect and promote human rights.
•	
P6 – Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment.
•	
P7 – Businesses, when engaging in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a manner that is responsible 
and transparent.
•	
P8 – Businesses should promote inclusive growth and equitable development.
•	
P9 – Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner.

Specific commitments, goals and targets set 
by the entity with defined timelines, if any.
Signatureglobal (India) Limited has adopted a three-phase ESG roadmap 
that assigns clear, time-bound targets and assigns ownership at the 
senior management and business-unit levels:
n	
Phase 1 – Foundation & Data Infrastructure (FY 2024-25)  
	
o 	
Publish our inaugural, GRI- and BRSR-aligned ESG report.
	
o 	
Complete a Sustainable-Construction Blueprint covering 
low-carbon materials, passive-design principles, and waste-
segregation standards.
	
o	
Roll out a digital data-automation system on every active 
project, ensuring monthly, audit-ready tracking of energy, 
water, and waste.
n	
Phase 2 – Target-Setting & Transparency (FY 2025-26)
	
o	
Finish an SBTi readiness assessment and submit near-term 
science-based targets for validation.
	
o 	
Embed quantitative ESG KPIs—covering climate, HSE, labour 
standards, diversity, and responsible procurement—into 
annual business plans.
	
o 	
Issue an annual ESG report to all stakeholders, including 
independent assurance of key environmental data sets.
n	
Phase 3 – ESG Leadership (FY 2026-27) 
	
o 	
Commission 
priority 
carbon-reduction 
projects 
(onsite 
renewables, 
high-efficiency 
MEP 
systems, 
low-carbon 
concrete from the Group’s captive plant) that put the portfolio 
on a 1.5 °C path.
	
o 	
Formalise a Green-Finance Framework and raise capital 
through green loans or bonds to fund further retrofits.
	
o 	
Extend sustainability criteria across 100 % of Tier-1 suppliers 
and contractors, with annual compliance audits.
These phased commitments rest on ESG Steering Committee-(internal 
committee) approved policies for Net Zero, Climate Change, Energy, 
Biodiversity, Sustainable Procurement, Waste Management, and ESG 
Governance. Progress against each milestone will be reviewed quarterly 
by the ESG Steering Committee and shall be disclosed publicly in our 
annual ESG report, ensuring accountability and continual improvement.

Performance of the entity against the specific 
commitments, goals and targets along-with 
reasons in case the same are not met.
At present, Signatureglobal (India) Limited is finalising the detailed, time-
bound ESG commitments outlined in our newly adopted three-phase 
roadmap (see preceding Point No. 5). Because these targets formally 
take effect from FY 2025–26 onward, no discrete, year-end performance 
metrics can yet be reported for FY 2024–25. During the year, management 
focused on the prerequisite groundwork, namely:
1.	
Governance & oversight – restructuring of an ESG Steering 
Committee, to be led by senior management, to guide strategy and 
implementation.
2.	
Baseline data capture – completion of the first group-wide GHG 
inventory and site-level water- and waste-data automation pilots.
3.	
Policy framework – ESG Steering Committee approval of the Net-
Zero, Sustainable Procurement, Waste Management, and ESG 
Governance policies that underpin forthcoming targets. 
Until the full suite of quantitative KPIs (e.g., Scope 1-3 emission-reduction 
milestones, water-intensity benchmarks, supplier-audit thresholds) is 
formally adopted in FY 2025-26, performance can only be assessed 
qualitatively. Accordingly, no target shortfalls—or explanations thereof—
are reported for the current period. The first comprehensive progress 
review, including measurable variances and corrective actions, will be 
disclosed in the FY 2025-26 ESG/BRSR report.
Governance, leadership and oversight

Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As we begin implementing the ESG Vision and Roadmap approved this 
year, Signatureglobal (India) Limited has already laid the groundwork 
for transparent, accountable sustainability leadership: we completed 
our first double-materiality assessment, finalised a suite of foundational 
policies—from Net-Zero and Climate-Change to Waste-Management and 
Supplier Code of Conduct—and mapped them to GRI, SASB, and BRSR 
standards, giving every business unit clear guardrails for responsible 
growth. Our immediate priority for FY 2024-25   is the Year 1 “Foundation 
& Data Infrastructure” target set in the roadmap: publish a GRI/BRSR-
aligned ESG report, issue a sustainable-construction blueprint, and roll 
out project-level data ingestion automation for energy, water, and waste. 
Looking ahead, we view reducing embodied carbon in materials, aligning 
our decentralised supply chain with evolving policies, and strengthening 
data assurance as key opportunities to advance our ESG vision. With 
dedicated oversight from the ESG Steering Committee, tracking progress 
quarterly, we are committed to driving meaningful impact and look forward 
to sharing our journey in the annual ESG report.

SECTION C: PRINCIPLE WISE PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE
This section is aimed at helping entities demonstrate their performance in integrating the Principles and Core Elements with 
key processes and decisions. The information sought is categorized as “Essential” and “Leadership”. While the essential 
indicators are expected to be disclosed by every entity that is mandated to file this report, the leadership indicators may be 
voluntarily disclosed by entities which aspire to progress to a higher level in their quest to be socially, environmentally, and 
ethically responsible.
PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that is 
Ethical, Transparent and Accountable.
At Signatureglobal (India) Limited, integrity is not just a compliance requirement — it is a core pillar of how we do business. 
In FY 2024–25, we conducted structured training programs for all governance levels, including the Board of Directors, Key 
Managerial Personnel (KMPs), and employees. These initiatives are aimed at fostering a culture of transparency, ethical 
awareness, and proactive compliance.
Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, applicable to all directors and Senior Management, guides our actions in 
managing conflicts of interest, upholding anti-corruption practices, and ensuring accountability. No cases of bribery, corruption, 
or conflict of interest were reported during the year. The company maintains a robust whistleblower mechanism, along with 
strict policies to prevent unethical conduct across the value chain.
Signatureglobal (India) Limited also extended ethical awareness to external stakeholders through regular value chain training 
programmes, covering topics like environmental management, fire safety, and health protocols, ensuring a responsible 
ecosystem beyond internal operations.
Through these ongoing efforts, we not only safeguard our reputation and investor confidence but also contribute to broader 
goals of ethical governance and inclusive growth.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
At Signatureglobal (India) Limited, environmental responsibility is embedded into every aspect of our business. Our commitment 
to environmental stewardship is reflected through sustainable project design, resource efficiency, and waste minimization 
strategies. During FY 2024–25, we made measurable progress across energy efficiency, GHG emissions management, water 
conservation, and waste management practices.
The Group significantly enhanced renewable energy consumption through commissioned solar plants, contributing over 202 
GJ of clean energy. While total energy use increased with business growth, our energy intensity per unit of built-up area 
remained low, evidencing operational efficiency. Scope 1 and 2 emissions were closely monitored, with zero reported instances 
of non-compliance or adverse environmental impact.
We have implemented Zero Liquid Discharge across project sites through advanced STP systems and dual plumbing networks, 
ensuring treated water is reused for landscaping and flushing. Air emission levels, including Nox and PM10, are periodically 
monitored through accredited laboratories, with values remaining within permissible limits.
Sustainable construction practices, such as use of high-performance glass, solar lighting, and energy-efficient pumps, have 
reduced our environmental footprint and earned us certifications like EDGE and recognition from IGBC. Construction waste 
reuse is part of our zero-waste policy, and all metallic scrap is managed responsibly. Additionally, we are strengthening supplier 
assessments to extend environmental accountability across our value chain.

In line with our commitment to responsible waste management and our Zero-Waste Policy, we have strengthened our 
tracking and reporting of waste generated across our project sites in FY 2024–25. This year, we have systematically 
captured data across multiple waste categories—specifically for Construction & Demolition (C&D) waste—ensuring that 
such waste is either recycled, reused, or duly managed in accordance with regulatory norms and sustainability best 
practices. This reporting does not currently include steel waste.
	
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Y/N) If 
yes, name of the external agency. No
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Responsible waste management is a vital aspect of sustainable project development. In this regard, waste management 
encompasses eliminating waste where possible, minimizing it where feasible, and reusing materials that might otherwise 
become waste. Signatureglobal (India) Limited has adopted appropriate measures for the handling, storage, transportation, 
and disposal of waste across both construction and operational phases of its projects. These efforts form the foundation 
of the waste management practices implemented at our construction sites.
	
For non-hazardous waste—such as metal scraps and construction debris—the maximum feasible amount is reused 
directly at the site. In addition, we work with authorized recyclers to ensure proper disposal and recycling of remaining 
materials. Hazardous waste is managed with care and disposed of through authorized third-party vendors, in line with 
applicable waste management regulations. This comprehensive approach of Reusing, Reducing, and Recycling not only 
upholds sustainability principles but also contributes to the advancement of a circular economy.

Signatureglobal (India) Limited advocates for fair, transparent, and inclusive policy environments that align with the long-term 
sustainability of the real estate sector. The Group actively participates in public policy dialogue through memberships in reputed 
national trade and industry bodies. These engagements help the Group stay informed on key regulatory developments, 
offer constructive inputs on policy formulation, and promote the adoption of sustainable and ethical business practices 
across the sector.
Our involvement with organizations such as ASSOCHAM, CEEW, NAREDCO, and IGBC reflects our commitment to responsible 
advocacy. Through these platforms, Signatureglobal (India) Limited voices its positions on regulatory clarity, green building 
incentives, infrastructure development, and real estate reforms. All such activities are conducted in a transparent, collaborative, 
and non-partisan manner, in line with our ethical code.
We have not received any adverse regulatory observations related to anti-competitive behavior or policy misconduct. The Group 
reviews its public policy positions periodically and incorporates stakeholder feedback through internal governance mechanisms 
before engaging in policy-related communication.

PRINCIPLE 8: Businesses should promote inclusive growth and equitable development
Signatureglobal (India) Limited is committed to creating a lasting social impact through inclusive growth and equitable 
development. While the Group has not undertaken any statutory Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) or Rehabilitation 
& Resettlement (R&R) initiatives in the current reporting period, its extensive CSR efforts reflect a strong commitment to 
community empowerment, especially for marginalized and vulnerable groups.
The Group’s Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM), managed by a dedicated committee, ensures the timely redressal of 
community concerns. All CSR projects, such as Paathshala, Jaagruk Beti Swasth Beti, Women Empowerment Initiatives, 
Aarogyarise, Maa Madhuri Brij Varis Sewa Sadan Apna Ghar Sansthan, Sanshil Foundation for Welfare, Shakti Shiksha Nyas, 
Shri Vedic Mission Trust, Hare Krishna Movement Vrindavan, Affordable Quality Health, and Dev Animal Voluntary Organisation 
(DAVO), are carefully designed to address local needs, benefiting over 68,000 individuals, with 100% of them belonging to 
vulnerable or marginalized sections of society in most cases.
In terms of sustainable sourcing, nearly 24% of inputs were sourced from MSMEs or small producers, and almost 100% 
from within India, reinforcing local economic participation. However, procurement from marginalized/vulnerable groups is not 
yet formalized.
Although job creation currently concentrates in metropolitan areas, Signatureglobal (India) Limited continues to assess 
opportunities for enhancing employment diversity and regional inclusion.
