 We make every effort to integrate safety into all business processes. We also have an internal safety audit mechanism in 
place to verify compliance with internal standards as well as statutory requirements. Workers are involved in safety audits 
& can report unsafe conditions in safety committee meetings. We make our best effort to resolve these issues in a timely 
manner.  Safety incidents are reported, investigated and lessons learnt are communicated widely within the organisation.  
 
Measures taken to ensure safe and healthy workplace:
 
• 
 A safe working environment is critical and is reinforced via ongoing learning of technical operations, machine handling,

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
 We are dedicated to safeguarding the rights of all our employees and workers by ensuring a work environment devoid of 
physical, verbal, or mental abuse. Our organisation maintains a strict “zero tolerance” policy against harassment based on 
race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy, age, nation of origin, disability, and 
any other actions that could create an objectionable or intimidating work atmosphere, including unwanted or unsolicited 
sexual advances.
 
 To address and prevent sexual harassment in the workplace, we have implemented a comprehensive policy that includes 
mechanisms for receiving and addressing complaints. A dedicated committee has been established to oversee the effective 
functioning of this policy. We ensure that complainants face no adverse consequences in cases of discrimination and 
harassment, and we maintain the anonymity of the complainant as a matter of policy.
 
 We have developed and enforced Whistle-blower Policy, Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) and Diversity & Inclusion 
Policy policies to effectively mitigate adverse outcomes in cases of discrimination and harassment. These policies are designed 
to reinforce our commitment to providing a workplace that offers equal opportunities for all, free from discrimination. We

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
 
 Our manufacturing units have comprehensive business continuity and disaster management plans, complete with regular 
mock drills. We understand the critical need for uninterrupted operations, even during unexpected challenges. Through 
frequent business impact assessments (BIA), we pinpoint potential threats such as natural disasters, supply chain issues, 
hazards, and public health crises. We are dedicated to deploying effective mitigation strategies to reduce these risks. 
Leadership closely monitors and reviews compliance issues periodically.
 
 We maintain detailed business continuity plans, aligning with National Disaster Management Authority Guidelines, to ensure 
preparedness and effective responses to various scenarios.
 
 Collaborating with our suppliers, we identify vulnerabilities and strengthen our supply chain resilience, ensuring all key 
vendor dependencies have backups. To protect our data and IT systems, we perform regular risk assessments and audits 
on cybersecurity, both internally and through independent experts/agencies. Refer our Business Continuity Policy for further 
details.

Principle 8: Businesses should promote inclusive growth and equitable development.
Globalisation and technological progress have led to rapid economic growth, but the resultant advantages have not been equally 
distributed. We seek to rectify this disparity by addressing heightened economic and social instability, as well as global challenges.
