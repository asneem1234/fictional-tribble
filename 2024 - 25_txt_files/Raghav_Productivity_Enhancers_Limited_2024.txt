or Opportunity (R/O)
Rationale for identifying the risk/

In case of risk, approach to

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative)
1
Health of Workers 
– Exposure to 
Silica Dust & 
Risk of Silicosis
Risk
Prolonged exposure to silica 
dust poses serious health risks, 
including silicosis, leading to 
increased medical costs, reduced 
workforce productivity and 
potential regulatory penalties.
Implementing advanced 
dust suppression 
systems, regular air 
quality monitoring, 
providing workers with 
high-grade personal 
protective equipment 
(PPE), conducting periodic 
health check-ups and 
enforcing strict workplace 
safety protocols.
Negative – Increased 
compliance and health 
management costs. 
However, long-term 
mitigation efforts reduce 
legal liabilities and enhance 
workforce productivity, 
leading to potential 
long-term financial stability.
2
Energy 
Consumption and 
Carbon Emissions
Risk
High energy consumption and 
associated carbon emissions can 
lead to increased operational costs 
and regulatory scrutiny, especially 
with the global shift towards 
low-carbon economies.
Invest in energy-efficient 
technologies, adopt 
renewable energy 
sources, and implement 
energy management 
systems to monitor and 
reduce consumption.
Negative – Initial investment 
costs; however, long-term 
savings from reduced 
energy expenses and 
potential incentives for using 
renewable energy.
3
Supply 
Chain Disruptions
Risk
Dependence on a limited number 
of suppliers or geopolitical factors 
can disrupt the supply of raw 
materials, affecting production 
schedules and costs.
Diversify supplier base, 
establish long-term 
contracts with key suppliers, 
and maintain strategic raw 
material reserves.
Negative – Potential 
increase in procurement 
costs; however, ensures 
continuity of operations and 
mitigates production risks.
4
Product 
Innovation for 
Sustainable Solutions
Opportunity
Growing market demand for 
environmentally friendly and 
sustainable products presents an 
opportunity to differentiate from 
competitors and capture new 
market segments.
Invest in research and 
development to create 
eco-friendly ramming mass 
products with enhanced 
performance and lower 
environmental impact.
Positive – Potential for 
increased market share 
and premium pricing for 
sustainable products.
5
Market Demand for 
Sustainable Practices
Opportunity
Increasing consumer and investor 
preference for companies with 
strong sustainability practices 
can open new markets and 
investment opportunities.
Enhance transparency in 
sustainability reporting 
and actively market the 
company's ESG initiatives.
Positive – Access to new 
markets and potential for 
increased investment.

operational efficiency thereby lowering power usage. Additionally, the integration of advanced VSI-based technology strengthens our efforts to 
minimize emissions and optimize resource utilization. Furthermore, our contributions to the secondary steel sector promote more sustainable and 
economically viable practices, reinforcing our commitment to fostering a circular economy and supporting sustainable industrial growth.
	
People are at the heart of our operations, and we prioritize their safety, growth, and well-being. We are committed to achieving zero workplace 
fatalities, reinforcing our safety protocols through continuous training and strict compliance. Beyond our workforce, we engage with communities 
through skill development, education, and healthcare initiatives, fostering inclusive and responsible growth.

ethical business practices, and responsible procurement. Strong risk management and global partnerships ensure our supply chain aligns with 
sustainability principles, strengthening trust with stakeholders and investors.

combined with cutting-edge research and global expansion, has enabled us to thrive in 35+ countries. Looking ahead, we remain committed to 
enhancing energy efficiency, embedding circular economy principles, and expanding our social impact.
