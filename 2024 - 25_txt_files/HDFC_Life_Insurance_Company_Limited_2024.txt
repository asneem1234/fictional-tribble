A brief on types of customers
 
HDFC Life serves a diverse customer base across individual and institutional segments, addressing 
a broad spectrum of protection, savings, and investment needs through life insurance solutions. 
Life insurance serves not only as a safeguard against financial disruption due to events such as death 
or critical illness but also as a disciplined mechanism for long-term savings and wealth creation.
 
The customer segments we cater to include:
• 
Individuals: Salaried and self-employed individuals, typically with financial dependents, who seek 
financial protection against risks such as death, critical illness, or disability. Many also use our 
products to cover liabilities like home or personal loans. Additionally, our portfolio includes savings 
and investment-oriented life insurance products that help customers plan for key life goals such 
as children’s education, marriage, or retirement. We also serve senior citizens and retirees through 
annuity and pension solutions that support post-retirement financial stability.
• 
Institutional Clients: Organizations across various sizes and sectors engage with HDFC Life to 
manage employee benefit schemes. These include solutions for group term insurance, gratuity, 
superannuation, and leave encashment, thereby enabling companies to meet their statutory and 
welfare obligations toward their employees.

7.   Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and 
achievements 
Dear Stakeholders,
At HDFC Life, ESG principles are not ancillary. They are central to how we operate, 
grow, and create value for all our stakeholders. Our ESG commitment forms the 
backbone of our long-term sustainability strategy, and we are proud to share key 
achievements and ongoing priorities in this regard.
We are pleased to have received an ‘A’ rating from MSCI, a score of 48 from S&P 
Global, and a rating of ‘low’ risk from Sustainalytics. These reflect our continued 
efforts to align with global ESG benchmarks and enhance disclosure quality.
On the environmental front, we are focused on reducing our ecological footprint. 
Our GHG emissions inventory covers Scope 1 and 2 emissions, along with select Scope 
3 categories. We align our climate-related disclosures with the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and are taking 
steps to improve resource efficiency and support climate resilience.
Social responsibility is integral to our corporate ethos. We continue to invest in 
creating a safe, inclusive, and empowering workplace that promotes diversity and 
equal opportunity. Our focused efforts on gender diversity have resulted in women 
comprising 28.2% of our workforce across roles and levels.
We also remain committed to community development through structured CSR 
programs, targeted partnerships, and active employee volunteering. These initiatives 
are aimed at making a meaningful difference to the lives of those we serve.
Our governance practices are rooted in transparency, accountability, and ethical 
conduct. A diverse and experienced Board of Directors guides our decisions, 
supported by strong internal controls, compliance frameworks, and enterprise risk 
management systems to protect stakeholder interests.
Looking Ahead
We believe companies that embed ESG into their core strategy are better positioned 
to manage risks, unlock efficiencies, and drive sustainable returns. As we move 
forward, we remain steadfast in integrating ESG considerations into all facets of our 
operations and strategy.
We thank you, our valued stakeholders, for your continued trust and support. 
Together, we look forward to building a future defined by responsibility, resilience, 
and shared progress.
Warm regards,
Niraj Shah (Executive Director & Chief Financial Officer)

offerings affect the economy, environment, and society. They also serve as a vital feedback mechanism on 
its products, service delivery, community initiatives, and other key activities.

the development of risk mitigation and improvement measures. Engagement frequency and mode are 
tailored based on stakeholder type, relevance, and the degree of business impact. This approach ensures 
the business remains aligned with stakeholder expectations and emerging realities.

instrumental in shaping the company’s ESG agenda.
 
 Building on these insights, the Company undertook detailed internal assessments across FY2023–24 and

8. 
 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment 
cases.
 
 HDFC Life has established a comprehensive Whistleblower Policy that includes strong safeguards to protect 
individuals who report incidents of discrimination, harassment, or other misconduct. The policy ensures that 
complainants are not subjected to retaliation, victimization, or any form of adverse treatment for raising 
concerns in good faith.
Protection is extended to whistleblowers who:
1. 
Follow the prescribed disclosure process;
2. 
Act in good faith without malicious intent;
3. 
Cooperate with the investigation while maintaining confidentiality.
In such cases, the Company takes all necessary steps to prevent any detrimental actions—such as 
harassment, threats, or biased behavior—against the complainant. Disclosures are handled with strict 
confidentiality, and if the investigation process requires revealing the source, appropriate protective 
measures are implemented.
Anonymous complaints are also considered, provided they include specific, credible, and verifiable 
information. While anonymity is respected, the Company encourages identification to facilitate a more 
effective investigation. Frivolous or malicious complaints, however, are discouraged and may lead to 
disciplinary or legal action.
HDFC Life also extends protection to employees involved in the investigation process, reinforcing its 
commitment to a safe, respectful, and transparent workplace.

Inherent limitations 
Sustainability reporting involves the application of management judgment in the selection and application 
of criteria, estimation techniques, and underlying assumptions. The absence of a universally accepted set of 
measurement frameworks for non-financial information may result in varying approaches and interpretations 
by different organizations. This may affect comparability between entities, even when similar disclosures are 
made.
Furthermore, non-financial information is often subject to inherent limitations such as data availability, evolving 
methodologies, and estimation uncertainties. Certain sustainability indicators may be derived from third-party 
systems or involve extrapolation, and as such, they are subject to risks of approximation or inconsistency in 
documentation or methodology over time.
As with any assurance engagement, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements may remain 
undetected due to fraud, error, or misrepresentation.
Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control 
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) and have the required competencies and 
experience to conduct this assurance engagement. 
The firm applies Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures

Standards Board of the ICAI. This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information are prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing 
the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances. 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
