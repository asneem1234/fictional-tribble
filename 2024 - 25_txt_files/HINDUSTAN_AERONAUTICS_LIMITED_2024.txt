Scope and Approach
Sustainability Actions Private Limited (“SAPL”) has been 
engaged by the management of Hindustan Aeronautics 
Limited (“HAL” or “the Company”), as an Independent 
Reasonable Assurance Provider of the Company’s Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) Core Matrices 
(refer to Annexure I) for the Financial Year 2024-25.
Reporting Criteria
Our reasonable assurance covers the sustainability Information 
listed in Annexure-I of this report. The reporting boundary is 
disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of 
the BRSR, with exceptions noted under respective questions.
The criteria utilized by the Company to prepare the identified 
sustainability information are as follows:
• 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements), Regulations, 2015, as amended;
• 
Chapter IV-B of SEBI master circular for compliance with 
the provisions of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations by listed 
entities, issued vide SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 and 
dated November 11, 2024;

and

Management Responsibilities
The Company’s Management is responsible for identification 
of key aspects, content and presentation of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report in accordance with 
the Criteria mentioned above. This responsibility includes the 
design, implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report and measurement of BRSR Core Matrices 
which are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
Independent Assurance Statement
Independence and Quality Control
We are independent from the entity in accordance with the 
requirements of independence and quality assurance set out 
in BRSR provisions and professional pronouncements and have 
fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance 
with these requirements.
Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption that 
the data and information provided by the company to us as 
part of our review have been provided in good faith and free 
from material misstatements. We were not involved in the 
preparation of any statements or data included in the Report 
except for Assurance Statement. Our firm applies International 
Standard on Quality Management and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. We apply SQC 1 for quality control in 
assurance and related services.
Reasonable Assurance
A reasonable assurance engagement includes identifying and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information, whether due to fraud or error, 
and responding to the assessed risks as required by the 
circumstances.
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of 
sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed the disclosures 
presented within the Report and referenced information, 
and sampled the disclosures and were reviewed through the 
company’s customised sustainability information management 
system.
The procedures conducted were based on professional 
judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, 
inspection 
of 
documents, 
evaluation 
of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical 
procedures, and reconciliation with underlying records. Given 
the circumstances of the engagement, in executing the 
procedures outlined above, we:
• 
Obtained an understanding of the identified sustainability 
information and related disclosures;
• 
Acquired knowledge of the assessment criteria and 
assessed their adequacy for evaluating and/or measuring 
the identified sustainability information;
• 
Conducted inquiries with Company’s management, 
including the environment team, compliance team, human 
resources team, and other relevant personnel responsible 
for preparing the Report;
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
158
• 
Developed an understanding and performed an evaluation 
of the design of key systems, processes, and controls 
for recording, processing, and reporting the identified 
sustainability information at the corporate office and 
other locations.
• 
Based on our understanding and the potential risks of 
material misstatement in the identified sustainability 
information, we determined the nature, timing, and 
extent of further procedures.
• 
We tested the Company’s process for compiling 
sustainability information by comparing or reconciling it 
with the underlying records.
• 
We verified the consolidation of data from various 
plants and offices on a sample basis within the reporting 
boundary to ensure the completeness of the reported 
data.
We believe that the evidence we have gathered is both 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable 
assurance opinion.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
conclusion on the identified sustainability indicators, based on 
the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with 
the International Standard for Assurance Engagements other 
than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 
(‘ISAE 3000’), and the terms of reference for this engagement 
as agreed with the Company. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject 
Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to 
issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures 
selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of 
the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
Reasonable Assurance Opinion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the company’s identified sustainability 
criteria as per BRSR core framework for the financial year ended 
31st March 2025 are not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
Inherent Limitations
We have relied on the information, documents, records, data, 
and explanations provided to us by the Company for the 
purpose of our review. The assurance scope excludes:
•	
Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the scope 
section above
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period
•	
Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy 
and other related linkages expressed in the Report.
•	
The reported financial data are based on audited financial 
statements issued by the Company’s statutory auditors 
which is subject to a separate audit process. We were not 
involved in the review of financial data from the Annual 
Report.
•	
The Company’s statements that describe expression of 
opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward looking 
statements provided by the Company and assertions 
related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive 
issues.
•	
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other 
than those mentioned in Reporting Criteria above.
•	
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s 
internal controls when determining the nature and extent 
of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not 
designed to provide assurance on internal controls.
•	
The procedures did not include testing controls or 
performing procedures relating to checking aggregation 
or calculation of data within IT systems.
