Please indicate responsible material business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental 
and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the 
same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following 
format:

1.
Emissions
Management
Risk
Manufacturing processes 
generate emissions 
due to energy use, 
industrial operations, 
fuel consumption 
etc. Globally, climate 
change is leading to 
stricter regulations and 
compliances. If not
managed, this can lead 
to climate risks and 
regulatory penalties
Measure Scope 1 
and 2 emissions 
regularly; shift 
to clean fuels; 
adopt cleaner 
technologies.
Negative – Penalties 
or loss of contracts if 
emissions are too high; 
Positive –Reduced 
costs with efficiency 
improvements.
2
Energy
Management
& Energy
Efficiency
Opportunity
The production processes 
of auto components 
manufacturers involve 
the use of fossil fuels and 
energy, which leads to 
both direct and indirect 
emissions of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs).  The 
majority of the energy 
consumed in the auto 
parts business comes 
from purchased power.
The industry is also being 
urged to lower
GHG emissions 
by regulators and 
customers.  Access to 
alternate energy sources 
and dependence on 
other forms of energy 
may become more 
crucial as overall energy 
efficiency costs and 
hazards are managed.
NA
Positive- Reduced input 
costs and enhanced 
Environmental 
performance can 
improve operational 
margins and 
stakeholder trust.

Waste 
management
Opportunity
Waste generated by 
the industry includes 
machine lubricants and 
coolants, solvent cleaning 
systems, paint, and scrap 
metals and plastics. 
Violating environmental 
regulations may increase 
legal expenses as well as 
capital expenditures for 
pollution control facilities.
NA
Positive- Reuse of 
materials can reduce 
costs
4
Product
Quality &
Safety
Risk
Driving inherently carries 
the risk of accidents, 
which may lead to injuries 
or fatalities involving 
drivers, passengers, or 
pedestrians. While many 
factors can contribute 
to accidents, defective 
vehicle components 
significantly increase this 
risk.
If an auto components 
manufacturer fails to 
identify and address such 
defects before products 
reach the market, the 
consequences can be 
severe — including large-
scale recalls, regulatory 
penalties, and legal 
liabilities. Therefore, 
maintaining high 
standards of product 
quality and safety is not 
only critical for protecting 
end-users but also 
essential for preserving 
brand reputation and 
financial stability.
Rigorous quality 
control processes, 
ISO 9001 / QMS 
certifications, 
product testing, 
and regular client 
audits.
Negative – Warranty 
claims and OEM 
dissatisfaction if 
compromised;  
Positive – High quality 
builds, loyalty and 
pricing power

5.
Product
Design & Life
Cycle
Management
Opportunity
Motor parts and 
components that lower 
vehicle fuel consumption 
are becoming more 
and more in demand 
from automobile 
manufacturers. Fuel-
efficient parts and 
components are essential 
for lowering emissions 
due to, energy efficiency 
improvements, and other 
considerations.
Companies who design 
and produce these parts 
may see a boost in sales 
who are increasingly 
dealing with more 
stringent environmental 
rules and consumer 
demands for greener 
vehicles.
NA
Positive – New product 
offerings, regulatory 
compliance in global 
markets, and circular 
economy alignment.
6
Training & 
Education 
& Employee 
Engagement
Opportunity
In an industry that 
is increasingly being 
shaped by automation, 
electrification, digital 
tools, and evolving 
customer expectations, 
a skilled workforce is 
essential. Continuous 
training not only helps 
employees stay current 
with new technologies 
and industry standards 
but also strengthens 
product quality, 
innovation capability, and 
operational efficiency. 
Learning a culture 
contributes to employee 
engagement, satisfaction, 
and retention— 
especially important in 
manufacturing setups 
where attrition and 
skill gaps can disrupt 
productivity.
NA
Positive – Leads to 
improved product 
quality, higher 
productivity, fewer 
errors, and stronger 
employee loyalty, 
ultimately reducing 
costs related to turnover 
and rework.
