2.
Technology 
Risks 
(leveraging AI & 
emerging tech)
Risk
In the rapidly evolving business 
landscape, emerging disruptive 
technologies are reshaping the 
dynamics between clients and 
suppliers.
Clients, facing persistent budget 
constraints, are increasingly 
inclined to reduce back-office 
costs, while suppliers are 
innovating to offer additional 
services and generate 
supplementary revenues. 
Technologies like Cloud 
Computing, Artificial Intelligence, 
Data Analytics software, 
Social Media platforms, and 
Process Automation software 
are revolutionizing the 
Business Process Services 
(BPS) industry, empowering 
businesses to enhance 
efficiency and lower operational 
costs. BPS companies are 
swiftly adapting, leveraging 
these technologies to 
provide value-added services 
through strategic technology 
enablement, partnerships, and 
alliances.
Digital Solutions 
Development:
•	
Recognizing the importance 
of digital transformation, 
the Company has invested 
in the development of 
a wide suite of Digital 
Solutions. These solutions 
encompass Robotics 
Process Automation, 
Digital, and Analytics, 
aligning with the industry's 
shift towards automation 
and data-driven decision-
making.
•	
As part of its productization 
strategy, the Company 
has integrated domain 
expertise with cutting 
edge technology to create 
innovative offerings.
•	
By combining industry 
knowledge with best-
in-class digital tools, it 
aims to deliver high-value 
solutions that address the 
evolving needs of clients 
and capitalize on emerging 
market opportunities.
Digital Solutions 
Development:
Positive Investing in 
digital solutions enhances 
competitiveness and revenue 
potential. Automation 
efficiencies lead to long-term 
cost savings and profitability.
Negative Initial investment 
costs may arise but are offset by 
potential revenue streams and 
efficiency gains.
Productization Initiatives:
Positive Leveraging expertise 
for specialized offerings boosts 
customer satisfaction and 
revenue. Scalable streams 
lead to improved financial 
performance.
Negative Upfront investment 
in  development and marketing 
is required but yields long-term 
growth and market positioning 
benefits.

Human 
Resource Risk
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
•	
Attrition threatens 
operational disruption, 
increased costs, and 
performance inconsistency. 
Difficulty in recruiting and 
retaining skilled talent may 
exacerbate wage inflation, 
impacting profitability 
and competitiveness. 
Inadequate succession 
planning and leadership 
changes can disrupt 
business continuity, 
impede strategic execution, 
and affect employee 
morale. Ethical lapses 
and misconduct pose 
reputational damage, legal 
liabilities, and trust erosion 
among stakeholders.
Opportunity:
•	
Effectively managing 
attrition fosters talent 
retention, stability, and a 
conducive environment 
for growth and innovation. 
Overcoming recruitment 
challenges and managing 
wage inflation enhances 
workforce stability, supports 
expansion, and bolsters 
market position. Strong 
succession planning 
ensures organizational 
resilience, sustains client 
relationships, and fosters 
employee commitment, 
driving long-term success. 
Upholding ethical 
standards enhances brand 
reputation, builds trust, 
and differentiates the 
Company as an ethical and 
responsible business entity 
in the market.
•	
Strengthening talent 
retention through upskilling 
and career development 
initiatives.
•	
Implementing effective

Code of Conduct and 
whistleblowing mechanism 
to address unethical 
behavior.
•	
Ensuring competitive 
compensation and 
succession planning 
aligned with career 
aspirations.
Positive:
•	
Effective retention 
strategies can reduce 
turnover costs and improve 
productivity, potentially 
enhancing financial 
performance.
•	
Successful recruitment 
practices and wage 
management can lead 
to workforce stability and 
operational efficiency, 
possibly improving financial 
outcomes.
•	
Strong succession planning 
ensures leadership 
continuity, mitigating risks 
and maintaining stability, 
potentially supporting long-
term financial growth.
•	
Upholding ethical 
standards and fostering 
a culture of integrity can 
enhance brand reputation, 
build trust, and attract 
investors, potentially 
resulting in long-term 
financial gains.
Negative:
•	
Attrition-related costs, such 
as recruitment and training 
expenses, may negatively 
impact profitability.
•	
Difficulty in recruiting skilled 
talent and wage inflation 
can increase personnel 
expenses, potentially 
reducing profit margins.
•	
Inadequate succession 
planning may result 
in leadership gaps 
and disruptions, 
negatively affecting 
business continuity and 
performance.
•	
Ethical breaches and 
misconduct may lead to

damage, and loss of

PRINCIPLE 2 - Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
Firstsource supports the ethical and sustainable procurement of goods and services. The Company has implemented a 
Sustainable Supply Chain Policy that encourages moral and responsible behavior across the value chain. Through this 
approach, Firstsource seeks to reduce negative environmental impacts and contribute to a better society, while simultaneously 
generating overall value for its stakeholders.
As part of its Quality Management System, Firstsource has adopted ISO 9001:2008 in select centers. The Company also 
adheres to process improvement methodologies such as Six Sigma, Lean, and Kaizen.
Essential Indicators
1.  
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the 
entity, respectively.
	
At present, Firstsource does not systematically track the percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (CAPEX) 
investments allocated specifically to technologies aimed at improving the environmental and social impacts of its 
products and processes.
	
However, the Company remains committed to enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience through 
sustainable digital transformation. Initiatives undertaken include efforts to reduce energy consumption, improve 
resource efficiency, and promote digitalization across service delivery processes.

contribute to environmental and social outcomes, in alignment with its broader ESG strategy.

Governance) guidelines, human rights standards, anti-corruption measures, and environmental stewardship, as 
explicitly detailed in our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct.
	
	
These policies require adherence to local and international laws, promotion of diversity, minimization of 
environmental impacts, and the assurance of safe and humane working conditions. Suppliers are required to 
complete a comprehensive ESG screening questionnaire to ensure compliance with our defined sustainability 
thresholds. Additionally, a supplier awareness program is being implemented through self-paced learning modules 
shared with vendors to reinforce understanding and alignment with our sustainability expectations.

b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
85% of our total procurement spend is directed towards critical and new suppliers evaluated against defined 
sustainability criteria. As part of our onboarding process our new suppliers and top critical vendors undergo 
rigorous background verification and annual ESG compliance assessments conducted by an independent third-
party auditor. These assessments cover ethical business conduct, human rights, occupational health and safety, 
environmental performance, and the prevention of child labor, forced labor, and harassment. Suppliers are required 
to meet defined threshold scores, and corrective actions are undertaken for any identified gaps, thereby ensuring 
responsible and sustained sourcing in alignment with our sustainability objectives.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
As a Business Process Services (BPS) company, Firstsource focuses on delivering service-based solutions rather than 
manufacturing physical products. Therefore, discussions around product health and safety or end-of-life reclamation of 
manufactured goods are not directly applicable to our operations.
	
Firstsource has implemented comprehensive processes to manage materials used across operations in an 
environmentally responsible manner. This includes the reclamation, reuse, recycling, and safe disposal of materials at 
the end of their life cycle.
	
Key initiatives include:
•	 Adoption of waste segregation techniques, where materials are classified into recyclable, reusable, and non-reusable 
categories to ensure responsible disposal through authorized channels.
•	 Management of e-waste in compliance with regulatory guidelines by partnering with certified recyclers who dismantle 
and process components safely.
•	 Implementation of the 5R framework-Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle-to minimize waste generation 
and enhance circularity in internal operations.

circumstances, management may allow early retirement without forfeiting benefits or may extend employment tenure 
based on mutual agreement.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
	
Firstsource adopts a structured four-step stakeholder engagement methodology to consult on key economic, 
environmental, and social (EES) topics. This process includes:
	
1.	
Material issue identification
	
2.	
Stakeholder surveys and consultations
	
3.	
Scoring, ranking, and prioritisation of issues
	
4.	
Mapping of concerns against business impact
	
These consultations involve both internal and external stakeholders and are conducted periodically through digital 
platforms, direct interviews, focus group discussions, and surveys.
	
Insights gathered through this engagement process are reviewed by the ESG and senior leadership teams and 
summarised for presentation to the Board of Directors. Feedback loops ensure that stakeholder concerns are 
systematically integrated into corporate strategy and disclosures. 
2. 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Yes. Firstsource actively engages stakeholders to identify and manage material environmental and social topics through 
a structured materiality assessment process.
	
In FY 2021-22, Firstsource conducted its first comprehensive materiality assessment involving key stakeholder groups 
including employees, customers, shareholders/investors, suppliers/vendors, and community/NGOs. Stakeholders 
were engaged through a Materiality Survey, guided by global standards such as the GRI, SASB, MSCI and asked 
to rate over 40 sustainability issues on a scale of perceived importance. The responses were analyzed, weighted by 
stakeholder group relevance, and consolidated into eight core strategic themes:
•	 Ethical Governance
•	 Empowering Workplace
26
FIRSTSOURCE SOLUTIONS LIMITED
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
•	 Customer Centricity
•	 Economic Performance
•	 Environment and Climate Action
•	 Sustainable Economic Growth
•	 Community Impact
•	 Responsible Supply Chain
	
These themes guided the development of Firstsource’s ESG strategy, and the leadership was actively involved in the 
prioritization and decision-making process.
	
In FY 2022-23, Firstsource reviewed the material topics in light of business stability and confirmed that no revisions 
were required. However, the Company initiated a shift toward aligning its approach with the double materiality principle.
	
In FY 2023-24, the Company formally integrated this principle into its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. 
This alignment supports compliance with emerging regulations and enables structured impact assessments of 
Firstsource's environmental and social footprint.
	
The updated assessment rationalized the previously identified 24 topics to 10 high-priority material topics. Topics such 
as business ethics, ESG governance, and human rights were excluded from the prioritization list as they are considered 
foundational or already well-integrated. Similarly, waste and water management were deprioritized due to limited 
operational impact, though they continue to be monitored and disclosed.
	
New focus areas, such as Decarbonization and Energy Management, were introduced to reflect the Company’s evolving 
environmental commitments and operational realities.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Firstsource prioritizes the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups in its community engagement 
and CSR initiatives. These groups include rural women, students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, 
unemployed youth, patients from underrepresented communities, individuals with disabilities, and children with 
special needs.
	
When selecting beneficiaries for CSR projects, Firstsource’s CSR team and employee volunteers actively engage with 
community members to understand their specific challenges. They co-create solutions with the communities to address 
identified social issues in a sustainable and context-sensitive manner.
	
Firstsource also maintains regular interactions with these communities through its on-ground volunteers, who gather 
feedback and flag grievances. This feedback loop enables timely and relevant response to community needs.
	
Furthermore, Firstsource provides formal grievance redressal channels accessible to all stakeholders, including 
marginalized communities:
•	 Email: grs@firstsource.com
•	 Firstsource's website link: https://www.firstsource.com/
	
These platforms allow stakeholders to raise concerns, which are then routed to the appropriate teams for resolution, 
ensuring inclusive and equitable grievance handling.

the onboarding process.
