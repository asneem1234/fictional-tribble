Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/
No) If yes, provide details of the same.
	
As required under the Companies Act 2013, the Company obtains Annual Declarations from the Directors and KMPs, and 
also periodical declaration for the changes, if any, to the declaration made earlier. The declarations help the Company to 
identify the conflict and avoid such transactions as appropriate. Further, the Director, interested in any subject matter, will 
recuse himself from the meeting and move out of the meeting room. In the discussion on the evaluation of Directors by 
the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Director concerned will not participate, while he is being evaluated by 
other members.
	
The Code of Conduct for Directors, KMPs and Senior Employees also has an appropriate process to disclose the 
conflict situation.
PRINCIPLE 2
Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
Essential Indicators
1.	
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the environmental 
and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity, respectively.
	
In our efforts to enhance the environmental and social impacts of our construction processes, we have invested in aluminum 
formwork technology. Aluminum formwork is a sustainable alternative to traditional wooden formwork, significantly reducing 
timber usage and minimizing deforestation. It also helps in reducing construction waste due to its reusability. Socially, the 
lightweight nature of aluminum formwork reduces the physical strain on workers and lowers the risk of on-site injuries, 
promoting a safer working environment. Additionally, the precision and efficiency of aluminum formwork result in high-
quality, durable structures, contributing to safer and more resilient buildings for end users
2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No). If yes, what percentage of inputs were 
sourced sustainably?
	
YES. SPL integrates sustainability into its supply chain and is driven by the Sustainable Supply Chain Management Policy 
(SSCM)
	
The Company gives priority to purchasing locally available materials/products of high quality to minimize environmental 
impact and gives preference to green-certified field products (including FSC and other products)
	
Approximately 19% of the inputs were sourced sustainably.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.

quarters to improve hygiene and comfort for caregiving personnel, painting select sections of the facility to create a cleaner 
and more uplifting environment, providing essential vessels to support the daily food distribution for residents, and installing 
geysers to ensure the availability of hot water—especially important in elder care.
	
We are pleased to report that all planned interventions were successfully implemented, reflecting our commitment to values 
such as compassion, dignity, and responsible corporate citizenship.

1
Promoting sustainable 
construction*
Significant change we have made is the modification of 
our concrete mix composition. Instead of relying solely 
on high cement content, we have introduced GGBS as 
a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM). GGBS is 
a byproduct of manufacturing iron in a blast furnace. By 
incorporating GGBS, we not only reduce the amount of 
cement needed but also decrease the carbon footprint 
associated with cement production.
Reduction in the water usage by replacing conventional water 
curing with curing compound.
And in case of water curing, sprinkler technique has been 
adopted instead of conventional type.
Rod straightening machine implemented to use the lower 
dia rods which may end up as scrap.

Wastewater Management
Wastewater generated is treated at the sewage treatment 
plant (STP) and reused efficiently for secondary consumption 
purposes like gardening, landscaping and flushing. This 
process significantly reduces our dependence on potable 
water, thereby conserving precious water resources.

Water Conservation Initiatives*
To reduce water waste, implemented several water 
conservation measures, ensuring the use of low-flow fixtures 
and efficient irrigation methods. These measures include:
•	
Water-efficient showerheads
•	
Water-efficient bathroom faucets
•	
Efficient water closets
•	
Water-efficient kitchen faucets
27% water savings

Renewable Energy*
Power usage in common areas at Park 63 is converted to 
green power sources to reduce our carbon footprint. This 
initiative includes the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) 
modules thus ensures sustainable energy practices are 
adopted throughout the project.
7
Implementation of Voided 
Slabs*
We have utilised in applicable areas Voided slab technology 
has been adopted where it is a sustainable construction 
method aimed at reducing the environmental impact of 
concrete structures. By incorporating filler material within 
concrete slabs, voided slabs significantly reduce the amount 
of concrete & steel needed for construction. This results in 
a substantial decrease in carbon emissions associated with 
cement production, contributing to a greener and more 
sustainable built environment.
8
Implementation of Waffle 
Slabs*
We have utilised in applicable areas Waffle slab technology 
has been adopted where it is an innovative construction 
approach designed to minimize the environmental impact 
of concrete structures. By utilizing a grid pattern of ribs on 
the underside of slabs, waffle slabs reduce the amount 
of concrete required for construction while maintaining 
structural integrity. This reduction in concrete & steel usage 
results in decreased carbon emissions associated with 
cement production, making waffle slabs an environmentally 
friendly choice for building projects. Additionally, waffle slabs 
offer enhanced structural efficiency, allowing for larger spans 
and reduced need for columns, further reducing material 
usage and environmental footprint.
The adoption of waffle slab 
technology has contributed to 
significant reductions in concrete 
consumption and associated 
carbon emissions.

free numbers (1800 2030 575) listed in all our emails or email our help desk at customer.helpdesk@shriramproperties.
com, which is included in the signature block of our customer communications. We have implemented a digital system to 
collect and resolve complaints.
	
Complaints received by our pre-sales, sales, and CRM teams generate an automated ticket and an auto-acknowledgment 
(or manual acknowledgment for refund cases without a booking ID) is sent to the customer. Senior executives oversee 
the resolution process to ensure effective governance. Our system promptly creates tickets to track complaint progress, 
and the details of each complaint are included in the signature block of all emails sent to customers. We keep customers 
updated on their complaint status through regular email updates, and the complaints are forwarded to the relevant team 
or department for resolution.
