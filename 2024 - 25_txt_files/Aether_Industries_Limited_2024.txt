Product 
safety
Risk
Safety concerns regarding individuals, 
manufacturing defects, or insufficient 
disclosure of product-related risks 
can result in substantial product 
liability claims, exposing companies to 
financial ramifications associated 
with adverse events and product 
recalls. Biotechnology and 
pharmaceutical companies that 
effectively reduce the occurrence of 
product recalls, safety issues, and 
regulatory enforcement actions are 
better positioned to safeguard 
shareholder value.
This entails rigorous testing 
and quality control 
measures to identify and 
mitigate any unintended 
characteristics that may 
pose health or safety risks 
to end-users. 
Furthermore, careful 
management of product 
testing, as well as 
monitoring and controlling 
chemicals, content, and 
ingredients in products, is 
essential to uphold safety 
standards across all sectors 
served by the company.

agencies for the disposal of liquid and powder chemical waste after treatment 
on our end. Furthermore, a 15 MW hybrid power plant has also been operational.

(C)Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of

As a company operating within the chemical sector, we acknowledge the significance of minimizing waste and 
lessening our environmental footprint. To this end, we've instituted a comprehensive waste recycling initiative 
aimed at diminishing waste generation and discovering inventive methods for its reuse or recycling. Our program 
encompasses several key initiatives: 
Waste Reduction: 
We've implemented strategies to curtail waste production through more efficient production methods, reduced 
raw material usage, and optimized supply chain management. 
Waste Segregation:  
Ensuring recyclable materials are separated from non-recyclables maximizes our ability to reuse or recycle waste. 
Recycling Partnerships: 
Collaborating with local recycling facilities and specialists allows us to recycle waste effectively, including 
operating our Solvent Recovery Plant. 
Education and Training: 
Providing employees with education and training on waste reduction and recycling fosters awareness and 
participation in environmental stewardship. 
Innovation: 
Investing in research and development enables us to explore novel technologies and processes for repurposing 
waste materials into new products. Our waste recycling endeavours have not only reduced our environmental 
impact but also led to new business opportunities and cost savings. Embracing a circular economy model allows 
us to conserve resources, diminish waste, and deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. 
Overall, we view our waste recycling program as integral to our sustainability commitment and responsible 
business conduct. We remain steadfast in our dedication to discovering fresh, innovative approaches to curbing 
our environmental impact and building a more sustainable future.

(A)Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)?SMS,  exhibitions gatherings, etc to understand their needs. 
Currently the Company does not conduct LCA, but have made the decision to conduct Life Cycle Assessments 
(LCA) for all of our products wherein we will be analysing the environmental impact of our products from their 
initial creation all the way through their use and eventual disposal. 
Conducting LCAs offers several advantages. Firstly, it allows us to identify areas where we can reduce our 
environmental footprint, whether it's through optimizing manufacturing processes, choosing more sustainable 
materials, or improving end-of-life disposal methods, it also it aligns with our vision of being a responsible 
corporate and creating a positive impact on the environment for future generations. 
(B)If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of 
your products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any other

(D)Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation. 
 
The entity has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge mechanism. The ZLD plant is designed to treat wastewater 
and minimize the amount of liquid waste produced. Here is a breakdown of the treatment process. Industrial 
effluent from the various stages of the process is collected and treated in an Effluent, Treatment Plant having 
primary treatment facility. The effluent is first collected in Collection tank. The effluent is then transferred into 
Equalization cum Neutralization tank and retained for enough time, where pH of the effluent is raised to 8.5 by 
addition of lime solution from lime dosing tank. Effluent is then pumped to primary settling tank, where 
suspended particles are settled. The primary treated effluent is collected into a collection tank. The settled sludge 
from primary settling tank is dewatered and dried in a Filter Press. The filtrate collected is returned to the 
neutralization tank for treatment. The dried sludge is sent to the TSDF site for secured land filling. Then the primary 
treated effluent is Going for stripper to Remove Low Volatile Organic and Bottom Material Is Going for Evaporation 
in MEE/MVR. The Condensate from Evaporation System is transfer for Secondary treatment (SBT Plant).

SBT Treatment: 
SBT is based in bioconversion process where fundamental action of nature namely, respiration, Mineral weathering 
and photosynthesis are brought about in a controlled media containing Selected micro and macro-organisms. 
Accordingly in the said process three fundamental Reactions of this plant viz. 1) respiration brings about removal of 
organics by oxidation of the Organic molecules 2) mineral weathering brings about pH correction 3) while 
photosynthesis Serves to regulate the process at work.In coming pH is in range of 6-7 and has to be adjusted with 
lime treatment before taking to the filter (this is done in neutralization section). Advanced Oxidation is provided as 
treatment using ozone generator to break down molecules to smaller size and to improve BOD/COD ratio. This 
biological treatment is a batch processes in which wastewater is pumped and applied into the top surface of the 
Bioreactor as shown in Figure. The design has suitable provision for manual removal of suspended solids from the 
bio-filter surface. Distribution of wastewater over the media is achieved via pumping, piping and distribution 
arrangements. Separate distribution lines are provided for raw wastewater as well as recycle water. The 
suspended Water first percolates through the bioreactor media which in houses cultured media in 40-60 mm and 
gets collected into the collection tank. It can then be pumped on to the media again (recycling) in order to achieve 
maximum solid liquid contact. The recirculation mode is provided for further polishing of the effluent. Dissolved 
organic and inorganic are oxidized and the water is purified further. The SBT Treated Effluent  is feed in to R. O. Plant. 
From R. O. Plant, R. O. Permeate water is recycle in to Utilities .  Reject Water is subjected to Evaporation and 
Condensate is Recycle to Utility.
(E)Please provide details of air emissions (other than GHG emissions) by the entity. 
 
The air emissions of the entity were not monitored for any of the financial year. 
Aether, has recognized the importance of air quality and its impact on public health and the environment. To 
ensure that their operations are environmentally responsible, they have decided to monitor their air emissions 
going forward. By monitoring their air emissions, Aether can identify areas for improvement and take proactive 
steps to reduce their impact on the environment. This could involve implementing measures to reduce emissions
