Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.
	
The Company has adopted comprehensive waste management practices guided by the principles of the 3R’s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). 
Hazardous wastes are disposed of only through agencies authorized by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), and all waste generation 
remains within the prescribed limits under SPCB/CPCB consents. Dedicated procedures, aligned with ISO standards and statutory 
obligations, are implemented to minimize hazardous waste generation. These are subject to internal audits twice a year and annual 
external audits by authorized agencies.
	
At all facilities, waste is segregated into hazardous and non-hazardous streams and stored in designated sheds for safe disposal as per 
SPCB norms. Organic waste from kitchens is further utilized to derive energy, supporting circular economy principles.
	
Through these measures, the Company demonstrates its commitment to responsible waste management and environmental 
sustainability
