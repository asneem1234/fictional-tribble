1.
Environmental Impacts 
of Project Development
R
Environmental 
impact 
is 
a 
critical concern due to the nature 
of our projects which involve 
construction and operation of 
water and wastewater treatment 
infrastructure. It can affect local 
ecosystems, water sources, and 
land use patterns. Regulatory 
authorities’ rules on environmental 
protection are strict, so we must 
carefully manage these impacts. If 
we don’t follow the rules, it could 
lead to heavy fines, extra costs to 
fix the damage, and harm to our 
reputation.
To reduce the environmental impact of our projects, we 
carefully follow all the environmental laws and standards that 
apply at both the local and national levels. Before starting any 
project, we make sure to get all the necessary permits and 
approvals. This helps us ensure that everything we do is legal 
and meets the required environmental rules.
In addition to following the laws, we are deeply committed to 
protecting the environment. One way we show this commitment 
is through our ISO 14001 certification. This certification 
means that we have put in place a strong Environmental 
Management System (EMS). This system helps us identify 
any possible environmental impacts our projects might have, 
manage those impacts carefully, and work to reduce them 
throughout every stage of the project.
Our EMS is not just a set of rules; it is a continuous process 
that helps us improve how we protect the environment over 
time. By following these steps—obtaining proper approvals, 
complying with laws, and using our EMS—we aim to complete 
our projects in a way that supports sustainability. We want 
to make sure our projects do not harm the environment while 
also meeting all legal requirements and being responsible 
members of the community.

2.
Structural Integrity & 
Safety
R
Mistakes 
or 
low-quality 
work during the design and 
construction 
of 
buildings 
or 
infrastructure can cause serious 
problems. These problems might 
include injuries to people, a drop 
in property value, and financial 
losses. If the structure is not 
properly managed for safety and 
strength, it could lead to costly 
redesigns or repairs later on. It 
can also result in legal issues and 
harm the company’s reputation, 
which may make it harder to grow 
or win new projects.
To prevent these risks, companies 
should aim to meet or even 
exceed the latest industry quality 
standards. 
They 
should 
also 
put strong internal checks and 
controls in place to find and fix 
any design problems early on. 
This approach helps ensure the 
safety, durability, and success of 
the project, protecting both people 
and the company’s future.
To manage the risks related to structural safety and the strength 
of our projects, we follow strict quality management practices 
that are supported by our ISO 9001:2015 certification. This 
certification shows our strong commitment to keeping high-
quality standards at every stage of project development, from 
start to finish.
Our Quality Management System (QMS) helps us ensure that 
we use only top-quality materials and the best construction 
methods available. We make sure these meet or go beyond 
the usual industry standards to guarantee the reliability and 
safety of our work.
At every step of the project — whether it’s during design, 
purchasing materials, construction, or the final inspection 
— we carry out careful and thorough quality checks. These 
checks help us confirm that both the materials used and the 
workmanship are of the highest standard.
By following these quality practices and using the clear 
guidelines provided by our ISO 9001:2015 certification, 
we significantly reduce the risk of structural failures. This 
also lowers the chances of having to spend extra money on 
redesigns or repairs later on. Most importantly, it helps us 
deliver projects that are safe, strong, and built to last.

Workforce Health & 
Safety
R
The health and safety of our 
workforce are crucial due to the 
hazardous nature of construction 
and treatment activities. Stringent 
labour compliance requirements 
in India require us to ensure 
effective 
health 
and 
safety 
measures which are necessary to 
prevent accidents.
To reduce and manage risks related to worker safety, we follow 
both OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 45001 standards. These 
certifications show our strong commitment to maintaining 
high levels of health and safety for everyone involved in our 
operations. At EMS Limited, safety is not just a requirement 
— it is one of our core values and an important part of how we 
do business.
Across all our Engineering, Procurement, and Construction 
(EPC) and Operations & Maintenance (O&M) sites, we have 
put in place several safety systems and procedures to make 
sure that the work environment is safe for everyone.
One of the key things we do is provide comprehensive safety 
training for every person who enters our project sites. This 
ensures that all workers, contractors, and visitors understand 
the safety rules, know how to work safely, and are aware of the 
potential hazards.
We also use a robust work permit system. This system ensures 
that supervisors are fully aware of all ongoing tasks and that 
no job starts without a proper safety check. Before any work 
begins, safety risks are assessed, and all necessary precautions 
are taken. This includes using the right protective equipment, 
ensuring tools are in good condition, and confirming that the 
work area is safe.
By following these practices and standards, we create a culture 
of safety and take proactive steps to protect the health and 
well-being of everyone at our work sites.

Business Ethics
R
high ethical standards is very 
important 
for 
protecting 
our 
company’s 
reputation 
and 
making sure we follow all laws 
and regulations. If we do not act 
ethically, it can lead to serious 
problems like financial loss and 
damage to our reputation.
Since 
we 
work 
closely 
with 
government 
authorities 
on 
construction 
projects, 
it 
is 
especially important for us to be 
honest, fair, and responsible in 
everything we do. Maintaining 
strong 
business 
ethics 
and 
integrity is a top priority for us.
To manage risks related to business ethics, EMS is 
committed to maintaining the highest standards of honesty 
and transparency. We have clear policies in place to ensure 
ethical behavior and legal compliance. These include strict 
rules against insider trading, a strong whistle-blower policy to 
safely report misconduct, and a Code of Conduct for our senior 
management and board. We also follow a Risk Management 
Policy to handle potential ethical and operational risks. In 
addition, our anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies help 
prevent unethical financial practices. Together, these steps 
build a culture of integrity, reduce ethical risks, and strengthen 
our reputation and operations.

Technology and 
Innovation
O
Technology 
and 
innovation 
open up great opportunities for 
businesses to grow and work 
more efficiently. By using the 
latest tools and smart solutions, 
companies can cut costs, improve 
quality, and get more done in 
less time. Tools like automation, 
smart systems, and data analysis 
help manage resources better 
and make operations smoother. 
These 
advances 
also 
support 
sustainability, help meet changing 
rules, and give businesses an 
edge over competitors. Technology 
can also make work safer, faster, 
and more accurate by using real-
time information and predictions. 
In short, using technology and 
innovation 
helps 
businesses 
perform better, grow faster, and 
stay ahead in the market.

activities, including exposure to chemical, biological, and pathological hazards; providing 
personal protective equipment (PPE), establishing requirements for its use, and enforcing 
compliance; delivering safety training for all personnel in their language, covering hazards 
and safety protocols related to their jobs; offering special training for specific hazards such 
as open water, trenches, slippery walkways, working at heights, energized circuits, heavy 
equipment, entry into confined spaces, fires, and explosions; recording incident statistics, 
including total work hours, lost time incidents, major injuries, fatalities, and near-miss 
incidents; ensuring adherence to the EHS Plan by subcontractors; planning objectives and 
targets for Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Environmental Sustainability (ES); 
conducting incident investigations, reporting, implementing corrective actions, and ensuring 
horizontal deployment; managing contract safety; and providing training and awareness 
programs. The Company recognizes its duty to identify workplace hazards and address them

anonymously. In addition, the Company respects every employee’s right to stop working and 
move away from any situation they believe is unsafe, without facing any punishment. Once 
a concern is raised, the situation is reviewed, and necessary actions are taken before work 
continues. All these safety procedures are outlined in a document called HIRA, which stands for

dangers, understand the level of risk, and decide the best way to reduce or eliminate those
