1.
Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Climate change poses a significant 
risk to the Rico Group’s operations 
and long-term sustainability, mainly 
due to high energy consumption 
and heat emissions from its 
commercial activities. These 
factors contribute to environmental 
degradation and rising costs. 
Recognising this, the Rico 
Group is committed to adopting 
more sustainable practices by 
implementing an integrated energy 
management system focused on 
renewable energy. This approach 
will help to reduce energy costs, 
minimise heat emissions, and lower 
the Rico Group’s carbon footprint, 
ultimately improving environmental 
performance and resilience.
The Rico Group is 
progressively integrating 
climate-related 
considerations into 
business planning and 
operations. It is working 
towards improving energy 
efficiency in manufacturing 
processes, enhancing 
the share of renewable 
energy in its energy mix, 
and investing in cleaner 
technologies like replacing 
its fuel powered furnaces 
into electric furnaces. It is 
also evaluating Scope 1 
and Scope 2 Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions 
and has initiated several 
measures towards 
reducing the same.

3.
Waste 
management
Risk and Opportunity
Waste management and disposal 
can create environmental and 
operational risks for the Rico Group, 
including pollution, regulatory issues, 
and higher costs if not managed well. 
At the same time, focusing on waste 
reduction and circular economy 
practices offers a chance to improve 
performance. By adopting waste 
minimisation, reuse, and recycling, 
the Rico Group can reduce risks, 
use resources more efficiently, and 
support sustainability.
The Rico Group has 
implemented waste 
segregation practices 
at source, invested in 
authorized recyclers 
and ensures compliance 
with Hazardous Waste 
Management Rules and

Rules as applicable.

water management benefits 
local communities, ensures 
long-term business continuity,

investors.

Employee 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Unsafe working conditions can lead 
to workplace incidents, regulatory 
penalties, reduced employee 
morale, and reputational damage. It 
impacts internal stakeholders such 
as employees, contract workers, 
and unions, as well as external 
stakeholders such as regulators, 
auditors, and customers who 
prioritize responsible supply chains. 
Poor safety performance can also 
disrupt operations and affect overall 
productivity.
The Rico Group has 
implemented International 
Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 
45001 aligned with 
statutory requirements 
and industry best 
practices. Regular safety 
trainings, mock drills, 
risk assessments, and 
audits are conducted 
across facilities. The 
Rico Group promotes 
a safety-first culture 
through awareness 
campaigns and employee 
engagement. Personal 
protective equipment 
(PPE) and other safety 
equipment’s usage is 
strictly enforced, and 
incident reporting systems 
are in place to ensure 
continuous improvement. 
Periodic health check-
ups, hygiene monitoring, 
and ergonomic 
interventions are also 
part of Rico Group’s 
preventive health strategy.

Enhancing gender diversity and 
promoting a culture of engagement

a more inclusive, motivated, and 
productive workforce. These 
initiatives positively influence 
internal stakeholders such as 
employees and management, while 
also aligning with the expectations 
of customers, investors, and 
partners committed to responsible 
business practices. A strong 
culture of inclusion can improve 
talent retention, innovation, and 
operational efficiency across the 
value chain.

Emissions
Risk 
Rising GHG emissions expose 
the Rico Group to regulatory, 
operational, and reputational risks. 
Stricter emissions norms, carbon 
pricing, and stakeholder expectations 
can increase compliance costs and 
affect access to markets, especially 
from global OEMs focused on 
decarbonization. This risk impacts 
investors, customers, regulatory 
bodies, and communities across the 
value chain.
The Rico Group is 
proactively working to 
monitor and reduce 
its GHG emissions 
through energy 
efficiency initiatives, 
process optimization, 
and increased use of 
renewable energy. The 
Rico Group is tracking 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions. Investments 
in clean technologies, 
awareness programs, 
and alignment with 
future regulatory 
requirements are 
key strategies being 
adopted. The Rico 
Group is also exploring

reduction targets in line

climate commitments.

Responsible

Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Inadequate oversight of 
Environment, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) practices 
in the supply chain may lead to 
reputational damage, compliance 
issues, and business disruptions, 
impacting key stakeholders 
including OEM customers, 
suppliers, investors, and 
regulatory bodies. Conversely, 
a responsible supply chain can 
enhance operational resilience, 
stakeholder trust, and long-term 
competitiveness.
The Rico Group is 
strengthening its supply 
chain governance by 
promoting adherence 
to its Supplier Code of 
Conduct, which covers 
ethical, environmental, 
and social standards. 
The Rico Group is in the 
process of developing a 
comprehensive supplier 
evaluation framework 
that includes ESG 
criteria. Responsible 
sourcing practices are 
being adopted to ensure 
traceability, regulatory 
compliance, and 
alignment with customer 
expectations.

(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
As a manufacturer of automobile components, the Rico Group’s products are directly supplied to the OEMs as per their requirements, 
hence the Rico Group has very limited scope for reclaiming it at the end of its life cycle. Hence, the Rico Group has not reused, 
recycled or disposed any e-waste, hazardous or any other waste. However, the Rico Group has reclaimed some of the plastic 
(packaging material) to be reused or disposed.

recognizing the growing importance of evaluating the environmental impact across a product’s entire life cycle, from raw material sourcing 
to end-of-life disposal, the Rico Group is actively considering the adoption of such assessments in the near future. These evaluations may 
be integrated into its sustainability roadmap in the coming years to further enhance environmental responsibility and support data-driven 
decision-making for product design and development.

of these measures is to safeguard the continuity of business operations and minimize downtime in the event of unforeseen incidents 
that could impact the Rico Group’s infrastructure, personnel, or processes. By doing so, the Rico Group aims to maintain operations

some class of its value chain partners as well.
	
Furthermore, the Rico Group is currently in the process of formulating a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes a detailed 
checklist covering key parameters across ESG dimensions. These assessments are intended to be implemented in the near future as 
part of the Rico Group’s broader sustainability and responsible sourcing initiatives.
