Failure 
to address this issue 
may 
affect

highlighting ESG 
related 
challenges, 
targets 
and 
achievements  
“In my role as the Director of Business Responsibility, I am delighted to share our 
significant achievements in addressing Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) challenges.  
 
Our commitment to sustainability has strengthened our positive impact on the 
environment, our stakeholders, and the communities we serve.  
 
As part of our continued commitment to responsible and sustainable business 
practices, our Bank recognises the critical role of Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles in driving long-term value creation. In line with the 
initiatives of the RBI to promote Sustainable practices, the bank has a Climate 
Risk Framework and we have initiated steps to align our internal policies, 
governance structures and risk management processes. 
 
Challenges:  
 
Challenges remain in embedding ESG principles across all operational layers. We 
remain committed to continuous improvement and transparency in our ESG 
journey, guided by the evolving regulatory expectations. 
 
The Bank is in the process of preparing a framework on ESG and setting clear 
short and long-term targets to address various aspects under UN SDGs. This 
includes identifying material ESG risks, enhancing our sustainability disclosures, 
and integrating ESG considerations into our lending and investment decisions. 
 
Moving Towards Our ESG Targets and Achievements: 
 
This year, we have made significant progress towards our ESG targets. Water 
intensity per rupee of turnover improved from 14.78 (FY 23-24) to 13.96 (FY 24-
25), and Scope 1 emissions were reduced from 571.19(FY 23-24) to 330.06 (FY 
24-25) metric tonnes. 
 
Despite opening 75 new branches and facing higher electricity tariffs electricity 
consumption increased by only 4.87% reflecting effective energy management. 
The Company’s workforce grew by 5.76% during the year. Training participation 
rose to 97%, and investment in employee well-being increased, demonstrating 
our focus on inclusion and workforce development. 
 
While these achievements are encouraging, we remain committed to advancing 
our ESG goals and driving sustainable growth in the years ahead.”

The Bank’s Vigilance department is responsible for overseeing and managing all matters related to 
human rights. This involves monitoring compliance, addressing concerns, and ensuring adherence to 
human rights standards and regulations within the organization. By assigning this responsibility to the 
Vigilance department, the Bank underscores its commitment to upholding human rights principles and 
creating a workplace environment that respects and safeguards the rights of every individual.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
Recognizing the critical importance of addressing human rights grievances, the Bank strictly prohibits 
the use of child, forced, or compulsory labour in its operations. It enforces a ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy 
on sexual harassment, supported by an internal complaints committee to handle such issues. 
 
The Bank has also established a Whistleblower Policy that provides a comprehensive framework for 
receiving and addressing complaints or grievances from stakeholders. These complaints may involve 
corruption, unethical business practices, behavioural concerns, and other matters. This platform 
allows employees to securely report any violations or concerns related to human rights or employee 
welfare. We ensure complete confidentiality in managing the information submitted, promptly 
directing it to the relevant authorities for appropriate action.

Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and

The Bank’s Whistleblower Policy guarantees the following: 
• 
Confidentiality and Protection: To protect the identity of the complainant, the Bank will not 
issue any acknowledgement of receipt of the complaint. The Complainant also should not 
enter into any further correspondence with the Bank in their own interest.  
 
• 
Protection Against Retaliation: The policy protects whistleblowers from retaliation, 
including threats, intimidation, termination, disciplinary measures, transfers, demotions, 
discrimination, harassment, or any misuse of authority that obstructs their duties or further 
disclosures. 
 
• 
Additionally, an intranet portal exclusively accessible to women employees has been 
established, enabling them to report genuine concerns in a secure manner. This platform 
ensures confidentiality and provides protection to women complainants. 
 
 
• 
Redressal Mechanism: If any employee is aggrieved by any action on the ground that he/she 
is victimized due to filing of the complaint or disclosure, he may file an application before 
the MD & CEO of the Bank seeking redressal in the matter. The MD and CEO shall take such 
action, as deemed fit. The MD and CEO will prevent initiation of any adverse personnel 
action against the complainant.  
 
This policy is designed to promote the reporting of concerns while ensuring the protection and rights 
of whistleblowers within the organization.

10.  
Briefly 
describe 
the 
waste 
management 
practices adopted in your establishments. 
Describe the strategy adopted by your company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
As the Bank operates exclusively in financial 
services and does not engage in manufacturing 
activities, it nonetheless maintains sustainable 
waste management practices to ensure the proper 
disposal of any waste generated. 
 
a) E-waste, Plastic and Battery waste - The Bank 
arranges for the transportation of plastic waste to 
local vendors for processing and disposal. Proper 
management of e-waste is essential for both 
security and environmental reasons. Accordingly, 
computers and related accessories are handed 
over to vendors or certified disposal agencies. 
Additionally, the Bank has established a reporting 
and monitoring system to track the collection, 
disposal, and recycling of battery waste. 
 
b) Hazardous Waste - As a banking company, our 
operations do not involve the use of hazardous or 
toxic chemicals, and therefore, we do not produce 
any related waste. 
 
c) other waste - Due to the nature of the Bank’s 
business, other types of waste are not applicable.

complaints via a portal on our website, ensuring timely resolution of grievances. All complaints are 
logged into the CCMS and acknowledged promptly. Additionally, the system provides a mechanism 
for customers to track the status of their complaints until they are fully resolved. Complaints received 
via email or letter are also manually entered into the CCMS and acknowledged accordingly. 
 
This structured approach ensures efficient handling and resolution of customer complaints in line 
with RBI guidelines and enhances customer service and feedback mechanisms.
