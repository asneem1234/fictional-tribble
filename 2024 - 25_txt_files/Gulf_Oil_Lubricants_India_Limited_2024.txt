to incorporate best practices and enhance supplier accountability on environmental and social parameters. GOLIL has 
been certified for compliance with Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) Plastic Management under the ISO 14021 Type II 
Environmental Declaration. As part of this, PCR procurement vendors were audited to verify their sourcing practices 
in line with environmental standards. Certified by IRQS after a detailed audit, the assessment covered their readiness

Product
Process to reclaim the product
Plastics 
(including packaging)
The Company fully complies with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 (PWM Rules) and 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requirements. To fulfil these obligations, it has partnered 
with a certified Waste Management Agency (WMA) for the collection of post-consumer plastic 
packaging waste across all operating states. The collected waste is channelled to authorized 
recyclers or disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner, in strict adherence to statutory 
norms. Through its WMA, the Company ensures achievement of mandated EPR targets, thereby 
along with this also meeting its End-of-Life (EOL) responsibilities.
Within the manufacturing facilities, all plastic waste is managed through authorized agencies, which 
route the material to approved recyclers or disposal partners. Record-keeping and compliance 
monitoring are overseen by the Plant EHS team.
In addition, GOLIL has achieved first of its kind in the industry a certification for Post-Consumer 
Recycled (PCR) Plastic Management under ISO 14021 Type II Environmental Declaration. As part 
of this initiative,

Process to reclaim the product
PCR procurement vendors underwent rigorous audits to verify sourcing practices against 
environmental standards. Certified by IRQS following a comprehensive assessment, the audit also 
validated vendor readiness to supply lubricant packaging incorporating 30%, 50%, and 100% 
PCR material. This strengthens the Company’s commitment to circularity, resource efficiency, and 
the transition towards sustainable packaging solutions in coming future.

As part of its compliance with EPR regulations, GOLIL is accountable for obligations across plastic, battery, and used oil 
categories. The Company is committed to the safe disposal of packaging materials and achieving the targets set by the 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). For the financial year 2024–25, CPCB has mandated GOLIL to recycle 4,732.77 MT 
of plastic packaging waste and meet an End-of-Life (EOL) target of 4,768 MT, with the plastic EPR target expected to be met 
by September 30, 2025. In the prior fiscal year (2023–24), GOLIL successfully fulfilled its plastic recycling obligation of 7,085 
MT of rigid plastic via an authorized Waste Management Agency and filed the annual return accordingly. Additionally, for FY 
2024–25, the company has a battery recycling target of 692.72 MT and has already met the FY 2023–24 battery EPR target of 
714.51 MT, with the corresponding return filed. GOLIL is also registered as a Producer under the Used Oil EPR category with 
CPCB, the Company has used oil recycling target of 3,015.29 MT assigned for used oil.
Leadership Indicators

Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
	
While GOLIL has not yet undertaken a formal Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for its products, we recognise its critical role in 
evaluating environmental impacts across the entire value chain. We are actively assessing suitable LCA methodologies and 
industry-relevant tools, with the objective of initiating assessments for priority product categories in the coming years.

If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal 
of your products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any 
other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same.
	
As we have not yet conducted a formal Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for our products, no LCA-based risks have been 
identified to date. However, through internal reviews and stakeholder engagement, we recognise potential environmental 
concerns such as greenhouse gas emissions during production, energy and water use, and the responsible disposal of 
used lubricants. To address these, GOLIL has implemented initiatives including increased renewable energy use, process 
efficiency improvements - These measures form part of our ongoing efforts to mitigate impacts while we work towards 
integrating formal LCA insights into our sustainability strategy.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
	
	
Yes, GOLIL has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System, certified 
under ISO 45001:2018, across all its manufacturing plants locations. This system ensures a safe and healthy work 
environment for employees, contractors, truck drivers, customers, and other stakeholders. The OHS management 
system is not only established and implemented but is also continuously reviewed and improved to maintain high 
safety standards. The ISO 45001 surveillance audit for FY 2024–25 has been successfully completed, reinforcing our 
ongoing commitment to international best practices.
	
	
As part of our proactive safety culture, regular safety briefings are conducted for truck drivers by the security team 
upon every plant entry, along with alcohol testing at gates to safeguard both personnel and vehicles. We also ensure 
safe drinking water and clean restroom facilities for drivers and cleaners, recognizing hygiene as a key component of 
occupational safety. 
	
	
Additionally, as a part of our GO SAFE (Safety First Awareness Campaign) at GOLIL, we are driving a culture of 
proactive safety by encouraging employees to actively report unsafe conditions, acts, and near misses. This initiative 
has significantly boosted safety consciousness across the organization, with near miss reporting increasing tenfold 
contributing to measurable improvements in our overall safety performance. Each quarter, safety officers are deployed 
to new locations to conduct targeted awareness training and ensure timely closure of safety audits. With the goal of 
achieving a zero-incident workplace, GO SAFE will continue as an ongoing initiative, reinforced at regular intervals to 
foster continuous learning and safety excellence. 
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
	
GOLIL follows a structured approach to identifying and assessing work-related hazards for both routine and non-
routine activities. Our Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process encourages employees to actively 
identify hazards and report them, ensuring that potential risks are addressed promptly. The site leadership team 
regularly reviews these hazard assessments to ensure their effectiveness. We also value the input of workers through 
safety toolbox talks, providing a platform for discussing safety concerns and sharing experiences.
	
	
Additionally, GOLIL has implemented a work permit system for high-risk activities and conducts safety walks to ensure 
safety practices are consistently applied across operations. For environmental risk management, we occasionally 
carry out impact studies to mitigate potential environmental hazards.
	
	
To further enhance our safety culture, we provide ongoing Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) training to ensure 
employees understand and follow safe practices. We also regularly review and update hazard assessments through 
safety audits and internal evaluations. 
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, GOLIL has implemented procedures that enable all employees to report workplace hazards and withdraw from 
unsafe conditions. These mechanisms include a suggestion box, safety committee meetings, safety walkthroughs, 
toolbox talks, and systematic reporting of near-miss events.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
24
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (Contd.)
	
	
Yes, GOLIL ensures that all employees have access to comprehensive non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services. At our manufacturing sites, we have an Occupational Health Centre (OHC), which is staffed by a doctor 
and a nurse to provide routine medical care and periodic health check-ups for employees including other than 
permanent employees. 
	
	
In addition to in-house healthcare services, we offer medical insurance for all permanent employees and their families, 
which includes an option for additional coverage if required. Other than permanent employees are enrolled in the 
Employees' State Insurance (ESI) scheme.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
Health, safety, and well-being of employees are central to GOLIL’s organizational values. Guided by our comprehensive 
Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Policy, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace through 
structured programs and continuous improvement. Our facilities in Silvassa and Chennai adhere to international standards 
ISO 45001:2018 for Occupational Health and Safety and ISO 14001:2015 for Environmental Management, reinforcing our 
commitment to global best practices.
	
We promote a culture of safety through regular awareness initiatives such as toolbox talks, safety walks, and training sessions 
led by our Safety Committee, with a strong emphasis on personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance and the correct 
use of safety equipment. In FY 2024–25, a total of 3,703 manhours of safety training were completed across both plants. 
	
Additionally, as a part of our GO SAFE (Safety First Awareness Campaign) at GOLIL, we are driving a culture of proactive 
safety by encouraging employees to actively report unsafe conditions, acts, and near misses. This initiative has significantly 
boosted safety consciousness across the organization, with near miss reporting increasing tenfold contributing to 
measurable improvements in our overall safety performance. Each quarter, safety officers are deployed to locations to 
conduct targeted awareness training and ensure timely closure of safety audits. With the goal of achieving a zero-incident 
workplace, GO SAFE will continue as an ongoing initiative, reinforced at regular intervals to foster continuous learning and 
safety excellence.
	
To celebrate and reinforce our safety values, we observe Safety Week annually from March 4 to 10, involving interactive 
sessions, recognition of safety champions through our Safety Awards Program, and campaigns to deepen safety 
consciousness across teams. Periodic medical checkups and access to recreational facilities are also provided, supporting 
both the physical and mental well-being of our workforce. These continued efforts drive us toward our goal of zero incidents 
across all operations.

GOLIL is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace by aligning its operations with international standards such 
as ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems and ISO 14001 for Environmental Management 
Systems. These standards are embedded into the core of our manufacturing practices across all locations. To foster a 
culture of safety, the company conducts regular safety walks, training sessions, and awareness programs aimed at driving 
behavioural change among employees and contract workers.
	
A structured Corrective and Preventive Action approach is followed to address actual or potential non-conformities in the 
workplace. Incident investigations are carried out routinely, with corrective actions focused on awareness-building and 
process improvements. For instance, awareness on drum filling machine workmen’s regarding the operation, associated 
risks, and safety precautions was provided, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been established to guide 
routine activities.
	
Preventive measures such as training contract supervisors and workers and reinforcing the correct use of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) are regularly implemented. In addition, GOLIL conducts monthly hazard identification and 
safety assessments, supplemented by quarterly risk assessments, to proactively identify, evaluate, and address potential 
hazards. Through these ongoing efforts, GOLIL continues to strengthen its safety performance and reduce the risk of work-
related injuries and illnesses.

The Company has implemented a comprehensive Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system across both of its manufacturing 
facilities, demonstrating its strong commitment to sustainable and responsible water management. A combined Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP) and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) is operational at each site, ensuring that no liquid waste is 
discharged beyond the facility boundaries. All wastewater, including sewage, is treated on-site, and the recycled water 
is repurposed for non-potable applications such as landscaping, toilet flushing, and industrial processes. This integrated 
approach not only ensures full compliance with regulatory effluent discharge standards but also significantly reduces 
dependence on freshwater resources by maximizing internal reuse and recycling.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, GOLIL has undertaken a range of targeted initiatives across its Chennai and Silvassa plants to reduce Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) emissions, with a focus on enhancing energy efficiency and integrating renewable energy solutions.
	
Both facilities have commissioned 660 kWp solar power systems, each expected to generate over 645,000 units of clean 
energy annually, thereby reducing reliance on grid electricity and lowering associated emissions. Further, optimization of the 
AdBlue® transfer line has resulted in additional energy savings. 
	
Along with these common initiatives, specific plants have also taken the following measures:
 
 
The Silvassa facility has implemented similar optimization initiatives, achieving comparable efficiency gains. In addition, 
two diesel-powered forklifts have been replaced with battery-operated models, contributing to further reductions in 
fuel consumption and emissions.
 
 
At the Chennai plant, solar capacity was also enhanced from 450 kWp to 610 kWp with the installation of an additional 
160 kWp system. Collectively, these actions reinforce GOLIL’s strategic commitment to lowering its carbon footprint 
through renewable energy adoption and sustain operational efficiency. Additional measures have been introduced, 
including improvements in the additive heating process, blending process optimization, energy efficiency upgrades in 
the QC laboratory, and the launch of a “Zero Compressed Air Leakage” campaign.

Restoration of Hannikallu Mountain Wetland, Wellington, The Nilgiri
Gulf Oil, under its CSR initiative, supported an ecological restoration 
and water conservation project focused on reviving a 2-acre pond and 
adjoining grasslands. The project involved removing invasive weeds, 
upgrading canal systems, and enhancing natural drainage. Dual earthen 
embankments were constructed to prevent soil erosion and stabilize 
the land. Wastewater management was improved in collaboration with 
the Wellington Army. Native plant species were reintroduced to promote 
biodiversity and restore ecological balance. Grasslands were linked 
to nearby water bodies to improve water retention and soil health. The 
initiative has significantly enhanced local green cover and water recharge 
potential. As a result, the site now facilitates an annual groundwater 
recharge of 24.28 million liters. This integrated effort supports long-term 
climate resilience and water security. The project stands as a replicable 
model for sustainable land and water management under corporate social 
responsibility
