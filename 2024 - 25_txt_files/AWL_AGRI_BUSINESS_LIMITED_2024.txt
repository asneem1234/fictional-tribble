A brief on types of customers:
 
 
AWL operates across two complementary verticals: staple food products and Industrial ingredients including 
oleochemicals and castor oils for diverse industrial applications. The company boasts a diversified portfolio of kitchen 
essential staples such as edible oils, wheat flour, rice, pulses, besan, and sugar, where it holds market-leading positions 
across multiple categories. Its flagship brand, ‘Fortune’, is a household name in India for branded edible oils and food 
products, reaching over 113 million households—approximately one in every three Indian homes— and stands as the 
country’s largest-selling edible oil brand. AWL also caters to institutional customers in the food industry by marketing its 
edible oils and food products in bulk. While the majority of its customers are based in India, the company has a growing 
presence in international markets through exports of both branded and bulk products.
 
 
The company supplies its industrial ingredients to a diverse customer base spanning FMCG, pharmaceutical, and specialty 
chemical sectors. These ingredients are integral to the manufacturing of a wide array of products, including personal care 
items, home care solutions, paints, and more. Additionally, the company markets oil meals used as high-quality animal 
feedstock. Its sales are nearly evenly balanced between domestic markets and exports.

ensures 
that 
effluent is not released 
in 
the 
environment 
which can be hazardous. 
Besides 
this, 
more 
than 98% of packing 
material is recyclable, 
thereby 
restricting 
non-biodegradable 
waste. Additionally, we 
are guided by Adani 
Group’s 
Resource 
Conservation 
Policy 
which provides guidance 
to 
various 
business 
units to incorporate the 
principles of circularity 
in 
processes

Statement by director 
responsible for the business 
responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
AWL Agri Business Ltd (AWL)’s (Formerly known as ‘Adani Wilmar Limited’) vision is to be a 
leading agribusiness company committed to sustainably deliver safe, nutritious and quality 
agricultural commodity and food through innovation, highest standards of environmental, 
social and governance practices, and the creation of livelihoods in communities in which we 
operate to deliver long-term value to all our stakeholders.
AWL has always prioritized efficiency in its operations, which has an associated benefit 
of reducing the impact on the environment. This has always led us to invest in advanced 
machinery, technologies, and process improvements to reduce our resource usage, including 
plastics for packaging. Our Integrated Business model, along with the strategic location of 
our facilities has optimized the movement of materials, thereby reducing GHG emissions. 
We have port-based refineries so that imported edible oil can be directly moved to refineries 
through pipelines, eliminating the use of emission-intensive road transport for inward 
logistics.
A large network of 98 depots along with 50%+ direct shipment from factory to distributors, 
optimizes cargo movements. We are increasingly using railways for long-distance shipments, 
which now accounts for around 23% of the volume of our primary dispatches in packaged 
staples. For road movements, we are shifting to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles, 
by incentivizing the fleet owners. As part of AWL’s efforts to expand renewable energy 
usage, we have been adding solar panels to our facilities and have covered 13 locations. 
Renewable sources contributed 11% of our energy consumption in FY25, which we plan to 
enhance significantly in the near future. 98% of our packaging material is recyclable. With 
the assistance of our co-promoter, Wilmar International Limited, we have reached 90%+ 
traceability to mills in palm oil sourcing. We are taking steps to improve sustainable sourcing 
in the domestic markets as well. We are also dedicated to our societal responsibilities, 
investing in various social causes through Adani Foundation. Notably, our Project, Fortune 
SuPoshan focuses on eradicating malnutrition among children aged 0-5, adolescent girls 
and pregnant & lactating mothers. Moving forward, we will continue to expand our efforts 
in sustainability and social initiatives.

AWL Agri Business Limited 
(Formerly known as ‘Adani Wilmar Limited’)
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
 
The installation of rooftop solar stations not only demonstrates the Company's commitment to environmental sustainability 
but also contributes to its efforts in adopting clean and renewable energy solutions. By generating electricity from solar 
power, the Company not only reduces its operational costs but also contributes to mitigating the effects of climate change by 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Utilisation of Biomass as Fuel:
 
In addition to solar energy, the Company is also utilizing biomass as a sustainable fuel source in its boilers. Biomass refers to 
organic materials such as wood chips, agricultural residues, or waste from forestry and agricultural activities that can be used 
as fuel for energy generation. By using biomass as fuel, the Company taps into a renewable and environmentally friendly 
energy source while also reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.
 
Biomass boilers convert biomass materials into heat energy through combustion, which can then be used for various industrial 
processes, including steam generation for manufacturing operations. This approach not only helps in reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions but also contributes to the efficient utilisation of organic waste materials, thereby promoting a circular economy.
Solar Generation Capacity:
 
Currently, the Company has successfully installed rooftop solar stations with a total generation capacity of 7273 kilowatts peak 
(KWp) across its 11 plants. This significant investment in solar energy infrastructure underscores the Company’s commitment 
to transitioning towards sustainable energy practices and reducing its environmental impact.
 
The solar generation capacity represents a substantial contribution to the Company’s overall energy portfolio, allowing it to 
harness clean and renewable solar energy to power its operations. By expanding its solar generation capacity, the Company 
not only reduces its dependence on conventional energy sources but also positions itself as a leader in adopting renewable 
energy solutions within the industry.
Plants Under Commissioning:
 
As part of its ongoing efforts to expand its renewable energy infrastructure, the Company is currently in the process of 
commissioning three additional solar plants. These plants, located in Nimrani, Haldia 1, and Nagpur, are undergoing final 
testing and optimisation to ensure their seamless integration into the company’s energy network.
 
Once operational, these new solar plants will further augment the Company’s solar generation capacity, enhancing its 
ability to meet its energy needs sustainably while also reducing its environmental footprint. The commissioning of these 
plants underscores the company’s continued commitment to investing in renewable energy technologies and advancing its 
sustainability goals.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
 
The Company has adopted various practices to ensure reduced wastage, reuse or recycling of discharged waste as well as 
responsible disposal of the same in line with regulatory guidelines.
 
Following is a brief summary of the some of the practices adopted by the Company:
 
1)  
Wastewater management: Manufacturing units release waste which is treated at our plants for reuse through effluent 
treatment plants. Over and above this, Company has also installed ZLD at major plants. The recycled water is used for 
multiple purposes at the plant locations.
 
2)  
Reuse of Lubricant Oil: All the edible oil refineries produce wastage in the form of lubricant oil. This lubricant oil is resold 
to authorized recycler for further reuse.
 
Besides the above measures of waste management, the Company has also replaced the packaging material used for its FMCG 
products. Today, approximately 98% of the packaging material used is recyclable.
 
Going forward, the Company will assess and closely monitor the usage of various chemicals. The endeavor of the Company 
shall be to find out ways for minimal usage of such chemicals and careful disposal of the same.
