Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Akums Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited recognizes that responsibility extends beyond business performance to include 
environmental sustainability and resource stewardship. The company aims to create long-term value by integrating sustainable 
practices across operations while maintaining its position as a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer.
During FY 2024-25, Akums achieved several environmental milestones. The new facilities at Kotdwar and Haridwar incorporate 
sustainability principles with modern technology while meeting quality and environmental standards. The company has 
implemented measures for natural resource conservation, maintaining soil, air, and water quality, and ensuring ecological 
balance in operational areas. Resources have been allocated toward adopting renewable energy sources across manufacturing 
facilities, reducing carbon footprint. Programs to increase green cover around operational areas have been initiated, contributing 
to improved air quality and ecological health.
Despite progress, Akums faces several sustainability challenges. Managing environmental impact while expanding manufacturing 
capabilities remains a challenge. Pharmaceutical manufacturing requires continuous innovation to optimize water and energy 
usage without compromising quality. Extending sustainability principles throughout supply chain partners requires ongoing 
engagement.
The company continues to integrate eco-friendly practices in manufacturing operations to minimize ecological footprint. By 
focusing on innovation, pharmaceutical excellence, and sustainability, Akums is confident these efforts will strengthen its market 
position while contributing positively to communities and the environment.

Akums adheres to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) rules for plastic waste management and submits 
compliance reports as per statutory requirements. The company operates a plastic recycling plant where 
in-house generated plastic waste is recycled and sold to authorized manufacturers. Additionally, other 
recyclable plastic wastes are collected, stored at designated locations, and disposed of through government-
authorized vendors.
E-waste
All electronic waste is collected and stored at designated locations for sorting before being sent to authorized 
vendors. Records of e-waste management are meticulously maintained using Form 2 of the E-waste Rules, 
2016
Hazardous waste
Hazardous wastes generated within the plants are collected, stored, and disposed of in accordance with 
compliance and consent to operate at each site. The collected hazardous waste is sent to recyclers approved 
by regulatory agencies, ensuring safe and compliant disposal.
Other waste
Other wastes, such as canteen waste, horticulture waste, and municipal solid waste (MSW), are collected 
using color-coded bins, stored, and disposed of sustainably. For instance, canteen waste is decomposed in 
composters and used as manure. Color-coded bins facilitate the segregation and collection of various waste 
categories, promoting efficient waste management practices.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The Company identifies its key stakeholder groups through a comprehensive, data-driven materiality assessment process. This 
process involves engaging with a diverse array of stakeholders across multiple channels—such as surveys, focus groups, and direct 
consultations—to gather both quantitative and qualitative insights. The resulting analysis not only highlights the environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) challenges but also drives strategic sustainability planning and risk management.
	
Based on this assessment, the stakeholder groups are categorized as follows:
Internal Stakeholders:- 
 
 
Employees: The workforce that drives day-to-day operations.
 
 
Management: The leadership team responsible for strategic decision-making.
 
 
Shareholders: Investors whose financial interests align with the company’s long-term value creation.
External Stakeholders:- 
 
 
Regulators: Government agencies and regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA, CDSCO, and local health authorities) that oversee 
compliance and industry standards.
 
 
Healthcare Providers: Physicians, pharmacists, and hospitals that prescribe or dispense the company’s products.
 
 
Suppliers and Distributors: Vendors that supply raw materials, packaging, and ensure efficient distribution channels.
 
 
Communities and NGOs: Local communities where the company operates, and non-governmental organizations focused on 
social, economic, and environmental well-being.
	
Through this structured engagement process, insights from each stakeholder group are synthesized into a materiality matrix 
that prioritizes issues based on both business impact and stakeholder importance. Senior leadership reviews and validates these 
findings, ensuring that the voice of every stakeholder is integrated into strategic decision-making.

meetings, and open forums. Employee feedback on economic, environmental, and social topics is systematically collected

approach ensures that concerns and suggestions from every stakeholder group, including communities and employees, are 
considered and acted upon in a timely and effective manner.

Note: The Company has developed a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory, FY2021 onwards, based on relevant and measurable categories within Scope 
1&2.   For the computation of emissions for scope 1 and 2, emission factors from GHG Protocol tool and CEA were applied to energy consumption quantities 
along with GWP values derived from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6).
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Y/N) 
If yes, name of the external agency.
Yes. For FY 2024, half of the GHG emissions data was audited by the external agency Nangia Andersen LLP. For FY 2025, the 
company plans to obtain external assurance for its GHG emissions data.
