Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR)
SECTION A: GENERAL DISCLOSURES
At Borosil Renewables Limited, our commitment to Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles is deeply 
embedded in our business philosophy and operational strategy. As India’s pioneering solar glass manufacturer, we 
recognize our unique responsibility in shaping a sustainable future. Our ESG framework is designed to create long-
term value for all stakeholders while contributing meaningfully to environmental stewardship, social equity, and ethical 
governance.
We believe sustainable development not merely as a strategic necessity, but as a core ethical commitment that guides 
our business decisions and long-term vision. Our ESG policy reflects our dedication to minimizing environmental 
impact, promoting social well-being, and upholding the highest standards of corporate governance. We invest in 
energy-efficient technologies and responsible sourcing and strive to lead in every aspect of our operations.
Environmental Stewardship: As a responsible corporate, environmental sustainability is at the heart of our operations. 
As India’s leading solar glass manufacturer, we play a pivotal role in supporting the renewable energy ecosystem. Our 
commitment to reducing our environmental footprint is reflected in our continuous efforts to lower carbon emissions, 
conserve natural resources, and promote circular economy practices. Our solar glass has a carbon footprint that is 22% 
lower than the global industry average, as certified by a reputed European institute, underscoring our commitment in 
sustainable manufacturing. We have invested in renewable energy, including a 10 MW wind-solar hybrid power plant 
and 1.5 MW wind farm that will meet approximately 30% of our electricity needs. We are further adding 16.5 MW wind-
solar hybrid power plant which will be commissioned by the end of September 2025 quarter and with that the share of 
renewables will reach to 65% of our electricity needs. Our facilities are equipped with energy-efficient technologies and 
water recycling systems, and we have implemented rainwater harvesting to reduce freshwater dependency. Additionally, 
we are transitioning to sustainable packaging solutions and increasing the use of recyclable materials, such as steel 
pallets, to minimize waste generation. We have developed processes in which we eliminate use of hazardous substances 
like antimony from its products, setting new benchmarks in sustainable manufacturing. These initiatives are part of our 
broader vision to align with global climate goals and contribute to a greener future.
Social Responsibility: Borosil Renewables is deeply committed to fostering a socially responsible and inclusive work 
environment. We believe that our people are our greatest asset, and we prioritize their well-being, safety, and professional 
development. Our workplace policies are designed to ensure health and safety, promote diversity and inclusion, and 
provide equal opportunities for all employees. We invest in continuous learning and upskilling programs to empower our 
workforce and prepare them for future challenges. Beyond our organization, we actively engage with local communities 
through targeted CSR initiatives focused on education, healthcare, and sustainable livelihoods. Our community 
development programs are designed in consultation with local stakeholders to ensure relevance and long-term impact. 
We also extend our social responsibility to our supply chain by encouraging our partners to adopt ethical and sustainable 
practices. Through these efforts, we aim to create shared value and contribute to the socio-economic development of the 
regions in which we operate.

mandatory disclosures, pose 
compliance risks if GHG 
emissions are not effectively 
managed.
•	 There is a reputational risk 
associated with failing to meet 
stakeholder expectations, 
especially from investors, 
•	 Technological advancements 
and enhanced 
operational efficiency can 
contribute to reducing 
GHG emissions. 
•	 The Company promotes 
resource efficiency by 
employing innovative 
technologies and 
processes that minimize

and emissions without 
compromising business 
objectives.
Negative:
•	 Stricter emission control 
regulations might affect

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
At Borosil Renewables Limited, sustainability is not just a strategic priority, it is a core value that guides our decisions 
and defines our purpose. As a key enabler of the renewable energy ecosystem, we are committed to integrating 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles across our operations. The past year has presented both 
opportunities and challenges, from navigating global supply chain disruptions to meeting evolving stakeholder 
expectations. Despite these, we have made meaningful progress in advancing our ESG goals and remain focused 
on building a resilient, responsible, and future-ready organization.
	
Borosil Renewables continues to lead in environmental stewardship by embedding sustainability into its core 
operations. As India’s leading solar glass manufacturer, we have reduced 22% of our carbon footprint which 
is significantly lower than the global industry average through cleaner production technologies and process 
optimization. Our investment in a 10 MW wind-solar hybrid power plant and 1.5 MW wind farm now supplies nearly 
30% of our energy needs from renewable sources. We have developed processes in which we eliminate use of 
hazardous substances like antimony from our products and adopted recyclable packaging materials, reinforcing our 
commitment to responsible manufacturing. Going forward, we aim to further reduce energy intensity and expand 
19
Annual Report 2024-25
our use of renewable energy across operations as we are further adding 16.5 MW wind-solar hybrid power plant 
which will be commissioned by the end of September 2025 quarter and with that the share of renewables will reach 
to 65% of our electricity needs.
	
We place strong emphasis on inclusive growth and employee well-being. Our workplace policies promote diversity, 
equal opportunity, and safety, supported by regular training and wellness initiatives. We actively engage with local 
communities through CSR programs focused on education, healthcare, and sustainable livelihoods. Across our 
value chain, we advocate ethical labour practices and support skill development to uplift workers and partners. Our 
goal is to deepen community engagement and enhance workforce diversity, ensuring that our growth benefits all 
stakeholders equitably.
	
Governance at Borosil Renewables is anchored in transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct. Our Board of 
Directors provides strategic oversight, supported by committees that ensure compliance with regulatory standards 
and ESG integration. We have a robust Code of Conduct and Whistleblower Policy to uphold integrity across 
the organization. Regular disclosures and stakeholder engagement help maintain trust and alignment with global 
governance benchmarks. As we scale, we remain committed to strengthening our governance framework to support 
sustainable and responsible growth.
	
We continuously monitor our progress toward achieving our ESG objectives, taking necessary actions to ensure 
we remain on track. Our commitment extends to developing processes that raise awareness of environmental 
concerns among both our internal team and external stakeholders. We regularly update them on our ESG goals 
and the progress we are making. Our ESG initiatives are managed through a structured approach involving three 
tiers within the Company:
i.	
Executive Leadership – The Executive Chairman and Vice-Chairman provide oversight and strategic 
direction, ensuring alignment with the Company’s broader vision.
ii.	
Steering Committee – This committee supervises ESG initiatives, coordinates with external agencies and 
internal teams, and ensures timely execution of projects.
iii.	
Cross-Functional Team – Responsible for data collection and reporting, this team ensures accurate tracking 
and communication of ESG progress.
	
Through this structured framework, we aim to make our ESG efforts effective, transparent, and aligned with 
our strategic objectives. We are dedicated to fostering an organizational culture that prioritizes sustainability 
and social responsibility, contributing to a better future for our stakeholders and the environment.

Plastics (Including 
packaging
All our plastic waste is safely stored, transported, and sent to government-authorized recyclers 
for recycling. This ensures that the plastic waste is responsibly managed and recycled, 
thereby reducing our environmental impact.
E- Waste
Electronic waste produced in the factory is kept in designated areas and subsequently sent 
to recyclers authorized by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for further processing. 
Records of e-waste generation and disposal (Form Number 06) are maintained to monitor the 
process in accordance with GPCB guidelines.
Hazardous Waste
We have designated specific areas for the storage of hazardous waste, including empty bags, 
contaminated containers, and used oil. These areas feature closed sheds and secondary 
containment systems to prevent spills. Each storage chamber is clearly marked with 
appropriate signage, and spill kits are readily available at the scrap yard. Hazardous waste 
is stored for a maximum of 90 days. Handling procedures require the use of proper personal 
protective equipment (PPE), coverage under a Workers’ Compensation policy for all personnel 
involved, and a prohibition on hot work activities near the scrap yard. Critical handling of 
hazardous materials involves thorough briefings and documentation. The transportation of 
hazardous waste is strictly regulated, requiring manifests, adherence to GPCB guidelines, 
GPS-equipped vehicles, and end-user consent for reuse or recycling. Specific protocols are 
also established for the disposal of oil-soaked cotton waste, batteries, and plastic drums 
within specified timeframes.
Our plant generates the following hazardous waste:
i.	
Containers, barrels, and liners that have been contaminated with hazardous chemicals 
or waste under Category 33.3.
