During the year, 6 of the Company’s vessels were retrofitted with Mewis Duct, a device which improves the flow of water on to 
propeller and thus its efficiency. It also helps in reduction of underwater noise.
	
During the year, the Company replaced traditional lighting such as fluorescent, halogen and incandescent lights onboard its vessels 
with energy efficient LED lights on 5 vessels.
	
For a typical Bulk Carrier or Tanker, loss of energy through hull resistance is around 25-30% and this increases with growth of hull 
roughness due to bio-fouling. To minimize growth of bio-fouling, the Company has applied superior anti-fouling coatings on 10 vessels 
during their respective dry dockings. Hull cleaning/propeller polishing was carried out in 23 ships.
	
Research & Development – In our pursuit of suitable options for decarbonization we have conducted sea trials with sustainable 
biofuel blended VLSFO on one of our MR tankers to evaluate the impact on machineries and challenges in its storage and handling.

2.	
a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
	
	
The Company is into a business of marine transportation of bulk commodities which does not involve sourcing of 
raw materials as an input for manufacturing any end product. Most of the Company’s supplies to vessels are finished 
products, for example engine spares which are procured from maker or licensee, consumables from reputed oil 
majors, paint and chemical from manufacturers, general stores from ship chandlers who procure multiple line 
items from the market, consolidate and deliver them on board. So, in essence, the Company does not procure any 
raw material as input to our business activities. However, the Company looks for following criteria while selecting 
its vendor for a prospective business –
	
	
1.	
Sourcing from reputable suppliers known in the industry.
	
	
2.	
Vendors are maintaining registration under local/ regional laws.
	
	
3.	
Vendors are complying to National and International applicable legislations.
	
	
4.	
Vendors are maintaining management systems under ISO 9001 and 14001 or any other equivalent systems 
wherever applicable.
	
	
5.	
Suppliers are requested to meet following Company requirements additionally:
	
	
	
a.	
In accordance with SOLAS Chapter 11-1/ Reg 3-5 supplies of materials which contain asbestos are prohibited 
on all ships and “asbestos free declaration” must be provided with every supply made to the vessel.
	
	
	
b.	
The seller shall guarantee that no hazardous material identified under MEPC269(68) and EUSRR have been 
used in the supplies.

and shipboard incineration. To reduce emissions, the Company has implemented following:
•	
In order to improve air quality and protect the environment, from 1 January 2020, the IMO 
limit for sulphur in fuel oil used by ships operating outside of emission control areas (“ECAs”) 
was reduced from 3.50% to 0.50%. This dramatic reduction in SOx emitted from ships will 
provide significant health and environmental benefits around the world, particularly for coastal 
populations and those living near ports. The Company has reduced the Sulphur oxide (SOx) 
emissions by following a mixed strategy of using low Sulphur fuel and installation of exhaust 
gas cleaning systems (EGCS) to comply with the above IMO regulation.
•	
The Company’s applicable vessels are in compliance with NOx emission requirements as per 
MAPROL Annex VI and maintains NOx technical file.
•	
Since 2014, the Company has a dedicated department responsible for vessel performance 
management. They helped in enhancing fuel efficiency of vessels through advising on retro-
fitment of energy saving devices and operational measures. The Company’s list of emission 
reduction measures includes installation of Mewis duct, Propeller Boss Cap fins (PBCF), high 
efficiency Kappel Propeller, LED lighting, use of low friction hull coatings and onboard sensors 
driven data collection systems in order to enable fuel consumption optimization in real time 
on selected vessels.
•	
Over the years, the Company has been consistently following fleet renewal program, selling 
some of our oldest and least efficient vessels and by acquiring modern and efficient ships. This 
has been an important contributor towards enhancing the energy efficiency of the Company’s 
fleet and reducing its GHG emissions.
•	
For EEXI regulation compliance, company has completed the process for calculation of EEXI 
values and approvals of EEXI technical file for all company vessels. The vessels for which 
overridable power limitations are to be installed to meet this EEXI requirements, company 
contracted with makers timely and has already started their installation and expect to complete 
the process for all vessels much before their due dates as per their respective periodical IAPP 
survey. All vessels built after 2014 have Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) certificates.
•	
We have enrolled our 13 ships with voyage optimization software in this fiscal which will also 
help us improve CII ratings for these ships.
•	
To support the IMO 2030 strategy, the Company is exploring investments into alternative 
technologies and fuels. We have ordered redesigned propellers for our 04 LR tankers which 
will be fitted in their respective forthcoming drydocking.
•	
All the Company vessels are complying with regulation 12 of IMO MARPOL Annex VI on Ozone 
Depleting Substance (ODS).
•	
Applicable Company vessels are complying with regulation 15 of IMO MARPOL Annex VI on 
Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) and have implemented Class approved VOC management 
plan.
Ballast water
Ballast water is essential for safe and efficient shipping operations. It reduces stress on the vessel’s 
hull, substituting weight lost due to consumption of potable water and fuel and changes to cargo 
load. However, loading and unloading untreated ballast water poses serious ecological, economic 
and health risks as ships become a vector for the transfer of organisms between ecosystems.

The Company is into a business of marine transportation of bulk commodities and do not manufacture any product for 
sale. However, waste generated on board during normal operation of ship are handled as per vessel specific garbage 
management plan and landed ashore to approved reception facilities for further processing. We supplied 16 vessels with 
shredders to improve the management of wastes onboard. For the e-waste generated at shore offices, the Company has 
tied up with an approved local recycler. The Company tries to re-use the old laptops as far as possible before opting for 
disposal to recycler.

DESCRIPTION

ACTION TAKEN
A ballast water exchange system involves the substitution of water in a ship’s ballast tanks using 
either a sequential, flow-through, dilution or other exchange method which is recommended or 
made obligatory by the IMO. A variety of technologies are used for ballast water treatment, these 
include i.e.: Filtration (physical); Chemical Disinfection (oxidizing and non-oxidizing biocides); Ultra-
violet treatment; Deoxygenation treatment; Heat (thermal treatment) or Magnetic Field Treatment. 
A typical ballast water treatment system on board ships, use two or more technologies to ensure 
that the treated ballast water is compliant with the IMO standards.
As of 31st March 2023, 26 percent of the Company’s vessels are fitted with exchange systems and 
74 percent have installed treatment technology. The Company intends to complete all installations 
of treatment systems by respective vessel’s IMO mandated due date.
Domestic 
Discharges
Sewage: The discharge of sewage from ships into the sea, can create a health hazard and contribute 
to marine pollution. Sewage can also lead to oxygen depletion and can be an obvious visual pollution 
in coastal areas – a major problem for countries with tourism industry.
It is generally considered that on the high seas, the oceans are capable of assimilating and dealing 
with raw sewage through natural bacterial action. Therefore, the regulations in Annex IV of MARPOL 
prohibit the discharge of sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land, 
unless otherwise provided.
All the Company vessels are fitted with Flag approved Sewage Treatment System in compliance 
with IMO’s MAPROL Annex IV requirements. Additionally, some ships have holding arrangements to 
meet the local restriction with respect to discharge of treated sewage.
