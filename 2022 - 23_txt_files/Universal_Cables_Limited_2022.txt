1.
Footprint of 
operations
Opportunity
By 
identifying 
the 
footprint 
of 
its 
operations 
as 
an 
opportunity, 
the 
Company can proactively mitigate risks 
and enhance its reputation. Through 
sustainable 
practices, 
environmental 
impact 
assessments, 
stakeholder 
engagement, 
and 
investments 
in 
innovation, the Company can minimize 
negative environmental impacts, ensure 
compliance, and establish itself as a 
sustainable industry leader. Embracing 
these 
opportunities 
aligns 
with 
the 
Company’s commitment to environmental 
stewardship and contributes to long-term 
profitability in a sustainability-conscious 
market.
Positive
Implementing 
sustainability 
initiatives 
has significant financial implications for 
the 
Company. 
Responsible 
resource 
consumption, waste reduction efforts, and 
renewable energy utilization can reduce 
operational costs and improve efficiency. 
Proactive environmental risk management 
and regulatory compliance protect the 
Company from fines and legal liabilities. 
Demonstrating environmental stewardship 
enhances the Company’s reputation and 
attracts eco-conscious clients, leading to 
new business opportunities and increased 
project 
value. 
Proactive 
stakeholder 
engagement and investments in research 
and innovation drive operational efficiency 
and long-term financial sustainability.
Risk
The Company acknowledges the inherent 
risks associated with its operations in 
cable 
and 
capacitor 
manufacturing, 
including 
environmental 
impacts 
on 
biodiversity, emissions, water discharges, 
resource 
consumption, 
and 
waste 
generation. To safeguard the ecosystem 
and 
surrounding 
communities, 
the 
Company 
must 
proactively 
manage 
and mitigate these risks. By doing so, it 
can ensure compliance, mitigate legal 
and environmental complications, and 
maintain 
a 
competitive 
advantage. 
Embracing responsible and sustainable 
practices will not only protect the 
environment 
but also 
enhance 
the 
Company’s 
long-term 
success 
and 
resilience in an environmentally conscious 
market.
The Company is actively mitigating 
operational risks by implementing 
a robust Integrated Management 
System (IMS), conducting regular 
assessments and audits, and 
adopting sustainable practices. 
In accordance with controlled 
IMS procedures, the Company 
performs a comprehensive annual 
analysis of risks and opportunities. 
Both at the departmental and 
management 
level, 
suitable 
controls are employed to address 
and mitigate various types of risks.
Negative
The 
identified 
risk 
carries 
financial 
implications that may include increased 
costs for addressing environmental issues, 
potential fines, or penalties for non-
compliance with regulations, and possible 
legal expenses. Failure to effectively 
manage 
and 
mitigate 
environmental 
and other risks can result in decreased 
profitability and cash flow. Therefore, it is 
essential to take appropriate measures to 
manage and address these risks in order 
to safeguard financial stability and maintain 
sustainable business operations.

2.
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
The identification of energy management 
as an opportunity for the Company is 
rooted in the potential benefits it offers, 
including enhanced energy efficiency, 
diversified energy sources, and access 
to renewable energy. By implementing 
energy-efficient 
technologies 
and 
systems, the Company can not only 
reduce costs and improve operational 
efficiency 
but 
also 
mitigate 
risks 
associated with energy price fluctuations. 
Embracing 
energy 
management 
as 
an 
opportunity 
not 
only 
enhances 
the 
Company’s 
competitiveness 
but also contributes to a greener 
future and reinforces its commitment 
to 
environmental 
stewardship. 
By 
proactively pursuing energy management 
initiatives, the Company can position itself 
as a leader in sustainable practices, while 
simultaneously reaping the economic and 
environmental rewards of a more efficient 
and resilient energy portfolio.
Positive
UCL’s strategic investments in solar power 
infrastructure, including the installation of 
a 2 MW rooftop solar plant at the Satna 
Unit, a 500 KW rooftop solar plant at the 
Goa Unit, and the procurement of 4 MW 
solar power through open access, have 
yielded significant financial benefits. These 
initiatives have not only led to a substantial 
reduction in CO2 emissions but have also 
created opportunities for cost savings and 
improved profitability.
By enhancing energy efficiency and adopting 
renewable energy sources, UCL can reduce 
energy consumption and associated costs, 
resulting in potential savings and increased 
financial performance. Diversifying energy 
sources and relying on alternative and 
renewable energy options also mitigate 
the risks associated with energy price 
fluctuations and reduce dependence on 
conventional sources.
Furthermore, 
these 
investments 
in 
renewable energy infrastructure, such as 
the rooftop solar plants and outsourced 
solar power, can potentially qualify for 
incentives, subsidies, and long-term cost 
savings through reduced energy bills.
Overall, UCL’s commitment to effective 
energy management not only aligns with 
its environmental goals but also positively 
impacts its financial performance and 
strengthens its competitive position in the 
market.

Waste 
Management
Opportunity
The 
Company 
recognizes 
waste 
management 
as 
an 
opportunity 
to 
implement responsible practices and 
enhance its environmental performance. 
By 
focusing 
on 
minimizing 
waste 
generation, 
ensuring 
environmentally 
responsible disposal, and adopting the 
“3R” model of reduce, reuse, and recycle, 
the Company aims to optimize its waste 
management efforts. Emphasis is placed 
on meticulous waste segregation and 
disposal 
through 
approved 
vendors 
to ensure compliance with regulatory 
requirements.
Through this proactive approach, the 
Company not only mitigates potential 
negative impacts on the environment 
but 
also 
unlocks 
various 
benefits. 
These include cost savings through 
reduced waste generation, improved 
resource efficiency through reuse and 
recycling initiatives, and strengthened 
environmental stewardship by minimizing 
its overall environmental footprint. By 
setting specific goals and continuously 
improving 
its 
waste 
management 
practices, the Company demonstrates 
its commitment to sustainable operations 
and plays an active role in conserving 
resources and promoting a circular 
economy.
Positive
The Company’s strong focus on effective 
waste management practices provides 
significant 
financial 
implications. 
By 
implementing 
proper 
waste 
collection, 
storage, 
and 
disposal 
methods 
in 
accordance with the waste’s nature, the 
Company ensures compliance with local 
regulations and submits required returns 
promptly.
Minimizing waste generation and promoting 
resource efficiency offers several benefits. 
The Company can reduce waste disposal 
costs, 
optimize 
material 
usage, 
and 
potentially generate revenue by selling 
reusable 
materials. 
Compliance 
with 
regulatory requirements also mitigates the 
risk of fines and legal liabilities, safeguarding 
the Company’s financial stability.
Moreover, the Company’s commitment 
to sustainable practices enhances its 
reputation and attracts environmentally 
conscious clients. This fosters long-term 
financial sustainability, as it opens doors to 
new business opportunities and strengthens 
customer loyalty.
By prioritizing proper waste management 
and adhering to regulatory standards, the 
Company not only contributes to a greener 
environment but also realizes tangible 
financial benefits.

Community 
Development
Opportunity
Active engagement with stakeholders and 
prioritizing community needs presents 
an opportunity for the Company to 
achieve long-term business success. By 
building positive relationships, obtaining 
community support, and enhancing its 
reputation, the Company can secure 
permission to operate, foster sustainable 
growth, and create shared value for both 
the business and the community.
Positive
By prioritizing community engagement, 
respecting human rights, and securing a 
social license to operate, the Company 
can reap numerous advantages. These 
include an enhanced reputation, increased 
community support, and improved customer 
loyalty. Furthermore, these efforts can 
attract socially conscious investors and 
pave the way for potential partnerships and 
business collaborations.
The positive financial implications of these 
endeavours may encompass enhanced 
long-term profitability, access to new 
markets, and cost savings achieved through 
streamlined 
operations 
and 
reduced 
conflicts with local communities.
Risk
The risks associated with the Company’s 
operations include potential long-term 
impacts on local communities, which 
can result in community dissatisfaction 
and the possibility of legal issues arising 
from environmental and social impacts. It 
is crucial for the Company to proactively 
address these risks, engage with the 
community, 
and 
implement 
robust 
measures to mitigate any adverse effects, 
thereby safeguarding its reputation and 
maintaining positive relationships with 
stakeholders.
The Company is committed to 
mitigating 
potential 
challenges 
associated 
with 
community 
development. This is achieved 
through 
supporting 
community 
growth, upholding human rights, 
and fostering strong relationships 
with the community. The primary 
objective of the Company is to 
earn trust, secure community 
permission for operations, and 
generate 
mutually 
beneficial 
outcomes for both the Company 
and the communities it serves.
Negative
Negative consequences such as community 
dissatisfaction, legal complications, and 
reputational harm can lead to higher 
costs, 
potential 
expenses 
related 
to 
litigation, and missed business prospects. 
Moreover, addressing environmental and 
social impacts may necessitate additional 
investments 
in 
mitigation 
measures, 
potentially impacting short-term profitability 
and cash flow.

Workforce 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Workforce Health and Safety is identified 
as a risk based on the higher fatality 
and injury rates in the cable industry 
compared to other sectors, as well as 
the increased vulnerability of temporary 
workers who often lack training and 
experience. Inadequate management of 
these risks can lead to human suffering, 
legal liabilities, and financial costs.
The Company places a high 
priority on workforce health and 
safety through the implementation 
of comprehensive safety protocols, 
regular training programs, and 
the promotion of a strong safety 
culture. By conducting thorough 
risk assessments, complying with 
occupational health and safety 
regulations, 
and 
continuously 
monitoring 
and 
improving 
safety practices, the Company 
is committed to safeguarding 
the well-being of its employees. 
These efforts aim to minimize 
accidents, injuries, and fatalities 
while fostering a safe and healthy 
work environment. Additionally, 
prioritizing 
workforce 
health 
and safety enhances employee 
morale, productivity, and retention.
Negative
Workplace accidents and injuries have 
various financial implications, including 
increased costs such as medical expenses, 
compensation 
claims, 
potential 
legal 
liabilities, and regulatory fines. Additionally, 
these incidents can cause project delays, 
heightened 
insurance 
premiums, 
and 
reputational damage, ultimately impacting 
the Company’s profitability and its ability to 
secure future projects.

Strategic 
Sourcing

that involves analysing an organisation’s 
spending profile and supplier base 
to 
ensure 
efficient 
and 
profitable 
procurement. It integrates data, spend 
analysis, market research, negotiation, 
and contracting to optimize overall 
business performance.

Sustainable sourcing:
Does the entity have 
procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? 
(Yes/No)
Yes, the Company has implemented procedures to ensure sustainable sourcing practices. UCL is 
committed to the safe and efficient utilisation of resources throughout the entire product lifecycle. To 
achieve this, the Company actively promotes awareness among its value chain partners about their 
respective roles and responsibilities.
In line with its commitment to sustainable sourcing, the Company has established a Supplier 
Framework. This framework aims to foster sustainable practices and includes a thorough evaluation 
and selection process for suppliers based on three key criteria:
Quality: Suppliers’ products or services are rigorously assessed for factors such as performance, 
durability, reliability, and compliance with industry standards. By prioritizing quality, the Company 
ensures that the sourced materials or services meet the highest standards and align with its commitment 
to excellence.
Pricing: The financial aspect is carefully considered when evaluating potential suppliers. The overall 
cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of pricing structures are scrutinized to strike a balance between 
optimal value for investments and maintaining profitability and cost-efficiency.
Delivery: Timeliness and reliability of delivery are crucial considerations in supplier selection. The 
Company places great emphasis on suppliers’ ability to deliver products or services within agreed-upon 
timeframes, ensuring consistency and minimizing disruptions to its own operations. This prioritisation 
of efficient and reliable delivery enables the Company to meet customer demands and operational 
timelines.
Suppliers are expected to adhere to the Company’s desired environmental and social standards as 
outlined in specific terms of agreements within the contracts. Performance evaluations and rankings 
are conducted based on their compliance with these parameters. Additionally, the Company has 
established Environmental Requirements for its suppliers, which are communicated to them.
During the supplier registration process, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted to assess suitability. 
Suppliers are required to complete a Supplier Registration Questionnaire, providing information on 
aspects such as Quality, Environment, Occupational Health & Safety, and compliance with Statutory 
& Regulatory Requirements.
Furthermore, the Company has conducted External Sustainability Audits (ESA) conducted by a third-
party organisation, Intertek, in accordance with national laws and regulations. These audits assess the 
Company’s compliance with business ethics, health and safety standards, and labour management 
practices.
In the future, the Company will continue to enhance its efforts in establishing a sustainable supply 
chain by further strengthening the assessment of its value chain partners.
If yes, what percentage 
of inputs were sourced 
sustainably?

When it comes to waste generated within the Company, we have implemented stringent measures 
to ensure strict compliance with environmental laws and consent conditions. We have established 
specific protocols for handling different categories of waste, as outlined below:
• 
Plastic Waste: We take responsibility for the proper management of plastic waste by selling it 
to authorized recyclers. This approach promotes sustainable waste management practices and 
contributes to a circular economy.
• 
E-Waste: To comply with regulatory requirements, we exclusively sell electronic waste to 
authorized recyclers. This ensures that the e-waste is properly recycled and disposed of, 
minimizing the environmental impact.
• 
Acid Batteries: We have implemented a buy-back policy with Original Equipment Manufacturers 
(OEMs) for acid batteries. This ensures that these batteries are safely and environmentally 
soundly disposed of, preventing any adverse effects on the environment.
• 
Hazardous Waste: Our approach to hazardous waste is meticulous and strictly adheres to 
guidelines and safety protocols. We dispose of hazardous waste through authorized recyclers, 
ensuring that it is handled and processed in a safe and responsible manner.
• 
Other Non-Hazardous Waste: For non-hazardous waste materials, we adopt a responsible 
approach by selling them to trusted vendors. These vendors have the capability to handle and 
utilize the materials appropriately, minimizing waste and promoting resource efficiency.
Through these measures, we strive to effectively manage the waste generated within our operations, 
minimize environmental impacts, and contribute to a sustainable future.
