Energy 
Management
R
Energy 
plays 
a 
vital 
role 
since 
the 
Company 
is 
in 
the aerospace and defense 
manufacturing industry, with 
purchased electricity being the 
primary expense, followed by 
purchased fuels. The specific 
energy sources, consumption 
levels, 
and 
management 
strategies employed depend 
on 
the 
products 
being 
manufactured. 
The 
energy 
mix, which includes on-site 
generation, grid electricity, and 
alternative energy, can impact 
the cost and dependability of 
the energy supply. As a result, 
it has the potential to influence 
the entity’s cost structure and 
regulatory risk.
To 
mitigate 
the 
potential 
challenges 
associated 
with 
energy in aerospace and defense 
manufacturing, 
the 
Company 
can 
adopt 
several 
strategies. 
Firstly, they can invest in energy-
efficient 
technologies 
and 
processes to reduce overall energy 
consumption. This can be coupled 
with the integration of renewable 
energy sources to decrease reliance 
on traditional energy providers 
and 
enhance 
sustainability. 
Additionally, implementing robust 
energy 
management 
systems 
and conducting regular energy 
audits can help identify areas for 
improvement and optimize energy 
usage. By diversifying the energy 
mix 
and 
adopting 
proactive 
measures, The Company can 
mitigate cost volatility, enhance 
energy reliability, and reduce 
regulatory risks in their operations.

Data Security
R
Given the Aerospace & Defense 
industry’s 
involvement 
in 
developing sensitive military 
and 
advanced 
aviation 
products, entities within this 
sector face a heightened risk 
of cyber-attacks. Compromised 
information systems due to 
data security breaches can lead 
to significant costs for both the 
entity and its clients. 
The Company’s endeavor and 
continuous efforts to safeguard all 
data security related aspects. Data 
security is of utmost priority for 
the organization being in defence 
and aerospace manufacturing.  To 
ensure data security, the Company 
has allocated resources and well-
defined 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedures regarding information 
security, cyber-attacks and data 
theft. Regular security audits and 
vulnerability assessments can help 
identify and address potential 
weaknesses and any associated 
risks. 
Implementing 
employee 
training programs on cybersecurity 
with best practices is crucial. 
Collaboration with cybersecurity 
experts 
and 
participation 
in 
information 
sharing 
networks 
can enhance threat intelligence. 
By taking these preventive steps, 
the Company can minimize the 
financial and reputational impacts 
of 
data 
breaches, 
ensuring 
the integrity of their systems, 
protecting 
client 
information, 
and maintaining the trust of their 
customers.

Materials 
Sourcing & 
Efficiency
R
Aerospace 
and 
defense 
entities 
face 
supply 
chain 
risks associated with the use 
of critical materials in their 
products. These materials have 
limited or no substitutes and are 
often obtained from deposits 
concentrated in a few countries, 
making them susceptible to 
geopolitical 
uncertainties. 
Additionally, growing global 
demand for these materials 
from various sectors creates 
competition, leading to price 
increases and supply risks. To 
mitigate 
potential 
financial 
impacts arising from supply 
disruptions and volatile input 
prices, entities in this industry 
can reduce their reliance on 
critical materials by exploring 
alternative options and actively 
securing their supply chains.
To mitigate the supply chain 
risks 
associated 
with 
critical 
materials, 
the 
Company 
can 
adopt strategic measures. The 
Company engages with pre-
approved  and vetted suppliers 
as per the OEM’s requirements. 
This coupled with established 
supply 
chain 
management, 
ensures that the Company is not 
exposed to challenges of delay/
damage of materials needed 
for 
manufacturing 
with 
well 
planned supply chain schedules 
for timely deliveries. Establishing 
strong supplier relationships and 
implementing robust supply chain 
management practices, such as 
monitoring and early warning 
systems, can enhance resilience.

partners to develop sustainable solutions that contribute to a low-carbon future.
	
Our success is closely linked to the well-being and growth of our employees, the communities we serve, and society 
at large. We prioritize health and safety by ensuring a secure working environment and implementing comprehensive 
protocols. Our employees are our most valuable asset, and we foster diversity, equality, and inclusion while encouraging 
their professional development and meaningful contributions to the company and society.
	
We have a strong commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards in all our operations, promoting transparency,
