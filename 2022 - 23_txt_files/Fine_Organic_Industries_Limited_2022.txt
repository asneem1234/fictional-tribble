(indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1.
Extended product 
approval process
R
• The 
regulatory 
approvals 
received 
from 
different 
industry/institutions 
are 
generally granted for a limited 
duration.
• The regulatory compliances 
are 
regularly 
revised 
depending on the geographical 
region, industry, end-users 
and other factors.
• Generally, it takes three to 
five years to get approvals 
on the additives before a 
manufacturer gets the nod as 
an additive supplier to major 
organisations. This means the 
additive end-users are likely 
to source tested additives 
from established suppliers to 
avoid expensive and lengthy 
validation tests. This process 
creates an entry barrier for a 
Company before venturing into 
new customers, geographies 
and applications.
• Focus 
on 
improving 
communications    with 
all 
relevant 
stakeholders 
locally 
and internationally.
• Proper 
understanding 
of applicable regulation 
to make the approval 
process faster.
• Reduced revenue due to loss 
of business.
2.
Vegetable oil prices
 
`
R
• Price 
of 
vegetable 
oils 
depend upon the global as 
well as domestic demand-
supply output & climate/crop 
conditions.
• Changes in the duties made 
by the Indian Government 
and importing countries may 
result in price volatility and 
fluctuations.
• Invest in commodities to 
help prepare for sudden 
price fluctuations in the 
market, and maintain a 
future repository of raw 
materials that will help 
survive the volatility of 
resource. 
• Maintain 
robust 
relationship with our 
key suppliers.
• Increased 
cost 
of 
raw 
materials, resulting in lower 
margins and impacting the 
bottom-line.
3.
Industry growth 
O
• Increased use of plant-based 
green additives in industries 
like biopolymers & bioplastic 
processing, 
personal 
care 
& home care products as 
a 
replacement 
for 
other 
synthetically based additives, 
helps the Company to be 
innovative and environment 
friendly.
-
• Anticipated growth in the 
green 
additives 
market 
globally, may result in more 
sustainable 
business 
and 
increased revenue.

5.
Impact of climate 
change 
R
The 
business 
may 
face 
challenges 
due 
to 
adverse 
weather conditions and climate 
change, 
as 
these 
factors 
can have an impact on crop 
production. 
Since 
vegetable 
oils, which are key raw materials 
for the industry, are derived 
from agriculture, any negative 
effects on crops can affect their 
availability. Additionally, climate 
change and related natural 
disasters like floods, cyclones, 
and droughts can introduce 
volatility in raw material prices, 
potentially influencing farmers 
decisions. 
Such 
disruptions 
can also impact supply chains, 
production facilities, and even 
change customer demand and 
preferences.
• Sustainable 
sourcing 
from 
developed 
key 
supplier can mitigate 
risks for the Company 
by ensuring a stable 
and 
reliable 
supply 
of 
raw 
materials 
while 
promoting 
e n v i r o n m e n t a l 
stewardship 
and 
resilience.
• Enhancing 
green 
chemistry by reducing 
the use and generation 
of 
hazardous 
substances
• Shifting 
to 
the 
use 
of 
alternate 
energy-
efficient 
fuels 
can 
reduce 
the 
climate 
change risk for the 
Company by minimising 
air 
emissions, 
promoting 
cleaner 
energy 
sources, 
and 
reducing the Company's 
overall carbon footprint.
The Company  does not enter 
into 
supply 
contract 
that 
are longer than 12 months, 
thereby exposing to risk of 
increase in raw material prices 
and decrease in profitability. 
Climate change related to 
regulatory amendment could 
result in increased regulatory 
compliances, failure to comply 
with the same could result in 
reputation risk.

Statement by the Director responsible for the Business Responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
Governance, Leadership and Oversight
Our People, Our Planet.
The Company has established itself as an entity that takes business responsibility seriously, while strongly emphasising ESG 
as enlightened citizens. It understands that companies which perform ethically and create value for society may achieve 
long-term success. 
The Company’s Oleochemicals-derived additives and product solutions assist its customers in achieving their sustainability 
objectives and help them in preparing for the future. To this end, 88% of the Company’s raw materials are green – derived 
from vegetable origin.
The employees diligently work towards the Company’s mission and vision. In turn, the Company shows appreciation for their 
efforts by improving their compensation and increasing the workforce by adding more like-minded employees. 
To foster a sense of security and belongingness among its employees, the Company has extended health and insurance 
coverage, along with financial support. The Company acknowledges its role in improving the lives of the communities in 
which it operates, and is committed to continuing these efforts in the years ahead.
The Company recognises its responsibility towards the people and planet, and will always continue working towards taking 
care of it. 
	
Over the period, the Company has made a number of operational improvements as well as applied best practices to 
ensure that its manufacturing activities are sustainable:
	
Environment-friendly plant-based raw materials and products:
Wastewater management:
	
Majority of the Company’s raw materials are vegetable based and obtained from various plant sources, 
which are natural and renewable. Therefore, the Company is able to manufacture and offer its final 
products as 'Green Additives' for most applications.
The Company implements the 3R approach - Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle - across all of its production 
facilities to safeguard natural resources. By adopting the 3R principle, the Company can curtail its 
resource consumption, minimise waste production, and foster sustainability in its operations, thus 
curbing its environmental impact and supporting the fight against climate change. Notably, the 
Company prioritises the preservation and conservation of water resources above all. The Company 
has undertaken different measures to reduce it's daily water usage, staff up-skilling and frequently 
monitoring the water consumption. Additionally, the Company uses scientifically built ETP & STP 
systems to treat all wastewater generated within plant. The treated water is then reused and recycled 
within the facilities. As a result, the Company conserves one of the most valuable natural resources, 
‘Water’. Except for small scale unit of Badlapur (Member of CETP), all remaining manufacturing units 
operate as Zero Liquid Discharge units. The Company does not discharge a single drop of effluent, 
leading to zero-waste impact on the environment.

Energy conservation:

Plastic packaging & waste:
The Company uses renewal energy like solar energy in the form of ‘sky pipes’ across all its warehouses. 
These sky pipes work on the fundamental of utilising solar light as a resource for indoor lighting. Thus, during 
the daytime, the Company does not need to use any electrical power for LED lamps in the warehouses, 
reducing electricity utilisation and conserving energy.
The Company has shifted from using furnace oil to natural gas - one of the clean-burning fuel reducing CO2 
emission and eliminating SOx levels. This initiative has led to reduction in air emission. Thereby, achieving 
eco-friendly production facilities.
The Company has planted 845 trees, both within and around its facilities, which have several benefits, 
including helping sequester carbon dioxide and thereby reducing the company's carbon footprint. 
Additionally, the Company has undertaken green belt development and landscaping both within and 
around its facilities. This initiative has led to the creation of attractive and well-maintained green areas that 
enhance the release of oxygen into the surrounding environment and improve aesthetics.
The Company provides carpooling facilities to its employees. Thus, helping to reduce fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions as compared to using personal vehicles for commute.
The Company ensures a reduction in the use of plastic packing materials through alternate solutions. 
The plastic waste generated within the facility gets collected strategically and is disposed by sending it 
to authorised plastic recyclers. The Company gets a valid certificate from the authorised recyclers for the 
same. This helps to ensure that the plastic waste is treated suitably as per the Central & State regulatory 
compliance requirements.  The Company also encourage its employees to decrease use of plastic materials 
leading to reduction in plastic waste generation which directly or indirectly impacts the environment. 
	
Use of energy-efficient products:
The Company uses Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) for motors and pumps to get the desired performance 
at optimum consumption of energy. The Company has also installed LED lighting throughout the plant and 
office premises.

implementation.
	
Yes. 
	
Out of the total of seven manufacturing units, six have already implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facilities. The 
only exception is a small-scale manufacturing (SSI) unit, which currently discharges treated effluent into CETP for further 
disposal.
	
Water usage is not involved in the manufacturing process. The utility effluent undergo treatment in the Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP), and the treated effluent is subsequently recycled as makeup water for cooling towers or other utility needs. 
Thereby achieving Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD).
	
The ETP consists of primary, secondary and tertiary treatment are followed by the ATFD.  
	
The sewage undergoes treatment in the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). The STP consists of primary, secondary and tertiary 
treatment followed by UV treatment step. The treated sewage is then put to use for gardening purposes. The bio sludge 
generated during the treatment process is utilised as manure. In the case of smaller units, sewage is collected in septic tanks 
and subsequently directed to soak pits.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
the Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company produces environment friendly additives using raw materials derived from vegetable oil. As a result, the waste 
generated during the manufacturing process is non-hazardous. By transitioning from furnace oil to cleaner piped natural 
gas, the Company has eliminated the generation of boiler ash. Effective waste management and waste minimisation are key 
priorities across all of the Company's manufacturing sites. The Company maintains inventories to monitor and reduce waste 
generation, and the handling of solid and hazardous waste is in compliance with Consent to Operate and Hazardous Waste 
Authorisation regulations.
	
75% of the waste generated by the Company is either recycled or reprocessed authorised recyclers or the use of a TSDF 
(Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility). Certificates from recyclers are diligently maintained for E-waste. In case of 
Plastic packaging waste, it is full filled in accordance with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines. Additionally, 
the Company has implemented a buy-back mechanism to handle battery waste. Used batteries are returned to the suppliers, 
and proper inventories are maintained to ensure effective management of this waste stream. Process waste is safely disposed 
through Mumbai Waste Management Limited. (MWML).
