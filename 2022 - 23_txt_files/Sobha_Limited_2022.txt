Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/No). If yes, the coverage such system? 
	
Yes. ISO 45001.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity? 
	
SOBHA staying up-to-date to control risks and adapting to modern demands HIRA is one idea we 
are adhering to for risk control that can keep workplace safety measures in place. Concept of inputs 
(minimize the risk of hazards entering), processes (contain risks during procedures) and outputs 
(minimize exporting risk). 
	
Two different sorts of monitoring techniques are used by SOBHA to inspect the workplace. One 
is active monitoring, which help us to keep track of how management arrangements are created, 
developed, installed and used. We regularly audit our facilities, including our factories, offices and 
projects. We do routine health surveillance to spot risks and get rid of those that are bad for health. 
Routinely scheduled function check procedures for important plant components.
	
The second way, reactive methods of monitoring, uses the evidence of subpar health and safety 
practices that may be applied to other areas of a business, such as: looking into accidents and 
occurrences; keeping track of cases of illness and sickness absence records. This helping us to identify 
root causes of incidents and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
	
SOBHA takes a systematic and coordinated approach to managing workplace risks. We use risk 
assessment to identify and eliminate risks and we prefer hierarchy to prioritize measures to combat 
risks. We also use engineering controls and collective measures to minimize risks. Finally, we use PPE 
as a last resort only when necessary.
	
At SOBHA, we use the safety manager’s monthly reports and the department head’s audits, plans for 
corrective action and improvement targets to gather independent data on the effectiveness, reliability 
and efficiency of the entire health and safety management system. Effectiveness is increased by 
gathering data through face-to-face interviews, document analysis and visual observations. Through 
both proactive and reactive monitoring, SOBHA evaluates their performance. As part of active 
monitoring, we regularly review papers from each department relevant to health and safety and check 
buildings and plants every two weeks to fill in any gaps. Environmental monitoring records, such as 
those for water testing, DG stack height and noise testing and air monitoring testing, are kept on file 
and updated on a regular basis. 
	
Additionally, Health and safety audits conducted by internal or external auditors to assess the 
effectiveness of health and safety management system. Which include reviewing policies and 
procedures, conducting interviews with employees and inspecting the workplace. The safety manager 
will carry out a biweekly Audit to identify any flaws in the management system.

16
INFORMATION FOR OUR 
SHAREHOLDERS 
Annual Report 2022 - 2023
	
Reactive monitoring allows us to identify standards that require improvement by evaluating injuries, 
illnesses, accidents and near-misses. Detailed information from the accident reports is used to examine 
incidents and determine their causes.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
	
SOBHA nurture to perpetuate a system of roles and responsibilities for health and safety inside the 
organization, from senior management to front-line employees; for employees to report dangers at 
work, SOBHA has provided reporting channels, such as a reporting hotline, an email address, or an 
online reporting form. The Company frequently make aware of these reporting options and urge to 
use them through training. And an on-site suggestion box installed at project site so individuals can 
report anonymously submit ideas, any unsafe condition/unsafe act to rectify for enhancing safety in 
and around project for improvement throughout time.
	
By including workers in danger assessments and safety committees and by delivering training on 
hazard recognition and reporting, SOBHA encourage employee participation in hazard reporting. 
	
Employees at SOBHA have been given the authority to create a “stop work” authority, which enables 
them to stop working if they believe a task or activity to be unsafe or if they notice a hazard that 
poses a major risk. Through training, workers were made aware of this authority and management 
offered assistance.
	
SOBHA swiftly looks into hazard reports (preliminary incident investigation and detailed incident 
investigation reports), determines the hazard’s underlying cause and implements the necessary 
corrective measures to resolve the hazard and stop it from happening again. The second step in the 
accident investigation process involves examining all the paperwork, witness data, picture procedures, 
methods, etc.
	
Overall, SOBHA makes sure that employees are aware of the reporting mechanisms and hazard 
reporting protocols so they can report risks without worrying about repercussions. By putting these 
procedures in place, SOBHA encourages a culture of safety in which employees are given the authority 
to recognize and resolve hazards at work.
d.	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, the employees of SOBHA have access to non-occupational medical health care services. In 
particular, we provided preventive health care services. Recently, a specialist oncology doctor’s team 
conducted a free cancer awareness session and camp at SCO for our employees on March 10, 2023, 
in honors of World Cancer Day. Both male and female employees showed up for the medical 
examination. Mammography and all other smoking cessation programmes, nutrition counselling and 
general screenings are provided without charge.
	
To boost employee morale, we are mandatorily giving general medical care, such as routine check-
ups, vaccinations and treatment for common illnesses and injuries, pre-joining medical screening and 
tri-monthly medical examinations, to all segments of the workforce. They can access a medical care 
service known as a medical care center and an MBBS doctor at any time for medical crises, both 
occupational and non-occupational. 
	
We have been maintained half-yearly medical test reports (vision test) of operators and drivers. And it 
is a necessary lawful action to track all operators of a crane, winch, or other lifting appliance, transport 
equipment or vehicle in order to protect our safety and safety of our workers.
	
To ensure their fitness, workers over the age of 45 are occasionally (once a year) subjected to medical 
examinations. In order to promote employee well-being and foster a positive working culture, SOBHA 
arranges non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
For a safe and healthy workplace, SOBHA conducts risk assessments to assess the risks to employee’s 
health and safety in the workplace and take steps to mitigate these risks. This includes identifying 
potential hazards and taking steps to eliminate or control them.
	
SOBHA establishes procedures for safe work practices through an operational control procedure and 
often conducts training to aware employees. This can include procedures for handling hazardous 
materials, operating machines and responding to emergencies.
	
We frequently provide regular safety training sessions pertaining to eight major risk hazards, hazard 
identification and risk assessment, the occupational control process, legal obligations, the usage of 
personal protective equipment and the application of safety norms and protocols. The business also 
does routine safety audits to spot potential risks and take corrective action. To ensure that their 
medical needs are met, SOBHA additionally gives its employees access to medical facilities and health 
insurance. These actions show how committed the business is to providing a secure and healthy work 
environment for all of its workers.
	
SOBHA nurtures and perpetuates a system of roles and responsibilities for health and safety inside 
the organization, from senior management to front-line employees. Additionally, it is controlled or 
overseen by Setting key objectives and reviewing against them, planning, reviewing and auditing 
to ensure legal compliance, setting performance standards and effective implementation of plans, 
allocation of specific responsibilities, individual job descriptions with H&S responsibilities. SOBHA 
always monitors their staff’s competence and helps them nurture themselves by identifying training 
needs.  
	
SOBHA provided suitable information, instruction and training for their employees to enable them to 
make effective use of the PPE provided to protect them against workplace hazards to their health 
and safety.
