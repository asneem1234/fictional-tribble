1
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
The Circular Economy model of 
production 
and 
consumption 
promotes 
the 
reusing, 
refurbishing and recycling of 
existing materials and products. 
The transition to a circular 
economy will affect a change 
in building design and material 
usage. A shift in regulations and 
demand, combined with new 
technology, has the potential to 
reduce costs.
We have undertaken initiatives 
that help reduce generation 
of waste, to identify waste 
that can be reused and to 
dispose the waste generated 
in an environmentally friendly 
manner.

2
Emissions and 
Pollutants
Risk
Building infrastructure is an 
energy-intensive 
activity 
and 
generates significant direct and 
indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, 
including 
carbon 
dioxide and methane from fuel 
use. Uncontrolled pollutants and 
emissions during operation and 
associated activities impose legal 
and environmental risks for the 
company. 
We have focused interventions 
towards monitoring and 
reducing energy consumption 
through various energy and 
emission saving 
initiatives like:
- decrease in energy intensity 
ratio
- increased use of renewable 
energy
- to implement Internet of 
Things for plants
- increased use of technology 
such as Video Conferencing, 
Electric Vehicle to commute

Climate 
Change 
Risk and 
Adaptation
Risk
Climate 
Change 
can 
have 
adverse impact on our business 
and not having a correct strategy 
or its right implementation will 
severely affect the business 
continuity.
GRIL’s mission is to achieve a 
sustainable society by taking 
on the challenges of climate 
change and the efficient use 
of 
resources. 
In 
response 
to climate change, which is 
particularly an urgent issue. 
We will work on solutions for 
targeting 
decarbonization, 
carbon neutrality through the 
value chain. As a responsible 
company in the creation of 
environmental value, we will 
further accelerate our initiatives 
aimed at realizing these goals.
Positive
4
Water 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical resource 
required during construction, 
operation 
and 
maintenance. 
Water use for various business 
activities impacts the quality and 
quantity of local water resources. 
Improper discharge of water can 
result in contamination of water 
bodies. This in turn increases the 
operating cost and imposes a 
legal risk to the company. 
We are undertaking initiatives 
that help to reduce, reuse 
and recycle water to minimize 
freshwater consumption.

also diversifying to take our 
experience into other sectors 
and help build a better India.

Diversity & 
Inclusion
Opportunity
A company’s high diversity and 
inclusion rate reflects employees’ 
sense of belonging and fairness 
within the company. Improving 
diversity and inclusion helps 
companies to support vulnerable 
groups resulting in community, 
brand image creation for the 
company.
GRIL is managing its workplaces 
and maximizing the potential 
of its diverse talent pool in line 
with our basic philosophy that 
“Health and Safety Always Come 
First.” We respect all people, 
including co-creation partners 
and those who support the 
value chain, contributing to 
a society in which everyone 
can 
work 
safely 
and 
with 
peace of mind. Continuous 
efforts are being put in place 
to maintain healthy ratio of 
female employees across levels 
and also employment of people 
with dis-abilities.

Impact 
on Local 
Community
Opportunity
A 
Needs 
Assessment 
done 
prior to project execution gives 
us the voice and stance of the 
community along with their 
consent to operate
The focus of GRIL is to create a 
long-term sustainable impact 
on the community through 
regular interactions, increased 
CSR spend, etc.
Positive
8
Employee 
Satisfaction 
and Retention
Risk
A higher employee retention rate 
reflects good company policies 
and practices that lead to higher 
employee satisfaction. However, 
a high attrition rate indicates 
low employee satisfaction. High 
attrition also increases the cost 
of replacing and training the 
employees, increases the risk 
of business getting impacted 
in case of critical roles and may 
reflect negatively on investors.
We are developing mechanisms 
to gauge employee sentiments 
and feedback. To drive change 
across the organization, we have 
established a digitally enabled 
and transparent Performance 
Management System to provide 
feedback to employees which 
enable them to engage with 
their teams better and address 
any concerns. These insights 
have led us to create focus 
areas for action on a quarterly 
basis which is socialized with 
the 
leadership 
team 
and 
progress on the same is updated 
periodically.
Positive

Product 
Quality and 
Design
Risk
Companies in this industry have 
a vital commitment to safeguard 
their 
projects 
through 
the 
provision of engineering, design, 
architectural and other services. 
Only by ensuring compliance 
with safety standards can they 
demonstrate 
professional 
excellence 
and 
guarantee 
top-tier results. Poor design 
and construction of buildings 
or 
infrastructure 
can 
have 
devastating consequences- from 
loss of life, to decreased property 
value, to economic insecurity.
Our endeavour is to deliver 
the 
projects 
with 
highest 
quality, 
design 
and 
safety 
standards. Our proactive risk 
prevention 
approach 
during 
the designing phase, rapid and 
effective mitigation of safety 
and quality risks identified in 
the field and our governance 
and coordination among our 
projects helps to deliver quality 
output.

Taking the time for proper 
planning 
is 
essential 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
these 
disasters 
from 
occurring. 
When it comes to structural 
integrity and safety, companies 
that don’t do well can face 
high 
costs 
for 
redesigning 
or repair, as well as legal 
liabilities 
and 
damage 
to 
their reputation, which could 
harm their growth prospects. 
As a consequence of climate 
change, 
companies 
in 
the 
construction and infrastructure 
industry must now consider 
how changing weather patterns 
could damage their projects – 
potentially endangering public 
safety. Compliance with the 
minimum codes and standards 
may not be enough to retain 
reputational value.
The Quality Assurance and 
Quality Control teams ensure 
that work done is as per quality 
assurance 
plan 
and 
non-
conformances are reported and 
actioned upon timely.

Human Rights

Management
Risk
Changing

challenge.
GRIL is committed to good 
citizenship 
and 
promoting 
better 
working 
conditions 
for all. We take robust and 
thorough measures to protect 
our employees. We can also 
promote positive change by 
encouraging 
our 
business 
partners and communities to 
respect human rights as well. 
We ensure safe, healthy and 
sustainable working conditions; 
require 
a 
respectful, 
harassment-free 
workplace; 
prohibit discrimination; deliver 
employee compensation and 
benefits to attract and retain 
strong talent; prohibit child or 
forced labor and ensure our 
business partners share this 
commitment; 
and 
promote 
responsible sourcing practices

Setting 
up 
a 
resilient 
supply chain, due diligence of 
suppliers 
before 
onboarding, 
continuous

GRIL has developed general 
terms & conditions including 
suppliers’ 
responsibility 
to 
comply with the environment, 
safety 
and 
other 
related 
regulations. 
The 
Company 
has developed a process of 
conducting 
due 
diligence 
and technical evaluation of 
suppliers before onboarding. 
Through 
this 
process 
GRIL 
tries 
to 
communicate 
and 
emphasise on the importance 
of responsible sourcing to the 
suppliers. However, considering 
the industry, it’s a long way to 
go through continuous dialogue 
and education to the suppliers.

or 
anti-trust 
violations. Ethics violations can 
lead to investigations, hefty fines, 
settlement costs, and damage to 
reputation.
GRIL is committed to the highest 
standards of compliance – in all

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses are assessed based 
on their performance across all 
key governance issues, which 
include ownership & control, 
Board pay, accounting, business 
ethics, and tax transparency. 
This topic examines the effect 
that 
a 
company’s 
corporate 
governance 
and

ethics 
practices 
have 
on 
its 
shareholders 
and 
other 
investors.
GRIL Board of Directors oversees 
the strategic direction of the 
company to advance the long-
term interests of the company 
and its various stakeholders. 
Our Board, Audit Committee 
and Risk Managing Committee 
are unitedly responsible for the 
Enterprise Risk Management

Policies and Standard Operating 
Procedures, 
maintaining

Cybersecurity
Risk
Companies are assessed based 
on the amount of personal data 
they collect, their exposure to 
evolving or increasing privacy 
regulations, their vulnerability 
to potential data breaches, and 
their data protection systems.
GRIL 
respects 
the 
privacy 
of the people from whom it 
collects and processes personal 
information and ensures the 
same through data privacy 
policy 
and 
various 
control 
mechanisms. 
Protecting 
our

begins with our Cybersecurity 
approach. As part of our Digital 
Roadmap and through cyber 
defence 
strategy 
we 
detect, 
mitigate 
and 
respond 
to 
cyberthreats. We engage industry 
experts to continually improve 
our 
cyber

and 
processes. 
We 
conduct 
regular

to 
validate 
defensive 
measures, 
employing
