Corporate Overview
Annual Report 2022-23 | 83
• Ethanol: We support and promote the Government of India’s Ethanol Blending Programme and thus sell Ethanol to 
oil marketing companies.
• Ethyl Acetate: We sell Ethyl Acetate to end consumers and traders. This is primarily used as solvent. The industries that 
we cater to include packaging, paints, inks, adhesives, pharma, etc. 
• ENA (Extra Neutral Alcohol): We captively consume ENA in our potable spirits plant. We also sell ENA to country liquor 
manufacturers.
• Country Liquor: We sell Country Liquor to whole sellers/ distributors only in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
IV.  Employees:
 
We consider our employees to be our chief resources and believe their dedication and support is the primary ingredient 
of our success in the past 90 years. We uphold the principles of equality and inclusivity across our value-chain, and we 
are keen on building on these principles in the years to come. The Company is an equal opportunity employer. However, 
since majority of our operations occur in factories, on account of non-availability of requisite talent, there is a limited 
representation of women as part of our employee strength at 5% and worker strength at nearly 1%. We aim to strive 
and improve this representation through our corporate roles. At Corporate oﬃce we have approximately 30% women 
employees. This signiﬁes our alliance to the United Nations SDG 5 upholding Gender Equality. We also respect the rights 
and contribution of diﬀerently abled individuals and are open to employing such employees. However, as on date we 
do not have such employees working with us, primarily due to non-availability of trained manpower. The below table 
includes employees across the organization including corporate oﬃce.

Financial implications
of the risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or
negative implications)
1.
GHG Emissions
Risk
The greenhouse gases generated 
from burning of bagasse as well as 
processing of molasses can pose a 
risk of environmental harm. It is  to 
mitigate the generated emissions.
To identify sources of scope 1,2 
and 3 GHG emissions in Company’s 
operations 
and 
to 
deﬁne 
goals 
for 
reducing 
the 
same. 
Suitable 
environmental control measures have 
been deployed to minimize these 
emissions. However, bagasse being 
green fuel, has lower carbon footprint 
as compared to fossil fuel. Molasses are 
largely used to produce ethanol which 
again being green fuel helps reduce 
carbon footprint and its use in ethanol 
blending programme (EBP) helps in 
conservation of foreign exchange.
Initiatives 
undertaken 
to 
mitigate harm arising from 
GHG 
emissions 
lead 
to 
incremental costs. If a given 
adopted technology fails to 
perform, there could be losses 
incurred too.
2.
Water and waste 
Management
Opportunity Sugar industry is one of those 
industries 
where 
majority 
of 
generated waste byproducts are 
utilized for alcohol and power 
generation, 
Sewage 
Treatment 
Plant (STP)- sludge, press-mud, 
bagasse are all utilized for one 
or the other beneﬁcial purposes. 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) has 
also been implemented to better 
manage water resources
ZLD and waste management initiatives 
have been established at Company’s 
unit at Dhampur and Rajpura
Savings achieved in terms 
of power consumption and 
withdrawal of freshwater thus 
resulting in reduced costs of 
operations
3.
Energy management
Opportunity At 
Dhampur 
Sugar, 
we 
use 
Renewable Energy (RE) generated 
from bagasse and other sources 
and hence we are self-suﬃcient. 
There is a signiﬁcant cost savings 
potential through various energy 
optimization initiatives from the use 
of sugarcane by-products.
Existing generation methods for RE 
generation
Increased sale of power to 
the grid results in additional 
revenue generation

Governance, Leadership and Oversight

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements: 
The vision and mission of the Company aims at innovation and optimization for the beneﬁt of all stakeholders and 
making a positive contribution to the environment we operate in. Our business operations encompass our commitment 
to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. We believe that as a responsible business, it is our duty to 
balance our economic growth with sustainable development, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship. 
We prioritize responsible practices, with a commitment to match the highest standards in employee, environment and 
community health and safety. In doing so, we endeavor to enhance value for all stakeholders. This statement reﬂects 
our dedication to these principles.
Environment responsibility: We recognize the critical role we play in addressing climate change and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. We have implemented state-of-the-art technologies and processes to optimize energy 
eﬃciency, minimize waste generation, and promote the use of renewable resources. Our operations adhere to stringent 
environmental regulations, and we continually strive to exceed these standards. We continually invest in technologies 
to implement new ways to reduce our carbon footprint and promote a greener future. The approach is two pronged 
– continually improve energy and material utilization eﬃciencies to optimize consumption & increase waste recycling 
and reutilization. 
This has helped us moderate water use, resource depletion and pollution. Several initiatives like rainwater harvesting 
structures in our plants, development of green belts are regularly taken in our plants. Our company’s EHS policy 
prioritizes employee safety and environmental protection to uphold the value of our products.
Social Responsibility: We are committed to being a responsible corporate organization and making a positive impact 
on the communities in which we operate. We prioritize the well-being, health, and safety of our employees, providing 
them with a safe working environment and opportunities for growth and development. We engage in fair work practices, 
promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion within our workforce. We actively support local communities through social 
initiatives, education programs, and partnerships that promote economic development and enhance quality of life. 
Being an Agri based business, our teams have a very strong connect with the farmers and we constantly help them in 
enhancing their eﬃciencies which result in better income generation for farmers and is also beneﬁcial to the company 
– a win-win situation for the company and stakeholders both.

or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)  
 
Yes. We have the Whistle Blower mechanism & Employee Grievance Redressal committee established which addresses 
these concerns. 
5. 
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.  
 
The Company has policies relating to Whistle Blower, Employee Grievance Mechanism and Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH), which promote a free, fair and discrimination free working environment for employees and provide 
a mechanism for raising concerns and resolution of disputes. The policy covers complaints of sexual harassment not 
only in the workplace, but also includes any place visited by the employee arising out of, or during the course of 
employment including transportation provided by the employer for undertaking such journey. The committees remain 
common for discussing all types of issues - including safety, working conditions, etc.  The Grievance Redressal committee 
consists of a chairman and 8 members who have been designated to hear, investigate, and resolve any issues faced 
by the employee. The employee can ﬁrst reach out to their line manager/supervisor and the HR representatives who 
are expected to provide complete support in resolution of any such issues faced by the employee. In case the issue 
still prevails or is sensitive and cannot be disclosed to either of these sources, then the employee may reach out to the 
Grievance redressal committee directly for support. 
6. Number of Complaints on the following made by employees and workers:
 
We respect the rights of our employees and uphold and promote the principles of fairness, equality, freedom of thought 
and expression as well as equal pay. In line with the same, we are ever open to receive feedback, suggestions and

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
 
We have a Whistle Blower Policy in place which assures that the employees are fully protected against any type of 
reprisals, punishment, intimidation, coercive action, dismissal, or victimization for reporting genuine concerns. The 
Company also has in place a policy on prevention of sexual harassment in line with the requirements of the Sexual 
Harassment of women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Policy).
8.  Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)  
 
 Yes. Although our contracts do not have an explicit clause highlighting the need for the vendors/ business partners to 
adhere to human rights requirements, we do require them to comply to all laws, regulations and rules – whether local 
or national as prescribed by the government agencies and we believe this covers their adherence to all human rights 
requirements as well. Further, we will also be deﬁning a formal supplier code of conduct which will include the human 
rights coverage.

Provide details of the following disclosures related to water, in the following format:
The Company recognizes that water being a shared resource, it is our duty to ensure that it is used judiciously, and
any kind of wastage is strictly avoided. Although we do not operate in any area which are classiﬁed under water-stress
category, we do our best to ensure that we use minimal quantity and try to re-use the same to reduce withdrawals
wherever possible. As part of our CSR activities, we have undertaken eﬀorts to replenish the water supply in areas that
we operate at. Four  existing water ponds were percolated through large pits to ensure rejuvenation and beautiﬁcation
at Harah Ahmedpur and Gajupara in Dhampur villages and at Singholi Kallu and Singholi Poorvi in Rajpura villages. We
also focused on biological sewage treatment that cleans the wastewater by absorbing nutrients dissolved in the water
and thereby supporting living species inside the pond. We have also implemented Zero Liquid Discharge to recycle and
re-use water to the maximum possible extent.
Further, by optimizing our power consumption by using steam generated power we have achieved a signiﬁcant reduction 
in our water usage thus helping to conserve water and demonstrating our alignment to UN SDG 12 based on Responsible
Production and Consumption.

4. Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
 
Yes, Zero Liquid Discharge has been implemented at both Dhampur and Rajpura plants.  Nearly 100% of the water is 
recycled at both the plants and hence the freshwater demand has signiﬁcantly reduced as can be seen in the table above.
 
ZLD process followed for Distillery operations: A condensate polishing unit has been installed which takes care of spent 
lees (sediment of alcohol generated from molasses), blow down generated from cooling tower, as well as the washing 
and process condensate from evaporation plant. After treatment of the streams at CPU, treated condensate is recycled 
to process for dilution and as cooling tower make up which helps achieve zero liquid discharge (ZLD). Due to recycle of 
the process condensate, freshwater demand is reduced to a large extent. Spent wash is treated by multi eﬀect evaporator 
followed by slop ﬁred boiler and grain slop (Spent Wash) is passed through decanters for separation of suspended solids. 
Thin slops from decanter is partly recycled back to process and the balance fed to Thin Slop Evaporation Plant for 
concentration of remaining solids to form Syrup (20 - 30% w/w TS). The thin slop and syrup mixture is dried in Steam 
Tube Bundle Dryer for producing DDGS which is used as Animal Feed Supplement (AFS). The AFS is utilized as cattle-
feed, poultry-feed and ﬁsh feed ingredients. The process condensate is recycled back in the process after treatment in 
CPU.
 
ZLD process followed for Sugar operations: Sugar is made by the processes of milling, clariﬁcation, evaporation, 
crystallization, and centrifugation. Mill house and Boiling house are some sources which lead to the generation of 
eﬄuent. Physio-chemical and biological processes are used in the process designed for Zero Liquid Discharge System. 
The steps are following:
 
Step-1- Screening: Untreated wastewater has more suspended particles and ﬂoatable components, which contribute to 
organic and inert matter in the released eﬄuent that must be removed. The untreated eﬄuent is initially passed through 
ﬁxed bar screens, which separate and remove all of the larger suspended solids and ﬂoatable materials. Gravity transports 
the screened eﬄuent to the oil and grease removal tank.
 
Step-2- Oil & Grease trap: With the help of gravity, the sugar eﬄuent from the bar screen chamber would enter the O 
& G treatment chamber. During the detention time (half an hour), oil and grease will ﬂoat to the surface of the tank and 
be removed using mechanical equipment such as an oleophilic, belt-type oil skimmer.
 
Step-3- Equalization tank: The raw eﬄuent is let into the equalization tank, where it is continuously mixed with a 
ﬂoating aerator or an air diﬀused system to homogenize the combined eﬄuent from various plant sources and preserve 
homogeneous eﬄuent characteristics.
 
Step-4- pH neutralization: The pH of the eﬄuent is usually low. So, before letting the raw eﬄuent into the other 
110 | Dhampur Sugar Mills Limited
subsequent units, the equalization tank content is neutralized by dosing lime, caustic soda or soda ash in the equalization 
tank to neutralize the pH of the raw eﬄuent.
 
Step-5- Primary clariﬁer: The primary clariﬁer receives the neutralized eﬄuent from the Equalization Tank. To remove 
suspended materials, many types of primary clariﬁers (such as conventional or lamella) are used. The clariﬁer’s supernatant 
is pumped to the next treatment unit. The clariﬁer sludge is delivered to the sludge drying beds.
 
Step-6- Aerobic treatment: In anaerobic treatment, organic matter decomposes in the absence of oxygen while as 
in aerobic treatment, it decomposes in the presence of oxygen. The sludge is biologically transformed into a range of 
end products, including methane and CO2. The treatment processes include Upﬂow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) 
reactor, activated sludge process, bio-towers, extended aeration tanks, etc.
 
Step-7- Secondary clariﬁer: Depending on the operating conditions, each kilogram of Biological Oxygen Demand 
(BOD) removed produces 0.45–0.80 kg of sludge. The surplus sludge generated must be evacuated to maintain a 
suﬃcient Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS) concentration in the aeration tank; otherwise, the bacterial population 
in the aeration tank will be quite high.
 
Step-8- Multi-grade ﬁlter (MGF): The suction of the multi-grade ﬁlter feed transfer pump will receive treated wastewater. 
Filter feed pumps transport treated wastewater and treated water collected upstream of the MGF to downstream.
 
Step-9- Activated carbon ﬁlter: Suspended solids, color and odor are all removed using an activated carbon ﬁlter. A 
cylindrical mild steel vessel with dished ends makes up an activated carbon ﬁlter. For advanced treatment, membrane 
processes like reverse osmosis is used to further treat wastewater for re-use.
 
Step-10-Irrigation: The ﬁnal treated water is now ready to be utilized for irrigation purposes.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide detail
 
The Company being a part of sugar industry, we have implemented several measures in this direction including lowering 
the consumption of steam in production process, thereby reducing consumption of fuel of all types. We have zero to 
minimal fossil fuels burned for our production purpose, which in turn helps to reduce the GHG emissions. We generate 
energy from Bagasse and Molasses which helps us to eﬃciently manage our energy needs. Excess of this generated 
renewable energy is, in fact, exported by us to the state grid (UPPCL).  This also demonstrates our alignment to the UN 
SDG7 focusing on sustainable and clean energy usage. We have techniques such as slop boiler, condensation units 
and other such mechanisms to reduce the energy consumption. All of these are steps the Company has taken towards 
reduction of GHG emissions and eﬃcient energy management. To further identify improvement opportunities, we have 
got energy audits conducted. From the recommendations of these studies various steam and power reduction schemes 
have been implemented/ are under implementation to minimise energy consumption thereby reducing GHG emissions. 
Use of energy eﬃcient equipment like high eﬃciency motors, LED lightings etc further help in power reduction and 
minimising GHG emissions. We shall also initiate emission tracking of our of non-manufacturing locations such as oﬃces 
to identify emission reduction sources at these sites.

Green belt
The Company  has developed adequate greenery which 
is more than 33% of our premises area. As per UP Pollution 
Control Board (UPPCB ) instructions, at the beginning 
of monsoons, we plant thousands of plants every year. 
One of the best techniques for quickly establishing a 
forest cover on degraded land that has previously been 
used for construction or agriculture is the Miyawaki 
method. It works well because it follows the principles 
of natural forestry, which include employing local plants 
and imitating the processes of how forests regenerate 
naturally. In comparison to traditional forests, Miyawaki 
developed forest areas have been found to have more 
biodiversity and are proved to capture more carbon 
emissions
To help develop clean & green 
environment around us.

Slop Boiler & Cogen
The unit operations that make up the overall system, are 
the growing and harvesting of sugar cane, transport of 
the harvested cane to sugar mills, production of bagasse 
as a by-product from the sugar milling process, and the 
combustion of bagasse to generate heat and electricity. 
Dhampur Sugar considered 60 MW of electricity 
exported to the national electricity grid as the functional 
unit of study. The characterised data for 60MW of 
bagasse-derived electricity were compared with data for 
60MW of coal-derived electricity, using the same set of 
characterisation factors. The results of this comparison 
indicated that bagasse-derived electricity performs well 
in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, acidiﬁcation, 
and non-renewable energy inputs. The Company has 
installed the slop boiler of capacity 55 TPH & 75 TPH with 
Cogen and all slope of distillery process is constipated in

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community
 
For Dhampur Sugar, the local community primarily consists of farmers from whom we procure sugarcane. We have a 
dedicated Cane Department which liaises with the farmers daily. There are societies established by the government which 
act as a medium between the Private Industry (sugar manufacturers) and the farmers. The society represents the rights of 
the farmers. In case of any grievance, the farmer shall ﬁrst raise the same to the society’s government representative who 
will then communicate the same to Company’s Cane department personnel for resolution. However, we at Dhampur 
Sugar try to go an extra mile via the cane department and ensure we are in touch with the farmers on a daily basis to 
ensure their needs and demands are duly cared for. All kinds of grievances – relating to seeds, plant diseases, raising 
of timely payment indents, etc. are noted and resolved by the Cane department representative. Apart from farmers, if 
there is a grievance from any other member of the community, they directly reach out to the respective department 
representative at the plant oﬃces – who shall then address and resolve the same.

Goals. We support a school – Pushp Niketan which is situated at the Company’s campus at Dhampur, District Bijnor. 
It has emerged as a unique model which is based on thematic, student-centered learning, project-based studies and 
learning journeys creating a holistic experience for imparting world class education to the rural population. This initiative 
is aligned to UN SDG 4 of Quality Education. We are also committed to SDG 3 of ensuring Good Health and Well Being 
of the local communities. In FY 2021-22, the Company partnered with PHDRDF to implement a project for ‘Free Mobile 
Health Services’ to provide improved healthcare facilities to the less privileged and low-income groups in the villages near 
the plants at Rajpura and Dhampur.
 
The project reached out to more than 30,000 people in 20 villages of Dhampur and Rajpura Block in Bijnor and Sambhal 
districts respectively, who were unable to access healthcare easily. It provided generic health care services to the people 
through mobile medical vans with testing devices like ECG, blood testing facilities. It was supported by a qualiﬁed 
medical team consisting of a medical doctor and paramedical staﬀ including a lab technician and ANM. Through our 
Pond Development projects, we are also trying to contribute towards SDG 6 of ensuring sustainable management of 
water resources. In order to revive and sustain groundwater in the areas around Dhampur and Rajpura we have adopted 
local ponds and have undertaken conservation initiatives for the same.
