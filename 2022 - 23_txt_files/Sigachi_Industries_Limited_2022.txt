Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
The identity of the complainant is kept private as much as possible. The accused is counselled or informed for possible 
severe disciplinary consequences if the complainant is harassed post the complaint. If there is a reporting relationship, the 
complainant is immediately aligned to an alternate manager. If necessary, the accused is put under a temporary suspension

vehicle to pick & drop the individual on a need basis. All efforts to arrive at a conciliatory settlement is made for both parties 
to settle matters amiably.
