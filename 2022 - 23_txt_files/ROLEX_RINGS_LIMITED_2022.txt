Emphasizing product quality 
and safety presents an 
opportunity for manufacturers 
to proactively address 
potential reputational and 
financial risks associated with 
subpar product standards. By

measures, companies can 
distinguish themselves from 
competitors and cultivate a 
reputation for reliability and 
customer satisfaction. This 
commitment to consistently 
delivering high-quality and 
safe products not only fosters 
customer loyalty but also 
encourages repeat business, 
ultimately contributing to 
enhanced profitability.

Employee 
well-
being and 
engagement
Opportunity
Employee engagement 
encompasses the emotional 
connections individuals 
form with an organization, 
which profoundly impact 
their dedication and 
sense of belonging. Active 
involvement of employees 
tends to foster heightened 
loyalty, while a higher rate of 
employee retention signifies 
commendable company 
policies and practices that 
contribute to enhanced 
employee satisfaction. 
Conversely, a high attrition 
rate indicates low levels of 
employee contentment.

Opportunities 
in Clean Tech
Opportunity
Clean technology presents an 
opportunity as it encompasses 
a range of measures 
designed to diminish or, 
ideally, eradicate detrimental 
environmental effects, while 
simultaneously promoting 
economic and social 
advancement. The primary 
objective of clean technology 
is to minimize or eliminate 
pollution and waste, all the 
while enhancing productivity 
and efficiency.

4
Community 
Relations
Opportunity
The industrial machinery 
and goods industry plays a 
significant role in the economy 
by providing employment 
opportunities and contributing 
to community development 
through taxes and capital 
generation. However, it also 
faces important considerations 
related to environmental 
policies, community health, 
and process safety. These 
factors have far-reaching 
consequences in terms of 
regulations, operations, 
finances, and reputation for 
companies operating in this 
industry.

(Indicate positive

To navigate these challenges, 
building strong relationships 
with communities becomes 
crucial. Such relationships 
can help mitigate potential 
operational disruptions, 
reduce regulatory risks, retain 
talented employees, minimize 
financial burdens associated 
with litigation resulting from 
process safety incidents, and 
secure a solid social license 
to operate. It is important 
to note that process safety 
incidents not only jeopardize 
community well-being but also 
carry the risk of regulatory 
penalties, legal actions, and 
significant costs for mitigation 
efforts.
5
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
The production, maintenance, 
repair work, and other on-site 
tasks in the industrial setting 
often require a significant 
amount of manual labour. 
However, this reliance on 
manual labour poses inherent 
risks. The workforce’s 
exposure to powered 
haulage and heavy machinery 
increases the likelihood of 
accidents, falls, fatalities, 
and injuries. Temporary 
employees, in particular, 
may face a higher risk due 
to their limited training and 
work experience. Failure to 
protect the health and safety 
of workers can result in fines 
and penalties, while severe 
incidents can lead to acute 
injuries and potential liabilities 
through legal or regulatory 
actions. Risks associated with 
health and safety issues can 
also cause project delays 
and downtime, resulting in 
increased project costs and 
decreased profitability.
At Rolex Rings’ premises, 
we conduct regular health 
and safety audits to 
identify any gaps related 
to occupational health 
and safety hazards. This 
includes safety protocols 
followed, appropriate 
Personal Protection 
Equipment gear adapted, 
any workplace hazard 
identification and others 
as per industry standards 
and health and safety 
standards, provide regular 
training and awareness on 
safe and healthy practices 
to be adopted, specifically 
at production floor. Provide 
mechanisms to report and 
monitor any Occupational 
Health and safety hazard to 
mitigate any risks.

Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk
Customer satisfaction 
serves as a critical measure 
of success, reflecting the 
extent to which businesses 
successfully deliver 
products and services that 
meet or surpass customer 
expectations. It provides 
valuable insights into 
an organization’s overall 
performance. However, a 
weak customer experience 
can pose risks such as the 
loss of existing customers 
or a decrease in customer 
loyalty. Additionally, the loss 
of customers and damage 
to reputation can result in a 
decline in sales and revenue.
We, at Rolex Rings, 
have customers from 
across industries and 
have fostered long-term 
relationships with many. 
We continue to satisfy 
our customer by providing 
best in class industry 
quality products, meeting 
customer expectations 
and providing ways of 
two way engagement. 
Implement procedures and 
ways to increase customer 
engagement to build 
customer loyalty and brand 
image.
Negative
7
Material 
sourcing 
efficiency
Risk
The industrial machinery and 
goods industry face inherent 
risks in their supply chains due 
to the reliance on essential 
materials incorporated in 
their products. Many of these 
crucial materials are sourced 
from deposits concentrated in 
a limited number of countries, 
some of which are susceptible 
to geopolitical disruptions. 
Moreover, the rising global 
demand for these minerals 
from various industries can 
result in price fluctuations and 
supply challenges, thereby 
creating a competitive 
landscape for companies 
operating in this sector.
Implement strategies 
and practices in place to 
improve procurement and 
sourcing of raw materials 
as it is critical for our 
uninterrupted production 
process. Foster positive 
relations with our vendors 
and suppliers to ensure 
long term sustainability in 
material sourcing. Further, 
adopt sustainable sourcing 
practices to procure 
sustainably sourced raw 
materials. Implement lean 
manufacturing practices to 
ensure a timely production 
process and reduce high 
and frequent dependency 
on suppliers.
Negative
8
Energy 
Management
Risk
The industrial machinery 
and goods industry often 
relies on significant energy 
consumption for the operation 
of various facilities and 
machinery that are not directly 
involved in manufacturing 
processes. The choices made 
by companies concerning 
the energy intensity of 
their operations and the 
energy sources they utilize 
can vary over time and 
have implications for both 
operational efficiency and risk 
exposure.
Rolex Rings has a 
diversified mix of 
energy. This is achieved 
by investments made 
into renewable energy 
sources like windmill 
and solar installations. 
Conduct energy audits to 
identify high energy usage 
areas and find ways to 
implement energy efficient 
technologies or process 
to reduce overall energy 
consumption. Adopt energy 
management systems to 
improve energy efficiency 
process.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses undergo 
evaluation based on their 
performance across various 
crucial governance areas, 
encompassing ownership and 
control, board remuneration, 
accounting practices, business 
ethics, and tax transparency. 
This assessment delves into 
the impact that a company’s 
corporate governance and 
business ethics have on 
its shareholders and other 
investors.
Rolex Rings Limited has 
efficient policies and 
practices in place to 
ensure effective corporate 
governance. We will 
continue to implement 
robust systems and 
practices to ensure ethical 
behaviour, transparency, 
and accountability in 
corporate decision-making. 
Regular monitoring, 
independent audits, and 
board oversight is essential 
to our business to operate 
sustainably and help 
mitigate any risk.
Negative
10
Labour 
Relations
Risk
Businesses that rely on on-site 
workers must prioritize the 
implementation of effective 
labour management practices. 
This entails considering 
various factors such as 
the size and intensity of 
the workforce, operational 
locations, the quality 
of management-labour 
interaction, and the company’s 
commitment to worker rights 
and engagement. The attrition 
of skilled labour, in particular, 
presents a significant 
operational risk for companies.
Implement strategies 
and practices aimed at 
fostering positive labour 
relations, ensuring equal 
opportunity to workers, 
providing worker benefits 
and nurturing a safe and 
healthy workplace. We 
have mechanisms in place 
where in any worker 
can redress grievances. 
This helps us create a 
transparent mechanism 
and ways to engage with 
them to increase positive 
labour relations.
Negative
11
Water 
consumption 
and 
wastewater 
management
Risk
Companies that heavily rely on 
water in their manufacturing 
processes face inherent risks 
related to water scarcity. This 
risk includes the potential 
for operational disruptions, 
escalating costs of water 
procurement, and increased 
capital expenditures. 
Additionally, manufacturing 
processes generate 
wastewater that requires 
treatment before disposal. 
Noncompliance with water 
quality regulations can lead to 
regulatory penalties and the 
need for costly compliance 
measures.
At Rolex Rings plants, we 
have a sewage treatment 
plant installed to ensure 
industrial wastewater is 
treated before it is released 
into the environment. 
Furthermore, implement 
water conservation ways 
to reduce the freshwater 
consumption. Also, 
regularly monitor and 
report on water usage 
performance to identify 
processes where water 
consumption can be 
reduced by implementing 
efficient methods of water 
management.

12
GHG 
emissions
Risk
The manufacturing of 
industrial machinery and 
goods equipment entails the 
direct release of greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions 
(Scope 1) resulting from the 
combustion of fossil fuels 
during manufacturing and 
cogeneration processes. 
Moreover, manufacturing 
operations generate air 
emissions and hazardous air 
pollutants. These emissions 
pose potential operating risks, 
leading to fines or expenses 
associated with regulatory 
compliance. Management of 
GHG emissions by prioritizing 
energy efficiency, utilizing 
alternative fuels, or enhancing 
production processes can 
unlock financial benefits 
such as improved operational 
efficiency and reduced 
regulatory risks.
Implement efficient 
emission monitoring 
systems to track and 
identify any hazardous/
toxic pollutants released 
directly into the air. 
Conduct regular GHG 
emissions audit to verify 
effectiveness of measures 
in place for emissions 
management. As a 
responsible automobile 
component manufacturer, 
we have also installed 
solar rooftop, solar ground 
mount and windmill 
energy capacity to offset 
our emissions and will 
continuously thrive to 
invest in GHG reduction 
projects and technologies.
