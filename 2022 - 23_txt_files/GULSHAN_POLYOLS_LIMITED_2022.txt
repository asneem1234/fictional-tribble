ANNEXURE-G TO BOARD’S REPORT 
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Gulshan Polyols Limited (GPL), also known as Gulshan, is a leading manufacturer of specialty chemicals based on grains and minerals in 
India, with a global presence in over 42 countries across three continents. The company has been in the business for over four decades and 
operates multiple facilities across India. Originally incorporated in 1981 as Gulshan Sugars & Chemicals Limited (GSCL) with a primary focus on 
manufacturing calcium carbonate, GSCL was demerged into three companies in 2000, and GPL is one of them. Since its inception, GPL has been 
a dividend-paying company and is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE).
The Indian chemical industry, expected to grow to US$ 300 billion by 2025, has the potential to become a significant player in the global 
chemicals industry, with the specialty chemicals market expected to reach US$ 64 billion by 2025.
Growth opportunities in the Indian chemical industry are driven by rising demand from end-user industries, supply disruptions in other 
countries, and the Indian government’s initiatives to boost manufacturing share in GDP through investment and incentive schemes.
With its skilled and low-cost labor, world-class engineering, and strong R&D setup, the Indian chemical industry has the potential to attract 
significant investments and become a global manufacturing hub in the coming years.
GPL’s product portfolio includes Sorbitol, Fructose & Sweetener, Starch, Ethanol, Calcium Carbonate, Ethyl Neutral Alcohol, Agro-based Animal 
Feed, and its by-products. The company has On-site PCC plants located in multiple production facilities across India and provides the know-how 
to set up these plants and maintain the supply of raw materials for the same. GPL has been successful in partnering with paper mills for On-site 
PCC technology and is a significant player in the mineral processing and grain processing segments in India, with a substantial market share.
GPL caters to a wide range of industries and niche markets, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, footwear, tyres, rubber & plastics, 
paints, alcohol, value-added paper, agrochemicals, food and agro products, ethanol, etc. The company has an impressive clientele comprising of 
the nation’s top FMCGs, leading paint manufacturers, and many reputed brands. Recognized by the Government of India as Star Export House in 
2016, Gulshan has been consistent in exporting its products to various parts of the world and caters to the top 1000 companies.
As pioneer of sustainable urbanization in India, Gulshan Polyols Limited has continued its effort to develop green, innovative, and customer-
focused solutions that are rooted in a legacy of trust and transparency. Its developments are characterized by thoughtful design and a welcoming 
environment that enhances overall quality of life for both individuals and industries.
Despite the significant unforeseen challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, GPL has continued to grow at the fastest pace in a decade, 
driven by the dedication of its employees and the trust of its customers. India’s manufacturing sector is rapidly growing, through various 
initiatives like ‘Make in India’; as the chemical industry is a crucial part of this growth, the government has allocated a substantial budget to 
support its development. However, the company recognizes the risks associated with high energy costs and is taking measures to control its 
costs and improve efficiency.
GPL is also committed to sustainable practices and ensures compliance with environmental and safety standards. The company’s strengths lie in 
innovation, sustainability, intellectual property creation, and collaboration, which gives it a competitive edge in the industry.
The Company focusses on efficient deployment of resources, including people, processes, and materials to produce safe products, with a view 
to creating value for all its stakeholders. This ensures that the Company embeds balance in its engagement with all stakeholders, keeping the 
community at the core of whatever the Company does.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Determination of scope of materiality assessment:
	
The first step involved defining the scope of the materiality assessment, which included identifying the issues, topics, or areas that could 
potentially impact the company’s operations, reputation, or stakeholders. This was guided by the SASB and GRI suggested approaches.
	
Identification of internal stakeholders
	
The second step involved identifying internal stakeholders who have a direct connection to the company, such as employees, shareholders, 
and management. All internal stakeholders who could be affected by the materiality assessment were identified.
	
Prioritization of identified stakeholders
	
The third step involved identifying external stakeholders who are impacted by the company’s operations, such as customers, suppliers, 
regulators, and the local community.
	
The final step was to prioritize the identified stakeholders based on their level of interest in the assessment and their level of influence over 
GPL’s operations. This prioritization was done to determine which stakeholders should be engaged further in the materiality assessment 
process.

1. 	
Boregoan plants and Upcoming project at Assam are on ZLD basis technology. Company has installed the waste heat recovery and Multi 
effect evaporators to treat the ETP treated water for its use in the various process and then final concentrated effluent is being used in coal 
yard for Ash quenching.
2. 	
All mineral processing plants also operate on ZLD basis by using its water in back process. As effluent has the high Ph and less COD. Hence, 
it is good for using in the washing or in back process.
3. 	
Our plants at Muzaffarnagar and Bharuch are having moderated ETP backed by Multieffect evaporators. ETP treated water is being used 
in RO and RO reject is being processed in Multieffect Evaporators. RO reject and other qualified effluent, which is complying with the state 
pollution control board guidelines, are discharged in designated drain. We have the permission of effluent discharge. Hence, all discharge 
qualifies the norms set by the authority.
