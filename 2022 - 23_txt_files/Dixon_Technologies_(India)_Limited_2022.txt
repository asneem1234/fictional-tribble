Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
From an opportunity perspective, Human 
Capital stands as a pivotal asset for the 
Company, especially within the rapidly 
evolving electronics industry. Amidst the 
dynamic changes and growth spurred by 
emerging and existing technologies, the 
Company's skilled workforce is key to 
remaining adaptable and relevant. This 
proficient labor force plays a vital role 
in ensuring the Company's sustainable 
growth. The implementation of skilling and 
engagement programs not only fosters 
holistic employee development but also 
secures their tenure. The Company's 
strategic approach involves both short-
term initiatives, including induction, 
skill enhancement, On the Job trainings, 
and technical training, and long-term 
aspirations, culminating in a cutting-edge 
Centre of Excellence (COE) that nurtures 
theoretical and practical learning. In 
terms of recognition, the Company has 
proudly held the Great Place to Work 
(GWP) certification for the past two years, 
underscoring a remarkable organizational 
culture upheld by its employees. This 
certification serves as a testament to the 
Company's foundation of trust, fairness, 
respect, and camaraderie – the very 
essence of a Great Workplace.
The Company is well-
prepared to address this 
without risk, given its 
implementation of diverse 
employee-centric initiatives, 
including skill development, 
training, and various 
engagement programs.
Positive Implications
Focusing on human 
capital advancement 
will yield favorable 
financial outcomes 
for the organization. 
Investing in employee 
well-being initiatives, 
providing competitive 
compensation, and 
offering benefits foster 
a robust Company-
employee relationship. 
This enhances 
retention rates, 
amplifies productivity, 
and elevates the 
Company's brand 
image.
2
Health and 
safety
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective: 
Ensuring the well-being of the workforce 
is imperative within the workplace. Given 
the Company's presence in the electronics 
manufacturing sector, safeguarding 
employee safety is of paramount 
importance. As a result, the Company 
employs a well-structured approach, 
aiming for a zero-injuries and fatalities 
stance. Following the 5S methodology, it 
proactively prevents and addresses health 
emergencies. To mitigate potential hazards, 
workers are equipped with appropriate 
safety gear in the factories. For instance, in 
the lighting manufacturing unit, specialized 
goggles shield employees' eyes from high-
intensity lights. The Company solidifies its 
dedication through a distinct occupational 
health and safety policy.
The Company's dedication to 
preserving workforce health 
and safety is evident in its 
record of zero accidents 
and LTIFR incidents in its 
operations.
Positive implications
Protection of health 
and safety of the 
workforce will have the 
positive  implication on 
the Company.

Energy 
Management 
and Emission 
Reduction
Opportunity
Opportunity
Recognizing that greenhouse gas 
emissions significantly contribute to 
escalating climate change risks, the 
Company has diligently undertaken various 
measures to curtail its impact on the global 
greenhouse gas inventory. Prominent 
among these initiatives is the adoption of 
renewable energy sources, exemplified 
by solar panel installation to fulfill energy 
requirements, alongside the substitution 
of more environmentally friendly fuels 
like replacing HSD with PNG. Moreover, 
the Company consistently gauges its 
greenhouse gas emissions according to 
global benchmarks such as ISO 14064 Part 
1 and ISO 14064 
Part 2. This commitment to sustainability 
extends to enhancing energy efficiency 
through similar strategies.
Since Company has been 
undertaking several 
initiatives to curb greenhouse 
gas emissions from its 
operations, it is less likely 
to pose any risk to the 
Company.
Positive implications
Climate technologies 
are currently in the 
nascent stage as a 
result of which initial 
investment into these 
technologies could be a 
costly affair. However, 
return on invest in 
the longer run, will 
be higher in terms of 
economical, social and 
environmental well-
being. 
4
Waste 
management
Risk
Risk Perspective: 
Waste management stands out as a 
significant concern for the Company. 
Mishandling waste could result in legal 
ramifications, fines, and reputational 
harm. Moreover, a primary waste category 
stemming from the Company's operations 
is e-waste, which carries considerable 
hazards. Inadequate waste management 
might trigger environmental contamination 
and jeopardize the well-being of humans 
and other life forms.
The Company adopts a highly 
proactive stance in its waste 
management approach. 
Collaborating with authorized 
third-party vendors 
sanctioned by Pollution 
Control Boards, the Company 
ensures the secure disposal 
of waste, including e-waste 
and plastic waste. This 
process commences with 
meticulous segregation at the 
point of origin – for instance, 
in the manufacturing 
facilities, designated bins 
facilitate segregated waste 
collection. Subsequently, 
the segregated waste 
undergoes recycling or safe 
disposal by authorized waste 
collectors. Notably, within 
the mobile manufacturing 
division, no waste generated 
in the production process 
remains with the Company. 
All materials, including 
packaging waste, are 
returned to the client, making 
them responsible for proper 
disposal.
Negative implications
While engaging a 
government-authorized 
recycler might entail 
certain costs for 
the Company, these 
expenses pale in 
comparison to the 
substantial positive 
environmental and 
social benefits that 
ensue.

Product 
Design and 
Innovation
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective:
As new technologies emerge and existing 
ones evolve, the electronics industry, much 
like other sectors, undergoes substantial 
transformation. To stay aligned with these 
evolving needs, proactive measures are 
vital to consistently innovate product 
design and manufacturing procedures. 
In harmony with this principle, Dixon has 
made substantial investments in enhancing 
its Research and Development capabilities 
to elevate the Company's design and 
operational processes.
Company has state-of-the-
art R&D facilities which have 
been working tirelessly on 
innovative technologies 
for better efficiency 
and performance of the 
design and manufacturing 
processes.
Positive implications
It will have positive 
financial implications 
as development of 
new technologies 
will improve the 
performance, 
efficiency and 
functioning of 
the existing 
products. This will 
increase customer 
satisfaction and 
trust which may be 
reflected in positive 
revenue growth. 
However, Company 
will have to invest 
certain amount 
initially to enable the 
process. 
6
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective: 
The Company recognizes that neglecting 
sound corporate governance can lead to 
regulatory non-compliance, resulting in 
fines, penalties, and damage to reputation.
Rising legal and financial vulnerabilities: 
Deficient corporate governance practices 
can expose the company to legal and 
financial hazards. To mitigate this, the 
Company has instituted a robust corporate 
governance framework, ensuring 
adherence to all relevant regulatory 
stipulations. Additionally, the formulation of 
various policies formalizes the Company's 
commitment to uphold and foster 
strong corporate governance practices. 
The Company maintains an in-house 
compliance management tool (Lex comply) 
to stay updated on laws, rules, regulations, 
and the latest amendments. 
Company’s policies and 
good corporate governance 
practices will help to build

Supply chain 
management
Risk
Risk Perspective:
In globalized world, supply chain has 
become quite complex and extensive. 
Certain factors are at play for ensuring the 
robust and disruption-free supply chain 
like geo-political factors, logistical factors, 
quality, accessibility and availability of 
the materials etc. Therefore, it is quite 
important that effective supply chain 
management system is established for 
the sustenance of the business in the 
emergency situation. 
The Company recognizes 
the significance of 
establishing an efficient 
supply chain management 
system, understanding 
that an uninterrupted and 
seamless supply chain 
is crucial for sustaining 
business operations. To 
achieve this, the Company

measures to avert supply 
chain disruptions and 
ensure the efficacy of its 
supply chain processes. 
These initiatives encompass 
prioritizing local suppliers 
whenever feasible and 
leveraging SAP technologies 
for inventory management.

and laptop manufacturing 
sector, raw materials for 
the production process 
are provided by the

Climate 
change 
strategy
Risk
Risk Perspective: 
 Climate change has emerged as an 
undeniable reality in today's world. Notably, 
the repercussions of climate change, such 
as heatwaves, floods, and landslides, have 
gained prominence, prompting regulatory 
measures in response. Just like various 
other sectors, the electronics industry is 
vulnerable to both physical and transitional 
consequences of climate change. To 
address these challenges proactively, the 
Company recognizes the need to evaluate 
factors that could potentially impede its 
operations.
Company believes that first 
step towards improving 
lies with the assessment 
of where we currently 
stand. Therefore, has been 
considering conducting the 
climate risk assessment 
to clearly understand the 
impact of climate change on 
the Company’s operations. 
It believes that this process 
will enable in charting out 
the effective mitigation 
strategies.
Negative implications

certain cost initially 
in assessment and 
developing mitigation 
strategies. However, 
Return on Investment 
(ROI) in longer run 
is supposed to be 
positive.
10

the Company's image. Given its values, 
dedication, and compliance with legal 
mandates, the Company has implemented 
exemplary measures to ensure the 
protection of human rights. It has devised 
and enforced multiple policies,  
Company has been 
continually working to ensure 
the proper the compliance 
with the relevant statutory 
laws and implementation of 
its policies. It understands 
that as society is evolving at 
a rapid pace, it will also have 
to evolve its practices to be 
at par with the best practices 
and create better working 
environment for the people.

Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective: Biodiversity 
stands as an advantageous aspect for the 
Company due to its minimal susceptibility 
to the Company's operations. None of the 
Company's factories are situated within or 
near the government-designated protected 
areas. Additionally, the Company's 
business strategy explicitly avoids 
establishing factories in protected or world 
heritage sites, further emphasizing its 
commitment to biodiversity preservation. 
Consequently, this signifies a reduced 
impact of the Company on biodiversity and 
vice versa.

and privacy
Opportunity
Opportunity Perspective:
Company acknowledges that 
mismanagement of data can cause 
significant regulatory implications as well 
as reputational damage to the Company. To 
enable the same, Company has been taking 
initiatives to improve the information 
technology system of the Company. For 
example, Company has been getting their 
information technology system certified 
with ISO 27001. 
Company has formulated 
and implemented data 
privacy policy and also 
has been strengthening 
information security system. 
The Company has been on 
a regular basis monitoring 
their softwares and framing 
stringent policies for cyber 
security. The Company has 
implemented access control 
and IPS/IDS in firewall which 
reduced the risk of unwanted 
access and hacking.
This will have positive 
financial implications 
on the Company as 
it will prevent data 
breaches and other 
cybersecurity related 
risks.

Dixon Technologies (India) Limited
Annual Report 2022-23
Dixon technologies is placed at a strategic position in the supply chain, as it is manufacturing the electronic products 
for some of the leading electronic brands across the globe. As a result of its global footprint, it is primordial 
for the Company to comply with both national as well as international rules and regulations. Also, it needs to 
keep its manufacturing capacity, including the infrastructural as well as technical capacity, at par with the best 
global practices. Resultantly, the Company has been continually innovating its product design and manufacturing 
capabilities. Further, its operational activities take sustainability parameters into consideration as it acknowledges 
that a truly sustainable company should act towards preserving the environment, proving labor/employee friendly 
environment at the workplace while ensuring the economic efficiency of the Company. 
The Company's business endeavors are bifurcated into two distinct categories: ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) and OEM 
(Original Equipment Manufacturer). Under the OEM classification, the Company follows directives furnished by the business 
client throughout the entire product manufacturing trajectory – spanning from design conception to actual production and 
packaging. Conversely, in the ODM segment, the Company conceptualizes its own design, which subsequently evolves into the 
final product. However, the approval of the Business client remains imperative in this process as well. As such, irrespective of the 
product category, the Company ensures that its products are developed in a sustainable and responsible manner. For instance, 
the Company provides optimal workplace conditions for its factory workers, prioritizing their safety. With an environmental 
focus, the Company has strategically integrated solar panels at various sites and is progressively transitioning to cleaner fuel 
sources, such as PNG. This ecological approach significantly diminishes the Company's environmental footprint, contributing 
to an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during operations. Moreover, stringent quality assurance procedures are 
executed, exemplified by the lighting segment, where QR codes are affixed to products, enabling product traceability to address 
any arising issues. Consequently, the Company's collective endeavors exemplify its commitment to delivering superior-quality 
products while concurrently safeguarding the environment and the communities within which it operates.

Annual Report 2022-23

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
10 If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, 
biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones etc.) where environmental approvals / 
clearances are required, please specify details in the following format:
	
The Company has implemented a robust waste management system to efficiently handle waste generated during manufacturing 
processes and overall operations. The foundation of this approach rests on the 3Rs framework: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, 
which aims to curb waste generation in the first place. A meticulous step-by-step process ensures effective waste management. 
Beginning with proper segregation at the point of origin, this process enhances recyclability and reusability of waste while 
minimizing the potential for environmental contamination.
	
In particular, for the management of e-waste and plastic waste, the Company has established partnerships with government-
authorized recyclers. This collaboration diverts waste from landfills, fostering recyclability and responsible waste management. 
Notably, in the mobile and laptop manufacturing sector, waste generated during production doesn't remain within the Company's 
premises for disposal, with the exception of laptop packaging waste, for which the Company assumes responsibility. Instead, all 
types of waste are returned to customers, who are accountable for their appropriate management.
	
Furthermore, the Company has embraced the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (ROHS) directive. This entails the restriction 
of six hazardous materials – lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), hexavalent chromium (Cr6), polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), 
and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) – in the manufacturing of electronic and electrical devices.
