Energy 
Efficiency
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Energy 
management has 
been identified 
as a key material 
issue under Climate 
change and 
environmental risk. 
Climate Change and 
Environmental risks 
are addressed to 
emphasise on the 
Company’s climate 
consciousness and 
its contribution 
towards mitigation 
action plans against 
climate change. 
Opportunity: 
Comprehensive 
resource 
management plans 
in alignment with 
the Company’s 
environment 
conservation 
strategy will 
highlight the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to improving 
environment 
preservation and its 
contribution towards 
climate change 
mitigation action 
plans.
The Company focusses on four major 
areas related to climate change i.e. energy 
conservation, water conservation, use of 
renewable energy and waste minimisation. 
The Company’s Environment, Health and 
Safety (EHS) Policy covers all employees and 
stakeholders across all manufacturing units. 
In Lighting manufacturing processes, high 
energy consumption equipment had been 
replaced with cost effective energy-efficient 
equipment. The Company regularly monitors 
the operations and capacity optimisation of 
pumps, motors and cooling tower operations, 
to take corrective actions. The Company is 
contributing 
towards 
global 
environment 
by complying with ISO Certification i.e., ISO 
9001, ISO 14001 & OHSAS 18001 under the 
Integrated Management System, in each and 
every process of the Company. The Company 
regularly assesses various environmental 
risk associated with its activities and its 
likely impact. The purpose of this procedure 
is to establish and maintain procedures for 
identifying 
environmental/hazard 
aspects 
of activities. The manufacturing units have 
embraced initiatives on clean technology and 
energy efficiency. Innovative technologies have 
been implemented to reduce the impact on 
the environment. The Company has installed 
solar panel at its manufacturing facilities at 
Bahadurgarh and Malanpur Steel Plant and 
will be installing solar panel at all its other 
manufacturing units in time to come. In the 
longer term, the Company aims to reduce CO2 
emissions and generate energy at a lower cost 
at its factories in India. This, is in-sync with 
the Company’s approach towards ‘building 
a sustainable ecosystem through efficient 
energy consumption and optimum utilisation 
of natural resources such as solar power and 
wind energy. Furthermore, this project will 
also enable significant operating cost-savings 
for the Company such as lower energy loss, 
reduced electricity bills and maintenance costs
Positive: The 
Company’s focus 
on strengthening 
climate and ESG 
specific initiatives 
bolsters long term 
value-creation 
and enables 
the Company 
to effectively 
respond to rising 
stakeholder 
demands.
Negative: Lack of 
robust initiatives 
and action plans to 
contribute to ESG 
awareness and 
climate change 
could adversely 
impact business 
operations and 
lead to workforce 
disruption.

Human Rights 
Practices
Risk
Risk: Absence of 
a comprehensive 
Human Rights 
governance 
structure from 
the aspects of 
parameters such as 
working conditions, 
child/ forced labour, 
fair remuneration, 
gender diversity, 
prevention of 
sexual harassment, 
freedom of 
association, and 
collective bargaining 
will impact the 
Company’s 
performance in the 
social domain from 
the perspective 
of the employee 
workforce as well as 
the community.
The Company respects human rights of all 
relevant stakeholders and groups within 
and beyond the workplace including that of 
communities, consumers and marginalised 
groups. All the practices and policies of 
the Company, including engagement with 
suppliers and contractors, among others, 
ensure that human rights are honoured 
and protected. To respect the human 
rights of our employees, including non-
discrimination, prohibition of child and 
forced labour, freedom of association 
and the right to engage in collective 
bargaining. 
Surya 
Roshni 
strives 
to 
ensure that there is no discrimination 
or harassment due to gender, religion, 
ethnicity and disability. We continuously 
work towards building a conducive work 
environment wherein merit in qualification 
and performance becomes the sole criteria 
for selection and performance appraisal 
and the work environment is free from all 
forms of harassment - physical, verbal, 
psychological, sexual etc. Integrating a 
strong governance structure for Human 
Rights from the aspect of Human Rights 
Policy, freedom of association policy 
and due diligence across the business 
operations extending to supply chain 
partners and vendors.
Positive: 
Comprehensive 
alignment of 
Human Rights 
principles in 
accordance 
with the guiding 
principles of 
national and 
international 
Human Rights 
standards amplifies 
the Company’s 
performance in 
the social aspect 
as well as reflects 
its commitment 
towards human 
rights integration 
within the 
Company’s 
business model.
Negative: The 
absence of a 
Human Rights 
governance 
structure could 
result in employee 
dissatisfaction, 
impacting 
the workforce 
productivity that 
could impact the 
Company’s long-
term business 
growth plan. 
The lack of a 
strong redressal 
mechanism 
may result in 
non-compliance 
issues from a 
relevant regulatory 
perspective

Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure)
Our commitment to all aspects of sustainability is embedded in our founding 
principles — valuing our people, our partners, our communities, and our 
environment. These strategic principles drive long-term value creation 
for all of us. Our sustainability strategy is an ongoing journey, and we plan 
to use our entrepreneurial, innovative spirit to continue to be a leader in the 
industry. Surya Roshni aims to continuously contribute to the prosperity of 
its local communities and long-term sustainability. Thus, Sustainability and 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) form an integral part of the Company’s 
daily operations. The Company offers a wide array of products across both 
business verticals. These products are sold across India and exported to 
over 50 countries. As a result, the Company has de-risked itself from a 
specific industry or region-specific risks and built long-term sustainability. 
The Company has an established framework for the identification of internal 
and external risks specifically faced by the Company, in particular including 
financial, operational, sectoral, sustainability (particularly, ESG-related 
risks), information, cyber security risks, or any other risks, and ensure that 
appropriate methodology, processes, and systems are in place to monitor and 
evaluate risks associated with the business of the Company. We endeavour to 
provide a safe and healthy working environment, use resources effectively and 
efficiently, and be accountable and transparent regarding the impacts of our 
activities. We recognise the importance of energy conservation and well aware 
of the deleterious effects of global warming and climate change. The Company 
has already undertaken various energy efficient steps that strengthen its 
commitment towards becoming an environment friendly organisation. We 
continuously play our active part in reducing emission, conserve energy, 
safe-disposal of wastes, protect man-kind so as to preserve our country’s 
ecosystem. We also strive to exceed existing standards and stakeholder 
expectations and actively contribute to industry best practices.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social

The Company’s response on Process: At Surya, the stakeholder engagement mechanism is a key driving force 
towards strengthening and diversifying the stakeholder relationship, which further facilitates the identification of key 
material issues impacting the Company’s growth. The stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment exercise 
conducted in 2022-23 led to the prioritisation of material issues, mapping of the risks relevant to each material topic, 
and development of consequent risk mitigation steps. The primary outcome of the stakeholder engagement exercise 
resulted in the identification and prioritisation of material issues relevant to environmental, social, governance, and 
economic aspects. The identified material issues were presented to the highest governing member and the Board for 
their feedback and guidance on strategising the sustainable growth model of the Company. As part of the Company’s 
efforts to continually engage with internal and external stakeholder groups for the identification of key material issues 
impacting them, the stakeholder engagement exercise undergoes periodical review.
