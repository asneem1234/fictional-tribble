Risk
The sustainability of Cyient’s supply

Noncompliance with sustainable 
practices by suppliers could directly 
affect Cyient’s Scope 3 emissions. 
Furthermore, if any of Cyient’s suppliers 
fail to comply with regulations, it could 
have negative impacts on the company’s 
operations and reputation.

4.	
Stakeholder Engagement: We sought opinions from internal and external stakeholders about the criticality of 
identified issues and weighted stakeholder responses vis-à-vis their influence on our business.
5.	
External Requirements: We benchmarked listed issues against other reporting frameworks, such as UN 
SDGs, National Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs), and Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
Our sustainability interventions focus on material issues identified through this calibrated approach, helping 
us achieve our sustainability goals and better understand our stakeholders’ needs.

7. 	 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
We undertake efforts to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are aware of the Cyient Business Code of Conduct 
and Human Rights Policies and are aware that any complaint that violates those policies will be investigated. We are 
dedicated to fostering an environment at work where associates can do their jobs without fearing discrimination, 
gender bias, or sexual harassment. 
All employees have the right to be treated with respect, and if sexual harassment occurs at work or elsewhere that 
involves employees, it is a serious offence that must be punished. A committee has been established by management 
to investigate and address sexual harassment complaints. At each of the company’s locations, the Chairman and 
Managing Director may establish the committees that may be necessary to fulfil the requirements of the Act.
	
8. 	 Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
Yes, human rights requirements are part of our business and contracts, through our Vendor Code of Conduct. We

human rights and that they refrain from engaging in violations of those principles.

9.  	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
At our organization, we prioritize waste management practices to minimize our impact on the environment. 
We have established a system of segregated bins for different types of waste, including recyclable materials, organic 
waste, and non-recyclable waste. Our primary sources of waste, such as e-waste and computer peripherals, are collected 
and safely stored for three years before being disposed of through Pollution Control Board (PCB) authorized vendors. We 
also work with authorized vendors for paper waste management practices and use notepads made from recycled papers. 
Additionally, we have installed organic waste converters (OWCs) to manage food and garden waste, which process the waste 
and convert it into compost used for gardening and landscaping. Our associates are encouraged to avoid using hazardous 
and non-biodegradable products, and we periodically send awareness emails to reinforce this message.
To ensure that we comply with our waste management practices, we have implemented strict security measures at our 
main gate. Vendors are checked and stopped if they do not follow our waste management practices, and we encourage the 
use of biodegradable products. Finally, we treat wastewater generated at our establishments through a Sewage Treatment 
Plant (STP) to ensure it meets the necessary standards before being discharged.
Cyient minimizes the usage of toxic chemicals, including those in STP and cleaning processes. We dilute chemicals to 
reduce their concentrations, ensuring safer handling. Furthermore, all chemicals used at Cyient are certified by authorized 
agencies, providing assurance of their quality and compliance.

Cyient recognizes the criticality of its Corporate IT infrastructure in supporting global delivery models and maintaining 
seamless communication with clients. To mitigate potential disruptions, Cyient has developed a comprehensive 
business continuity and disaster management plan. This plan involves identifying essential functions and transactions, 
conducting Business Impact Analysis, and dividing services into independent activities. In the event of a disaster, a 
Crisis Management Team (CMT) oversees recovery efforts, while an Emergency Response Team (ERT) handles on-
site emergencies. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) plays a key role in building resilience within the Corporate IT 
infrastructure. By implementing these measures, Cyient aims to ensure continuity, minimize downtime, and safeguard 
its business reputation and growth.
