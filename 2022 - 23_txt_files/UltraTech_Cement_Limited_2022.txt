Global regulation 
on curbing Green 
House Gases 
Emission
Risk
Limestone is the main input 
for cement manufacturing and 
requires fossil fuel for burning 
the limestone. This process 
releases CO2 during calcination 
of limestone and combustion 
of fuel.  This could contribute 
to global warming and impact 
business continuity and/or 
disruption.
To mitigate the risk, the Company 
has set voluntary targets to reduce 
emissions by 27% and 69% for 
scope 1 and scope 2 respectively, 
by 2032 from 2017 as base year, 
which is validated by SBTi.
The Company is taking initiatives 
such as energy transition to 
renewables, increasing the waste 
heat recovery systems, increase in 
green product portfolio and use of 
alternative fuels and raw materials. 
The Company is also exploring 
innovative technologies like 
electrical energy to thermal energy 
for high temperature applications, 
carbon capture and potential 
energy for energy generation. The 
Company entered into MoU with 
many international players for new 
technologies. All these initiatives 
would lead to net zero by 2050.

Climate

With increased awareness of 
climate change, the consumer 
today is consciously shifting 
towards greener products. 
This brings an opportunity 
of higher revenue to the 
Company due to its diverse 
product portfolio and 
reducing the carbon footprint. 
The Company has GreenPro 
certification for 70+ products, 
high blended cement usage, 
Xtralite -AAC blocks and 
Readiplast - products with 
lower carbon footprint.

and reduces the emission of 
GHG.

heavily in using waste from 
various industries and 
agricultural residuals. 
The state-of-the-art R&D is

Kinney & Fine method. The initial risk score considering existing control is equal to ExSxP. If the risk score 
is beyond tolerable limit, additional controls are exercised and after considering them, the final score is 
assigned. Efforts are made to follow hierarchy of control in the order of elimination, substitution, engineering 
control, administrative control and personal protective equipment (PPE). Prioritised actions are taken to 
reduce/ manage significant risks. Apart from tier-1 risk assessment described above, tier -2 risk assessment is 
also done for high risk activities with the help of HAZOP, PHA and Bowtie, as applicable.

Managing Director and Chief Manufacturing Officer review organisational safety performance once every two 
months and further course of action is communicated across Units for implementation.
	
To further strengthen safety governance, the following Leaders’ Connect initiatives were introduced:
 
• 
Periodical Safety Review by Chief Manufacturing Officer, Unit Head, Function Head (Technical) and 
Department Head (Safety) of randomly selected three Units connected every week and Chief Manufacturing 
Officer interacted with them on all safety KPIs of their respective Unit.
 
• 
Cluster Head – Weekly review of WTI done by employees across Units through “Pratibimb” - a creative 
initiative to improve and strengthen safety and awareness at all workforce levels. 576 employees connected 
through 144 sessions during the year.

Leadership Indicators:
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Company’s Mission - To deliver superior value to our stakeholders on the four pillars of:
Sustainability  |  Innovation  |  Team Empowerment  |  Customer Centricity.
	
As a step in this direction, the Company engages with stakeholders as on ongoing process - be it investors; lenders; 
analysts; shareholders; employees; customers; suppliers and other channel partners.
	
This enables the Company to feel the pulse of stakeholders, their expectations and aspirations. Feedback 
received during interactions with stakeholders are deliberated by the management team and implemented, where 
appropriate.
	
The Board and relevant Committees are briefed about the interactions with the stakeholders and action 
implemented.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Stakeholders form an integral part of the Company’s business. Consultations are in the form of investor meetings; 
employee engagement; vendor / dealer meets; inter-action with host communities; training programs, among 
others.
	
The Company is committed to driving sustainability. It is focusing on reducing the carbon emissions by a number 
of ways. The decarbonisation framework includes driving efficiency improvements, introducing new technologies 
219
Statutory Reports
for reducing carbon footprint, using alternative energy, recovering waste heat, increasing renewables in the energy 
mix, introducing green product continuously in the portfolio, adopting circularity, reducing water usage and 
improving biodiversity. It also has effective community management and human rights management.
	
The Company benchmarks its sustainability practices with global players through Global Cement and Concrete 
Association (GCCA). As the founding member of the GCCA, the Company has played a pivotal role in launching 
GCCA’s India operations and exploring the new technology adoption possibilities.
	
The Company undertakes its social initiatives under the aegis of The Aditya Birla Centre for Community Initiatives 
and Rural Development, under the able leadership of Mrs. Rajashree Birla. The key focus areas are education, 
healthcare, women-empowerment, sustainable livelihood, infrastructure and social reform.
	
It follows a bottom-up approach for all social projects. All projects are planned in consultation with the community. 
The process involves interacting with them and understanding their challenges and issues. We interact with village 
panchayats and prepare a list of requirements based on in-depth focused discussions. Implementation and 
monitoring of a project is a mutual responsibility of the community and the team. Regular community stakeholder 
meetings are held to ensure appropriate implementation process is followed. Once the project achieves a status 
of self-sustenance, ownership is transferred to the villagers. This transfer of responsibility ensures a culture of 
empowerment and self-reliance.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable / 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
The Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) projects of the Company aim to focus on a social transformation in the 
life of its disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised stakeholders. The Company ensures that the CSR funds are 
utilised in an optimum manner that uplifts the weaker sections of the society.
	
The Company works towards overall development of the way of life of the communities around its Units, most of 
which are in distant rural areas and tribal belts. It reaches out to more than 1.6 million people across 500 villages 
spanning 16 states.
	
It works to actively contribute to the social and economic development of communities in which it operates. The 
details of projects undertaken under CSR activities towards vulnerable / marginalised stakeholder groups are 
provided in the Social Report section of this Report.
