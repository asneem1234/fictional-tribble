1
Climate 
Change 
Mitigation
Opportunity
The hydropower industry can 
contribute 
to 
climate 
change 
mitigation 
by 
expanding 
capacity, integrating intermittent 
renewables, 
and 
enhancing 
resilience to climate impacts. This 
will help reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and combat climate 
change globally. 
Not Applicable
Increased investment prospects, 
revenue 
generation 
potential, 
cost 
savings 
through 
carbon 
avoidance, access to incentives 
and subsidies, financial resilience 
to climate risks, access to green 
finance, 
and 
improved 
risk 
management through insurance.
2
Water 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity 
SJVN may face risks in water 
management 
due 
to 
climate 
change 
and 
hydrological 
variability. Fluctuations in water 
availability can affect electricity 
generation capacity and revenue, 
while droughts or reduced flows 
can reduce power production. 
Compliance with environmental 
regulations 
and 
mitigation 
measures may also be challenging.
SJVN can reduce water management 
risks 
by 
investing 
in 
advanced 
hydrological modeling, water-efficient 
technologies, 
diversifying 
water 
sources, engaging stakeholders, and 
investing in reservoir management 
techniques. 
These 
strategies 
improve forecasting, planning for 
water scarcity, optimizing usage, and 
minimizing wastage in hydropower 
plants. Regular consultations and 
transparent communication help build 
positive relationships and mitigate 
conflicts.
The 
costs 
associated 
with 
regulatory 
compliance, 
environmental 
mitigation, 
and 
dam safety maintenance can 
strain the company’s financial 
resources. Stakeholder concerns, 
including conflicts over water 
allocation and social impacts on 
local communities, can also create 
financial and reputational risks for 
SJVN.
3
Community 
Development
Opportunity
SJVN, as a responsible corporate 
citizen, has assimilated Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) as an 
integral part of its business and 
is pledged to fulfill its social and 
environmental commitments for 
meaningful organizational growth. 
SJVN Foundation through various 
CSR initiatives works for the 
upliftment and development of 
society by driving inclusive growth, 
social equity, and sustainable 
development. 
Not Applicable
SJVN is of the firm belief that a 
part of its profits should essentially 
and regularly flow to the society 
and the stakeholders in terms of
the government guidelines.

Stakeholder 
Engagement
Opportunity
Stakeholder engagement presents 
a valuable opportunity for SJVN. By 
actively involving and collaborating 
with stakeholders, including local 
communities, indigenous groups, 
government agencies, and non-
governmental 
organizations, 
SJVN can gain an edge.
Not Applicable
SJVN can minimize risks by 
actively involving stakeholders. 
This 
approach 
identifies 
and 
addresses 
concerns 
early, 
reduces conflicts, builds positive 
relationships, 
supports 
social 
liaison, and minimizes reputational 
risks. 
Engaging 
stakeholders 
accelerates project timelines and 
reduces costs.
5
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
SJVN may face occupational health 
and 
safety 
challenges, 
which 
expose employees to hazards like 
accidents, injuries, and potential 
loss of life. Inadequate addressing 
can result in legal liabilities, 
financial penalties, project delays, 
and damage to the company’s 
reputation.
SJVN prioritizes employee well-being 
and safety through comprehensive 
policies, regular risk assessments, 
PPE 
provision, 
safety 
training, 
inspections, 
emergency 
response 
plans, 
and 
open 
communication 
channels. 
This approach ensures a safe working 
environment and minimizes accidents 
or injuries, fostering a strong safety 
culture.
Workplace accidents and injuries 
can lead to increased costs, 
compensation claims, and project 
disruptions, affecting employee 
morale, productivity, and retention, 
ultimately 
affecting 
company 
financial performance.
6
Human 
Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity 
SJVN prioritizes human rights 
for 
ethical 
and 
sustainable 
business 
practices, 
building 
strong relationships with local 
communities 
and 
indigenous 
groups. This commitment fosters 
trust, goodwill, and a positive 
reputation. 
Integrating 
human 
rights principles into policies and 
practices creates an inclusive 
work 
environment, 
attracts 
talent, and establishes itself as a 
responsible and socially conscious 
organization in the hydropower 
industry.
SJVN 
upholds 
human 
rights 
standards by investing in community 
development programs, establishing 
grievance 
mechanisms, 
and 
prioritizing employee rights and safety. 
This approach promotes sustainable 
development, positive relationships, 
and fair labor practices.
Failure to respect and protect 
human 
rights 
can 
result 
in 
reputational 
damage, 
legal 
disputes, 
regulatory 
non-
compliance, and social unrest.
7.
Risk 
Management Risk 
SJVN has a comprehensive Risk 
Management Policy. The Policy 
has been duly supplemented with 
separate 
and 
comprehensive 
Risk Management Plans for each 
project duly approved by the 
Board. The main objective of risk 
management is to identify all the 
business-related activities followed 
by activity related potential risks 
followed 
by 
identification 
of 
various triggers and other factors 
associated with risks and their 
mitigation measures to overcome 
them with minimum effect to 
business.
SJVN has a Risk Management 
Committee is to monitor, review 
and update the Risk Management 
Policy, Plan and to discharge all such 
functions and responsibilities.
The risk management framework 
entails formulation of a Risk Matrix to 
assign the likelihood of occurrence to 
the assigned risks along with definition 
of nature of risk viz. controllable, 
Uncontrollable & partly controllable, 
suggesting a mitigation mechanism 
and lead responsibility centre. 
The risk management policy has a 
defined Risk Organization Structure 
with Chief Risk Officer at the helm 
supported by Risk Controller along 
with Risk Managers and Risk Officers 
performing the line functions. 
Without 
a 
risk 
management 
strategy, the company may be 
more susceptible to unforeseen 
risks, business disruptions and 
events. 
This 
could 
result 
in 
financial losses due to inadequate 
preparation or inability to respond 
effectively.

8. 
Ethics and 
Transparency 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Ethical conduct is the core of 
integral relationships for SJVN 
and underlies all organizational 
values. A diversified and skilled 
leadership team that provides 
strategic oversight with complete 
transparency and accountability 
is the driving force behind the 
Company’s ardent promotion of 
ethical business practices among 
its workforce, business partners, 
and customers.
Provisions on ethics, anti-bribery, 
and 
anti-corruption 
(ABAC) 
are 
embedded in the Code of Ethics 
and Whistle Blower Policy. In house 
training programme are conducted in 
various units of SJVN on preventive 
vigilance from time to time. Similarly, 
the Company periodically conducts 
training sessions to build awareness 
on the Company’s POSH
Policy.
The Code of Conduct for the Board 
of Directors and Senior Management 
has 
mentioned 
the 
Company’s 
commitment towards a workplace free 
of discrimination and harassment. 
SJVN has a well-defined Integrity 
Pact to remove corruption and ensure 
transparency.
Lack of ethics and transparency 
can 
strain 
relationships 
with 
business 
partners, 
suppliers, 
and customers. If stakeholders 
perceive the company as engaging 
in unethical practices or lacking 
transparency, it can lead to strained 
partnerships, contract disputes, 
or lost business opportunities. 
The financial implications include 
potential contract terminations, 
increased procurement costs, or 
difficulty in securing new business 
partnerships.
9.
Regulatory 
Compliance 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Regulatory compliance processes 
and strategies provide guidance 
for organizations as they strive 
to attain their business goals. By 
ensuring regulatory compliance, 
SJVN 
can 
demonstrate 
its 
commitment 
to 
responsible 
conduct, safeguard its operations, 
and maintain a positive reputation, 
thus 
securing 
its 
long-term 
sustainability.
The company has adequate internal 
control system, and the transactions/
processes are guided by delegation 
of powers, policies, rules, guidelines, 
and manuals framed in compliance 
with relevant laws and regulations. It 
includes evaluation of effectiveness 
of existing processes, controls, and 
compliances.
As a listed company, SJVN has been 
complying with the requirements 
of 
Corporate 
Governance 
under 
the SEBI (LODR) Regulations and 
Guidelines issued by Department of 
Public Enterprises, Government of 
India. In this regard, SJVN has been 
constantly achieving “Excellent” rating 
for compliance with ‘DPE Guidelines 
on Corporate Governance’ under 
the ‘Corporate Governance Grading 
System’ prescribed by DPE.
SJVN 
is 
also 
compliant 
with 
environmental 
laws 
where 
they 
operate. 
Regular 
environmental 
monitoring is done at SJVN projects 
and six-monthly compliance reports 
of Environment Clearance are sent 
to MoEF&CC and other concerned 
authorities.
Non-compliance can result in 
legal consequences such as fines, 
penalties, and legal actions. These 
legal repercussions can have a 
significant financial impact on the 
company, potentially affecting its 
profitability, reputation, and market 
standing.

6.     Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and workers? If “Yes”, 
give details of the mechanism in brief: 
Permanent Workers 
At SJVN, we attempt to redress the complaints and grievances of our employees through well framed 
Grievance Redressal Machinery which ensures expeditious settlement of grievances within the stipulated 
time frame. 
The individual grievances of the employee are dealt through a three-stage process. In case the employee is 
not satisfied with the reply at Stage-I, the grievance can be escalated to Stage-II and Stage-III respectively. 
For fair and timely Redressal of the complaints, Corporate IR & Welfare section at corporate level and 
respective HR at Project level is designated department for processing of Grievances. 
Stage I: The aggrieved employee shall take up his/her grievance orally with his/her immediate superior 
(not below the rank of Dy. Manager) who shall give a personal hearing and try to resolve the grievance at 
his/her level within a period of 7 days. Wherever necessary, the officer concerned can consult the Head 
of department and/or such other departments before communicating back to the aggrieved employee. In 
case the employee is not satisfied, he/she can submit his grievance in writing in Annexure-1 to the Head of 
Department concerned or the Head of HR Department within 15 days from the date of receipt of oral reply 
from his immediate superior. 
Stage II: On the grievance submitted by an employee in Annexure-1 to the Head of Department/Head of 
HR Department, if the concerned Head of Department/Head of HR Department is not able to arrive at any 
satisfactory decision, he/she may refer the grievance to the Grievance Settlement Committee. The Committee 
will examine the details of the grievance and may also discuss the same with the aggrieved employee, if felt 
necessary. The Committee shall give its reply to the aggrieved employee within 30 days from the date of 
receipt of the grievance. However, where felt necessary by the Committee, it may make a recommendation 
for a final decision by Director (Personnel), who will convey his/her decision within 30 days from the date of 
receipt of grievance from the Committee. 
Stage III: In exceptional cases and with the concurrence of the Director concerned, the aggrieved employee 
who is not satisfied with the decision of Grievance Settlement Committee/ Director (Personnel) will have an 
option to appeal to Chairman & Managing Director.

quality. At our sites, we reutilize the muck (in backfilling, construction 
material, etc.) and safely dispose it off at authorized disposal sites.  
Cumulatively, 680,45,79 m3 of 
muck was generated, of which 
997,852 
m3 
was 
reutilized 
and 580,67,27 m3 was safely 
disposed at dumping area.
