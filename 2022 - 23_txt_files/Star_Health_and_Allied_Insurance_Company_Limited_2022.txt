practices and international standards (ISO:27001)

information from malicious actors.

enhances digital transition services thereby improving 
the top-line growth. Negative- Weak data systems 
would directly impact the business productivity and 
would result in loss of data.
6

Opportunity- Risk management is the process of proactively 
identifying, assessing and controlling threats to an organization’s 
capital and earnings. It helps to analyze the relation between risks and 
the potential consequences for an organization’s strategic goals.
At Star Health, Risk management is not seen 
as a standalone function, but as an integral 
component of the organization’s activities and 
decision-making process. Our risk management 
culture is deeply ingrained in our strategy and 
company structure.
Positive-  Effective risk management systems are 
critical to the company’s overall performance and .
7
Business Continuity
Risk
Risk- Lack of business continuity or disaster management systems 
could result in financial losses and disruptions in the business’s 
critical operations including people, information, infrastructure and 
premises. These risks involve any contingencies arising from natural 
disasters, fires, disease outbreaks which pose as a threat to the 
organization’s day-to-day operations.
Opportunity- A well developed and robust business continuity plan 
would establish efficient risk management procedures and systems 
that aim to prevent interruptions in the company’s daily activities and 
re-establish the full function of the organization with little downtime 
as possible.
Star Health has designed and implemented a
