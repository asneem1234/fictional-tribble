Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate

1.
Digital theft, 
mobile security 
and firewall
Opportunity 
As with every passing day, more 
and more people adopt and 
shift 
to 
digital 
transactions, 
theft and security issues have 
also emerged. Countries across 
the globe has a sizeable elderly 
population who may not be 
very sophisticated in operating 
phones and computers; this at 
the same time offers an incredible 
opportunity for RML through 
security/ 
scanning 
offerings 
and thus leading to increasing 
revenue from our curated service 
offerings.
NA
Positive
2.
Talent pool
Opportunity 
and Risk
Increasing revenue from service 
offerings 
from 
cutting 
edge 
technology & products, enabled 
by our talent pool; this could also 
pose as threat as the company 
may lose in talent retention if 
the millennial talent pool is not 
provided with satisfactory career 
programmes accompanied by 
industry competitive facilities at 
work place.
Talent re- skilling, attrition
Positive: Given niche 
talent 
pool, 
we 
can emerge as a 
preferred 
business 
partner.

Opportunity
Our platform reliability creates 
differentiation from competitor 
by ensuring high service delivery.
Strengthen infrastructure, 
implement redundancy 
measures, 
continuous 
monitoring 
and 
maintenance
Positive
4.
Business 
Continuity
Risk
Any downtime can result in 
poor customer experience and 
potential customer loss.
Develop comprehensive 
business continuity plans, 
conduct 
regular 
drills 
testing 
and 
establish 
backup systems
Negative
5.
Innovation
Opportunity
We 
continuously 
enhance 
product capabilities and drive 
multiple revenue streams with 
existing / new customer base. 
At the same time, this helps 
enhance 
service 
quality 
and 
customer retention.
Foster 
a 
culture 
of 
innovation, invest in R&D, 
and 
collaborate 
with 
technology partners
Positive
6.
Digital Inclusion 
resulting in 
market growth
Opportunity
In order to provide access to 
everyone in society, especially 
those in rural areas and low-
income households, Companies 
are making huge investments 
in 
digital 
Infrastructure 
and 
programmes 
that 
aim 
to 
narrow the digital divide. As 
more companies across various 
sectors 
have 
started 
using 
cloud-based services, the cloud 
communication market in India 
is expanding quickly. This creates 
various opportunities for RML.
NA
Positive:
With 
Digital 
inclusion 
and 
rapidly 
growing 
market 
several 
opportunities 
are 
created.
7.
Digital Identity
Opportunity
To avoid income loss, enterprises 
must be prepared to resist identity 
theft in real-time. Additionally, 
it's critical to protect clients from 
fraud and inconveniences by 
adding an additional degree of 
security to their online experience.
NA
Positive:
TruSense 
– 
A 
product launched 
by the Company

reliable 
identity 
verification 
and 
intelligent 
fraud 
detection 
with 
a 
frictionless 
user 
experience
8.
Data Privacy 
and Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
As we process data, we may be 
exposed to privacy breach claims. 
Further various countries have 
regulatory authorities for e.g. TRAI 
in India. These authorities define 
rules of the game for CPaaS 
players and changes to these 
regulatory requirements could 
affect business potential.
Privacy policy, employee 
training. 
Robust 
Compliance programme, 
audit.
Negative:
Claims under privacy 
laws in jurisdictions 
where we operate.

Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief and if 
available, provide a web-link to the policy.   
	
At Route Mobile Limited, we have instituted a stringent anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy, underlining 
our commitment to upholding the highest standards of professional conduct, fairness, and integrity in all 
our business interactions and relationships across the globe. We operate under a policy of zero tolerance 
towards any form of bribery or corruption, whether direct or indirect. This applies universally to all individuals 
associated with our Company, including employees of all levels, consultants, contractors, volunteers, interns, 
agents, sponsors, and anyone else connected with Route Mobile Limited or its subsidiaries.
	
Our policy explicitly prohibits our associates, consultants, advisors, and employees from engaging in any form 
of bribery, including potential bribery, whether directly or through third-party conduits. If any member of our 
team suspects or becomes privy to possible instances of bribery involving the Company, they are obligated to 
report their suspicions to the Company's Audit Committee, adhering to the established reporting procedure.
	
Furthermore, our policy explicitly forbids the making or accepting of facilitation payments or 'kickbacks'. 
Facilitation payments refer to small, unofficial payments made to secure or expedite a routine governmental 
action, while 'kickbacks' are payments made in exchange for a business favour or advantage. The Company’s 
Audit Committee oversees the review of any internal investigations into suspicions of fraud, irregularities, or 
significant failures of internal control systems and reports such matters to the Board.
	
For more details, please refer our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy, which is available at https://routemobile.

2.	
Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of 
the Board? (Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes.
	
Our company has a robust system in place to manage and avoid conflicts of interest involving members of 
the Board.
	
Firstly, we have adopted a comprehensive "Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management," which 
clearly outlines the expected ethical behaviour and provides guidance on potential conflict of interest situations. 
This Code of Conduct is readily accessible and can be reviewed at https://routemobile.com/wp-content/
uploads/2021/11/Code-of-Business-Conduct-and-Work-Ethics-Policy.pdf
	
In our commitment to transparency, Board members are required to disclose any entities or arrangements 
in which they have a vested interest. This information is then made known to the Board to ensure everyone is 
aware of potential conflicts. Furthermore, we receive an annual declaration, which can be updated as necessary, 
from our Board members and Key Management Personnel (KMP) outlining any entities they have interest in.
	
Prior to engaging in any transactions with such entities or individuals, we ensure that requisite approvals are in 
place as per statutory requirements and the company's own policies. This ensures that any potential conflicts 
of interest are handled appropriately and transparently.
	
All related party transactions were conducted under the careful scrutiny of the Audit Committee, ensuring that 
they were carried out at arm's length and in the ordinary course of business. This serves as a testament to the 
effectiveness of our conflict of interest management process.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
Yes.
	
	
Our organisation is strongly committed to sustainable sourcing practices. The majority of our operational 
inputs are locally procured, which not only reduces the time, cost and efforts associated with procurement 
but also lessens the environmental impact of transportation. Furthermore, we insist that our suppliers 
adhere to our comprehensive 'Supplier Code of Conduct', which covers crucial areas such as anti-bribery, 
prohibition of child labour and anti-harassment measures.
	
	
Additionally, a significant portion of our value chain partners comprise large telecommunications operators. 
These partners adhere to stringent sustainability standards and maintain relevant certifications. This 
partnership ensures that our sourcing practices align with sustainability principles and contribute positively 
to our environmental and social footprint.
	
	
However, it is important to note that while we prioritize sustainable sourcing, the exact percentage of 
inputs sourced sustainably is currently not ascertainable due to the varied nature of our sourcing practices 
and the complex metrics involved in sustainability assessments. We are continually working to enhance 
our data collection and analysis capabilities in this area to provide more quantifiable measures of our 
sustainability efforts.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste.
	
As an IT services company, our waste generation is not material as that of other industries. Nevertheless, we 
remain committed to minimising our environmental impact and responsibly managing the waste generated 
from our operations. In this context, here's how we address various types of waste:
	
a)	
Plastics:
	
	
We opt for minimal plastic usage, promote reusable items and properly dispose of plastic waste.
	
b)	
E-waste:
	
	
We established an e-waste collection system, partner with certified recycling facilities, encourage 
refurbishment and reuse, and adhere to e-waste regulations.
	
c)	
Hazardous waste:
	
	
We properly dispose of hazardous waste such as batteries and printer cartridges, and train employees on 
proper handling.

to us with regard to occupational health and safety. As RML is a 
telecommunication technology enabled communication service 
provider, there are no product risks but there are those related to the 
provision of services like ergonomics in work as well as those associated 
with the operation of utilities and employee commute. Safety is a core 
value at Route Mobile Limited. We operate in a manner that helps 
protect our employees, contractors, customers and the communities 
where we operate.

local labour laws and regulations, and we ensure clear communication and transparency during these processes.

to their retirement savings plans and any accrued vacation time. For those facing termination of employment,

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
The Company has a comprehensive framework in place to protect individuals who come forward with 
complaints of discrimination or harassment, as reflected in our Whistle-blower and Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH) policies.
	
Our Whistle-blower Policy encourages all employees to voice concerns regarding human rights violations, 
improper conduct, or any unethical activities within the company. We assure our employees that any such 
reports made in good faith will be treated with utmost confidentiality and respect. Importantly, we have a strict 
non-retaliation clause embedded in this policy, which strictly prohibits any form of retaliatory action against 
individuals who report such incidents. We have designated a Competent Authority to handle these complaints, 
ensuring that they are addressed professionally and appropriately.
	
Similarly, our POSH policy is designed to prevent and address sexual harassment in the workplace. We are 
committed to providing a safe and inclusive working environment for all our employees. If an employee or job 
applicant chooses to exercise their right to make a complaint under this policy, we guarantee that they will be 
protected from any form of retaliation. This is part of our commitment to fostering a respectful and dignified 
work environment for all.
	
We regularly reinforce these policies and their protections during mandatory training sessions, ensuring that 
every member of our team understands their rights and the company's commitment to uphold them. We also 
continually review and update our policies in accordance with evolving laws and societal standards to make 
sure we are providing the best possible protections for our employees.
8.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts?
	
Yes. Our commitment to upholding human rights extends not just to our own operations, but also to our 
business relationships. As such, we have incorporated human rights requirements into our business agreements 
and contracts.
21
	
Our Supplier Code of Conduct, which forms a standard clause in all our contracts, explicitly outlines our human 
rights expectations. Our major suppliers, including those providing IT support, staffing solutions, facility 
management, and security services, are bound by this Code. This is especially significant for those suppliers 
that employ individuals from more vulnerable demographics with lower literacy levels.
	
We make every effort to ensure our partners are well-informed about our Supplier Code of Conduct and 
the human rights requirements it entails. We emphasise the importance of these standards not only in 
initial contract negotiations but also in our ongoing business relationships. Our partners' adherence to these 
standards is a key component of our decision-making when selecting and retaining suppliers.
	
Furthermore, we monitor compliance with these standards regularly and take necessary action in the event 
of non-compliance. This diligent approach is part of our commitment to promote human rights across our 
business ecosystem and to contribute positively to all communities we interact with.

consulting firms, staffing agencies, and partners who are expected to adhere to the same high standards. To 
ensure this, we regularly conduct employee training programmes focused on fostering an environment of 
respect and sensitivity towards human rights.

At Route Mobile, our value chain primarily consists of large telecom partners who 
are recognised for their robust policy frameworks that uphold ethical corporate 
behaviour in accordance with international benchmark practices. This ensures 
that the vast majority of our value chain is governed by stringent ethical standards, 
reflecting our own commitment to corporate responsibility and integrity.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is a crucial component of our contractual relationships, 
underpinning our interactions with all our partners, suppliers, and vendors. It's not 
just a document; it's a commitment that forms a standard clause in all our contracts, 
reinforcing our collective responsibility to uphold ethical practices.
While we trust in our partners' established policy architecture, we also believe in 
proactive measures to ensure compliance. Therefore, we are taking steps towards 
assessing the adherence of our value chain partners to our Supplier Code of Conduct, 
thus further ensuring that our commitment to ethical practices is consistently 
upheld across our entire value chain.
