Rationale for

Employees are an important 
resource at GSPL. Because of the 
nature of the operations, staﬀ 
health and safety are critical. 
Health, safety and wellbeing is 
ensured by means of evaluation 
and oversight of health and safety 
risks throughout the operations.
In contrast to the burning of coal 
and oil, natural gas combustion 
emits signiëcantly fewer pollutants 
and GHGs per unit of energy. 
Technologies and regulations are 
in place to reduce carbon 
emissions caused by natural gas 
leaks, allowing for the complete 
realisation of natural gas potential 
climate beneëts. As a result, GSPL 
has a great chance as it increases 
operations to provide natural gas, a 
fuel that is friendly to the 
environment.
Human rights have been cited as 
one of the priorities by our 
employees, communities, and 
investors. 
Our commitment to advancing a 
fair and equitable culture and 
respect for human rights 
throughout the business is a 
crucial part of realising our 
strategy and overarching purpose. 
Any violation of the human rights 
code will result in disciplinary 
action. Furthermore, it could 
impact our image and our capacity 
to draw talent.
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate 
GSPL has a comprehensive

Grievance Redressal Mechanism (INGRAM), Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAM), State 
Wide Attention on Grievances through Application of Technology (SWAGAT).
Note : Assumptions while computing and submission of data i) Value of Gas Purchase for internal usage  &  Trading has not been 
considered. ii) Value of  Gas Transmission Services from other pipeline operators has not been considered. 
GSPL is acquiring Right of Use (RoU) on land on temporary basis only and thus not changing any land use pattern. Pipeline 
laying activities in particular land area will be limited to only few days and the soil will be reinstated near to its original condition 
after laying of pipeline hence the eﬀected landowners can resume their cultivation activities as before. So, the project impact is 
temporary in nature and reversible. In addition to that, pipeline alignment is planned away from any village or settlement thus 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement issues do not arise.
