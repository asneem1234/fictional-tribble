Financial implications

implications)
1
GHG  
Emissions
Risk 
Given that SHK 
manufactures   
fragrances, the processes 
consumes electricity 
and other fuels, 
thereby resulting in 
GHG emissions.
With strict regulations on 
GHG emissions emerging 
every year, there maybe 
be a direct impact on 
the Company.
To mitigate these risks, SHK 
has implemented a Solar 
Energy project at their 
manufacturing plants. 
This has reduced the CO2 
emissions as compared to the 
use of conventional energy 
sources.  
SHK has replaced the fuel 
source for the boiler at the 
manufacturing unit in Vashivali.
SHK has installed a briquette 
boiler which is fitted with a 
dust collector.
This has eliminated particulate 
discharge and reduced the 
overall CO2 emissions as 
compared to traditional boilers.
Positive: 
•	 Reduction of 
GHG emissions
•	 Increased trust 
and credibility 
from stakeholders
Negative: 
•	 	Taxes on fossil fuels

2
Energy  
Management
Risk 
The manufacturing 
processes of SHK 
consumes electricity 
and fuel. 
There may be 
risks due to high 
energy consumption.
This can result in 
increased costs, 
regulatory non-
compliance, and 
reputational damage. 
SHK has taken steps to reduce 
power consumption at Vashivali 
factory by setting up a 360kWh 
Solar PV power plant. 
This project will produce 
6,20,500kWh of energy annually, 
and has helped reduce costs. 
This project has helped 
reduce 30% of our electric 
power requirement.
Negative: 
•	 	Increased costs 
on higher 
energy consumption 
Positive: 
•	 Increased trust 
and credibility 
from stakeholders
•	 	Effective energy 
management can 
lead to significant 
cost savings
3
Water &  
Wastewater  
Management
Risk
SHK’s manufacturing 
processes consume water 
and produce wastewater.  
Risks may arise due to 
poor water management, 
leading to increased 
water consumption and 
increased costs. 
Risks from ineffective 
Wastewater treatment 
include wastewater 
contamination of 
surrounding areas 
and degradation of 
the environment and 
water quality. 
SHK has installed a rainwater 
harvesting plant at its Vashivali 
plant, to collect rainwater from 
all the buildings on site. This has 
helped harvest close to 5,000-
5,500 kilo liters of water year-on-
year.
As a result of the implementation 
of a Multi-effect Evaporator 
(MEE) and Reverse Osmosis 
(RO) facility, the Company's 
Vashivali facility has Zero 
Liquid Discharge.
Negative: 
•	 	Increased costs 
due to higher 
water consumption  
Positive: 
•	 	Effective 
management of 
water thereby 
reducing the overall 
water consumption
•	 	Reduction in 
costs from better 
water management
•	 Effective treatment 
of wastewater 
reducing the impact 
on the environment 
and surroundings.

Human Rights 
&  Community  
Relations
Opportunity
Human Rights and 
Community relations 
is an opportunity for 
SHK to enhance its 
brand reputation, build 
trust, and gain  internal 
employees', and external 
community’s support. 
Healthier and simplified 
Human Rights procedures 
and policies will help 
create a positive 
environment to work. 
Engaging with local 
communities through 
philanthropic initiatives, 
volunteerism, and 
environmental 
stewardship can 
demonstrate SHK's 
commitment to 
social responsibility 
and sustainability.
SHK has a Human Rights Policy 
and has laid down steps and 
processes to help employees in 
all stages of the employee life-
cycle. Necessary trainings and 
employee engagement activities 
are conducted throughout 
the year. 
SHK has taken up many 
initiatives in CSR for the 
local communities. 
In collaboration with Sukruta 
Rural Empowerment Foundation, 
SHK helps accomplish 
Foundation's initiative of 
employing and educating 
women affected by drought; 
to pluck and dry Neem seeds 
that are further cold pressed to 
manufacture Neem oil.
In an attempt to make education 
accessible for all, SHK has 
established the Kelkar Education 
Trust in 1979. Through this Trust,  
SHK has setup  Shri Vaze College 
of Arts, Commerce and Science 
in Mumbai.
SHK also partners and 
contributes for upgradation 
of sanitation facilities and 
educational infrastructure.
Positive:
•	 	Community relations 
will enhance 
a Company's 
reputation, attracting 
customers and 
investors, and 
improving brand 
loyalty, leading to 
increased revenue 
and market share. 
•	 Human Rights 
processes can 
help gain the trust 
of Employees 
and Workers. 
5
Workforce  
Health &  
Safety
Risk
As SHK’s manufacturing 
processes involve 
handling of chemicals 
there may be a risk to 
worker health and safety, 
if not handled properly.
SHK conducts training for all  
its employees on Health and 
Safety. The Code of Conduct 
also emphasizes on the Health 
and Safety measures for all the 
employees and workmen. 
SHK also has a dedicated EHS 
policy that is committed towards 
occupational health, safety and 
environment protection.
Negative: 
•	 Risks related to 
employee well-being  
Positive: 
•	 Increased awareness 
and training on 
Health and Safety 
aspects will have a 
positive impact by 
reducing the overall 
number of safety 
related incidents.

Supply Chain  
Management
Risk
As SHK is reliant on 
many raw materials 
from different suppliers, 
Risks may arise due to 
supply chain disruption, 
moderate supplier 
performance and 
sustainability practices 
of suppliers, and geo-
political challenges.
SHK has a dedicated Policy 
towards Sustainable Supply 
Chain and Responsible 
Sourcing Policy.
All aspects of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) 
shall be complied by suppliers. 
SHK assesses its suppliers’ 
manufacturing  to ensure 
all aspects of quality and 
timely delivery of products 
are maintained. 
Alternate Supply of Raw 
Materials, supported     by 
Innovation, Backward Integration 
and Operational Efficiency.
Negative: 
•	 Delays in production 
due to substandard 
supply chain 
management.  
Positive: 
•	 	Increased awareness 
and compliance from 
suppliers will help 
towards creating a 
Sustainable Supply 
Chain. This will 
help reduce delays 
from suppliers, 
increased quality of 
products and better 
management of ESG 
issues in the supply 
chain.

Outcome of the initiative 
1
Condensate Recovery 
(Water Conservation) 
Water utilised for steam traps and cooling 
jacket is collected in a separate tank and 
used for cooling tower make-up water
Reduced inlet effluent load. Reduced excess load 
on RO and MEE. Reduction in usage of water.
2
RO permeate 
effective utilisation 
(Water Conservation)
Effluent is treated in RO plant, and the 
water is then utilized in cooling tower and 
for gardening purposes. 
Reduction in usage of water.
3
Reduction of Organic 
Load on Effluent 
Treatment Plant (‘ETP’) 
Before cleaning the vessels with water, 
fragrance material is collected from vessels 
by wiping them.  
Reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (‘COD‘) 
load on ETP (<2500 ppm); Reuse of approximately 
180 liters of fragrance on monthly basis; 
Reduction in usage of water. 
4
Effective Oil Recovery 
at Effluent Treatment 
Plant (‘ETP’)  
A mechanic oil belt skimmer is used to 
collect oil layer.
Reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (‘COD’) 
load on ETP, thereby improving bio-reactor 
efficiency.
5
Protection of 
environment 
Use of 10%  lime powder as a stabilizer in 
ETP sludge to reduce the Calorific Value 
(<2500 cal/gm) 
Reduction in incineration of sludge.
