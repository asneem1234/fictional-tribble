Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements.
	
A shift towards more sustainable living is not only shaping new trends in every industry and ours is not an exception. 
Today the variety of products where innovation is used necessitates producers to continuously improve quality and 
offer products with a lesser carbon footprint. While doing this, apart from the monetary factors, non-monetary 
aspects of sustainability are essential in all round growth of the Business. This brings us to the formal recognition 
to the best practices which are required to be followed by the corporate in the Environment, Social & Governance 
gamut.
	
The operations of the Company are carried on in a manner which ensure Zero Liquid Discharge. Secondly, the 
Company generates most of the energy required by its operation by using bagasse which ensures minimum carbon 
footprint. It is one of the biggest suppliers of ethanol to the Oil Marketing Companies, which will help the country 
reduce its carbon footprint in a big way, apart from planting trees in big numbers and engaging with farmers on drip 
irrigation techniques and other efficient methods for cultivation of sugarcane. In the coming years, the Company 
plans to gear up on its sustainability efforts by making processes more energy efficient, and find newer ways of 
contributing to reduction in its carbon footprint.

SDG 7: AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY:
• 
For captive consumption, the company uses a large proportion of energy generated by 
their cogeneration units. Around 83% of the cogeneration process is renewable energy, 
resulting in a significant reduction in GHG emissions. (501 Mn KwH of clean energy 
generated).
• 
The Company has undertaken various power conservation initiatives during the year, 
mainly installation of LED bulbs in place of conventional bulbs, solar power plants and 
solar heaters. The Company installed 150 KWH Solar power plant at Pathri plant, 32 No. of 
2.0 KWH capacity of solar heater at Athani Plant and 1,921 LED bulbs from 20 Watts to 200 
Watts at all the plants. All this resulted in power saving of 2.85 Mn KWH during the year.
•

and in one unit installation solar power plant to conserve the energy 2.849 Mn kwh per 
year.
• 
Their cogeneration power plants convert bagasse, a by-product of the sugar manufacturing 
process, into electrical and thermal energy. Hence, the majority of their cogeneration 
process is powered through a circular economy that ultimately results in significant 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. A significant portion of the power generated is 
consumed captively within their plants, while the remainder is sold to the state electricity 
grid, other industries & in power exchanges.

matter content to the standard prescribed limits.
• 
SRSL has installed fully automated weather stations at Athani (2) and Kolavi (2) to provide 
climatic updates and necessary steps to farmers associated with the organization. The 
weather stations are strategically located to cover all SRSL farmers. Predictions from 
AWS are used to generate advisories, which are circulated to 10,000 farmers via IVR and 
WhatsApp.
SDG 11: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNTIES:
• 
Under the Sustainable sugarcane cultivation Joint Project in Athani and Kolavi, training 
sessions are conducted at the village level for 24 days a month. Two meetings are held 
each day to address various topics. Additionally, regular meetings are held with farmers to 
address routine issues they encounter.
• 
In the Havalga unit, field days and farmers’ training/awareness programs were conducted. 
Expert entomologists and plant pathologists were invited to deliver lectures on managing 
pests like White fly and Root Grub, as well as diseases like Rust and Smut in sugarcane 
crops.
• 
206 farmers (120 from Athani and 86 from Kolavi) were trained on various topics related 
to sugarcane cultivation at S. Nijalingappa Sugar Institute, Belagavi. The training included 
field demonstrations, distribution of a Sugar Cane handbook, and providing soil moisture 
indicators for practical use.
SDG 12: RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION:

of spent wash. After extracting energy from spent wash, the potash rich fly ash generated 
from these incineration boilers can be used as a source of potash nutrition for agricultural 
green belt development.
• 
The Company also actively conducts numerous cane development activities such as 
enlightening our growers of the new methods of cane plantation and irrigation, and 
providing them with pesticides, organic manure and crops at subsidised rates.
• 
Their sugar mills are fully integrated to process sugarcane and manufacture sugar using 
a sulphur-free process, enabling them to provide their customers with superior quality 
products.
• 
The company distributed 50 battery operated spray pumps (Athani 26 & Kolavi 24) to 
promote spraying of nutrients, biofertilizers.
