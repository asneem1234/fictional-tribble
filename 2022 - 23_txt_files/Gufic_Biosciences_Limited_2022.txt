DIRECTORS MESSAGE:
In our commitment to responsible business practices, we are pleased to present our first Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report for the Financial year 2022-23, which outlines our efforts and progress in the areas of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) responsibilities. We recognize the challenges posed by ESG-related issues and have taken 
significant steps to address them.
We acknowledge the pressing environmental challenges that our planet faces today. Climate change, resource depletion and 
pollution are among the critical issues affecting our ecosystem. As a responsible business, we have set targets to reduce our 
carbon footprint, minimize waste generation and promote sustainable resource management. Through our innovative 
initiatives and collaborations, we are adopting eco-friendly practices across our operations. A comprehensive Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP) has been formulated to delineate the protocols for recovering and securely disposing of products 
that have expired or are defective. In compliance with government protocols, these products are disposed of or incinerated at 
waste management facilities that hold official government approval.
We understand that social issues are intertwined with our business ecosystem. We strive to create a positive impact on society 
by focusing on employee welfare, community engagement and inclusive practices. Our goals include promoting diversity and 
equality within our workforce, ensuring fair labour practices, protection of human rights, prevention of sexual harassment and 
supporting local communities through various social welfare programs. During the financial year 2022-23, our Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) endeavours encompassed a diverse range of initiatives, spanning healthcare, education, rural 
development, animal welfare, amongst others. 
We recognize the significance of strong corporate governance in sustaining long-term business success. Transparent and ethical 
practices are fundamental to our operations. Our governance framework ensures compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements, promotes accountability and maintains a robust system of checks and balances. We also have a secure grievance 
redressal and whistle blower mechanism within the organisation ensuring that our stakeholders can rely on us to uphold our 
core values and maintain the utmost levels of corporate governance. We continuously assess and enhance our governance 
practices to uphold the highest standards of integrity and instill trust among our stakeholders.
We take pride in the achievements we have made in our ESG journey. Our efforts have led to significant reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions, increased representation of women in leadership positions and strengthened partnerships with local 
communities. We have implemented robust monitoring systems to track our progress and continuously improve our 
performance. Looking ahead, we have set ambitious targets to further reduce our environmental impact, enhance social well-
being, and strengthen our governance practices. We are committed to actively engaging with stakeholders and collaborating 
with industry peers to address emerging challenges and drive positive change.
In conclusion, we remain steadfast in our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles of ESG. By 
embracing these challenges head-on, we aim to create sustainable value for our stakeholders and contribute to a better future 
for generations to come.

Furthermore, as part of our commitment to stakeholder satisfaction, the Board or Management reviews all complaints
 
raised and oversees the closure of such queries or complaints. This ensures that appropriate actions are taken to address
 
stakeholders' concerns and resolve any outstanding issues. Our grievance redressal process aims to foster transparency,
