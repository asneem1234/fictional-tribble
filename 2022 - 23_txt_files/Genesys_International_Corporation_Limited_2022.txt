S.

Material issue

Indicate 
whether 
risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for 
identifying 
the risk / 
opportunity
In case of risk, approach	
to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1
Climate 
Change
Risk
Climate change 
and its associated 
impacts pose 
a  risk to the 
environment, 
society and 
business. 
Climate change is a global 
issue impacting one and 
all. Genesys believe in 
environmental 
protection 
follow the environmental 
friendly 
practices 
and 
create awareness.
Risk: The financial implications 
of not adapting or mitigating 
the risk can include increased 
costs due to regulatory non-
compliance, fines, penalties, 
reputational 
damage 
and 
potential 
loss 
of 
business 
opportunities.
2
Employee 
Health and 
Safety
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Ensuring a safe 
and healthy work 
environment 
is essential 
for employee 
well-being and 
productivity. 
Failure to 
prioritize 
employee health 
and safety 
can result in 
accidents, 
injuries, increased 
absenteeism, 
decreased 
productivity, and  
potential legal 
liabilities.
Implementing  health and 
safety policies,  providing 
necessary 
training 
and 
fostering a culture of safety.
Risk: The financial implications 
of not mitigating employee 
health and safety risks can 
include 
medical 
expenses, 
legal 
costs, 
compensation 
claims, increased insurance 
premiums, reduced productivity, 
and potential damage to the 
company’s reputation. 
Opportunity: By investing in 
employee health and safety can 
lead to improved productivity, 
reduced costs associated with 
accidents and injuries, and 
enhanced employee morale 
and 
retention, 
resulting 
in 
positive financial implications.
This is already in practice at 
GICL.

Cybersecurity 
of On- 
Premises IT 
Infrastructure
Risk/ 
Opportunity
In today’s digital 
landscape, 
cyber threats are 
pervasive, and 
businesses face 
an increasing risk 
of cyberattacks, 
data breaches, 
and unauthorized 
access to 
sensitive 
information. As 
Genesys relies on 
its on-premises IT 
infrastructure for 
critical operations 
and data storage, 
ensuring robust 
cybersecurity 
measures is 
essential.
Genesys 
adapt 
by 
implementing 
a 
comprehensive 
cybersecurity 
framework, 
including firewalls, intrusion 
detection systems, regular 
vulnerability assessments, 
data encryption, access 
controls, 
and 
employee 
training on cybersecurity 
best practices. 
Regular monitoring and 
updating 
of 
security 
systems are crucial to stay 
ahead of evolving cyber 
threats.
Risk: Failure to adequately 
address cybersecurity risks can 
result in financial losses due to 
data breaches, legal liabilities, 
reputational 
damage, 
loss 
of customer trust, regulatory 
fines, and potential disruption 
of business operations.
Opportunity: 
Implementing 
robust cybersecurity measures 
can help protect sensitive data, 
maintain business continuity, 
preserve customer confidence, 
and minimize financial losses 
associated with cyber incidents.
This is already in practice in 
GICL through a systematic 
audit of the IT infrastructure. 
4
Manpower 
Attrition and 
Loss of Talent
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Manpower 
attrition refers 
to the departure 
or loss of 
employees, 
resulting in a 
loss of valuable 
talent, expertise, 
and institutional 
knowledge. 
It can impact 
team dynamics, 
productivity, 
and competitive 
advantage.
Implementing 
effective 
employee 
retention 
strategies, 
including 
competitive compensation 
and benefits, opportunities 
for 
growth 
and 
development, a positive 
work culture, and initiatives 
to 
promote 
employee 
engagement 
and 
well-
being. 
Conducting 
exit 
interviews and analyzing 
employee 
feedback 
provide insights to address 
underlying issues leading 
to attrition.
Risk: The financial implications 
of 
manpower 
attrition 
include 
costs 
associated 
with recruitment, hiring, and 
training of new employees. 
Additionally, the loss of talent 
and institutional knowledge can 
lead to decreased productivity, 
potential disruption of business 
operations, and a decline in 
competitive advantage.
Opportunity: By implementing 
effective retention strategies 
can help reduce recruitment 
and training costs, maintain 
productivity, 
preserve 
institutional 
knowledge 
and 
enhance 
the 
organization’s 
overall financial performance.
This is already in practice in 
GICL through a systematic 
recruitment 
drive 
in 
all 
business units of GICL.
