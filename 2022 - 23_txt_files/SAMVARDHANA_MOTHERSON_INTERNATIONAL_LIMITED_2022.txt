Samvardhana Motherson International Limited
IATF16949 accreditation, the organisation is duly certified 
with ISO14001:2015 accreditation across the business 
focusing on environmental aspects.
We are carefully monitoring all aspects of the 
environmental footprint of our operations and our 
products. From the choice of materials and product 
design to management of our supplier base, from energy 
use and waste handling to product delivery, there are great 
sustainability initiatives taking place across the group. The 
organisation is progressively increasing the share of solar 
power and wind power in its energy consumption and is 
graduating to energy-efficient lighting with the adoption 
of LED lights across its facilities.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Climate agreement 
provide the framework of a collective commitment 
to minimize the effects of global warming. The Paris 
Agreement acknowledges the urgent need to scale 
up global response to climate change. This requires 
international business across all industries to play their 
part in addressing the challenge. We at Motherson are 
committed in contributing to passing on to our next 
generation a clean environment and making every effort 
in preserving earth’s future by adopting environment 
friendly technologies, business practices and innovation 
which lead to a clean and green future. For Motherson 
and our stakeholders this is an issue of very high 
material importance where we have the ambition to 
make a positive contribution. In this respect, Motherson 
is actively working on following Principles to minimize 
the environmental impact of its current operations and 
supply chain, focusing on the following areas:
(a) 
Minimise and wherever possible eliminate the 
emission of greenhouse gases.
(b) Improve energy efficiency in all areas and maximise 
access to sources of renewable energy.
(c) 
Improve water utilisation efficiency and harvesting.
(d) Minimise and wherever possible eliminate waste 
focusing on the increased application of recycling 
solutions.
(e) 
Focus on climate positive actions and maximising 
economic circularity.
(f) 
Adapt and maintain compliance to evolving regional 
and country specific environmental goals.
Further, to emphasize the fundamental principles shaping 
the responsibility of Motherson with regard to Climate 
Change, the Board of Directors of the Company on 
August 26, 2021 inter-alia, adopted a Climate Change 
Policy which is available on the website of the Company 
at https://www.motherson.com/storage/Group-Policies/
Climate-Change-Policy.pdf

Motherson has implemented a range of mechanisms to receive and address grievances across the organization. 
Employees have multiple pathways to submit suggestions, including online portals, physical suggestion boxes, 
and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that encourage employee feedback. In cases of employee disciplinary 
matters, there are appeal processes outlined in policies, procedures, collective agreements, industry awards, and 
union processes.
Motherson has established various working groups, such as employee consultative committees, union-
management committees, health and safety committees, canteen committees, and welfare committees, to 
address employee matters. 
To facilitate confidential submissions, mechanisms for anonymous or private submissions include designated 
email addresses and/or telephone numbers. Trade unions play a visible role in resolving grievances where they 
are present. Motherson follows an open-door policy, granting all employees access to senior management, 
regardless of their role or position within the organization.
Additionally, Motherson has a formal Whistle-Blower Policy, providing a confidential platform for reporting 
grievances, which are subsequently investigated. The company also has a comprehensive policy on the 
prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment in the workplace. Many of Motherson’s Indian units 
have Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace 
(Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. The ICC members are responsible for conducting inquiries 
related to such complaints.

Yes. The majority of Motherson’s operations have implemented a health and safety management system 
that is certified to ISO45001/ISO18001 standards. In cases where these specific certifications have not been 
obtained, alternative health and safety management systems are in place that align with the ISO standards. 
In addition to the ISO standards, Motherson adheres to the high standards set by FM Global, a leading global

By adhering to these internationally recognized standards and practices, Motherson prioritizes the health, 
safety, and well-being of its employees and aims to create a secure working environment across all its 
operations.
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
At Motherson, we take a proactive approach to hazard and risk identification and assessment. We employ a 
variety of methods to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of potential hazards and associated risks.
1. 
Conducting safety inspection walks, where designated personnel inspect the workplace to identify any 
existing or potential hazards. We also conduct scheduled risk assessments to systematically assess 
risks across various activities and processes. Regular inspections are carried out to monitor ongoing 
compliance with safety protocols and identify any emerging hazards.
2. 
To maintain a high standard of safety, we conduct monthly and quarterly audits, which involve a 
thorough review of hazard identification and risk assessment inputs. This enables us to continuously 
improve our safety practices and ensure that any identified risks are addressed promptly.
3. 
From an equipment and plant perspective, we prioritize regular and scheduled preventative maintenance. 
This helps mitigate potential risks associated with equipment malfunctions or failures.
4. 
We perform pre-work/start-up/production risk assessments to evaluate potential hazards before 
commencing any tasks. 
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, we have established a system for all workers to submit hazard reports for prompt resolution. This 
system ensures that individuals can report any potential hazards they come across in the workplace. By

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
The established health and safety management systems serve as a framework for ensuring a healthy and safe 
workplace. This approach involves active participation from shop floor workers up to members of management, 
emphasizing the importance of a collective effort in maintaining safety.
Various programs are implemented to address hazard identification and risk assessment. These programs are 
carried out on an ad hoc basis, as well as through scheduled and pre-activity assessments. The objective is to 
systematically identify potential hazards and assess associated risks in order to implement appropriate control 
measures.
Health and safety committees play a crucial role, with representation from workers, employees, and management. 
These committees facilitate discussions on hazard and risk control, health and well-being initiatives, emergency 
response planning, and compliance with local regulations. The committees work in conjunction with the overall 
management systems to ensure a comprehensive approach to health and safety.

Several improvements related to safety have been implemented at Motherson. These include the installation of 
safety devices and systems in equipment, such as automatic and semi-automatic presses, to prevent access to 
areas at risk of equipment movement. These safety measures, such as interlocks, presence curtains, security guards, 
and equipment programming, help ensure the safety of employees by cutting off power in hazardous situations. 
Authorization processes have been developed for high-risk activities, such as hot work, work at height, and work 
in electrical installations. 
Other initiatives include compliance with applicable legal requirements, providing safety, health, and environmental 
induction courses to workers, delivering appropriate personal protective equipment for each activity, conducting 
safety audits in the process, and having medical and nursing staff available in the plant to provide immediate 
assistance if needed.
Monthly safety committee meetings are held to address and discuss any safety incidents that occurred during the 
month, as well as the actions implemented to prevent future incidents. Safety-related key performance indicators 
(KPIs) are available and discussed during monthly performance review meetings, enabling the monitoring and 
improvement of safety performance.
Each unit has identified incident investigation teams responsible for investigating any incidents and identifying 
remedial actions to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
Motherson has a Prevention of Harassment Policy ttps://www.motherson.com/storage/Group-Policies/
Prevention-of-Harassment-Policy.pdf. that strictly prohibits retaliation or victimization of individuals who seek 
redressal against all acts of harassment. The policy ensures that if a complaint is found to be true by the Reporting 
Authority, appropriate remedial action will be taken as prescribed in paragraph 7 of the policy.
The identity of the Reporting Person is kept confidential, and retaliation is strictly prohibited in accordance with 
the Code of Conduct for Employees and Whistleblower Policies. Motherson maintains a ‘zero tolerance’ approach 
towards any form of harassment in the workplace, and every individual is responsible for ensuring their actions 
and behaviors are free from harassment.
The Motherson Prevention of Harassment Policy serves as the foundation for preventing harassment within the 
organization. Each entity within Motherson is required to establish a complaints committee that is responsible for 
receiving, investigating, and submitting findings for each case, while maintaining strict confidentiality to the fullest 
extent possible. Any form of retaliation or victimization against the aggrieved person is strictly prohibited.
In addition to the group policy and procedure, Motherson also complies with local regulatory requirements 
concerning retaliation and victimization, further reinforcing its commitment to preventing harassment and 
fostering a safe and respectful work environment.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Waste is generated both from production processes, and inbound packaging, as well as general operational 
activity including maintenance.
annual report 2022-2023
193
At every site, production waste is monitored and reported on a monthly basis with the objective to minimise and 
reduce whereever possible. Any production waste produced is kept clearly segregated from general waste and 
is recycled wherever possible. The level of recycling infrastructure varies in different countries around the world.
General waste is always segregated between hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and is always disposed off 
in accordance with local legislation. What materials may be recycled using locally available facilities is appropriately 
done so.
For our business, the concept of hazardous really only applies to using some oil or solvent based products - 
whether related to production (painted parts), or maintenance (oils and degreasers). Some chemicals will be used 
in our water treatment facilities.
