FOREWORD 
Over the past few years, sustainability reporting is gaining importance globally as an 
important communication tool for corporates to display their commitment of being a 
sustainable and responsible business. The Indian reporting scenario is also rapidly 
evolving in line with the global trends wherein corporates are expected to maintain 
transparency and accountability in reporting. 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), regulator of capital markets in 
India, has put in place the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting 
(BRSR) framework which requires listed companies to disclose information under 
the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct. The 
BRSR disclosure is voluntary for FY-2022 and shall become mandatory from FY-2023 
onwards for the top 1,000 Indian listed companies by market capitalisation. 
Staying strong on our commitment of being a responsible business adopting BRSR 
framework from FY-2023 was a conscious choice to maintain transparency in 
sustainability reporting. The BRSR disclosures presented herein are strictly as per the 
format prescribed by SEBI.

stakeholders and members of communities, on social topics has been a key factor for

2. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the 
concerns of vulnerable/ marginalised stakeholder groups.

initiatives to build a model senior citizens’ old age home on the concept of ‘Active
