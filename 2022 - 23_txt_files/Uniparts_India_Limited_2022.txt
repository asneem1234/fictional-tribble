Risk
In case we are unable to identify 
and mitigate risks related to 
environmental impacts, labour 
practices, or governance, the 
same can lead to legal liabilities, 
reputational 
damage, 
and 
financial losses. Additionally, 
inadequate risk management 
can negatively impact employee 
safety and well-being and harm 
the surrounding communities. 
Therefore, failure to prioritize 
risk management can pose 
significant ESG risks for the 
company and its stakeholders.
We review risk management

We 
are 
also

Moreover, 
cyber-attacks can compromise 
customer data and confidential 
information, 
negatively 
impacting 
the 
company’s 
reputation 
and 
stakeholder 
trust. The potential for data 
breaches 
and 
cyber-attacks 
is increasing, and failure to 
prioritize data security, privacy, 
and cybersecurity can result 
in significant ESG risks for the 
company and its stakeholders. .
We

9.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Uniparts has implemented waste management practices to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals by 
following these measures:
	
Storage:
•	
ETP sludge/paint sludge is filled in leak-proof HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) bags that are labelled and 
stored in an impervious leachate-proof room.
•	
Used oil and waste are stored in barrels that are clearly labelled and kept under cover.
	
Treatment:
•	
ETP sludge and paint sludge are routed through an authorized treatment storage disposal facility. Specifically, 
ETP sludge is securely landfilled at the TSFD site in adherence to all applicable regulations and standards.
•	
Waste oil, used oil and waste batteries are periodically sold to CPCB-approved waste recyclers. This approach 
ensures that these materials are effectively managed and recycled in a safe, responsible, and sustainable 
manner.
