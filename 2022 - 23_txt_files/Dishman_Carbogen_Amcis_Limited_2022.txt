Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
Dear stakeholders, 
I am pleased to present our first Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report FY 2022-23 which has become 
mandatory for the top 1000 listed companies in India as per 
SEBI’s directive.
We firmly believe that sustainability and profitability go 
together and in fact sustainability positively influences 
growth. Sustainability continues to be an essential part of 
our culture of innovation, and long-term commitment to 
our employees and communities.
We are committed to environmental protection across 
all operations, aiming for continuous improvement to 
make our operations sustainable and resilient. We ensure 
our operations meet all regulatory requirements, and 
emphasise on reducing both direct (emissions) and indirect 
(eco-balance) 
environmental 
impact 
through 
‘Green 
Chemistry’ process optimisation.
Our commitment to responsible waste management 
is exemplified through our strict adherence to a zero-
discharge approach for wastewater. In a strategic move, 
we are investing `47 crores to upgrade to a modern and 
fully automated effluent treatment plant and multiple 
effect evaporator (MEE). We further ensure the safe 
disposal of all types of solid and liquid waste, ensuring 
zero harm to the environment and compliance with all 
norms and regulations. We have transitioned various 
hazardous processes and chemicals to non-hazardous 
alternatives through comprehensive analysis. Further, we 
have undertaken significant tree plantation to increase the 
green cover at sites.
