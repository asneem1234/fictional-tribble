1.
Employees  
Health & Safety
 Risk
Health and safety impact 
company’s practice as a 
responsible organization. 
Effective H&S performance also 
assists in attracting and retaining 
quality talent.This can also lead 
to decreased Productivity.
We have effective health 
and safety practices 
deployed. Several efforts 
and initiatives have been 
put in place to ensure 
employee health and safety.
Negative – Any cost put 
towards employee health 
and safety will yield 
positive results in the long 
term.
2.
Labour  
Practices
Risk
Changing regulations around 
labour practices pose as a 
challenge.
We have put in substantial 
effort to ensure that 
we comply with all 
requirements of labour law 
and do beyond it as well.
Negative –Workplace 
incidents related to 
employee’s health 
and safety can result 
in litigation and plant 
shutdown, impact 
reputation and attract 
fines from the regulator.
3.
Product Quality 
& safety 
Opportunity
In the jewellery industry, a 
company’s reputation hinges 
on the quality and safety of 
its products. To uphold their 
reputation, Our Company takes 
measures to ensure that their 
products meet high standards of 
quality and safety. This, in turn, 
fosters customer loyalty and 
helps to build a  positive image. 
-

product quality and 
safety, Our Company can 
generate higher sales and 
revenue, decrease costs, 
and unlock opportunities 
for market expansion.

Access and 
Affordability 
Risk
In the jewellery industry, it is 
crucial for companies to find a 
delicate equilibrium between 
providing affordable options and 
upholding the perceived value 
of their products and services. 
Additionally, they must consider 
the enduring consequences of 
their pricing strategy and refrain 
from engaging in a race to the 
bottom. 
Our Company has 
implemented measures 
to minimize potential 
risks by expanding their 
reach through the online 
platforms, capitalizing 
on economies of scale, 
and adopting a strategic 
approach to material 
procurement to curtail costs 
and provide affordable 
options for their customers. 
Negative – There is a 
potential risk of impacting 
sales as the balance 
between affordability 
and maintaining profit 
margins.

Opportunity

our Company shall build trust, 
attract new customers, enhance 
its brand image, and increase 
its credibility with customers and 
stakeholders. Ethical practices 
shall have a positive impact on 
employee engagement.
-
Positive - Increased

translates into higher 
sales, improved 
customer retention, and 
ultimately, better financial  
performance.
