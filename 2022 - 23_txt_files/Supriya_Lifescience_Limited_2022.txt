Statement by director responsible for the

ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
I am delighted to present Supriya Lifescience Ltd’s first Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report. As a business driven by our 
mission of ‘Caring for Life’, empathy and a commitment to business 
responsibility is integral to our corporate ethos. Known for quality 
and operational excellence, our business has a global footprint 
that extends beyond 80+ countries. We encourage and stimulate 
innovative thinking, and are constantly looking to enhance the value 
that we create for our stakeholders. As a pharmaceutical company, 
we have a profound responsibility to society, our employees, our 
partners, and the environment. Being cognizant of this, we are now in 
the process of inculcating ESG into our business practices.
While we are just starting out, we have already made some initial 
achievements. We are currently using biofuel in our operations, thus 
reducing our GHG footprint. We have a robust health and safety 
system, and have trained 100% of workers and 85% of employees with 
respect to proper health and safety protocols, in order to minimize 
incidents. Through our innovative approach, we are always looking 
at ways to improve access and affordability of our products. Our 
transparency, integrity and strong corporate governance practices 
make up the underlying foundation behind our ESG journey.
We are committed to sustainable value creation for all our stakeholders, 
and are looking forward towards creating a more responsible and 
sustainable future.
Regards,
