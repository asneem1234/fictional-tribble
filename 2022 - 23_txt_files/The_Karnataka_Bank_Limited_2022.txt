The Chairman’s 
Message
Dear Valued Stakeholders,
I am both delighted and honoured to welcome you to the 
integrated annual report for FY2023. This document  
encapsulates our journey, milestones, and steadfast dedication 
to you and the broader community we serve.
and knowledge. We view technology 
as an art form, one where the 
challenge lies in managing potential 
risks. Your Bank is committed 
to ensuring our services run 
seamlessly, safeguarding against 
unforeseen disruptions. The recent 
global challenges, especially those 
posed by the pandemic, have 
not been easy on the banking 
sector. Through the ever-changing 
dynamics of this era, Karnataka 
Bank stands unyielding, ever 
ready to evolve and adapt. We are 
harnessing the power of data-
driven strategies to ensure that 
the quality of our assets remains 
impeccable. We’ve also charted 
a clear course forward: blending 
the advancements of technology 
with the time-tested values of 
our tradition, meeting regulatory 
mandates with spirited innovation, 
and anchoring our journey in the 
tenets of sustainability.
Celebrating a Legacy: A 
Century of Trust. A Future of 
Growth.
Now in our 99th year, marking our 
centenary is more than a milestone; 
it’s a testament to our timeless 
journey, encapsulated in our tagline, 
“A Century of Trust. A Future of 
Growth.” These words resonate 
deeply within us, for they tell the 
tale of an institution built on the 
pillars of unwavering profitability 
and exemplary governance. Our 
outlook, while deeply rooted 
in the invaluable lessons of the 
past, stretches forward with 
unbridled optimism. We regard 
this momentous occasion not as a 
culmination of our achievements 
but as a rejuvenating sunrise—a 
fresh chapter brimming with 
opportunities. As we stride 
ahead, we do so with the youthful 
exuberance of a nascent start-up, 
fortified by a hundred years of 
wisdom, experience, and trust.
A Fresh Dawn with Seasoned 
Leaders
Every organization benefits 
from consistent and dedicated 
leadership. Mr. Mahabaleshwara 
M.S., during his complete tenure
as our Managing Director and CEO,
provided just that. His guidance
played a pivotal role in our bank’s
journey, and steering the Bank to its
current position of strength. As he
transitions to new opportunities, we
extend our heartfelt appreciation
and wish him well in his future
endeavours.
The induction of Mr. Srikrishnan 
H. as our new MD & CEO, coupled
with the appointment of Mr.
Sekhar Rao as Executive Director,
illuminates a bright pathway
towards the future for Karnataka
Bank. Both leaders bring with them
a tapestry of rich experiences and
accomplishments, promising a new
chapter of innovation and growth.
Their leadership, amalgamated
with the prowess of our seasoned
in-house team, heralds the genesis
of an even more exceptional
banking experience for our
customers. As we set our sights
on the horizon, with the renewed
vigour of our leadership and the
unmatched dedication of our team,

growth trajectory for Karnataka
Bank. And through this ascent, we
intend to remain anchored in our
time-honoured principles of robust
governance and meticulous risk
management.

vision extends to a larger canvas.

urgent call to action. We’re deeply 
A Landscape in Flux: Banking

The Managing Director and CEO’s
Message
Dear Stakeholders,
As I draft this message, I am 
overcome with a profound sense 
of humility coupled with an 
exhilarating anticipation. It is with 
immense pride and honour that 
I address you today as the newly 
appointed Managing Director & 
CEO of Karnataka Bank. Stepping 
into this esteemed role, I am acutely 
aware of the responsibilities it 
entails, the legacy it carries, and the 
dreams it holds for the future.
We are poised at a significant 
juncture, standing on the brink of 
a monumental milestone — the 
commencement of our 100th 
year in operation. It’s not merely a 
testament to the passage of time 
but a celebration of a century-old 
legacy underpinned by unwavering 
Trust and unparalleled Excellence. 
The weight of this legacy is not lost 
on me; rather, it fuels the fire of 
ambition, pushing us to set the gold 
standard in banking for generations 
to come.
commitments are clear, albeit 
not set in stone. We envision 
an invigorated Karnataka Bank, 
navigating the intricacies of a digital 
era. We hope to reach beyond 
traditional boundaries, creating 
virtual bridges that expand our 
presence. Embracing state-of-the-art 
technology and digital solutions will 
undoubtedly be our ally. Moreover, 
innovation and collaboration will 
serve as our guiding lights, ensuring 
that we consistently add value 
for our stakeholders. And while 
we ambitiously look ahead, we’re 
grounded in our values, emphasizing 
empowerment, delegation, 
ownership, and mindful action.
Strategizing Our Path 
Forward: Embracing Legacy, 
Crafting the Future
In the rapidly evolving banking 
landscape, our approach is 
both introspective and forward-
looking. We are fostering a shift 
that leans more into business 
and sales, challenging traditional 
paradigms and constantly setting 
new benchmarks. Our product 
development will now be more in 
tune with market dynamics, and 
digitization and automation have 
become central tenets of our  
modus operandi.
Operationally, the essence of our 
strategy is to enhance efficiencies. 
We’re streamlining, simplifying, and 
digitizing our processes, aiming to 
centralize significant portions of our 
operations. This not only fortifies 
our backend structures but also 
provides our customer-facing teams 
with more agility and resources. On 
the growth front, we are embracing 
an ambitious mindset. Our goal is to 
significantly expand our Advances 
and CASA portfolios, giving our 
customers a wider range of banking 
solutions. As we recognize the 
undeniable pull of the digital age, 
we are accelerating our digital client 
acquisition strategies. Furthermore, 
in a world where collaboration 
spells innovation, our eyes are set 
on forming meaningful partnerships 
with Fintechs.
Charting Our Course with 
the Three R’s
Our upcoming endeavours 
aim to bring forth wholesale 
transformation for Karnataka Bank. 
Digitalization, while soon becoming 
a cornerstone of our operations, 
will be enhanced by pivotal 
strategic partnerships, amplifying 
our potential in the market. The 
impending move towards a more 
customer-centric and business-
facing approach aspires to elevate 
our responsiveness, agility and 
alignment to our customers’ needs.
Our roadmap for the future is 
defined by our three pivotal pillars: 
Retail, Rural & MSME, and Risk 
Management. In the retail sector, 
our initiatives will be geared 
towards elevating advances and 
deposits, driven by cutting-edge 
digital analytics. It’s not just about 
transactional relationships but 
crafting unparalleled and lasting 
customer journeys.
Casting our sights on rural 
India’s vast expanse and the 
bustling universe of MSMEs, we 
are strategizing to deepen our 
roots. The plans to enhance our 
underwriting in rural territories, 
MSME domains, and agri-lending 
are crafted to resonate with value, 
serving both the bank and our 
extensive network of stakeholders.
Finally, addressing risk - a 
fundamental aspect of banking - 
our intent is to manage it with both 
caution and visionary thinking. The 
future will witness our decision-
making fortified by data-centric 
strategies, ensuring a well-calibrated

establish a dialogue, to hear from 
you, and to integrate your insights

Our Promise to Stakeholders
In the grand canvas of our vision

to our investors. Our endeavours 
will aim at enhancing the Return on 
Assets (ROA), and in propelling the 
Bank to more accelerated growth 
trajectories. What this paints for 
our investors is a future with fair

the long horizon. At the heart of our

The Executive Director’s
Message
Dear Esteemed Stakeholders,
I am delighted to inform you 
that FY23 has been a year of 
monumental achievements, 
especially in core KPIs such as Loan 
Advances, an enhanced Net Interest 
Margin (NIM), and a consistent CASA 
base. These milestones, bolstered by 
top-tier productivity metrics, serve as 
a testament to our forward-looking 
vision. This is further evidenced 
by our ROA’s impressive leap from 
0.56% in FY22 to 1.21% in FY23.
Our commitment to integrating 
digital innovations into our 
operations acts as a driving force 
behind our growth trajectory. 
Alongside this, our ‘Retailisation’ 
strategy with greater focus on Retail, 
Rural and MSMEs, is reshaping 
our portfolio. We are strategically 
zooming in on pivotal retail sectors, 
with a keen focus on Home Loans 
and Loans Against Gold, ensuring we 
bolster our risk profile and margins. 
FY2023 Performance
Financial Health and Profitability: 
Over the last fiscal year, our Bank 
demonstrated strong financial 
prowess. The net profit dramatically 
ascended from `508.62 crore to 
record breaking `1,180.24 crore, 
reflecting the Bank’s operational 
proficiency. Accompanying this 
growth, our operating profit 
amplified from `1,634.00 crore to 
`2,208.23 crore, reflecting a rise of 
35.15%, accentuating our Bank’s 
capability in optimising its core 
business processes. This robust 
enhancement in profitability was 
complemented by the net interest 
income, which escalated from 
`2,491.03 crore to `3,185.10 crore.
Assets and Liabilities Management: 
From a balance sheet perspective, 
our deposits grew by 8.68%, moving 
from `80,386.85 crore to `87,368.01 
crore, an indicator of growing 
customer trust and our effective 
deposit accumulation strategies. 
Parallelly, credit advances grew 
from `56,783.14 crore to `59,951.62 
crore, marking a 5.59% increase, 
demonstrating our capability to 
harness lending opportunities. 
Notably, while the Credit-Deposit 
Ratio saw a slight reduction from 
70.64% to 68.62%, this trend 
underscores our dedication to 
balanced financial stewardship.
Operational Efficiency: Our bank’s 
financial acumen is further 
accentuated by the Net Interest 
Margin (NIM), which progressed 
from 3.18% to 3.70%. This positive 
trajectory underscores our enhanced 
capability to profit from our lending 
activities. The CASA Ratio, which 
consistently stood at 32.97%, 
showcases our stable current and 
savings account base, essential for 
leveraging low-cost funds.
Asset Quality: A testament to our 
commitment towards preserving 
stellar asset quality is evident in 
the improvement in both Gross 
NPA (GNPA) and Net NPA (NNPA) 
percentages. The GNPA saw a 
reduction from 3.90% to 3.74%, and 
the NNPA observed an even more 
substantial decline from 2.42% to 
1.70%. This positive movement 
signifies our unwavering focus on 
credit risk management and robust 
lending and recovery mechanisms.
Shareholder Value and Returns: For 
our shareholders, the fiscal year 
brought encouraging returns. The 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) saw a 
significant jump, from an annualized 
value of `16.36 to `37.88, illustrating 
our improved profitability on a 
per-share basis. The Book Value 
per Share also saw a positive shift, 
moving from `228.01 to `262.96. 
Furthermore, our Return on Assets 
(ROA) more than doubled from 
0.56% to 1.21%, and the Return 
on Equity (ROE) exhibited a similar 
upward trend, leaping from 7.41%  
to 15.42%.
Dividend Announcement
It brings us great pleasure to share 
that our Board of Directors has 
recommended a dividend of Rs. 5.00 
per equity share, each with a face 
value of Rs. 10, for the financial year 
2022-23. This recommendation is 
subject to the endorsement of our 
shareholders at the forthcoming 
99th Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
We remain deeply committed to 
ensuring value returns for our 
shareholders and thank you for your 
unwavering trust in our institution.
Retailisation Takes Root
As part of our strategic pivot 
towards Retail, Rural & MSME, 
we have initiated a broad 
“Retailisation” strategy, focused on 
systematically expanding our Retail 
assets portfolio. This shift aims to 
recalibrate the composition of our 
Gross Advances, with a discerning 
reduction in the proportion of Large 
Corporate Loans. With an intentional 
focus on pivotal sectors like Home 
Loans and Loans Against Gold, our 
objective is to cultivate a stronger 
risk profile and secure healthier 
margins, aligning seamlessly with 
our long-term growth aspirations.
Evidence of our retail-driven 
approach’s efficacy is palpable. By 
the close of Q4FY23, Retail Advances 
had burgeoned to 50.34%, up from 
48.08% in Q3FY23. In contrast, Large 
Corporate advances contracted to 
20.18% from 22.91% over the same 
timeframe. This progressive shift 
towards prioritizing retail lending 
underscores our commitment to 
refining our portfolio mix. The goal 
is clear: enhancing our Return On 
Assets (ROA) and Return On Equity 
(ROE) and consistently delivering 
enduring value to our stakeholders.
Awards and Recent 
Initiatives
It is with immense pride that we 
share some significant recognitions 
and advancements that our Bank 
has recently achieved. The Chamber 
of Indian Micro Small and Medium 
Enterprises (CIMSME) honoured us 
with three distinguished awards: we 
were named the ‘Winner’ for our CSR 
Initiatives & Business Responsibility 
efforts, and ‘Runner Up’ for both 
Best MSME Bank and MSME Friendly 
Bank categories. Additionally, 
the Union Ministry of Electronics 
and Information Technology 
recognized our digital prowess by 
bestowing upon Karnataka Bank 
the ‘Prathista Puraskar’ under the 
‘Digidhan Awards 2021-22’. This 
award celebrates our exemplary 
performance in achieving the 
highest percentage target for BHIM-
UPI transactions among private 
sector banks. As part of our ongoing 
digital transformation journey, ‘KBL 
VIKAAS 2.0’, we have embarked 
on an accelerated digital drive, 
aptly titled ‘KBL-NxT’. This initiative 
further underpins our commitment 
to embrace technological 
advancements, thereby ensuring 
a seamless and enhanced banking 
experience for all our customers.
Digital Innovations for 
Enhanced Customer 
Experience
As part of our unwavering 
commitment to constantly enhance 
the customer experience and 
provide them with intuitive solutions, 
we have integrated a series of new 
digital initiatives.
Firstly, we introduced the KBL 
WhatsApp Banking Service. Aimed at 
offering immediate and instructive 
communication, this new Alternate 
Delivery Channel provides a range 
of banking services right at the 
customer’s fingertips. Adding to 
our suite of digital offerings, we’re 
also pleased to announce the 
implementation of the UPI Mapper

Item No. 4: Appointment of Statutory Auditors (SAs).
At the 98th Annual General Meeting held on August 26, 2022, M/s Sundaram & Srinivasan, Chartered Accountants 
(Firm Registration No. 004207S) and M/s Kalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP, Chartered Accountants (Firm Registration 
No./LLP No. 104607W/W100166), were re-appointed as the Joint Statutory Auditors of the Bank who, at the 
conclusion of the ensuing Annual General Meeting will be completing the period of second year (i.e., in the term 
commencing from FY 2021-22).
The maximum tenure of SAs is three years and FY 2023-24 will be the third year in office for the existing two audit 
firms. Therefore, with a view to ensuring continuity  of auditors, the Board of Directors of the Bank at its meeting 
held on 17.06.2023, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, approved the appointment of M/s Ravi 
Rajan & Co LLP, Chartered Accountants (Firm Registration No./LLP No. 009073N/ N500320), New Delhi. RBI, upon 
our application, approved the proposed appointment vide letter dated 20.07.2023.
The Bank will have three joint statutory auditors for the current financial year 2023-2024. The two existing audit 
firms will complete their third year of appointment as joint statutory auditors this year, and their assignment will 
end with the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) for 2023-2024. The Bank has already appointed 
one of the new audit firms this year and will appoint another new joint statutory auditor for the FY 2024-2025 
financial year. With necessary approvals, these two firms will jointly conduct the statutory audit thereafter.
All the above audit firms have confirmed their eligibility to be appointed as Statutory Auditors as per Section 
141 of the Companies Act, 2013 and applicable rules. The Board of Directors recommends the appointment of 
M/s Sundaram & Srinivasan, Chartered Accountants, M/s Kalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP, Chartered Accountants and 
M/s Ravi Rajan & Co LLP, Chartered Accountants jointly as Statutory Auditors of the Bank to hold office upto the 
conclusion of 100th AGM.

Upward revision in the fees payable to the Statutory Auditors (SAs):
As said above, it is proposed to appoint M/s Ravi Rajan & Co LLP, Chartered Accountants, New Delhi as the 
Statutory Auditor jointly with the existing two audit firms for the current year 2023–24. Accordingly, there will be 
three joint statutory auditors for FY 2023-24.
Presently, the consolidated statutory audit fees paid to each firm is `1.40 crore and it is proposed to fix the fees 
payable to M/s. Ravi Rajan & Co LLP at the same rate i.e., `1.40 crore/year. While there is no increase in the fees 
paid to each of the firms, however, on account of the on-boarding of one more auditor during the current FY, the 
overall audit fee will be ` 4.20 crore as against the fees of `2.80 crores paid during the previous year.
The Board of Directors is of the view that the increase in overall fees for the FY is justified considering the benefit 
the Bank would derive out of continuity and smooth transition of the audit process, besides inputs expected to 
be brought in by the new audit firm.
The Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, has approved the fees payable 
to the statutory auditors as mentioned hereunder:

rationale for such change.
There is no outgoing auditor during the current FY. However, as 
detailed above, the fees payable to the additional joint statutory audit 
firm is fixed at the same rates as being agreed upon and paid to the

components and variable pay is up to 125% of fixed pay, which

Managing Director & CEO by the NRC/Board after prior permission 
of RBI. Further, Variable pay has deferral arrangements for up to 3

Bank’s Compensation Policy. The Compensation Structure is as per 
the extant RBI guidelines on compensation to whole-time Directors.

vis-à-vis proposed remuneration is not made. However, the proposed 
remuneration is approved by RBI and is well within the limits of the 
Companies Act, 2013.

Variable Pay for every performance period is granted after evaluation 
of performance by the NRC/Board and will be paid only after obtaining 
the approval of RBI each year.

the Board of Directors of a Company shall exercise the powers to borrow only with the consent of the Company 
by a special resolution, where the money to be borrowed, together with the money already borrowed by the 
Company exceeds the aggregate of its paid-up share capital, free reserves and securities premium, apart from 
temporary loans obtained in the ordinary course of business.
The consent of the members of the Bank has already been obtained at the 97th Annual General Meeting held

thousand Crore only), in the form of debt instruments/ debentures etc., in one or more tranches in domestic and/

invitation for subscription of non-convertible debentures, it shall be sufficient if a special resolution is passed by 
the shareholders only once a year for all the offers or invitations for subscription of such debentures during the

exceeding `1500 crore, to be reckoned with in the already approved borrowing limit of `6000 crore.

reserves and the securities premium at any time, apart from (i) acceptance of the deposits of money from public 
repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise and/or (ii) temporary loans 
obtained in the ordinary course of business of the Bank and would form part of the overall borrowing limits 
under Section 180(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013.
Accordingly, the consent of Members is being sought by way of special resolution as set out in Item No. 8 of this 
Notice.

except to the extent of subscription by a financial institution/company/body corporate in which the KMPs,

RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
In the normal course of business, banks are exposed to various risks, namely, Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational 
Risk, besides other residual risks such as Liquidity Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Concentration Risk, Strategic Risk, Reputation 
Risk etc. With a view to efficiently managing such risks, your Bank has put in place various risk management systems 
and practices. In line with the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time, your Bank continues to 
strengthen various risk management systems that include policies, tools, techniques, systems and other monitoring 
mechanisms.
Your Bank aims at achieving an appropriate trade-off between risks and returns. Your Bank’s risk management 
objectives broadly cover proper identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, controlling, mitigation and 
reporting of the risks across various business segments of the Bank. The risk management strategy adopted by your 
Bank is based on a clear understanding of the risks and the level of risk appetite, which is dependent on the willingness 
of your Bank to take risks in the normal course of business. A Board level committee, viz., Risk & Capital Management 
Committee (RCMC), periodically reviews the risk profile, evaluates the overall risks encountered by the Bank and 
develops policies and strategies for its effective management. Bank has an exclusive risk management department 
and a Chief Risk Officer for the overall supervision of all the risk related issues.
Various senior management committees, such as Credit Risk Committee (CRC), Asset–Liability Management Committee 
(ALCO), Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) etc., operate within the broad policy framework of the 
Bank to ensure and enhance the risk control and governance framework within the Bank. The Risk Management 
Department at Head Office oversees the overall implementation of various risk management initiatives across the 
Bank. Your Bank’s Risk Management Department (RMD) has been accredited with the prestigious ISO 9001:2015 
international certification for Quality Management System (QMS). Under ISO Accreditation, Quality Policy has been 
defined, existing procedures and Standard Operating Procedures were reviewed, and a formal Quality Management 
system (QMS) was established to ensure that the Risk Management processes and practices of the Bank are in line 
with the global standards.
In line with the guidelines issued by RBI, your Bank has nominated a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who is 
responsible for articulating and enforcing the policies that the Bank uses to protect the information assets apart from 
coordinating security-related issues in the implementation of new systems in the Bank.
A more elaborate discussion on how the Bank manages the key risks associated with its operations is provided under 
Management Discussion and Analysis attached to this report.
Basel III Capital Regulations – Implementation of Leverage Ratio:
To mitigate the risk of excessive leverage and enhance financial stability, RBI mandated the minimum Leverage Ratio 
(LR) under Basel III Regulations for banks in India. Both the capital measure and the exposure measure, along with 
the leverage ratio are to be disclosed on a quarter-end basis. However, banks must meet the minimum leverage ratio 
requirements at all times. As on March 31, 2023, your Bank had a comfortable leverage ratio of 6.91% as against the 
regulatory minimum requirement of 3.50%.
Capital Adequacy & Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP):
In compliance with Basel guidelines, Bank has put in place a policy document for Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) to evaluate its capital adequacy requirements. A stress testing framework for various stress scenarios 
is also put in place for a better understanding of the likely impact of adverse market movements/events on capital 
and earnings. The results of the ICAAP and Stress testing are reviewed periodically to assess the capital requirement 
for the projected business growth, keeping in view the risk appetite and risk profile of the Bank. A Board level Risk & 
Capital Management Committee (RCMC) reviews the risk appetite, risk profile, business projections as well as capital 
assessments of your Bank at periodic intervals.
The Disclosure under Pillar III of the Basel III accord has been annexed to the Directors’ Report as in Annexure-I.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Global Economic Outlook:
Weighing the Impact of Geopolitical Uncertainty and Inflation
The FY2023 narrative in the global economic arena was one of paradoxes. It was marked by a gradual attenuation of 
the virulent infections, considerable easing of supply chains, but also persistent geopolitical tensions and stubborn 
inflation. Central banks worldwide acted in unison, devising monetary strategies to counteract these challenges.
The geopolitical conflicts stirring in Europe and escalation in the Taiwan/Korean Peninsula created substantial 
volatility in global energy and commodity prices. In response, central banks globally chose to counter unyielding 
inflation by raising their key policy rates. Benchmark yields and equities fluctuated, painting a picture of a complex 
and intertwined global economy.
Amidst a year of paradoxes, the world grappled with persistent geopolitical  
tensions, stubborn inflation, and volatile commodity prices. Yet, glimmers of 
resilience emerged, with IMF’s projections hinting at the easing of inflation  
and central banks globally adjusting to new economic realities.
However, even as economic heat maps flickered with instability, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) projections 
hinted towards a change in the weather. Indicators of inflation cooling and a slowdown in job openings emerged, 
but these have yet to translate into a concrete change in the central banks’ rate regime. The global growth rate was 
expected to fall from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023, and settle at around 3.0% in 2024. On the other hand, the global 
headline inflation was set to decrease from 8.7% in 2022 to 7.0% in 2023, with a full return to target inflation unlikely 
before 2025.
While fiscal and monetary policies remained largely accommodative, inflation ruling above targets forced several 
central banks of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) followed by Advanced Economy (AE) to tighten monetary policy. In 
the financial markets, risk-off sentiment drove equity markets into a correction. The bearish government bond market 
experienced a hardening of real yields across AEs. Going forward, the global economic growth outlook depends on 
global headwinds from the geo-political tensions, resurgence of new variants of COVID-19, volatility in global financial 
markets and inflation trajectory.
Indian Economic Overview:
Driving Growth Amidst Global Economic Uncertainty
As the world grappled with economic uncertainties, India emerged as a beacon of resilience. With strong GDP growth 
and robust export figures, the nation proved itself as a steadfast growth engine amidst global fluctuations.
India’s domestic economic activity displayed resilience in the second half of FY2023. Real GDP growth for the year 
stood at 7.2%, driven by strong investment and private consumption trends. The agriculture and services sectors 
played instrumental roles in maintaining this growth trajectory, even though the manufacturing sector was reined in 
by high input costs.
The Gross Value Added (GVA) in agriculture and allied activities registered a 3.5% growth in FY2023. Despite rainfall 
irregularities impacting kharif production, food grains production reached a record high in FY2023. The services sector 
also held its own, posting a robust growth of 9.5%, powered by contact-intensive services like trade, hotels, transport, 
and communication, which grew by 14.0%.
Amid global economic uncertainties, India demonstrated the vitality of its  
growth engine, offering an optimistic outlook for global economic recovery. 
The resilience and growth of the Indian economy serve as an encouraging  
signpost for future economic prosperity.
India’s external sector reflected a vibrant performance with merchandise exports rising by about 6% to a record 
US$447 billion. Despite this, inflationary pressures were hard to shake off completely, with the average CPI inflation 
standing at 6.7% compared to 5.5% in FY2022.

Heightened uncertainty surrounds the inflation trajectory, which is heavily contingent upon the evolving geopolitical 
situation. Global commodity price dynamics are driving the path of food inflation in India, including prices of inflation-
sensitive items that are impacted by global shortages due to output losses and export restrictions by key producing 
countries. International crude oil prices remain high but volatile, posing considerable upside risks to the inflation 
trajectory through both direct and indirect effects. Core inflation is likely to remain elevated in the coming months, 
reflecting high domestic prices and pressures from the prices of essential medicines. Renewed lockdowns and supply 
chain disruptions due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections in major economies could sustain higher logistics 
costs for longer.

Indian Banking Sector Developments:
Adapting and Growing Amidst a Pandemic
The banking sector in India, much like the rest of the world, had to face numerous challenges in the past year due to 
the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as highlighted in the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Annual Report 2022-23, it also saw 
a host of encouraging developments.
Liquidity remained stable, providing a necessary safety net against pandemic-induced disruptions. Public and private 
sector banks bolstered their financial health through profit retention and capital market funding. Impressively, the 
gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio for all scheduled commercial banks dipped to a six-year low.
The RBI’s Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2020-21, dated December 28, 2021, disclosed promising 
early signs of recovery in credit growth for the 2021-22 period (up to Dec 2021). Deposit growth, although slower at 
10.1% at end-September 2021 compared to 11.0% the previous year, remains robust.
Several transformative developments in the banking sector emerged during this period:
•
	The launch of the Financial Inclusion Index and Digital Payments Index, aimed to enhance the quality of banking
services and deepen digital payment penetration.
•
	The UPI123Pay implementation, opening the doors of formal banking to forty crore feature phone users,
transitioning from a cash economy.
•
	Amendments to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) Act 1961, requiring DICGC to
pay insured amounts to depositors within ninety days of RBI’s withdrawal restrictions imposition on troubled
banks.
•
	The establishment of the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd. (NARCL) aims to accelerate the resolution
of high-value stressed assets.
Opportunities and Outlook:
The Union Budget 2022-23 further amplified the sector’s momentum by focusing on hard infrastructure like roads, 
railways, and housing, which would generate employment, spur development, and boost the banking sector’s growth. 
Various budget proposals, such as connecting 1.5 lakh post offices to the Core Banking System, setting up 75 Digital 
Banking Units (DBUs) in 75 districts, and additional allocations under ECLGS for the Hospitality Sector, among others, 
are set to catalyze economic recovery and facilitate healthier credit flow to major sectors.
Our banking segments:
Pursuant to the Guidelines issued by RBI on Accounting Standard 17 (Segment Reporting), the Bank has identified four 
business segments viz., Retail Banking, (including DBUs) Corporate /Wholesale Banking, Treasury and Other Banking 
Operations for the year ended March 31, 2023. Details about aforesaid business segments are discussed hereafter:
Retail Banking: Comprehensive Retail Banking Services: Tailoring Financial Solutions
Your Bank offers an extensive range of personal banking products within the retail segment encompassing home 
loans, automobile loans, personal loans, education loans, loans against term deposits and securities, gold loans, small 
business banking loans, and agriculture loans.

Retail Banking includes credit of up to `7.50 Crore to industry, service, agriculture, forex, and other business activities. 
To manage this portfolio, the Division comprises four specialized wings: Agriculture, Forex, SMEs, and Others. An 
exclusive Agriculture Credit Support Group within the Retail Finance Division deals solely with agriculture credit, 
emphasizing our commitment to this crucial sector.
In addition to  this, we lend extensive support to the MSME sector through our retail banking arm. Our range of 
banking products includes Working Capital Finance, Term Loans, and Business Finance Products, both fund-based and 
non-fund based, tailored to fit needs of every industry/sector. We are a registered financier on the TreDS platform, 
providing an additional financing avenue to MSMEs.
Your Bank has marked its presence in more than 200 out of 388 clusters identified by the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization (UNIDO) as having significant MSME concentration and caters to the credit needs of these 
MSME units through our dedicated branch teams spread across these clusters.
Efficient Credit Management:
In an effort to streamline and standardize our credit underwriting practices, we established three Centralised Loan 
Processing Hubs (CLPHs) in Mangaluru, Bengaluru, and Ahmedabad. Alongside this, a Centralised Loan Sanctioning 
Centre (CLSC) was set up at Mangaluru.  To further speed up the loan sanctioning process, Bank upgraded the existing 
three CLPHs as Regional Loan Sanctioning Centres (RLPCs) and introduced two new RLPCs. This set up manages 
credit proposals of up to ` 5 Crore, considering product or facility specifics under Retail, MSME, Agri, and Forex credit 
facilities.
During the reporting year, our Retail Segment delivered strong performance. It generated revenue of `3755.78 crores 
(Previous year: `2910.17 crore), contributing ` 1634.08 crores (Previous year: `920.35 crore) to the profit before tax 
and un-allocable expenditure, further attesting to our robust retail banking strategy.
Corporate and Wholesale Banking:
Nurturing Large-Scale Business Growth

clients, with a focus on serving entities with an individual exposure exceeding `7.50 crore. This includes catering to 
the banking necessities of large-sized corporations across diverse industries.

such as term loans, working capital facilities, foreign exchange services, structured finance, trade financing, and bill 
discounting. Additionally, we provide non-fund-based products including letters of credit and guarantees, broadening 
our offering to fully cater to the diverse needs of our corporate clients.
In the fiscal year under report, the Corporate and Wholesale Banking Segment demonstrated satisfactory financial 
performance. It generated revenue amounting to `2691.29 crores (Previous year: `2506.24 crores). Furthermore, it 
significantly contributed to the Bank’s profit, yielding `462.62 crores (Previous year: `526.63 crore) before tax and 
un-allocable expenditure. This strong performance underscores the value of our tailored financial solutions for the 
corporate and wholesale banking clientele.
Treasury Operations: Streamlining Financial Management
The Bank’s treasury operations primarily manage statutory reserves, such as Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) and Cash 
Reserve Ratio (CRR), while ensuring effective liquidity management. Alongside these core functions, our treasury 
operations are responsible for investment and trading activities and the execution of foreign exchange operations.
In the pursuit of optimizing liquidity, the Treasury invests primarily in sovereign debt instruments and other fixed-
income securities. Moreover, the Bank utilizes instruments such as commercial papers, mutual funds, certificates 
of deposits, and floating-rate instruments to manage short-term surplus liquidity. In terms of foreign exchange, our 
operations are centralized in Mumbai and extend the scope of our Integrated Treasury. We provide our clients with a 
broad array of products and services, including forward contracts and diverse foreign exchange solutions.
During FY 22-23, our Treasury operations earned a total revenue of `1276.83 crores (Previous year: `1315.30 crores) 
from these operations, contributing `182.23 crores (Previous year: `256.12 crores) to profit before tax and un-allocable 
expenditure.

Risk and Mitigation
A Gist of how the Bank manages the key risks associated with its operations is provided hereunder:
Type of Risk
Mitigation Process
Strategy
CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the possibility 
of 
a 
bank’s 
borrower 
or 
counterparty failing to meet 
their obligations in accordance 
with agreed terms.
Your Bank has developed an online 
comprehensive 
credit 
risk 
rating 
system for quantifying and aggregating 
the credit risk of all borrower accounts 
across various exposures. Bank has 
introduced Specialized lending rating 
models, Retail Scorecard model (Pool 
based approach) and Facility Rating 
Model. Further, score card models 
under Business Rule Engine (BRE) 
approach have also been introduced for 
the digital underwriting process. Credit 
Audits, Legal Audits and Stock Audits of 
large credit exposures are conducted to 
limit the magnitude of credit risk.
Ensuring healthy asset quality by 
continuous monitoring and collection 
follow-ups through Credit Monitoring 
Department (CrMD).
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk to 
earnings and capital resulting 
from movements in market 
prices, particularly changes in 
interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates and equity and commodity 
prices, including the volatilities 
resulting from those changes.
Bank has put in place Board approved 
Policy on Integrated Treasury, Policy 
on Asset Liability Management (ALM), 
Policy on Market Risk Management 
and Policy on Fund Transfer Pricing for 
effective management of Market Risk 
in the Bank. Besides, there are inbuilt 
thresholds for close monitoring of the 
market movement.
Optimizing 
returns 
from 
various 
assets and market-linked instruments, 
treasury operations etc.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk arises when a bank 
fails to meet its contractual 
obligation in its daily operations 
due to inadequate funds flow
Proactive 
analysis 
of 
different 
circumstances viz. Funding risks, Time 
risks, and call risks which would cause 
liquidity risk to the banks. Liquidity 
risks is assessed using gap analysis for 
maturity mismatch based on residual 
maturity in different time buckets. 
Advanced techniques such as Stress 
testing, simulation, sensitivity analysis 
etc. are conducted at regular intervals 
to monitor the liquidity and to draw the 
action plan if required.
Advanced assessment of the need for 
funds and coordinating with various 
sources of funds available to the Bank 
under normal and stressed conditions.
INTEREST RATE RISK
This is a Risk that arises when 
the financial value of assets or 
liabilities (or inflows/outflows) is 
altered because of fluctuations 
in interest rates.
An analysis is conducted by applying 
various 
shocks 
on 
product-wise 
weighted average interest rates in each 
time band. The interest rate risk is 
viewed from different perspectives viz. 
‘Earnings Perspective’ and ‘Economic 
Value Perspective’. The former is 
measured using Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) 
under Traditional Gap Analysis (TGA) 
while the latter is measured through 
changes in the Market Value of Equity 
(MVE) under Duration Gap Analysis 
(DGA).
Ensuring appropriate trade-off between 
the cost of deposits and interest rate on 
advances.

system is intended to identify potentially 
fraudulent transactions on a real-time 
basis, based on predefined probable 
fraud scenarios. ELFRMS operates 24*7 
with a DR set up to ensure business 
continuity.
Introduction/modifications of products/
processes would be taken up post-
assessments primarily using the ‘Risk 
and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)’ to 
identify, evaluate, monitor, and mitigate 
key operational risks within the Bank.

Internal Control Systems – Adequacy and Compliance
Your Bank has put in place an effective and robust internal control apparatus, commensurate with its size, geographical 
spread, and complexity of operations. At the apex level, guidance and direction on the control aspects is vested 
with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors which takes an overall view of the internal control aspects and 
formulates all the related policy guidelines.
Your Bank has put in place an independent Compliance Department headed by a Chief Compliance Officer who is In-
charge of the entire compliance functions of the Bank to ensure effective implementation and compliance with all the 
directives issued by various Regulators, its Board of Directors and its own Internal Control Policy.
Risk-Based Internal Audit (RBIA):
Your Bank has adopted a Risk-Based Internal Audit (RBIA) mechanism which ensures greater emphasis on the internal 
auditor’s role in mitigating various risks. While continuing with the traditional risk management and control methods 
involving transaction testing etc., the Risk-Based Internal Audit would, not only offer suggestions for mitigating current 
risk but also on potential risk, thereby playing an important role in the risk management process of the Bank. The risk 
assessment under RBIA covers risks at various levels (corporate and branch; portfolio and individual transactions etc.,) 
as also the processes in place to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks.
The internal audit department has put in place the RBIA risk assessment methodology, with the approval of the 
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, keeping in view the size and complexity of the business undertaken 
by the Bank. The risk assessment process includes the identification of ‘Inherent Business Risk’ in various activities 
undertaken by the Bank and evaluating the effectiveness of the control systems for monitoring the Inherent Risks of 
the business activities. The Internal Audit function of the Bank, operates independently under the supervision of the 
Audit Committee of the Board, thereby ensuring its independence.
To appraise the effectiveness of management at different levels in accomplishing the assigned tasks towards achieving 
the overall corporate objectives, Management Audit is being undertaken by your Bank for Departments at Head Office 
and Regional Offices.

Centre, Centralized Account Verification Cell, SWIFT reconciliation, and external Integrated Audit of Centralised 
Reconciliation Cell is also undertaken.
Besides, the Bank has also been causing Stock/Credit Audits and Legal Audits of large borrowal accounts by external 
professionals in furtherance of effective credit administration. Bank’s Credit Monitoring Department and Risk 
Management Department are acting as Risk resilient systems for effectively monitoring and managing for mitigation 
of various risks.
Testing of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)
As per the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013, Bank has formulated Internal Financial Controls framework by 
documenting risks and controls associated with each process in the Bank and testing of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting (ICFR) is done annually.
Information Systems Audit

RISK MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
The various risks taken by the Bank during the course of the business development are identified, assessed,
measured, controlled, monitored, mitigated and reported effectively. The key components of the Bank’s
risk management rely on the risk governance architecture, comprehensive processes and internal control
mechanism. The Bank’s risk governance architecture focuses attention on key areas of risk such as credit, market
and operational risk and quantification of these risks wherever possible for effective and continuous monitoring.
a.
Objectives and Policies
		The Bank’s risk management processes are guided by well-defined policies appropriate for various risk
categories, independent risk oversight and periodic monitoring through the sub-committees of the Board
of Directors. The Bank has a well-documented Board approved ‘Policy on Risk Management’ in place. The
Board sets the overall risk appetite and philosophy for the Bank. The Board of Directors, the Risk & Capital
Management Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board review various aspects of risk arising from
the businesses of the Bank.
b.
	Structure and Organization
		The Bank has a risk management system that is centralized with a three track committee approach. The
committees are - Credit Risk Committee (CRC), Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and Operational
Risk Management Committee (ORMC). Risk & Capital Management Committee (RCMC) evaluates the overall
risk factors faced by the bank and directly reports to the Board of directors.

TABLE DF-3: CREDIT RISK: GENERAL DISCLOSURES CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT
Qualitative Disclosures
(a)
General qualitative disclosure with respect to credit risk
		Bank has developed an online comprehensive credit risk rating system for all borrower accounts. Risk
rating of borrowers is intended to help banks in quantifying and aggregating the credit risk across various
exposures. The Bank has validated its existing rating models and refined/revised the corporate models,
besides introduction of Specialized lending rating models, retail score card models [Pool based approach],
facility rating and Business Rule Engine based KB-96 scorecard are used for digital journey. Accordingly,
Bank is rating its credit portfolio as per the criteria laid down for rating in the Policy on Loans & Advances of
the Bank. The rating serves as a single point indicator of diverse risk factors of counter-party and for taking
credit decisions. The risk rating system is drawn up in a structured manner, incorporating different factors
such as borrower and industry specific characteristics. The Bank also undertakes periodic validation exercise
of its rating models and also conducts migration and default rate analysis to test robustness of its rating
models.
		The Bank has formulated a comprehensive Policy on Loans & Advances by incorporating various parameters
and prudential limits to manage and control default, transaction and intrinsic/concentration risk. The credit
exposures are taken after subjecting the proposals to analysis of various risk factors such as financial risk,
industry risk, management risk, business risk, transaction risk etc.
		The Bank analyses the migration of borrowers in various risk rating categories to gauge the quality of the loan
portfolio. The Bank also conducts periodical review of the loan assets to ascertain conduct of the accounts.
The Bank conducts periodical Credit Audit and Stock Audit of large credit exposures to limit the magnitude
of credit risk and interest rate risk.
Credit sanction and related processes
Know Your Customer is a leading principle for all business activities. The other components of the credit processes 
are:
1.
Sound credit approval process with well laid credit sanctioning criteria.
2.
	The acceptability of credit exposure primarily based on the sustainability and adequacy of borrower’s normal
business operations and not based solely on the availability of security.
3.
	Portfolio level risk analysis and reporting to ensure optimal spread of risk across various rating classes to
prevent undue risk concentration across any particular industry segments and monitor credit risk migration.
4.
	Sector specific studies at periodic intervals to highlight risks and opportunities in those sectors.
5.
	Adoption of rating linked exposure norms.
6.
	Industry-wise exposure ceilings based on the industry performance, prospects and the competitiveness of
the sector.
7.
	Separate risk limits for credit portfolios like advances to NBFC and unsecured loans that require special
monitoring.
Review and Monitoring
1.
	All credit exposures, once approved, are monitored and reviewed periodically against the approved limits.
Borrowers with lower credit rating are subject to more frequent reviews.
2.
	Credit monitoring involves independent review of credit risk assessment, compliance with internal policies
of the Bank and with the regulatory framework, compliance with the sanction terms and conditions and
effectiveness of loan administration.
3.
	Customers with emerging credit problems are identified early and classified accordingly. Remedial action is
initiated promptly to minimize the potential loss to the Bank.
Concentration Risk
The Bank controls concentration risk by means of appropriate sectoral limits and borrowers limits based on 
creditworthiness. The Bank also captures the Concentration risk by monitoring the geographical exposure.
Large exposures to individual clients or group
The Bank has individual borrower-wise exposure ceilings based on the internal rating of the borrower as well 
as group-wise borrowing limits. The Bank monitors the level of credit risk (Low/Moderate/High/Very High) and 
direction of change in credit risk (increasing /decreasing/ stable) at the portfolio level.

		While determining level and direction of credit risk, parameters like percentage of low- risk credit (investment 
grade and above) to credit risk exposure and migration from investment to non-investment grade (quantum 
as percentage of credit risk exposure) are also considered. The Bank monitors the rating-wise distribution of 
its borrowers also. 
(d)
Exposure to Industries:
		Industry analysis plays an important part in assessing the concentration risk within the loan portfolio.
Particular attention is given to industry sectors where the Bank believes that there is a high degree of risk
or potential for volatility in the future. The Bank has fixed internal limits for aggregate commitments to
different sectors so that the exposures are evenly spread over various sectors.
		The credit policy deals with short term as well as long term approach to credit risk management. The policy
of the Bank embodies in itself the areas of risk identification, risk measurement, risk grading techniques,
reporting and risk control systems /mitigation techniques, documentation practice and the system for
management of problematic loans.

TABLE DF-4: CREDIT RISK: DISCLOSURE FOR PORTFOLIOS SUBJECT TO THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH
Qualitative Disclosures
Large corporate borrowers and Public Sector Enterprises are being encouraged to solicit ratings from approved 
external rating agencies and wherever such ratings are available, the Bank uses the same in assigning risk weights. 
Bank has approved 7 domestic credit rating agencies identified by RBI i.e. CRISIL, CARE, India Ratings and Research 
Private Limited (earlier FITCH India), ICRA, Brickwork, Acuite Ratings & Research Ltd (Earlier SMERA Ratings Limited) 
and Infomerics Valuation and Rating Pvt Ltd (INFOMERICS). The ratings available in public domain are mapped 
according to risk profile and specific risk characteristics of each rating grade of respective agencies as envisaged in 
RBI guidelines. As per the RBI directions, no fresh rating/evaluations from Brickwork Ratings India Pvt Limited would 
be considered for calculation of RWA.

TABLE DF-5: CREDIT RISK MITIGATION: DISCLOSURES FOR STANDARDIZED APPROACH
Qualitative Disclosures
	As stipulated by the RBI guidelines, the Bank uses the comprehensive approach for collateral risk mitigation. Under
this approach, the Bank reduces its credit exposure to counterparty when calculating its capital requirements to
the extent of risk mitigation provided by the eligible financial collateral as specified in the Basel guidelines.
Types of eligible financial collateral / Guarantors:
	The Bank recognizes only specified types of financial collateral and guarantees (counter-guarantors) for providing
capital relief in line with Basel II guidelines on credit risk mitigation.
	This includes cash, Bank own deposits, gold (including bullion and jewellery, subject to collateralized jewellery
being notionally converted/benchmarked to 99.99 per cent purity), securities issued by the Central and State
Governments, Kisan Vikas Patra, National Savings certificates, life insurance policies with a declared surrender
value which is regulated by IRDA, certain debt securities rated by a recognized credit rating agency, certain debt
securities not rated but issued by Banks and listed on a recognized exchange and are classified as senior debt,
certain mutual fund units where daily Net Assets Value (NAV) is available in public domain.
Eligible Guarantors (counter-guarantors):
Credit protection given by the following entities is recognized:
i)
	Sovereigns, sovereign entities (including BIS, IMF, European Central Bank & European Community as well
as permitted MDBs, ECGC, CRGFTLIH, CGTMSE & credit guarantee schemes covered by NCGTC), Banks and
primary dealers with a lower risk weight than the counterparty;

ii)
	Other entities that are externally rated except when credit protection is provided to a securitization exposure.
This would include credit protection provided by parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies when they have
a lower risk weight than the obligor.
iii)
	When credit protection is provided to a securitization exposure, other entities that currently are externally
rated BBB- or better & that were externally rated A- or better at the time the credit protection was provided.
This would include credit protection provided by parent, subsidiary & affiliate companies when they have a
lower risk weight than the obligor.

TABLE DF-7: MARKET RISK IN TRADING BOOK
Qualitative Disclosures
	The Bank has put in place Board approved Integrated Treasury Policy, Asset Liability Management (ALM) policy,
Market Risk Management Policy and Fund Transfer Pricing Policy for effective management of market risk in
the Bank. The objective of Integrated Treasury Policy is to assess and minimize risks associated with treasury
operations by extensive use of various risk management tools. Broadly, it encompasses Policy prescriptions for
managing systemic risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk in treasury operations.
	For market risk arising out of various products in treasury and its business activities, the Bank has set regulatory
/ internal limits and ensures the adherence thereof. Migration of ratings is tracked regularly. Limits for exposures
to counter-parties, industries and countries are monitored and the risks are controlled through Stop Loss Limits,
Overnight limit, Daylight limit, Aggregate Gap limit, Individual gap limit, Value at Risk (VaR) limit for Forex, Inter-
Bank dealing and various investment limits. For the Market Risk Management the Bank has a Mid Office. The
functions of Mid Office are handled by Risk Management Department.
	The Board, RCMC & ALCO are overseeing the market risk management of the Bank, procedures thereof,
implementing risk management guidelines issued by regulator, best risk management practices followed globally 
and ensures that internal parameters, procedures, practices/policies and risk management prudential limits are
adhered to.
	Liquidity risk of the Bank is assessed through daily gap analysis for maturity mismatch based on residual maturity
in different time buckets as well as various liquidity ratios and management of the same is done within the
prudential limits fixed thereon. Advance techniques such as Stress testing, simulation, sensitivity analysis etc. are
conducted on regular intervals to draw the contingency funding plan under different liquidity scenarios.
	Fund Transfer Pricing Policy which lays down methodology/assumptions on which profitability of the branches/
products/customers is measured and the FTP results are being used for effective decision making.
Quantitative Disclosures
	Bank has adopted the Standardized Duration Approach as prescribed by RBI for computation of capital charge
for market risk and is fully compliant with such RBI guidelines.

TABLE DF-8 : OPERATIONAL RISK
	Strategies and Processes: Bank has initiated several measures to manage operational risk through identification,
assessment and monitoring of inherent risks in all its business processes. A framework has been laid to capture
loss data which can be mapped to operational risk events to measure the impact quantitatively. Bank has put in
place a hierarchical structure to effectively manage operational risk through the formation of internal committee
viz., Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC).
Scope and Nature of Operational Risk Reporting and Measurement Systems
	A systematic process for reporting risk events, loss events, “near misses” and non-compliance issues relating
to operational risks have been developed and implemented. The information gathered will be used to develop
triggers to initiate corrective actions to improve controls. All critical risks and potential loss events are reported
to the senior Management/ORMC/RCMC as appropriate for their directions and suggestions.
	Policy on Operational Risk Management approved by the Board of Directors details the framework for hedging
and/or mitigating operational risk in the Bank. As per the policy, all new Products/Procedure/Process are vetted
by the New Product/Process/Procedure Approval Committee to identify and assess potential operational risks
involved and suggest control measures to mitigate the risks.
Approach for Operational Risk Capital Assessment
	As per the RBI guidelines, the Bank has adopted Basic Indicator Approach for computing capital charge for
Operational Risk.
8.
TABLE DF-9: INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB)
	The interest rate risk is viewed from two perspectives i.e. ‘Earnings Perspective’ and ‘Economic Value Perspective’.
Generally, the former is measured using Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) under Traditional Gap Analysis (TGA) and the
latter is measured through changes in the Market value of Equity (MVE) under Duration Gap Analysis (DGA).
•
Earnings-at-Risk (EaR):
		All the Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate Sensitive Liabilities (RSL) maturing/re-pricing up to 1 year are
bucketed as per Traditional Gap Analysis (TGA) and EaR analysis is conducted by applying various shocks on
product-wise weighted average interest rates in each time band. EaR is quantified by changes in the NII and
NIM in comparison with the previous financial year end.
•
Impact on Market Value of Equity (MVE):
		Impact on Market Value of Equity (MVE) is analyzed through Duration Gap Analysis (DGA) which involves
bucketing of market value of all Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities as per residual maturity/
re-pricing in various time bands and computing Modified Duration Gap. Accurate method is adopted for
computing the market value by discounting each cash flow of all Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate
Sensitive Liabilities (RSL) with various discount curves as suggested by RBI. Notional interest rate shocks are
applied on the resultant Modified Duration Gap to arrive at the changes in the Market Value of Equity (MVE).
•
	Prudential limits have been fixed for changes in NIM and MVE for 200bps shock in the interest rates and
monitored on a monthly basis.
•
	Earning at Risk for 200 bps interest rate shock is estimated at ` 545.61 Crore and change in the Market value
of Equity for 200 bps interest rate shocks is 3.73%.

TABLE DF-10: GENERAL DISCLOSURES FOR EXPOSURE RELATED TO COUNTER-PARTY CREDIT RISK
Qualitative Disclosures
	Counterparty Credit Risk exposures for banks are assessed based on Bank’s business requirements and
considering counterparty Bank’s parameters such as CRAR, net worth, NPA level etc. Counterparty exposures for
other entities are assessed subject to exposure ceilings as per the Policy on Loan & Advances of the Bank. Capital
for Counterparty Credit Risk exposure is assessed based on Standardized Approach.

11. TABLE DF-15: DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR REMUNERATION
a)
Qualitative Disclosure
(a)
Information relating to the composition and mandate of the Nomination & Remuneration 
Committee (NRC).
The Nomination & Remuneration Committee (NRC) consists of four Directors, three of them are 
Independent Directors. Two members are also the members of Risk and Capital Management 
Committee (RCMC) of the Board.
The mandate of the NRC includes identification of persons who are qualified to become directors and 
who may be appointed in Senior Management in accordance with the criteria laid down and recommend 
to the Board for their appointment, fixing their compensation and/or removal, undertaking the due 
diligence of candidates before their  appointment/re-appointment as directors, formulating the criteria 
for determining qualification, positive attributes and independence of a director, key managerial 
personnel and other employees, formulation of criteria for evaluation of performance of independent 
directors and the board of directors, etc. NRC also reviews Policy on “Compensation of Whole Time 
Directors/Chief Executive Officers/Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, etc.” of the Bank (known as 
“Compensation Policy”) besides, administration of ESOP scheme.
(b)
Information relating to the design and structure of remuneration processes and the key features 
and objectives of remuneration policy.
Compensation Policy aims to attract and retain the right candidates in the Bank. The policy is designed 
to support key business strategies and create a strong, performance-orientated environment besides 
providing reasonable remuneration commensurate with the growth of the Bank, keeping in mind 
the circulars issued by the RBI in the matter. It also ensures effective governance of compensation, 
alignment of compensation with prudent risk taking, effective supervisory oversight and stakeholder 
engagement. The Policy read with Policy on Human Resource Management of the Bank aims at 
facilitating effective succession planning in the Bank.
(c)
Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the 
remuneration processes. It should include the nature and type of the key measures used to 
take account of these risks.
A wide variety of measures of credit, market and liquidity risks are used by Bank in implementation 
of risk adjustment. The risk adjustment methods have both quantitative and qualitative elements. 
Compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes and compensation pay-outs are sensitive 
to the time horizon of the risk.
(d)
Description of the ways in which the bank seeks to link performance during a performance 
measurement period with levels of remuneration.
The performance-based remuneration motivates and rewards high performers who strengthen long-
term customer relations and generate income and shareholder value. The Bank’s Compensation Policy 
stipulates that while designing the compensation package to WTD/CEO & Material Risk Takers, it is 
ensured that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. While fixing the Variable 
Pay, performance parameters under financial and non-financial areas of operations (including risk 
adjustment) are assessed.
(e)
A discussion of the Bank’s policy on deferral and vesting of variable remuneration and a 
discussion of the bank’s policy and criteria for adjusting deferred remuneration before vesting 
and after vesting.
As per the Bank’s Compensation Policy, effective pay cycles commencing from April 2020, the maximum 
permissible variable pay is at 200% of the fixed pay for WTD/CEO, which is split into cash (50%) and share 
linked components (50%). Further, in each of these components, 60% of the Variable Pay is deferred to 
be vested over a period of three years in the ratio of 30:30:40. In case of Material Risk Takers (MRTs), the 
maximum permissible limit of variable pay is at 100% of Fixed Pay with similar deferral arrangement. The 
policy also provides that the deferred compensation will be subject to malus/clawback arrangements in 
the event of subdued or negative financial performance of the bank and/or the relevant line of business 
in any year and the policy has identified certain set of situation which, if triggered, empower the NRC/
Board of Directors to invoke malus/clawback clauses. The payment of Variable Pay to the WTD/CEO is 
subject to prior approval of the RBI.
(f)
Description of the different forms of variable remuneration (i.e. cash, shares, ESOPs and other 
forms) that the bank utilizes and the rationale for using these different forms.
The variable pay is split into equal components of cash and share linked instruments to have proper 
mix of remuneration. The share linked instruments act as a retention and motivation tool and provide 
the incumbent with a sense of belongingness with the Bank.

12. TABLE DF-16 : EQUITIES – DISCLOSURE FOR BANKING BOOK POSITIONS
The risk oversight relating to the equity portfolio is part of the overall independent risk management structure of
the Bank and is subjected to the risk management processes and policies along with Integrated Treasury Policy
approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, entire investment portfolio of the Bank including equity investments is
classified on the date of purchase as:
•
HFT - Held for Trading
•
AFS - Available for Sale and
•
HTM - Held to Maturity.
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are classified as HTM securities. In accordance with the RBI 
guidelines, equity investments held under the HTM category are classified as banking book for capital adequacy 
purpose. Equity investments only in the equity of subsidiaries/joint ventures are eligible to be categorized as HTM 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines.
Further, investments in Private Equity funds are eligible to be accounted under HTM portfolio for the initial period 
of 3 years; bank will shift all such portions of draw down for the respective financial year to AFS category. All other 
investments are required to be classified as HFT / AFS securities.
Further, Investments classified under HTM category are carried at their acquisition cost and not marked to 
market. Any diminution, other than temporary, in the value of equity investments is provided for. 
Profit on sale of investment in the HTM category will be first taken to the Profit and loss account, and thereafter 
be appropriated to the ‘Capital Reserve Account”. The amount so appropriated would be net of taxes and the 
amount required to be transferred to statutory reserves. Loss on sale of HTM will be recognized in the profit and 
loss account. 
The Bank has classified investments in PE for ` 3.23 Crore under AFS and ` 5.78 Crore under HTM as at March 
31, 2023 as per prudential guidance. There was no sale, liquidation or shifting to other categories from above 
mentioned investments during the Quarter ended March 31, 2023 from the HTM category. On account of this 
investment, the Bank has not recognized any unrealized gain or loss in the financial statement as of March 31, 
2023.
13. LEVERAGE RATIO
Qualitative Disclosure:
Under Basel III, a simple, transparent, non-risk based ratio called leverage ratio has been introduced which is
calibrated to act as a credible supplementary measure to the risk based capital requirements. This ratio acts as a
“backstop” measure to the risk based capital requirements and constrains the build-up of leverage in the banking
sector.
The Leverage Ratio is computed as:
 Capital Measure (Tier I capital) 
Leverage Ratio =	
 -------------------------------------------- 
 Exposure Measure
The capital measure is the Tier 1 capital of the risk-based capital framework, taking into account various regulatory 
adjustments/deductions and the transitional arrangements. The exposure measure is the sum of on-balance 
sheet exposures, derivative exposures, securities financing transaction (SFT) exposures and off-balance sheet 
items.

14. LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR)
Qualitative Disclosure:
Bank is computing LCR on a daily basis in line with the RBI circular dated June 9, 2014 on “Basel III Framework
on Liquidity Standards – Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools and LCR Disclosure
Standards”. These guidelines ensure that banks maintain sufficient amount of High Quality Liquidity Assets
(HQLAs) to survive 30 days stress scenario so that banks can take corrective measures within such period. These
HQLAs have to be 100% of the net cash outflows w.e.f. January 1, 2019.
Bank’s Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is empowered to monitor and form suitable strategies
to maintain stipulated levels of LCR by channelizing funds to target good quality asset and liability profile to
meet Bank’s profitability as well as liquidity requirements. Funding strategies are formulated by the Finance
and Accounts Department (FAD) in accordance with ALCO guidance. The objective of the funding strategy is to
achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent with prudent liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs.
Accordingly, FAD estimates daily liquidity requirement. With the help of structural liquidity statement prepared
by Bank, FAD evaluates current and future liquidity requirement and takes necessary action.

15. NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR)
The NSFR is defined as the “amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding”
and it promotes resilience over a longer-term time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with more
stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis. The primary objective of NSFR is to ensure that banks maintain
a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities, promoting
funding stability. Bank is required to maintain NSFR of above 100%.

and subject to approval of the RBI each year. The said variable pay is equally split into cash and non-cash components 
with each component having upfront (presently 40% of VP) and deferred portions (presently 60% of VP with a deferral 
period of three years). The policy has malus/clawback arrangements in line with the RBI guidelines.
The remuneration structure of the Managing Director & CEO and Executive Director of the Bank is recommended

policy. The Board of Directors on the basis of recommendation of the NRC approves the remuneration, subject to

Independent Auditors’ Report
To The Members of
The Karnataka Bank Limited
Report on Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements 
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial 
Statements of The Karnataka Bank Limited (“the Bank”), 
which comprise the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2023, 
the Profit and Loss Account, the Cash Flow Statement, 
and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
Standalone Financial Statements give the information 
required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as 
the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the 
manner so required for banking companies and give a 
true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of 
affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2023, its profit, its cash 
flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our 
report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance 
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, provisions of section 
29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, circulars and 
guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) 
from time to time, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the 
financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report, including in 
relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included 
the performance of procedures designed to respond to 
our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the Standalone Financial Statements. The results of our 
audit procedures, including the procedures performed 
to address the matters below, provide the basis for our 
audit opinion on the accompanying Standalone Financial 
Statements.
A.
Identification of Non-Performing Assets (‘NPA’)
and Provisions thereon
Key Audit Matter
Significant estimates and judgment involved
	Identification of Non-Performing Assets (“NPA”) and
provisions in respect of NPAs are made based on
management’s assessment in accordance with the
prudential norms issued by the Reserve Bank of
India on Income Recognition, Asset Classification
and Provisioning (“IRACP”) pertaining to Advances
from time to time.
	The provision on NPAs is based on the valuation of
the security available and also involves management 
estimates and judgements. In case of restructured
accounts, provision is made in accordance with the
RBI guidelines.
	Accordingly, our audit focused on identification of
NPAs and provision on advances as a key audit matter
because of the level of management estimates and
judgment involved. Further, in the event of any
improper application of the prudential norms or
consideration of the incorrect value of the security,
the carrying value of the assets could be materially
misstated either individually or collectively, and
in view of the significance of amount of advances
and investments in the financial statements and
given its significance to the overall audit due to
stakeholder and regulatory focus, the classification
of the advances and investments and provisioning
thereon has been considered as Key Audit Matter.
Auditors’ Response
	Our 
key 
audit 
approach 
included 
assessing
the adequacy of design, implementation and
operating effectiveness of key internal controls
and substantive audit procedures over approval,
recording and monitoring of loans, assessing
the reliability of documentation, measurement
of provisions, identification of NPA accounts and
valuation of security for NPA accounts along with
basis and rationale for various other management
information.

Independent Auditors’ Report (contd...)
•
	As a process, we have read the Bank’s policies
for NPA identification and provisioning and
assessing compliance with the IRACP norms.
•
	We have evaluated details on a test check basis
of exposures for identification of NPA and
calculation of provisions including valuation of
primary and collateral securities which involves
certain degree of management estimation.
•
	We have evaluated and understood the
Bank’s internal control systems to ensure
completeness, 
accuracy, 
and 
relevance
of data and to ensure that the same is in
compliance with the RBI guidelines, circulars
and directions on the Prudential Norms on
Income Recognition, Asset Classification and
Provisioning issued from time to time.
•
	We tested on a samples basis to ensure
completeness of documentation, adherence of
the approval process to the Bank’s Policy and
board minutes, credit review of customers,
review of Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’)
reports in the RBI’s Central Repository of
Information on Large Credits (CRILC) and
other related documents and reports including
evaluation of the past trends of management
judgement, governance, and review of internal
control. Held discussion with the management
of the Bank on various accounts wherein there
has been stress and steps taken to mitigate
such risks.
•	
We have also assessed disclosure requirements 
for classification and provisioning of NPAs in
accordance with the RBI circulars including
those specifically issued for Covid 19 related
matters.
B.
Information 
Technology 
(IT) 
Systems 
and
Controls
Key Audit Matter
	The IT environment of the Bank is complex. The
Bank’s operations utilise many independent and
inter-dependent information technology systems
for processing and recording large volume of
transactions in numerous locations on a daily
basis. As a result, there is a high degree of reliance
and dependency on such IT systems for financial
reporting process of the Bank. Controls over
access and changes to IT systems are critical to
the recording of financial information and the
preparation of Standalone Financial Statements.
Appropriate automated general and application
controls are required to ensure that such IT systems
and applications are able to process the data, as
required, completely, accurately and consistently,
which directly impact the completeness and
accuracy of financial reporting.
	The IT systems and controls is identified as a key 
audit matter because of high level of automation, 
significant number of systems being used and 
complexity of the IT infrastructure and its impact 
on the financial reporting system since our audit 
approach could significantly differ depending on the 
effective operation of the Bank’s IT controls.
Auditor’s Response
	We tested the technology control environment for 
key IT applications (systems) used in processing 
significant transactions and recording balances in 
the general ledger. We also tested key automated 
controls embedded within these systems which link 
the technology-enabled business processes. Our 
further audit procedures included:
•
	Assessing the governance and higher-level
controls across the IT Environment and
performing review of IT general controls.
•
	Evaluation and understanding the key IT
systems being used by the Bank for its Core
Banking and other operations.
•
	Assessing 
operative 
effectiveness 
of 
key
controls within various business processes.
It included testing of integrity of system
interfaces, completeness and accuracy of
the data, system reconciliation controls and
automated calculations.
•
	Design and operating effectiveness testing of
controls across the User Access Management,
Change 
Management, 
backup, 
other 
IT
operational controls as well as effectiveness
testing of automated business process controls.
•
	Data integrity of critical system reports used by
us in our audit to select samples and analyse
data used by management to generate financial
reports.
C.
Direct and Indirect Taxes
Key Audit Matter
	This matter has been identified as a Key Audit
Matter due to the significant level of management
judgment required in the estimation of provision for
taxes including any write back of provisions, due to
factors like uncertain tax positions and provision for
tax involves interpretation of various rules and law.
It also involves consideration of on-going disputes
and disclosures.
Auditor’s Response
•
	Our audit procedures to test uncertain tax
positions included understanding processes,
evaluation 
of 
adequacy 
of 
design 
and
171
Financial Statements / Standalone à
Celebrating
19
2024
Years of Trust
 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
implementation of controls and testing of 
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
controls 
over 
provision for taxation, assessment of uncertain 
tax positions and disclosure of contingencies.
•
	We have obtained details of completed
tax assessments and demands from the
management of the Bank.
•
	We 
discussed 
with 
appropriate 
senior
management 
personnel, 
independently 
assessed 
management’s 
estimate 
of 
the
possible outcome of disputed cases; and
evaluated the management’s underlying key
assumptions in estimating the tax provisions.
•
	We considered legal precedence and other
rulings in evaluating management’s position
on these uncertain tax positions, the provisions
made, and/or write back of the provisions.
•
	We have also relied upon the opinion given
by tax specialist in evaluating management’s
assessment for the uncertain tax positions. For
those matters where management concluded
that no provision should be recorded, we also
considered the adequacy and completeness of
disclosures.
D.
Centralised Audit of the Bank
Key Audit Matter
	Till year 2020-21, the audit of Branches (other
than top 20 branches and certain other locations)
was carried out by the Branch Statutory Auditors
appointed by the Bank. However, since previous
year, the Joint Statutory Auditors have performed
the audit of the Bank centrally. Considering this fact,
it has been considered as a key audit matter.
Auditor’s Response
•
	We have assessed the Bank’s systems and
procedures 
for 
carrying 
out 
centralized
operations under various areas including
process of consolidation at the central level.
•
	Visited certain branches to understand the
operations carried out at Branches and
potential issues.
•
	Performed analysis of information provided at
central level.
•
	Reviewed the reports in respect of various
audits including concurrent audit, internal
inspections carried out at branches on a sample 
basis.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial 
Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon
The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises 
the Corporate Overview, Directors’ Report including 
annexures to Directors’ Report, Management Discussion 
and Analysis, Basel III – Pillar 3 disclosures and Corporate 
Governance report included in the Annual Report, but 
does not include the Standalone and Consolidated 
Financial Statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The other information is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above when it becomes available 
and, in doing so, consider whether such other information 
is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial 
Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the other information, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged 
with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect 
to the preparation of these Standalone Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows of the 
Bank in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Accounting 
Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act 
read with the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2021 in so far as they apply to the Bank and provisions 
of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and 
circulars and guidelines issued by the RBI from time to 
time. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act and the Banking Regulations Act, 
1949 for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and 
Independent Auditors’ Report (contd...)

are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the 
Management and the Board of Directors is responsible 
for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends 
to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing 
the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial 
Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under
Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible
for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank
has adequate internal financial controls system
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
in place and the operating effectiveness of such
controls.
•
	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures in the Standalone 
Financial Statements made by Management.
•
	Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s
use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether
a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our Auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue
as a going concern.
•
	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and
content of the Standalone Financial Statements,
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the
Standalone Financial Statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of the misstatements in the 
Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone 
Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) 
planning of the scope of our audit work and evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of 
any identified misstatement in the Standalone Financial 
Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our Auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
Independent Auditors’ Report (contd...)

adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 4 (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report 
of even date on the Standalone Financial Statements of the Karnataka Bank Limited for the year ended March 
31, 2023)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements of The 
Karnataka Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2023 
in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements criteria established by the Bank considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the Bank’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Act and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and 
the circulars and guidelines issued by the RBI.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI and deemed to be 
prescribed under section 143 (10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our 
audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal financial controls based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone 
Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the Bank has, in 
all material respects, adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
and such internal financial controls were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the criteria for 
internal control with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements established by the Bank considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
“Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting” issued by the ICAI.

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ADOPTED IN PREPARING THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
GENERAL
The Karnataka Bank Limited incorporated at Mangaluru in India is a publicly held Banking Company governed by the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and is engaged in providing a wide range of banking and financial services involving 
retail, corporate banking and para-banking activities in addition to treasury and foreign exchange business.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with requirements prescribed under the 
Third Schedule (Form A and Form B) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, following the going concern concept, on 
historical cost basis and accrual basis of accounting unless otherwise stated,  conforming to the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP) in India which encompasses applicable statutory provisions, regulatory norms prescribed 
by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time, the accounting standards notified under section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2021 to the extent applicable and practices 
generally prevalent in the Banking industry in India.

in the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
and the reported income and expenses during the reported period. The Management believes that the estimates and 
assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could 
differ from these estimates. Any revision in the accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and 
future periods.

required to be transferred to Statutory Reserve account) in accordance with the RBI guidelines.
		Interest on income tax refund is recognised based on the refund intimation / order received under the
provisions of the Income tax Act, 1961 from time to time.
2.
INVESTMENTS
2.1 Classification:
	Investments are classified under the heads “Held to Maturity”, “Available for Sale” and “Held for Trading” categories 
and are valued in accordance with the RBI guidelines. The value, net of depreciation is shown in the Balance 
Sheet. For the purposes of disclosure in the Balance Sheet, they are classified under six groups viz. Government 
Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Subsidiaries and/or joint ventures and 
Other Investments.
2.2 Basis of Classification:
	Investments that are held principally for resale within 90 days from the date of purchase are classified as HFT 
securities.
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are classified as HTM securities.
Investments which are not classified in the above categories are classified as AFS securities.
	Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are classified as HTM except in respect of those investments which 
are acquired and held exclusively with a view to its subsequent disposal. These investments are classified as AFS.
	An investment is classified as HTM, HFT or AFS at the time of its purchase and subsequent shifting amongst 
categories is done in conformity with regulatory guidelines.
2.3 Acquisition Cost:
	Cost of investments is computed based on the weighted average cost method. Cost including brokerage, 
commission pertaining to investments, paid at the time of acquisition, is charged to the Profit and Loss Account. 
Broken period interest is charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
2.4 Valuation:
Held to Maturity:
	These are carried at their acquisition cost and are not marked to market. Any premium on acquisition is amortised 
over the remaining maturity period of the security on a straight-line basis. Provision is recognised for diminution 
other than temporary in the value of such investments for each investment individually.
Non-performing investments are identified and provision is recognised as per the RBI guidelines.
190
Financial Statements / Standalone à
Celebrating
19
2024
Years of Trust
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
Held for Trading and Available for Sale categories:
	Investments classified under HFT and AFS are marked to market as per the RBI guidelines. These securities 
are valued scrip-wise and any resultant depreciation or appreciation is aggregated for each category. The net 
depreciation for each category within each group is provided for, whereas the net appreciation for each category 
is ignored. The book value of individual securities is not changed consequent to periodic valuation of investments.
	Traded investments are valued based on the trades / quotes from the recognised stock exchanges, prices 
declared by Primary Dealers Association of India (‘PDAI’) jointly with Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (‘FIMMDA’)/Financial Benchmark India Private Limited (‘FBIL’), periodically.
	The market value of unquoted government securities which qualify for determining the Statutory Liquidity Ratio 
(‘SLR’) included in the AFS and HFT categories is computed as per the Yield-to-Maturity (‘YTM’) rates published by 
FIMMDA/FBIL.
	The valuation of other unquoted fixed income securities (viz. State government securities, Other approved 
securities, Bonds and debentures, Pass through Certificates) wherever linked to the YTM rates, is computed 
with a mark-up (reflecting associated credit and liquidity risk) over the YTM rates for government securities with 
similar maturity, published by FIMMDA/FBIL. Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up value, if the 
latest Balance Sheet is available or at ` 1 as per the RBI guidelines. Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest 
repurchase price / net asset value declared by the mutual fund. Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate 
of deposits, being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost.
	Units of Alternate Investment Fund (‘AIF’) held under AFS category are marked to market based on the NAV 
provided by AIF based on the latest audited financial statements. In case the audited financials are not available 
for a period beyond 18 months, the investments are valued at ` 1 per AIF.
	In the event provisions recognised on account of depreciation in the AFS or HFT categories are found to be 
in excess of the required amount in any year, such excess is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and 
subsequently appropriated, from profit available for appropriation, if any, to Investment Reserve Account in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines after adjusting for income tax and appropriation to Statutory Reserve.
2.5 Security Receipts (SR):
	Where sale of stressed asset results in a consideration lower than the value of the stressed assets net of provisions 
carried there against, the shortfall is debited to Profit & Loss account. Where such sale results in consideration 
higher than the value of the stressed assets net of provisions carried there against, the excess is netted off 
against the cost of corresponding SRs to arrive at their Book Value.
	SRs issued by Asset Reconstruction Companies (‘ARC’) are valued at Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) declared by the ARC 
except in respect of stressed assets which are sold on or after Apr 1, 2018 and the Bank holds more than 90% 
of SRs backed by its sold assets, the provision held against the Book Value of these SRs is higher of provision 
required in terms of NAV declared by the ARC and provisioning applicable to the underlying loans, assuming that 
the assets sold notionally continued in the books of the Bank.
2.6 Disposal of Investments:
	Profit/Loss on sale of investment under the aforesaid three categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account. In accordance with the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India, Profit on sale of investments 
in the Held to Maturity (HTM) category is appropriated to Capital Reserve, net of applicable taxes and amount 
required to be transferred to Statutory Reserve. The discount if any, on acquisition of investments in
Held to Maturity (HTM) category is accounted as follows:
a.
on interest bearing securities, it is accounted for at the time of sale/ redemption.
b.
on zero-coupon securities, it is accounted for over the balance tenor of the security on a constant yield basis.
2.7 Repo and reverse repo transactions:
	Repo and reverse repo transactions are accounted for as secured borrowing/ lending transactions respectively. 
Borrowing cost on repo transactions is treated as interest expense and income on reverse repo transactions is 
treated as interest income.
2.8 Short Sale
	In accordance with the RBI guidelines, the Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central Government 
dated securities. The short positions are reflected in ‘Securities Short Sold (‘SSS’) A/c’, specifically created for 
191
Financial Statements / Standalone à

Years of Trust
 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
this purpose. Such short positions are categorised under HFT category and netted off from investments in the 
Balance Sheet. These positions are marked-to-market along with the other securities under HFT portfolio and 
the resultant mark-to-market gains/losses are accounted for as per the relevant RBI guidelines for valuation of 
investments discussed earlier.
2.9 Non Performing Investments
a.
Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid for more than 90 days.
b.
	In the case of equity shares, in the event the investment in shares of any company is valued at ` 1 per
company on account of non-availability of the latest balance sheet, those equity shares would be reckoned
as NPI.
c.
	The Bank also classifies an investment as a non-performing investment in case any credit facility availed by
the same borrower/entity has been classified as a non-performing asset and vice versa. The above is applied
to Preference Shares where the fixed dividend is not paid.
d.
	The investments in debentures/ bonds, which are deemed to be advance, are also subjected to NPI norms
as applicable to investments.
3.
DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
	Derivative contracts are designated as hedging or trading and accounted in accordance with Reserve Bank of
India’s guidelines.
	Derivative deals for trading are marked to market and net depreciation is recognised while net appreciation is
ignored.
	Derivatives used for hedging are marked to market in cases where the underlying assets/ liabilities are marked
to market and income /expenditure is accounted on accrual basis.
4.
ADVANCES
4.1 Classification
	Advances are classified into (a) Standard; (b) Sub-Standard; (c) Doubtful; and (d) Loss assets, in accordance 
with the RBI Guidelines and are stated net of provisions made towards Non- performing advances, unrealised 
interest and claims received from Guarantee corporations. etc. Advances are net of bills rediscounted, Inter-
bank participation with risk, provisions for non- performing advances, floating provisions, unrealised fees and 
unrealised interest held in suspense account. Credit facility/investment are classified as performing and non-
performing asset as per applicable RBI guidelines.
4.2 Provisioning
	Provision for non-performing advances (‘NPAs’) comprising sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets is made in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines which prescribe minimum provision levels and encourage banks to make a 
higher provision based on sound commercial judgement.
	In case of restructured/rescheduled assets, provision is made in accordance with the guidelines issued by the RBI 
as applicable.
	In case of financial assets sold to Securitisation/Reconstruction Company, if the sale is for the price higher than 
the net book value, excess provision held is not reversed but retained till redemption of the security receipt, 
wherever applicable. If the sale is at a price below the net book value (NBV), the shortfall is debited to the Profit 
and Loss account, as per the RBI Guidelines.
5.
FIXED ASSETS
	Fixed assets are stated at historical cost (except premises revalued based on values determined by the approved
valuers) less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost includes incidental expenditure incurred on
the assets before they are ready for intended use and taxes and duties to the extent not eligible for input credits

REVALUATION OF FIXED ASSETS
	Portfolio of immovable properties is revalued periodically by an independent valuer to reflect current market
valuation. All land and building owned by the Bank and used as branches or offices are grouped under “Land
and Building” in the fixed assets category. Appreciation, if any, on revaluation is credited to Revaluation Reserve
under Capital Reserves. Additional Depreciation on the revalued asset is charged to the Profit and Loss Account
and appropriated from the Revaluation Reserves to Revenue Reserves.
7.
DEPRECIATION
	Depreciation on fixed assets (including revalued portion thereon) is provided following Straight Line Method
(SLM) as per the useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, except in respect of computers
(including software) where depreciation is provided at a flat rate of 33.33 % as per the RBI guidelines.
	Where during any financial year, addition has been made to any asset or where any asset has been sold,
discarded, demolished or destroyed, the depreciation on such asset is calculated on pro rata basis from the date
of such addition or as the case maybe, up to the date on which such asset has been sold, discarded, demolished
or destroyed.
	Premium paid on leasehold properties is charged off over the lease period.  Depreciation on leased assets is
calculated so as to spread the depreciable amount over the primary lease period.
8.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
	The carrying amount of assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date if there is any indication of impairment
based on internal/external factors. In case of indicators of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised wherever 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the
asset’s net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and risks specific to the asset. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount
of the asset over remaining useful life.
9.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
9.1 Initial Recognition
	Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the reporting currency by applying to the foreign currency amount 
the exchange rate between the reporting currency and foreign currency on the date of the transaction.
9.2 Conversion
	Monetary Assets and Liabilities, Forward Exchange Contracts, Guarantees, Letters of Credit, Acceptances, 
Endorsements and other obligations are evaluated at the closing spot rates/forward rates for the residual maturity 
of the contract, as notified by the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (‘FEDAI’) and the resulting profit 
and loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss account, as per the guidelines issued by RBI.
9.3 Exchange Differences
	Exchange difference arising on settlement of monetary items is recognised as income or as expense in the year 
in which it arises. Non-monetary items which are carried in terms of historical cost denominated in a foreign 
currency are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items which 
are carried at fair value or other similar valuations denominated in a foreign currency are reported using the 
exchange rates that existed when the values were determined.
	Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading that are entered into to establish the amount 
of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of transactions, which are outstanding at 
the Balance Sheet date are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. The premium or discount arising at the 
inception of such a forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract.
9.4	 Outstanding forward exchange contracts are revalued at the Balance Sheet date at the rates notified by FEDAI 
and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. The resultant gain/loss on revaluation is recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account in accordance with the RBI/FEDAI guidelines.
9.5	 Forward exchange contracts and other derivative contracts which have overdue receivables remaining unpaid 
over 90 days or more are classified as non-performing assets and provided for as per the extant master circular 
on Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning issued by the RBI.

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
10.1 Defined Benefit Plan
	Liability towards Gratuity, Pension, Sick Leave and En-cashable Leave are determined and recognised in the 
accounts based on actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date. Gratutity is funded with the Gratuity Trust 
duly registered under the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961. The actuarial gains/losses are recognised as per the 
Accounting Standard 15.
10.2 Defined Contribution Scheme
	Contribution made by the Bank to the Provident Fund and Contributory Pension Scheme in the form of retirement 
benefits are charged to the Profit and Loss account. There is no other obligation other than the contribution 
payable to the fund.
Short term employee benefits are accounted for on actual basis.
11. EMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
	In accordance with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2021 /   Guidance Note on Accounting
for the Employee Share-based Payments issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants  of India (‘ICAI’), the
cost of equity-settled transactions is measured using intrinsic value method for all options granted on or before
31 March 2021.
	RBI vide its clarification dated 30th August, 2021, circular reference no. RBI/2021-22/95 DOR.GOV.
REC.44/29.67.001/2021-22 on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/ Chief Executive Officers/
Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, advised Banks that fair value of share-linked instruments on the
date of grant should be recognised as an expense for all instruments. For options granted after March 31, 2021,
the Bank follows the fair value method and recognise the fair value of such option computed using the Black-
Scholes model without reducing estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense over the vesting period.
12. SEGMENT REPORTING
	The Bank recognises the Business Segment as the Primary Reporting Segment and Geographical Segment as
the Secondary Reporting Segment, in accordance with the RBI guidelines and in compliance with Accounting
Standard 17.
	Business Segment is classified into (a) Treasury, (b) Corporate and Wholesale Banking, (c) Retail Banking and
(d) Other Banking Operations and revenues /expenses allocated in accordance with the RBI guideline. Further,
‘Digital Banking’ has been identified as a Sub–segment under Retail Banking as required in extant guidelines of
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Geographical Segment consists only of Domestic Segment since the Bank does not have any foreign branches.
13. EARNINGS PER SHARE
	Basic Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to the equity
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
	Diluted Earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to the
equity shareholders using the weighted average number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares
outstanding at the year end.
14. TAXATION
	Tax expenses comprise current and deferred taxes. Current income tax is measured as the amount expected to
be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961, rules framed thereunder  and  after
due consideration of the judicial pronouncement and legal opinions.
	Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of current year timing differences between taxable income and
accounting income for the year and reversal of timing differences of earlier years. Deferred tax is measured
based on the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. Changes in
deferred tax assets / liabilities on account of changes in enacted tax rates are given effect to in the Profit and Loss
Account in the period of change.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for future tax consequences of timing differences between the
carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss carry forwards.

	Deferred tax is recognized subject to consideration of prudence on timing difference being the difference 
between taxable income and accounting income that originate in one period and are capable of reversal in one 
or more subsequent period. In the event of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward losses and items relating 
to capital losses, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that there is virtual certainty supported 
by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable income will be available to realize such assets. In other 
situations, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient 
future taxable income will be available to realize these assets.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if such items relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing 
tax laws and the Company has a legally enforceable right for such set off.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and appropriately adjusted.
15. PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS
	A provision is recognised when there is an obligation as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made.
Provisions are not discounted to their present value and are determined based on the best estimate required to
settle the obligation as at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to
reflect the current best estimates.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
	A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the
Bank or a present obligation that arises from past events that is not recognized because it is not probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation
cannot be made. The Bank does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial
statements.
	Contingent liabilities on account of foreign exchange contracts, letters of credit, bank guarantees and acceptances
and endorsements denominated in foreign currencies and outstanding as at the Balance Sheet date are translated 
at year end rates notified by the FEDAI.
	Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed
continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income
are recognized in the period in which the change occurs.
16. NET PROFIT
	The net profit disclosed in the Profit & Loss Account is after making provisions for (i) Taxes, (ii) Non Performing
Assets, (iii) Standard Advances, (iv) Restructured advances,  (v) Depreciation on Investments and (vi) other
necessary and applicable provisions.
17. LEASES
	Leases where the Lessor effectively retains substantially all risks and benefits of ownership of the leased item are
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised on SLM basis as an expense in the Profit
and Loss Account over the lease term in accordance with AS-19.
18. ACCOUNTING FOR DIVIDEND DECLARED / PAID
	The Bank is not required to provide for dividend proposed/ declared after the balance sheet date. The same shall

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
Bank is computing LCR on a daily basis in line with the RBI circular dated June 9, 2014 on “Basel III Framework
on Liquidity Standards – Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools and LCR Disclosure
Standards”. These guidelines ensure that banks maintain sufficient amount of High Quality Liquidity Assets
(HQLAs) to survive 30 days stress scenario so that banks can take corrective measures within such period. These
HQLAs have to be 100% of the net cash outflows w.e.f. January 1, 2019.
Bank’s Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is empowered to monitor and form suitable strategies
to maintain stipulated levels of LCR by channelizing funds to target good quality asset and liability profile to
meet Bank’s profitability as well as liquidity requirements. Funding strategies are formulated by the Finance
and Accounts Department (FAD) in accordance with ALCO guidance. The objective of the funding strategy is to
achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent with prudent liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs. 
Accordingly, FAD estimates daily liquidity requirement. With the help of structural liquidity statement prepared by
Bank, FAD evaluates current and future liquidity requirement and takes necessary action. Bank has consistently
maintained LCR above 100% during FY 22-23 i.e., at levels higher than the required regulatory at minimum level
on an ongoing basis.

Qualitative Disclosure
The Bank has put in place Board approved Integrated Treasury Policy, Asset Liability Management (ALM) policy, 
Market Risk Management Policy and Fund Transfer Pricing Policy for effective management of market risk in the Bank. 
The objective of Integrated Treasury Policy is to assess and minimize risks associated with treasury operations by 
extensive use of various risk management tools. Broadly, it encompasses Policy prescriptions for managing systemic 
risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk in treasury operations.
For market risk arising out of various products in treasury and its business activities, the Bank has set regulatory/ 
internal limits and ensures the adherence thereof. Migration of ratings is tracked regularly. Limits for exposures 
to counter- parties, industries and countries are monitored and the risks are controlled through Stop Loss Limits, 
Overnight limit, Daylight limit, Aggregate Gap limit, Individual gap limit, Value at Risk (VaR) limit for Forex, Inter-Bank 
dealing and various investment limits. For the Market Risk Management the Bank has a Mid Office. The functions of 
Mid Office are handled by Risk Management Department.
The Board, RCMC & ALCO are overseeing the market risk management of the Bank, procedures thereof, implementing 
risk management guidelines issued by regulator, best risk management practices followed globally and ensures that 
internal parameters, procedures, practices/policies and risk management prudential limits are adhered to.
Liquidity risk of the Bank is assessed through daily gap analysis for maturity mismatch based on residual maturity in 
different time buckets as well as various liquidity ratios and management of the same is done within the prudential 
limits fixed thereon. Advance techniques such as Stress testing, simulation, sensitivity analysis etc. are conducted on 
regular intervals to draw the contingency funding plan under different liquidity scenarios. 
Fund Transfer Pricing Policy which lays down methodology/assumptions on which profitability of the branches/
products/customers is measured and the FTP results are being used for effective decision making.

@ Credit exposure is calculated as per RBI Circular DBS.FID.No.C-12/01.02.00/2002- 03 dated 20-01-2003 on 
measurement of credit exposure of derivatives products and we have adopted current exposure method for calculating 
the same. According to the circular, on order to calculate the credit exposure equivalent of off balance sheet interest 
rate & exchange rate instruments under current exposure method, a bank would sum:
i.
	The total replacement cost (obtaining by marking by marking to marking) of all its contracts with positive value
(i.e. when bank has to receive money from counterparty) and
ii.
	An Amount Potential future charges in credit exposure calculated on the basis of the notional principal amount
of the contract multiplied by the credit conversion factor of 1% (applicable to contracts maturing less than one
year) and 5% (contract maturing one year and above) according to residual maturity.

(b)
Information  relating to the design and structure of 
remuneration processes and the key features and 
objectives of remuneration policy.
Compensation Policy aims to attract and retain the 
right candidates in the Bank. The policy is designed 
to support key business strategies and create 
a strong, performance-orientated environment 
besides providing reasonable remuneration 
commensurate with the growth of the Bank, 
keeping in mind the circulars issued by the RBI in 
the matter. It also ensures effective governance of 
compensation, alignment of compensation with 
prudent risk taking, effective supervisory oversight 
and stakeholder engagement. The Policy read with 
Policy on Human Resource Management of the 
Bank aims at facilitating effective succession
planning in the Bank.
(c)
Description of the ways in which current and future 
risks are taken into account in the	remuneration 
processes. It should include the nature and type 
of the key measures used to take account of these 
risks.
A wide variety of measures of credit, market and 
liquidity risks are used by Bank in implementation 
of risk adjustment. The risk adjustment methods 
have both quantitative and qualitative elements. 
Compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk 
outcomes and compensation pay-outs are sensitive 
to the time horizon of the risk.
(d)
Description of the ways in which the bank seeks 
to link performance during a performance 
measurement period with levels of remuneration.
The performance-based remuneration motivates 
and rewards high performers who strengthen 
long-term customer relations and generate income 
and shareholder value. The Bank’s Compensation   
Policy stipulates that   while designing the 
compensation package to WTD/CEO & Material Risk 
Takers,  it  is ensured that there is a proper balance 
between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. While fixing 
the Variable Pay, performance parameters under 
financial and non-financial areas of operations 
(including risk adjustment) are assessed.
(e)
A discussion  of  the Bank’s policy	 on deferral and 
vesting of variable remuneration and  a   discussion 
of the bank’s policy and criteria for adjusting 
deferred remuneration before vesting and after 
vesting.
As per the Bank’s Compensation	 Policy, effective 
pay  cycles  commencing  from  April 2020, the 
maximum permissible variable pay is at 200% of 
the fixed pay for WTD/CEO, which is  split   into   
cash   (50%)   and   share   linked components 
(50%). Further, in each of these components, 60% 
of the Variable Pay is deferred to be vested over 
a period of three years in the ratio of 30:30:40. 
In case  of  Material  Risk  Takers  (MRTs),  the 
maximum permissible limit of variable pay 
is at 100% of Fixed Pay with similar deferral 
arrangement. The policy also provides that the 
deferred compensation will be subject to malus/
clawback arrangements in the event of subdued or 
negative financial performance of the bank and/
or the relevant line of business in any year and the 
policy has identified certain set of situation which, 
if triggered, empower the NRC/Board of Directors 
to invoke malus/clawback clauses. The payment of 
Variable Pay  to  the WTD/CEO  is  subject  to prior 
approval of the RBI.

(f)
Description of the different forms of variable 
remuneration (i.e. cash, shares, ESOPs and other 
forms) that the bank utilizes and the rationale for 
using these different forms. 
The variable pay is split into equal components of 
cash and share linked instruments to have proper 
mix of remuneration. The share linked instruments

the Bank.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To The Members of
The Karnataka Bank Limited
Report on Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated 
Financial Statements of The Karnataka Bank Limited (“the 
Bank” or “Holding Company”), and its subsidiary (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred to 
as “the Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance 
sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Consolidated Profit and 
Loss Account, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 
for the year ended, and notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based on 
the consideration of the reports of the other auditors on 
separate financial statements and on the other financial 
information of the subsidiary, the aforesaid Consolidated 
Financial Statements give the information required by the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies 
Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so 
required for banking companies and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of 
affairs of the Group and its subsidiary as at March 31, 
2023, its consolidated profit, and its consolidated cash 
flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, provisions of section 
29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, circulars and 
guidelines issued by the RBI from time to time and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, and based on the consideration 
of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial 
statements and on the other financial information of the 
subsidiary, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report, including in 
relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included 
the performance of procedures designed to respond to 
our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of our 
audit procedures, including the procedures performed 
to address the matters below, provide the basis for 
our audit opinion on the accompanying Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
A.
Identification of Non-Performing Assets (‘NPA’)
and Provisions thereon
Key Audit Matter
Significant estimates and judgment involved
	Identification of Non-Performing Assets (“NPA”) and
provisions in respect of NPAs are made based on
management’s assessment in accordance with the
prudential norms issued by the Reserve Bank of
India on Income Recognition, Asset Classification
and Provisioning (“IRACP”) pertaining to Advances
from time to time.
	The provision on NPAs is based on the valuation of
the security available and also involves management 
estimates and judgements. In case of restructured
accounts, provision is made in accordance with the
RBI guidelines.
	Accordingly, our audit focused on identification of
NPAs and provision on advances as a key audit matter
because of the level of management estimates and
judgment involved. Further, in the event of any
improper application of the prudential norms or
consideration of the incorrect value of the security,
the carrying value of the assets could be materially
misstated either individually or collectively, and
in view of the significance of amount of advances
and investments in the financial statements and
given its significance to the overall audit due to
stakeholder and regulatory focus, the classification
of the advances and investments and provisioning
thereon has been considered as Key Audit Matter.
Auditor’s Response
	Our 
key 
audit 
approach 
included 
assessing
the adequacy of design, implementation and
operating effectiveness of key internal controls
238
Financial Statements / Consolidated à
Celebrating
19
2024
Years of Trust
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
Independent Auditors’ Report (contd...)
and substantive audit procedures over approval, 
recording and monitoring of loans, assessing 
the reliability of documentation, measurement 
of provisions, identification of NPA accounts and 
valuation of security for NPA accounts along with 
basis and rationale for various other management 
information.
•
	As a process, we have read the Bank’s policies
for NPA identification and provisioning and
assessing compliance with the IRAC norms.
	•
	We have evaluated details on a test check basis
of exposures for identification of NPA and
calculation of provisions including valuation of
primary and collateral securities which involves
certain degree of management estimation.
•
	We have evaluated and understood the
Bank’s internal control systems to ensure
completeness, 
accuracy, 
and 
relevance
of data and to ensure that the same is in
compliance with the RBI guidelines, circulars
and directions on the Prudential Norms on
Income Recognition, Asset Classification and
Provisioning issued from time to time.
•
	We tested on a samples basis to ensure
completeness of documentation, adherence of
the approval process to the Bank’s Policy and
board minutes, credit review of customers,
review of Special Mention Accounts (SMA)
reports in the RBI’s Central Repository of
Information on Large Credits (CRILC) and
other related documents and reports including
evaluation of the past trends of management
judgement, governance, and review of internal
control. Held discussion with the management
of the Bank on various accounts wherein there
has been stress and the steps taken to mitigate
such risks.
•	
We have also assessed disclosure requirements 
for classification and provisioning of NPAs in
accordance with the RBI circulars including
those issued specifically issued for Covid 19
related matters.
B.
Information Technology - IT Systems and
Controls
Key Audit Matter
	The IT environment of the Bank is complex. The
Bank’s 
operations 
utilise 
many 
independent
and 
inter-dependent 
information 
technology
systems 
for 
processing 
and 
recording 
large
volume of transactions in numerous locations on
a daily basis. As a result, there is a high degree of
reliance and dependency on such IT systems for
financial reporting process of the Bank. Controls
over access and changes to IT systems are critical
to the recording of financial information and
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Appropriate automated general and 
application controls are required to ensure that 
such IT systems and applications are able to process 
the data, as required, completely, accurately and 
consistently, which directly impact the completeness 
and accuracy of financial reporting.
	The IT systems and controls is identified as a key 
audit matter because of high level of automation, 
significant number of systems being used and 
complexity of the IT infrastructure and its impact 
on the financial reporting system since our audit 
approach could significantly differ depending on the 
effective operation of the Bank’s IT controls.
Auditor’s Response
	We tested the technology control environment for 
key IT applications (systems) used in processing 
significant transactions and recording balances in 
the general ledger. We also tested key automated 
controls embedded within these systems which link 
the technology-enabled business processes. Our 
further audit procedures included:
•
	Assessing the governance and higher-level
controls across the IT Environment and
performing review of IT general controls.
•
	Evaluation and understanding the key IT
systems being used by the Bank for its Core
Banking and other operations.
•
	Assessing 
operative 
effectiveness 
of 
key
controls within various business processes.
It included testing of integrity of system
interfaces, completeness and accuracy of
the data, system reconciliation controls and
automated calculations.
•
	Design and operating effectiveness testing of
controls across the User Access Management,
Change 
Management, 
backup, 
other 
IT
operational control as well as effectiveness
testing of automated business process controls.
•
	Data integrity of critical system reports used by
us in our audit to select samples and analyse
data used by management to generate financial
reports.
C.
Direct and Indirect Taxes
Key Audit Matter
	This matter has been identified as a Key Audit
Matter due to the significant level of management
judgment required in the estimation of provision for
taxes including any write back of provisions, due to
factors like uncertain tax positions and provision for
tax involves interpretation of various rules and law.
It also involves consideration of on-going disputes
and disclosures.
239
Financial Statements / Consolidated à
Celebrating
19
2024
Years of Trust
 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
Auditor’s Response
•
	Our audit procedures to test uncertain tax
positions included understanding processes,
evaluation 
of 
adequacy 
of 
design 
and
implementation of controls and testing of
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
controls 
over
provision for taxation, assessment of uncertain
tax positions and disclosure of contingencies.
•
	We have obtained details of completed
tax assessments and demands from the
management of the Bank.
•
	We 
discussed 
with 
appropriate 
senior
management 
personnel, 
independently 
assessed 
management’s 
estimate 
of 
the
possible outcome of disputed cases; and
evaluated the management’s underlying key
assumptions in estimating the tax provisions.
•
	We considered legal precedence and other
rulings in evaluating management’s position
on these uncertain tax positions, the provisions
made, and/or write back of the provisions.
•
	We have also relied upon the opinion given
by tax specialist in evaluating management’s
assessment for the uncertain tax positions. For
those matters where management concluded
that no provision should be recorded, we also
considered the adequacy and completeness of
disclosures.
D.
Centralised Audit of the Bank
Key Audit Matter
	Till year 2020-21, the audit of Branches (other
than top 20 branches and certain other locations)
was carried out by the Branch Statutory Auditors
appointed by the Bank. However, since previous
year, the Joint Statutory Auditors have performed
the audit of the Bank centrally. Considering this fact,
it has been considered as a key audit matter.
Auditor’s Response
•
	We have assessed the Bank’s systems and
procedures 
for 
carrying 
out 
centralized
operations under various areas including
process of consolidation at the central level.
•
	Visited certain branches to understand the
operations carried out at Branches and
potential issues.
•
	Performed analysis of information provided at
central level.
•
	Reviewed the reports in respect of various
audits including concurrent audit, internal
inspections carried out at branches on a sample 
basis.
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon
The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises 
the Corporate Overview, Directors’ Report including 
annexures to Directors’ Report, Management Discussion 
and Analysis, Basel III – Pillar 3 disclosures and Corporate 
Governance report included in the Annual Report, but 
does not include the Standalone and Consolidated 
Financial Statements and our auditors’ reports thereon. 
The other information is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above when it becomes available 
and, in doing so, consider whether such other information 
is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial 
Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the other information, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged 
with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for the 
preparation and presentation of these Consolidated 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the 
consolidated financial position, consolidated financial 
performance and consolidated cash flows of the Bank 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with 
Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 in so far 
as they apply to the Bank and provisions of Section 29 
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars and 
guidelines issued by the RBI from time to time. Further, 
in terms of the Act, the respective Board of Directors of 
the companies in the Group covered under the Act, are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
and the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 for safeguarding 
of the assets of the Group and of its subsidiary and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
Independent Auditors’ Report (contd...)
240
Financial Statements / Consolidated à
Celebrating

Years of Trust
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. These financial statements have been 
used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements by the management and Directors 
of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 
respective Management and the Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the Group are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless Board of Directors either intends to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of each Company.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under
Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible
for expressing our opinion on the internal financial
controls system with reference to Consolidated
Financial Statements in place and the operating
effectiveness of such controls.
•
	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements made by Management.
•
	Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s
use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether
a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our Auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the bank to cease to continue
as a going concern.
•
	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and
content of the Consolidated Financial Statements,
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the
Consolidated Financial Statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•
	Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence
regarding the financial information of such entities
or business activities within the Group to express an
opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the audit of the financial
information of the Bank. For the other entities
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,
which have been audited by other auditors, such
other auditors remain responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the audits carried
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our
audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are
further described in ‘Other Matters’ in this Audit
report.
Materiality in the magnitude of the misstatements in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually 
or aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning of the scope of our audit work and 
evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the 
effect of any identified misstatement in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
Independent Auditors’ Report (contd...)
241

Years of Trust
 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our Auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
We did not audit the financial statements of the subsidiary, 
KBL Services Limited, included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, whose financial statements reflect 
Group’s share of total assets of Rs.10,130 thousand as 
at March 31, 2023, Group’s share of total revenue of 
Rs. 41,132 thousand and Group’s share of total net loss 
after tax of Rs.5,608 thousand for the year ended March 31, 
2023, respectively. These financial statements have been 
audited by another auditor whose Independent Auditor’s 
Report has been furnished to us by the Management, 
and our opinion on these financial statements, in so far 
as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in 
respect of this subsidiary, is based solely on report of 
such auditor and the procedures performed by us as 
stated in paragraph above.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statement 
is not modified in respect of the above matters with 
respect to our reliance on the work done and the report 
of the other auditor on the said financial statements of 
the subsidiary.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
1.
	The 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheet 
and 
the
Consolidated Profit and Loss Account have been
drawn up in accordance with Section 29 of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Accounting
Standards as per section 133 of the Act read with
the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021.
2.
	As required by section 197(16) of the Act in
relation to managerial remuneration, based on
the information and explanations given to us, and
on the consideration of the reports of the other
auditors, referred to in the Other Matters section
above, on separate financial statements of the
subsidiary, we report that, the subsidiary covered
under the Act has not paid any remuneration to its
directors during the year. Hence, reporting under
the provisions of section 197 read with Schedule V to 
the Act is not applicable for the current year. Further, 
since the Holding Company is a banking company, 
as defined under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; 
the reporting under section 197(16) in relation to 
whether the remuneration paid by the Bank is in 
accordance with the provisions of section 197 of the 
Act and whether any excess remuneration has been 
paid in accordance with the aforesaid section is not 
applicable.
3.
	As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on
our audit and on the consideration of the reports of
the other auditors on separate financial statements
and other financial information of the subsidiary, we
report, to the extent applicable, that:
(a)
	We 
have 
sought 
and 
obtained 
all 
the
information and explanations which to the best
of our knowledge and belief were necessary
for the purpose of our audit of the aforesaid
Consolidated Financial Statements.
(b)
	In our opinion, proper books of account as
required by law, relating to the presentation of
the aforesaid consolidated financial statements
have been kept so far as it appears from our
examination of those books and reports of the
other auditors.
(c)
	The Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated
Profit and Loss Account and the Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement dealt with by this Report
are in agreement with the books of account.
(d)
	In our opinion, the aforesaid Consolidated
Financial 
Statements 
comply 
with 
the
Accounting Standards specified under section
133 of the Act read with the Companies
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 to the
extent they are not inconsistent with the
policies prescribed by the RBI.
(e)
	On the basis of the written representations
received from the directors of the Holding
Company as on March 31, 2023 and taken on
record by the Board of Directors of the Holding
Company and the reports of statutory auditors

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 3 (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report 
of even date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Karnataka Bank Limited for the year ended March 
31, 2023)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of The 
Karnataka Bank Limited (“the Bank”) and its subsidiary 
company, as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our 
audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Group for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Bank and its 
subsidiary company are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements criteria established by the respective 
companies considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Bank and its subsidiary 
company, based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 
“Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI and deemed to be 
prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference 
to 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal financial controls based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors, 
in terms of their reports referred to in the Other 
Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements may become 
244

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based on 
the consideration of the reports of the other auditors 
referred to in the Other Matter paragraph below, the 
Bank and its subsidiary company have, in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements were operating effectively as at 
March 31, 2023, based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
criteria established by the respective companies 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the “Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting” issued by the ICAI.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid report under section 143(3)(i) of the Act 
on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements in so far as it relates to a subsidiary 
company is based solely on the report of the auditors of 
such company. Our opinion is not modified in respect of 
this matter with respect to our reliance on the work done 
and the report of the other auditors.

over the remaining maturity period of the security on a straight-line basis. Provision is recognised for diminution 
other than temporary in the value of such investments for each investment individually.
Non-performing investments are identified and provision is recognised as per the RBI guidelines.
Held for Trading and Available for Sale categories:
	Investments classified under HFT and AFS are marked to market as per the RBI guidelines. These securities 
are valued scrip-wise and any resultant depreciation or appreciation is aggregated for each category. The net 
depreciation for each category within each group is provided for, whereas the net appreciation for each category 
is ignored. The book value of individual securities is not changed consequent to periodic valuation of investments.
	Traded investments are valued based on the trades / quotes from the recognised stock exchanges, prices 
declared by Primary Dealers Association of India (‘PDAI’) jointly with Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (‘FIMMDA’)/Financial Benchmark India Private Limited (‘FBIL’), periodically.
	The market value of unquoted government securities which qualify for determining the Statutory Liquidity Ratio 
(‘SLR’) included in the AFS and HFT categories is computed as per the Yield-to-Maturity (‘YTM’) rates published by 
FIMMDA/FBIL.
	The valuation of other unquoted fixed income securities (viz. State government securities, Other approved 
securities, Bonds and debentures, Pass through Certificates) wherever linked to the YTM rates, is computed 
with a mark-up (reflecting associated credit and liquidity risk) over the YTM rates for government securities with 
similar maturity, published by FIMMDA/FBIL. Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up value, if the 
latest Balance Sheet is available or at ` 1 as per the RBI guidelines. Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest 
repurchase price / net asset value declared by the mutual fund. Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate 
of deposits, being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost.
	In the event provisions recognised on account of depreciation in the AFS or HFT categories are found to be 
in excess of the required amount in any year, such excess is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and 
subsequently appropriated, from profit available for appropriation, if any, to Investment Reserve Account in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines after adjusting for income tax and appropriation to Statutory Reserve.
2.5 Security Receipts (SR):
	Where sale of stressed asset results in a consideration lower than the value of the stressed assets net of provisions 
carried there against, the shortfall is debited to Profit & Loss account. Where such sale results in consideration 
higher than the value of the stressed assets net of provisions carried there against, the excess is netted off 
against the cost of corresponding SRs to arrive at their Book Value.
	SRs issued by Asset Reconstruction Companies (‘ARC’) are valued at Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) declared by the ARC 
except in respect of stressed assets which are sold on or after Apr 1, 2018 and the Bank holds more than 90% 
of SRs backed by its sold assets, the provision held against the Book Value of these SRs is higher of provision 
required in terms of NAV declared by the ARC and provisioning applicable to the underlying loans, assuming that 
the assets sold notionally continued in the books of the Bank.
2.6 Disposal of Investments:
	Profit/Loss on sale of investment under the aforesaid three categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account. In accordance with the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India, Profit on sale of investments 
in the Held to Maturity (HTM) category is appropriated to Capital Reserve, net of applicable taxes and amount 
required to be transferred to Statutory Reserve. The discount if any, on acquisition of investments in

b.
on zero-coupon securities, it is accounted for over the balance tenor of the security on a constant yield basis.
2.7 Repo and reverse repo transactions:
	Repo and reverse repo transactions are accounted for as secured borrowing/ lending transactions respectively. 
Borrowing cost on repo transactions is treated as interest expense and income on reverse repo transactions is 
treated as interest income.
2.8  Short Sale
	In accordance with the RBI guidelines, the Parent Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central Government 
dated securities. The short positions are reflected in ‘Securities Short Sold (‘SSS’) A/c’, specifically created for 
this purpose. Such short positions are categorised under HFT category and netted off from investments in the 
Balance Sheet. These positions are marked-to-market along with the other securities under HFT portfolio and 
the resultant mark-to-market gains/losses are accounted for as per the relevant RBI guidelines for valuation of 
investments discussed earlier.
2.9 Non Performing Investments
a.
Interest/ instalment (including maturity proceeds) is due and remains unpaid for more than 90 days.
b.
	In the case of equity shares, in the event the investment in shares of any company is valued at Re. 1 per
company on account of non-availability of the latest balance sheet, those equity shares would be reckoned
as NPI.
c.
	The Parent Bank also classifies an investment as a non-performing investment in case any credit facility
availed by the same borrower/entity has been classified as a non-performing asset and vice versa. The
above is applied to Preference Shares where the fixed dividend is not paid.
d.
	The investments in debentures/ bonds, which are deemed to be advance, are also subjected to NPI norms
as applicable to investments.
3.
DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
	Derivative contracts are designated as hedging or trading and accounted in accordance with Reserve Bank of
India’s guidelines.
	Derivative deals for trading are marked to market and net depreciation is recognised while net appreciation is
ignored.
	Derivatives used for hedging are marked to market in cases where the underlying assets/ liabilities are marked
to market and income /expenditure is accounted on accrual basis.
4.
ADVANCES
4.1 Classification
a)
	Advances are classified into (a) Standard; (b) Sub-Standard; (c) Doubtful; and (d) Loss assets, in accordance

interest and claims received from Guarantee corporations. etc. Advances are net of bills rediscounted, Inter-
bank participation with risk, provisions for non- performing advances, floating provisions, unrealised fees
and unrealised interest held in suspense account. Credit facility/investment are classified as performing and

current marked to market values of foreign exchange forward contracts, at levels stipulated by the RBI from time 
to time. These provisions on Standard Assets are included under Other Liabilities.
	The Bank estimates the inherent risk of the unhedged foreign currency exposures of its borrowers as per the 
regulatory guidelines stipulated by the RBI from time to time and recognises incremental provisions on exposures 
to such entities as per methodology prescribed. These provisions are included in Provision for Standard Assets 
and reported under Other Liabilities.
	In case of financial assets sold to Securitisation/Reconstruction Company, if the sale is for the price higher than 
the net book value, excess provision held is not reversed but retained till redemption of the security receipt, 
wherever applicable. If the sale is at a price below the net book value (NBV), the shortfall is debited to the Profit 
and Loss account, as per the RBI Guidelines.
5.
FIXED ASSETS
	Fixed assets are stated at historical cost (except premises revalued based on values determined by the approved
valuers) less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost includes incidental expenditure incurred on
the assets before they are ready for intended use and Taxes and duties to the extent not eligible for input credits
if any. Profit on sale of immovable properties are transfered to the Capital Reserves after adjusting for income
tax and appropriation to Statutory Reserve.
Computer Software is capitalised along with computer hardware and included under other fixed assets.
6.
REVALUATION OF FIXED ASSETS
	Portfolio of immovable properties is revalued periodically by an independent valuer to reflect current market
valuation. All land and building owned by the Bank and used as branches or offices are grouped under “Land
and Building” in the fixed assets category. Appreciation, if any, on revaluation is credited to Revaluation Reserve
under Capital Reserves. Additional Depreciation on the revalued asset is charged to the Profit and Loss Account
and appropriated from the Revaluation Reserves to Profit and Loss Account i.e. revenue reserves.
7.
DEPRECIATION
	Depreciation on fixed assets (including revalued portion thereon) is provided following Straight Line Method
(SLM) as per the useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, except in respect of computers
(including software) where depreciation is provided at a flat rate of 33.33 % as per the RBI guidelines.
	Where during any financial year, addition has been made to any asset or where any asset has been sold,
discarded, demolished or destroyed, the depreciation on such asset is calculated on pro rata basis from the date
of such addition or as the case maybe, up to the date on which such asset has been sold, discarded, demolished
or destroyed.
	Premium paid on leasehold properties is charged off over the lease period. Depreciation on leased assets is
calculated so as to spread the depreciable amount over the primary lease period.
8.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
	The carrying amount of assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date if there is any indication of impairment
based on internal/external factors. In case of indicators of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised wherever 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the
asset’s net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and risks specific to the asset. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount
of the asset over remaining useful life.
9.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
9.1 Initial Recognition
	Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the reporting currency by applying to the foreign currency amount

and loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss account, as per the guidelines issued by RBI.
9.3 Exchange Differences
	Exchange difference arising on settlement of monetary items is recognised as income or as expense in the year 
in which it arises. Non-monetary items which are carried in terms of historical cost denominated in a foreign 
currency are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items which 
are carried at fair value or other similar valuations denominated in a foreign currency are reported using the 
exchange rates that existed when the values were determined.
	Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading that are entered into to establish the amount 
of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of transactions, which are outstanding at 
the Balance Sheet date are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. The premium or discount arising at the 
inception of such a forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract.
9.4	 Outstanding forward exchange contracts are revalued at the Balance Sheet date at the rates notified by FEDAI 
and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. The resultant gain/loss on revaluation is recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account in accordance with the RBI/FEDAI guidelines.
9.5	 Forward exchange contracts and other derivative contracts which have overdue receivables remaining unpaid 
over 90 days or more are classified as non-performing assets and provided for as per the extant master circular 
on Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning issued by the RBI.

	RBI vide its clarification dated 30th August, 2021, circular reference no. RBI/2021-22/95 DOR.GOV.
REC.44/29.67.001/2021-22 on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/ Chief Executive Officers/
Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, advised Banks that fair value of share-linked instruments on the
date of grant should be recognised as an expense for all instruments. For options granted after March 31, 2021,

equity shareholders using the weighted average number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares
outstanding at the year end.

be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961, rules framed thereunder and after
due consideration of the judicial pronouncement and legal opinions.
	Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of current year timing differences between taxable income and
accounting income for the year and reversal of timing differences of earlier years. Deferred tax is measured

deferred tax assets / liabilities on account of changes in enacted tax rates are given effect to in the Profit and Loss
Account in the period of change.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for future tax consequences of timing differences between the
carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss carry forwards.
	Deferred tax is recognized subject to consideration of prudence on timing difference being the difference
between taxable income and accounting income that originate in one period and are capable of reversal in one
or more subsequent period. In the event of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward losses and items relating 
to capital losses, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that there is virtual certainty supported
by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable income will be available to realize such assets. In other
situations, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient
future taxable income will be available to realize these assets.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if such items relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing
tax laws and the Company has a legally enforceable right for such set off.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and appropriately adjusted.
15. PROVISIONS, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS
	A provision is recognised when there is an obligation as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made.
Provisions are not discounted to their present value and are determined based on the best estimate required to
settle the obligation as at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to
reflect the current best estimates.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
	A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the
Parent Bank or a present obligation that arises from past events that is not recognized because it is not probable
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the
obligation cannot be made. The Parent Bank does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence
in the financial statements.
