Statement by director responsible for 
the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement 
of this disclosure) 
During the last several years, the world has witnessed history quickly unfold as we live through significant complexity 
and uncertainty. Many of the persistent challenges that humanity has faced during this period require continued attention, 
including combating climate change, preserving natural resources, fighting COVID-19, and narrowing the digital divide. 
We are all learning to live with the new reality created by these challenges that continue to cause broader concerns about 
peace and prosperity for all. In order to overcome the challenges being faced, society needs to find new and innovative 
ways to carry out its activities and meet its requirements. This will be the collective effort of all the elements of society 
be it the people, Government, businesses, social sector, etc. Therefore, business enterprises need to carry out their 
business in a more responsible manner by inculcating practices which are environment friendly and oriented towards the 
welfare of society. In the long run, the entities which will imbibe the best ESG principles in their businesses will survive 
and will be successful, as they will be considered more credible and reliable. Resilience allows us to navigate through 
tough times and seize the moment. It is what has helped our company to cope with and emerge stronger from major 
international economic and geopolitical crises. Our total energy consumption fell by almost 7% in 2023, which is due to 
our implementation of energy efficiency measures. Under Company’s CSR initiatives, it has done a lot of work for the 
benefit of society, particularly in the field of education and health for the underprivileged.  It is common knowledge that 
the last decade marked the onset of ESG-related regulations and in the next decade, ESG will take center stage. With this 
clear understanding, CONCOR has been planning its actions focussed on creating value for its stakeholders by giving 
emphasis on protecting the environment, community development, taking care of the health, safety, and wellbeing of its 
employees, and creating a strong framework of governance.

We aim to create value for all our stakeholders. We engage with key stakeholder groups to 
understand their perspectives and cater to their needs. These ongoing engagements help us identify 
and monitor key economic, environmental, and social trends that can be incorporated into our 
overall business strategy. At CONCOR, the stakeholder engagement mechanism is a key driving 
force towards strengthening and diversifying the stakeholder relationship, which further facilitates 
the identification of key material issues impacting the Company’s growth. The stakeholder 
engagement led to the prioritization of material issues, mapping of the risks relevant to each 
material topic, and development of consequent risk mitigation steps. The primary outcome of the 
stakeholder engagement exercise resulted in the identification and prioritization of material issues 
relevant to environmental, social, governance, and economic aspects. The identified material 
issues were presented to the highest governing member and the Board for their feedback and 
guidance on strategizing the sustainable growth model of the Company. As part of the Company’s 
efforts to continually engage with internal and external stakeholder groups for the identification 
of key material issues impacting them, the stakeholder engagement exercise undergoes periodic 
review.
