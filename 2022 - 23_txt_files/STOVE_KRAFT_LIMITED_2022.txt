PRINCIPLE 3: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT AND PROMOTE THE WELL-BEING OF ALL 
EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THOSE IN THEIR VALUE CHAINS
A)	 ESSENTIAL INDICATORS:
	
Our ability to create goods and fulfil client requests depends on our workers. So, the wellbeing of our 
workers is our top priority. Employee well-being includes their physical, emotional, and mental health as 
well as their employment security, equitable pay, and other perks that foster a productive workplace.
	
First and foremost, we make sure that the workers are in a secure and wholesome atmosphere. This entails 
supplying suitable safety gear, carrying out regular safety inspections, and taking care of any potential 
dangers that might emerge. In addition to being crucial for workers’ health, creating a secure workplace 
can help avoid mishaps and lower the likelihood that the business will face legal action.
	
Secondly, we offer our workers fair wages, perks, and room for advancement. For workers to feel valued 
and encouraged to give their best work, fair compensation is crucial. Consequently, by prioritizing the 
well-being of all workers and employees is a key to the success of the company.

understand the importance of providing multiple channels for workers

A) 	 ESSENTIAL INDICATORS:
1.	
Identification of stakeholders group: 
Describe 
the 
processes 
for 
identifying key stakeholder groups 
of the entity
We at Stove Kraft have a systematic process of identifying individuals or groups 
that have a vested interest in the company’s products and activities. There’s a 
step-by-step process for identifying stakeholders of the company:
Determine the impact: Determine the impact that the product has on different 
groups of people, including customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders 
considering both the positive and negative impacts of the product.
Identify internal stakeholders: Identify internal stakeholders, such as employees, 
managers, and shareholders, who have a direct interest in the success of the 
product. This may include individuals who are involved in the design, development, 
production, marketing, and sale of the products.
Identify external stakeholders: Identify external stakeholders, such as customers, 
suppliers, regulators, and the local community, who have an indirect interest in 
the product. These stakeholders may be affected by the product in various ways, 
such as through employment opportunities, environmental impact, or regulatory 
compliance.
Prioritize stakeholders: Prioritize the stakeholders based on their level of interest 
and influence. Prioritizing stakeholders will help the company to focus its efforts 
on those stakeholders who are most critical to the success of the product.
Engage with stakeholders: Once stakeholders have been identified and prioritized, 
the company should engage with them to understand their needs, concerns, and 
expectations. This may involve conducting surveys, hosting focus groups, or 
meeting with stakeholders individually.
Monitor stakeholder feedback: Once the company has engaged with stakeholders, 
it should monitor their feedback to ensure that it is meeting their needs and 
expectations. This feedback can be used to inform future product development 
and marketing efforts.

To address grievances related to human rights issues, we have established several internal mechanisms. Firstly, there

they may have regarding human rights, with the assurance that their identity will be protected. Complaints are then 
investigated by the focal point, along with the HR manager, and any necessary remedial action is taken to address the 
issue.
Secondly, the company has formulated and adopted a Vigil Mechanism/Whistle Blower Policy for its employees and 
workers and vendors. The policy aims to encourage the reporting of significant deviations from key management 
policies, as well as any non-compliance and wrong practices such as unethical behaviour, fraud, violations of law, or 
inappropriate conduct. The policy also provides for direct access to the Chairman/Managing Director/Chairman of the 
Audit Committee in exceptional cases. This policy aims to promote a culture of transparency, accountability, and ethical 
conduct within the organization, and to ensure that any instances of wrongdoing are promptly addressed and resolved.
