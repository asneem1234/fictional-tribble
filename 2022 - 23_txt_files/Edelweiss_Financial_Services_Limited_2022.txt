We are continually energised by the actions of the

possibilities. Delivering on our quarterly objectives

Drawing inspiration from ancient architecture, we 
discover wisdom in the theme of the bifocal vision 
concept, where form and function, aesthetics and 
utility, art and science, tradition and modernity have 
converged to create marvels that have withstood the 
test of time, over centuries.
At Edelweiss, we embrace a bifocal 
vision that allows us to focus on 
our current goals while never losing 
sight of our future aspirations.

In the ancient city of Bodh Gaya, India, stands the magnificent Mahabodhi Temple, an embodiment 
of faith and devotion. The Bodhi tree, under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment, is the 
highlight of the temple, drawing thousands of devotees every year to seek spiritual guidance and 
enlightenment. The temple’s design embodies a bifocal approach with the Bodhi tree representing 
the physical world and the stupa symbolising the spiritual world. This iconic temple stands as a 
symbol of the harmony between man and nature, where spirituality and physicality intertwine. Its 
spiritual significance and architectural grandeur make it a true marvel and a testament to the rich 
cultural heritage of India.

Built on an island in the Arabian Sea, the Sindhudurg fort is a result of the vision of Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Maharaj and stands as a testament to the will and tenacity of the Maratha empire. It was 
designed to deter enemies and keep the people of the region safe, even in the most difficult times. 
Remarkably, the fort has endured the test of time for over 400 years, with its foundation still as strong 
as ever. This was achieved through the innovative use of materials, involving transporting thousands 
of tonnes of lead to the middle of the sea for use in the fort’s foundation. Today, the Sindhudurg 
island-fort is not just a physical structure, but a symbol of the courage, perseverance, and strength 
that the people of India possess. It reminds us of the power of determination and the ability to 
overcome the toughest challenges.

Rising majestically from the golden sands of Konark in Odisha, the 13th-century Konark Sun Temple 
is an example of India’s rich cultural heritage and architectural prowess. What makes this temple 
truly remarkable is its unique design, which is built in the shape of a chariot, with twelve pairs of 
intricately-carved wheels - a marvel of engineering and art. These wheels not only serve a decorative 
purpose but also function as sundials, accurately measuring time to the minute, both day and night. 
The Sun Temple is not only a place of worship dedicated to the Sun God, but is a perfect example of 
how religion and science can coexist.

The Ajanta and Ellora Caves are a true embodiment of India’s rich heritage, showcasing the country’s 
multifaceted nature. These caves are more than just historical structures and stand as a testament to the 
cultural, social, and religious significance of India while offering a unique insight into the country’s past. 
The Ajanta Caves’ arts offer a glimpse into the past through a variety of lenses, including gender studies, 
history, sociology, and anthropology. The art showcases the lifestyle of both the elite and common man, 
illuminating the lives of people in India around the mid-1st millennium CE. In contrast, the Ellora 
Caves are a set of 34 rock-cut Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu temples and monasteries that were constructed 
between 350 and 700 AD. The caves provide a contrast and perspective between the austere and ascetic 
life of monks and the opulent and luxurious lifestyle of the royalty and the rich. This contrast highlights 
the fusion of varying needs in the social strata, and the interplay between the spiritual and the social.

Rani Ki Vav in Patan, Gujarat is a 900-year-old UNESCO world heritage site that exemplifies the 
ingenuity of ancient Indian architecture. The temple’s seven levels of stairs feature beautiful 
mythological and religious carvings, but it’s the water storage tank on the fourth level that sets it 
apart.  Queen Udaymati’s brilliant solution to address the water scarcity in the region, ensured that 
people could access water during their visit to the temple, and the tank’s four-level depth prevented 
it from drying up quickly in the summer. Rani Ki Vav is a stunning example of a structure that 
combines both form and function.

Amidst the hustle and bustle of Jaipur city, stands a palace that is a testament to the grandeur and creativity of 
the Rajput architecture - the Hawa Mahal. Ingeniously designed to provide a comfortable space for the women 
of the royal family to observe the festivities of the city without compromising their privacy, what sets the Hawa 
Mahal apart is its unique honeycomb design, consisting of 953 small windows or jharokhas that create a natural 
air-conditioning system. The tallest building in the world constructed without a foundation, its curved structure 
leans at an 87-degree angle and has a pyramidal shape, which has helped it withstand the test of time for over 
two centuries. The Hawa Mahal is not just a palace, it is a masterpiece that showcases the original creativity and 
precise engineering of the Rajput architecture.

One of our key focus for the year was toUHGXFHRXUZKROHVDOHDVVHWV. This year, we achieved a ~40% reduction in our ECLF 
wholesale assets to `5,700 crores. Although we exceeded the planned target, we feel there is scope to further increase the pace. We 
have been evaluating newer strategies to this end and will see them playing out going ahead. We are targeting to take this down to 
`3,000 crores, i.e., a ~50% reduction hereon, by FY24.
Along with reduction of wholesale credit, scaling our retail credit businesses is a priority. Our retail credit franchise focusses on 
MSME & Mortgages and is designed to be inherently asset-light. We are in the process of stabilising co-lending partnerships and 
emphasising the generation of a high-quality loan book. Although progress has been slower than anticipated, we remain committed 
to this strategic priority.

crisis nor is it the last. The world has the innate ability to emerge stronger, like we saw in the case of the pandemic as well. Hence, 
what’s important is to view the current situation not only from a lens “short-term immediate impact” but extend the horizon and 
see “long-term eventual outcome view”.

issues that led to it. A bifocal view can ensure sustainable growth by avoiding excess emphasis on short-term gains that may lead to 
long-term instability.
The global economy is no stranger to volatility, uncertainty, and fear. Throughout history, we have witnessed cycles of prosperity 
and crisis, with each downturn paving the way for a stronger rebound. Notable instances like the crises of 1991, 1997, 2008, and 2020 
underscore this phenomenon.

Elliott (1871–1948). According to this theory, the market moves in repetitive patterns called waves, where a peak is followed by a 
trough, and this cycle repeats itself. Drawing a parallel to economic movements, it is observed that the economic scenario also 
seems to move in a similar wave-like pattern, oscillating between periods of prosperity and crisis. Just as in technical analysis, where 
analysts look at the long-term trend of the market and understand that the cycles lead to a long-term trend. In life as well, it is 
crucial to keep our long-term trend and trajectory upwards and not be deterred by short-term gyrations. With this understanding, 
every trough or downturn can be viewed as an opportunity rather than a setback.

However, this approach requires an important mindset shift, of not letting ownership get in the way of business growth or its need 
for further capital. This approach required a singular focus on continuous and ongoing value creation. The most recent example 
of how we’ve practised this philosophy was in the value unlock of Nuvama Wealth Management, which we have spoken at length 
in the past year and even earlier in the letter. We also exercised a similar outcome in our Insurance Broking business where we

In all of India’s progress, the one achievement that has my heart is the democratisation of entrepreneurship that we have seen in the 
recent years. As an entrepreneur, it gives me immense joy to see the burning entrepreneurial spirit in more Indians, specially beyond 
the metros. ~50% of all recognised start-ups in India are from tier II and tier III cities. It’s a matter of great pride that once seen 
as the remote rural part of the country, is now becoming a hotbed for disruption. India’s odyssey is a long one, augmented by its 
young demographics – India is amongst the only few large economies with more than 65% of its population in the working age. 
India is on track to become the 3rd largest economy by 2030. India has truly entered its golden age of compounding and has 4 key 
factors working in its favour – its VLJQLÀFDQWVL]H, a digital push, democratised entrepreneurship, and GHPRJUDSKLFGLYLGHQG

are far simpler – our entity count has reduced by 30% from our peak of 2016 and is now at 24 entities. Our balance sheet remains 
robust with comfortable liquidity and well-capitalised businesses.

THE COLLABORATORS FOR TRANSFORMING EDUCATION
In 2016, EdelGive launched The 
Collaborators for Transforming Education 
(CTE)as a public-private partnership with 
the Department of School Education and 
Sports (DSES), Government of Maharashtra, 
and facilitated by the EdelGive Foundation. 
Through this coalition, EdelGive intends to 
solve the multifaceted problems of 
education by bringing reforms at a systemic 
level to elevate learning. Initially, the 
programme that started with 4 districts in 
Maharashtra, was expanded to 7 districts, 
with multiple funders and three non-

occasions. For example, EdelGive best practices are shared with the central government   and within and outside the states as also 
with UNICEF and the World Bank. The Government of Maharashtra has signed an extended MoU with EdelGive Foundation up to 
2026 with the provision to expand the programme across Maharashtra.

Driven by its conviction in the systems thinking 
approach that the sum is greater than its 
parts—EdelGive launched The Coalition for 
Women’s Empowerment (CWE)in 2019, by 
bringing together funding organisations and 
grassroots organisations as collaborative 
stakeholders, united by a common mission to 
facilitate social and economic empowerment of 
women and girls in India. The coalition is 
currently supported by Ford Foundation, Chintu 
Gudiya Foundation, Forbes Marshall and David 
and Lacile Packard Foundation. The coalition 
focuses on providing 360-degree support to 
grassroots organisations through enabling 
funding for critical rights-based programmes 
that are often under-invested, and by investing 
additionally in institution building for improved

empowerment including the UdyamStree 
campaign for promoting entrepreneurship by 
women in India.

besides selecting 25 NGOs for organisational development. 
The organisational development (OD) facilitates quarterly 
discussions and tracks NGO’s growth in their respective OD 
journey. Through organisational development, the GROW team 
conducts one on one mentoring sessions with NGOs to 
understand its challenges and accordingly develops a 
respective capacity building matrix. Additionally, a website audit 
was conducted for NGOs to guide and support them to 
enhance website performance by transforming it from a source 
of information to being an optimal marketing tool. The capacity 
building initiatives have noted considerable results in the 
domain of fund raising and communication. 
The programme partnered with agencies like Social Lens,

entrepreneurship as a key driver for women’s economic empowerment in India. 
Committed to bridge the economic gender gap through collective action and 
engagement across stakeholder groups, UdyamStree works towards creating a 
conducive environment for women entrepreneurs in India to prosper. It works 
to strengthen the ecosystem and support women’s entrepreneurship, increase 
stakeholder participation in the promotion of women entrepreneurship, and 
raise awareness on the need for women’s entrepreneurship. The campaign was 
implemented to unlock the prospects of entrepreneurship and sustainable 
livelihood among women while attempting to engage with the corporate 
sector, bureaucracy and government infrastructure for a systemic facilitation.

Management Discussion & Analysis 
India's growing prominence as a formidable player in the 
global economy is becoming evident as the search for new 
leadership unfolds in the global arena. 
With its visionary foreign policy and unwavering dedication 
to aiding nations facing crises, India has established itself as a 
trusted and highly regarded global partner. By making use of 
its thriving tech industry, favourable demographic factors, and 
proactive strategies to attract foreign investment, India has 
embraced the opportunity and displayed its competence to 
thrive on the global stage. 
Assuming the presidency of the G20 in 2023, India seized a 
unique opportunity to strengthen its position in the global

independent foreign policy fuelled by its economic prowess. 
This platform is expected to bolster relationships, forge new 
partnerships, and contribute to the international community, 
as India sets forth an ambitious, people-centric agenda to 
tackle global challenges and foster sustainable economic 
development, ultimately paving the way for its prominent role 
in the global economy.

by an impressive 5.9% in 2023 (Source: IMF, April 2023 World 
Economic Outlook). India has been designated as a pivotal 
player in the global economic recovery and the expectation 
is for India and China to contribute around half of the 
global growth this year. This recognition underscores India's

potential to drive and shape the process of global recovery.
Several factors have contributed to the stable growth of the 
Indian economy, including sustained government capital 
expenditure, deleveraging of the corporate sector, lower 
non-performing assets in the banking sector, and moderation 
in commodity prices. Furthermore, high-frequency indicators

countries at a competitive rate.
The Union Budget 2023-24 sketched the roadmap to Amrit 
Kaal, or India@100 and outlined the action agenda for fuelling 
India’s growth story and catapulting it into a developed nation 
by 2047. There was a paradigm shift in overall macroeconomic 
priorities, transitioning from COVID-19 recovery to scaling 
new heights. The thrust of the Budget was on infrastructure 
development through higher capital expenditure, which stood 
at `10 lakh crore (up 33% from the previous year), laying 
the foundation for achieving the ambition of a $5 trillion 
economy by 2026 and improving prosperity for the populace. 
Strong infrastructure has always been a cornerstone of any 
developed economy, and this increased spending will provide 
great impetus to other critical areas such as education and 
skill development, urban development, the green economy, 
job creation, and improving global competitiveness.
Recognising the higher logistics costs in India compared to 
global peers, the government has planned transportation 
infrastructure projects to address this issue. The Railways 
UHFHLYHGVLJQLÀFDQWIXQGLQJDQGH੔RUWVZHUHPDGHWR
revive coastal shipping and airports, as well as promote 
electric mobility. The Make in India agenda was supported 
through reductions in import duties and tax incentives. 
Urban infrastructure development was prioritised, and steps 
were taken towards a greener economy with a focus on 
energy transition and carbon neutrality. The government 
also emphasised the importance of skilled manpower and 
research and development, with the establishment of centres 
of excellence and skill development initiatives. Tax reforms 
aimed to simplify compliance and enhance the ease of 
doing business. The Budget underscored self-reliance, digital 
advancements, sustainable choices, and economic stability, 
all contributing to inclusive development and the goal of 
achieving a $7 trillion economy by 2030.

contributing to a moderation in overall economic growth.

Alternative assets funds are gaining popularity in India as investors seek diverse income-generating opportunities beyond traditional 
portfolios. These funds focus on assets like real estate, private equity, and hedge funds, deviating from conventional investments.

The focus on technology driving innovation continued with the regulator enabling a longer experimentation period for

Thus, the last year has been a period of robust growth and landmark changes for the non-life insurance industry paving the way 
for strong sustainable growth in the future. In the coming years, we will see a transition to a ‘Risk Based Capital’ regime along with 
adoption of the ‘IFRS’ accounting standards.

Going forward too, the life insurance sector in India is expected to grow at a healthy pace in the coming years. The growth of the 
sector is being driven by a number of factors, including a growing population, increasing awareness about the importance of life 
insurance, rising disposable incomes, and government initiatives.
The Indian life insurance sector is the second largest in the world in terms of the number of policies in force. The sector is 
dominated by public sector insurers, which account for over 60% of the market share. The private sector insurers are growing 
rapidly and are expected to account for a larger share of the market in the coming years.

committed bank credit lines of `100 crore. 
Over the years, we have demonstrated a strong track record of fund raising from both retail and institutional lenders. With 
the help of public issues and our retail borrowing programmes, we have increased the proportion of funding through retail 
sources from 34% to 42% in the past one year. 
On the asset side, we continue to focus on and reorient our balance sheet towards retail growth. As wholesale recoveries 
remain slightly slower than anticipated, we have optimised the tenor and focussed on medium to long-term borrowings. 
Long-term borrowings now stand at 59% of the total debt.
All these steps have ensured that we maintain a positive ALM gap across all time buckets.

Governance
At the core of everything we do is a strong commitment to governance, which encompasses not only compliance but also ethics 
and values. For us, governance means trust, legitimacy, accountability, competence, and respect for the law. We believe that these 
values are essential to building a culture of transparency, authenticity, and fairness that is critical to the success of our organisation.
Our Board plays a crucial role in ensuring that these high governance standards are upheld at every level of our organisation. 
Through its unwavering focus on ethics, integrity, transparency, and fairness, our Board has established a robust framework for 
conduct, behaviour, and process oversight.

The Company will endeavour to maintain the dividend

appropriately consider at that point in time. When the 
performance of the company coupled with the market 
conditions are conducive/ favourable, the Board may consider 
declaring interim dividends too. 
In order to conserve resources, the Board may consider 
recommending a lesser rate of dividend (as compared to 
the earlier years). The retained earnings of the company can
