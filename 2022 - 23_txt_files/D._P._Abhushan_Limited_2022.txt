Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
The Company has formulated a stakeholder engagement framework to enhance stakeholder 
identification, aiming to improve engagement effectiveness and uphold the company's reputation, trust-
building, and value creation for all stakeholders. The framework includes:
Two dimensions: The framework incorporates two crucial dimensions for stakeholder identification their 
interests and their level of influence. Considering both dimensions helps the organization identify 
stakeholders and determine appropriate modes and levels of engagement for each group.

responsibility they hold towards the organization, the attention they receive from the organization, and 
their level of influence over it.
By utilizing this stakeholder engagement framework and taking into account these criteria, the company 
can effectively identify key stakeholders essential to its success and develop tailored engagement 
strategies that align with their needs and interests. This approach is critical for maintaining positive
