Introduction of 
Carbon Border 
Adjustment 
Mechanism 
for exports 
in European 
Union
Opportunity and 
Risk
The transitional phase of Carbon 
Border Adjustment Mechanism of 
European Union (EU) begins on 
1st October 2023 covering some 
of the major sectors serviced 
by the Company.  There is a 
possibility of exports to EU 
getting affected to some extent. 
There is a possibility of some of 
the goods manufactured by the 
Company getting covered in the 
subsequent phases. 
The Company 
intends to adopt 
to the same by 
taking consistent 
measures to 
reduce carbon 
footprint of its 
operations.
Opportunity: Company can focus 
and reduce its carbon footprint and 
make positive contribution to the 
future generation.
Risk: If exports to EU of the 
Company’s customers are affected, 
there is a possibility of business to 
the Company from them reducing 
to some extent.
If the goods manufactured by the 
Company are covered under CBAM, 
based on the extant regulations/
formula, there is a possibility of the 
overall cost of import increasing for 
the Company’s customers in EU.
