1. 
Occupational Health 
and Safety 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Risk: Occupational health and safety practices, if not 
managed properly, can expose our employees to 
physical, ergonomic, and other risks while working 
with heavy machinery in its facilities.  
 
Opportunity: Promoting a safety-first culture and 
putting comprehensive health and safety programs,

being, leading to higher productivity.

Positive and Negative
2. 
Energy Management 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Risk: The Company has high energy consumption 
during the production process, which contributes to 
carbon emissions and exacerbates climate change. 
Inadequate energy management practices could lead 
to increased reliance on fossil fuels and hinder the 
transition to renewable energy sources.  
 
Opportunity: Energy management presents a unique 
opportunity and provides the company with a 
competitive edge. The energy-efficient technologies 
The Company is working on heat 
recovery 
systems 
to 
conserve 
significant quantities of waste heat 
generated from the heating furnaces 
of rolling mills, by reusing it back in 
the process. Installation of Solar 
panels, LEDs and natural lighting to 
manage energy efficiently 
Positive and Negative
projects can reduce operational costs, resulting in 
improved margins and enabling us to mitigate climate 
change impacts. 
Further, using non-renewable energy would help 
create access to cleaner and more energy efficient 
sources. 
3. 
Emissions 
Management 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Risk: Globally, greenhouse gas emissions continue to 
rise at a time when there is an urgent need to be 
rapidly declining. If GHG emissions continue to rise 
unabated, they can pose risks. 
 
Opportunity: Effectively controlling GHG emissions 
could create significant economic, environmental, and 
social benefits. It provides a responsible ecosystem 
and enhances company’s relationships with all its 
stakeholders. 
The 
Company 
recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
reducing 
GHG 
emission 
footprint 
and 
has 
implemented 
an 
emissions 
management program to achieve 
this. The 
program 
focuses on 
identifying emission hotspots and 
reducing GHG emissions through 
initiatives focused on optimal fuel 
usage and cleaner alternatives in the 
production 
process, 
wherever 
feasible. Furthermore, the company 
is 
constantly 
exploring 
new 
opportunities 
for 
preserving 
biodiversity through the innovative 
design of our products.  
Positive and Negative
4. 
Employees

Opportunity 
Risk: If employee engagement is not prioritised, it can 
have an adverse long-term impact on the company’s 
performance. 
 
Opportunity

a 
culture 
of 
employee 
engagement can lead to higher retention, greater job 
satisfaction, better performance, and sustained 
organisational success in the long term. 
The Company prioritises employee 
satisfaction and has implemented a 
robust HR framework with five 
employee focus areas and a nine-grid 
performance management system 
to 
enhance 
productivity 
and 
employee motivation. 
Positive and Negative
5. 
Effluents 
Management 
Risk 
The Company recognizes that efficiently managing 
effluents even if it has only a small footprint is 
essential for companies in our sector. 
The Company has a state-of-the-art 
ETP, which ensures that the effluents 
are fully treated and used for various 
purposes at the factories and 
leftover 
sludge 
is 
disposed 
responsibly. 
Negative 
6.  
Waste Management 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Risk: The Company recognizes that poor waste 
management practices exacerbate the impact of 
climate change effects and create negative health 
impacts for workers and surrounding communities. 
 
Opportunity: Comprehensive waste management 
programs with heightened environmental and social 
consciousness can effectively contribute to the 
mitigation of climate change impacts while promoting 
the overall well-being of workers and communities. 
The 
Company 
places 
utmost 
importance to minimizing waste – 
both hazardous and non-hazardous – 
with a focus on Reduce, Recycle, and 
Reuse 
principles. 
Our 
waste 
management 
commitments 
are 
designed to meet all the statutory 
guidelines and industry standards. 
Further our focus on circularity 
initiatives, ensure judicious usage of 
natural and manmade resources. 
Positive and Negative
7.  
Community and 
Society 
Opportunity 
Corporate engagement in communities is positive 
towards people and society and creates a conducive 
environment for inclusive growth. These initiatives can 
help Corporate to better understand the social, 
economic, and environmental contexts in which they 
operate, 
build 
stronger 
relationships 
with 
stakeholders, and identify new opportunities for 
innovation and sustainable growth. 
NA 
Positive 
8. 
Responsible Sourcing
Opportunity 
Extending the sustainability agenda to suppliers can 
significantly reduce company’s exposure to risks 
related to economic, environmental, social, and 
governance. Getting all our suppliers to commit to our 
Supplier Code of Conduct and Business Conduct 
Guidelines, with an emphasis on legal compliance, 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption, human rights, health 
and safety, and environmental protection, along with
