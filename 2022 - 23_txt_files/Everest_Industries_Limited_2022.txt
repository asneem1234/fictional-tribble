1
Emissions 
(Climate 
Change)
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk): Climate Impacts are affecting 
society and businesses and as a 
Responsible Corporate Citizen, we 
are taking actions to minimize our 
impacts.
(Opportunity): The demand for 
Green Buildings is increasing with 
a preference for more resource-
efficient materials and lower GHG 
emissions. Our response to adapt to 
climate change and focus here will 
enable a more resilient business.
We have undertaken a 
number of initiatives on 
energy efficiency, improving 
our renewable energy mix 
as well as looking at supply 
chain improvements which 
reduce our GHG emissions.
Proactive action will 
improve our brand and 
customer attraction 
and resource efficiency 
will also improve 
our margins. Lack of 
attention would have a 
negative impact.
The preference for 
energy-efficient 
green buildings is a 
significant driver for 
our ESBS, Boards and 
Panels businesses.
2
Energy 
Consumption 
(Climate 
Change)
Opportunity
To run plants and equipment energy 
is consumed from the grid. There 
could be opportunities to reduce the 
electricity usage.
The company keeps an active 
track of energy consumption 
and runs certain six sigma 
projects to reduce and keep 
the energy consumption 
under check.
The Company has invested 
in rooftop solar projects for 
captive consumption within 
the plants.

3
Water and 
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk): Water and Waste are key 
parameters as part of environmental 
compliance and non-compliances 
are a risk to business continuity. 
We recognize that water stress will 
lead to increasing costs and lower 
availability and since water is a key 
component of our manufacturing 
process, we need to focus on on this 
aspect.  Water management is a 
necessity for responsible businesses. 
The compliance requirements on 
waste are being expanded going 
beyond hazardous materials towards 
other types of waste.
(Opportunity): We recognize that 
adopting the 3 R principles leads to 
direct economic impact
We have zero liquid 
discharge and are in the 
process of setting up 
monitoring systems to 
improve our water and waste 
management processes.

Impact of 
Products 
(R&D)
Opportunity/
Risk
Changes in existing regulations/ 
emerging regulations impacting

The Boards and ESBS 
products are environmentally

an opportunity. In case 
of Roofing, the company 
ensures that scrap generated 
is disposed as per statutory 
guidelines.
Positive
5
New Product 
Development
Risk/
Opportunity
Asbestos Fiber may come under 
regulation in future.
Everest is pro-actively 
working on emerging areas 
and implement much ahead 
of statute. The company is 
a pioneer and is a leader in 
non-asbestos cement roofing 
sheets.
It is working with agencies to 
ensure that its customers are 
able to generate LEED and 
GRIHA points. The Company 
continues to monitor all 
emerging regulations, 
incidents, developments and 
map it for compliance.

Positive
9
Health & 
Safety
Risk
The manufacturing operations of 
the Company require employees to 
interact with plant, machinery, and 
material handling equipment, all of 
which carry an inherent risk of injury
The Company places a 
strong emphasis on healthy 
and safe workplaces. 
The Company’s plants, 
facilities and equipment are 
designed based on careful 
consideration of health and 
safety at the workplace.
Providing adequate health 
and safety resources, 
including manpower and 
infrastructure, is essential 
for maintaining a safe 
workplace.
By focusing on preventive 
measures and creating a 
culture that values safety, 
the Company can minimize

Supply 
Chain and 
Sustainable 
Sourcing
Opportunity
Disruption in supply chain due to 
unavailability of key RM. Sustainable 
supply chain processes would also 
help reduce our environmental 
impact and improve our social 
impact.
Cement, Fly Ash and Silica 
are major raw materials 
which are extremely 
commoditized and do 
not have a huge risk of 
availability. The company 
imports Pulp and has 
diversified its suppliers base.
The industry has dependency 
on few suppliers for Asbestos 
Fiber. The company works 
with them in a manner to 
ensure steady supplies 
at competitive prices. 
Everest has numerous 
initiatives for raw material 
substitution and product 
enhancement. We are also 
evaluating sustainable 
sourcing parameters via our 
sustainable sourcing policy.

EVEREST’S vision is to reimagine spaces to improve peoples’ lives. To achieve this vision, we are building an organization 
based on values of Respect, Excellence and Integrity. These values are a part of the company’s DNA and way of working. 
In line with our vision and values I believe that it is our responsibility to take into consideration the Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) factors that affect our operations and the wider community. We recognize that these factors pose 
significant challenges, and we are committed to addressing them through our ESG Strategy.
	
One of our key targets is to reduce our carbon footprint by implementing energy-efficient practices and utilizing renewable 
energy sources. We have already made significant progress in this area, and we aim to further reduce our emissions by 
using carbon-efficient energy sources. Additionally, we are actively exploring innovative ways to reduce waste and increase 
recycling, such as implementing circular economy principles in our operations.
	
Social responsibility is also a key focus for us, and we are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our workforce 
and supply chain. We are proud to have achieved 25% women directors on our Board, and the number of women employees 
in the Company has increased by 2.4% in the last 3 years. The numbers however are small and we recognize that there is 
still work to be done. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize this area and work towards achieving greater diversity.
	
Lastly, we understand that good governance is essential for building trust and credibility with our stakeholders. We are 
committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency, and we regularly review and 
update our policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and best practices.
	
In summary, we recognize the importance of ESG factors in building a sustainable future, and we are committed to 
addressing these challenges through our ESG Strategy. We will continue to set ambitious targets and work towards 
achieving them while ensuring that we uphold our values and principles as a responsible corporate citizen.

High Court of Delhi 
appointed Justice 
Gorla Rohini as the 
Sole Arbitrator.
` 11.25 
Lakhs
Premium Pressure had placed an order for 
supply and erection of factory building for 
` 74.5 Lakhs. They had given an advance of 
` 7.5 Lakhs to us. We supplied anchor bolts 
of ` 1.1 Lakhs to them. Subsequently, the 
project was held up for 1.5 years. Later, 
Premium Pressure wanted us to pursue the 
Project at the same price to which we did not 
agree. Premium Pressure invoked Arbitration 
against us for recovery of ` 36.5 Lakh.
The matter has been 
settled before any 
award was passed in 
the Arbitration. Since 
there is no Arbitral 
award, no appeal lies 
in the matter.

10. 	 Health and safety management system:
a. 	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system?
	
We have certification in ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems) at 2 ESBS plants at Narmada 
and Bhagwanpur. We follow the same principles at rest of the plants. The following principles are applied:
	
•	
A safety committee is formed at plant where the safety points are discussed with the participation of employees 
and workmen.
	
•	
Periodic hazard identification and controlling drive is implemented.
	
•	
Safety induction trainings are being imparted to workmen. Hazards, risks, emergency precautions, 
etc. details are being communicated to the workmen. Specialized safety training is imparted for 
instance working at height, electrical job, occupational health, welding/cutting/grinding activities, etc. 
Safety and health campaigns (Road Safety Week, National Safety Week, Fire Service Week, etc.) are organized 
periodically. Various other initiatives such as mock drills, Toolbox talk, safety inspections, medical examination 
or workmen and monitoring of various lead and lag indicators are being monitored, reported, and reviewed.
	
•	
Reward and recognition programs are organized monthly in which the workmen are awarded.
b. 	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
Work-related hazards and risks are being identified on a continuous day-to-day basis. We have established routine 
practices to identify hazards and risks. The plant walk-throughs conducted by the safety team, plant head inspections, 
and safety committee meetings are effective ways to proactively identify potential hazards and risks. These activities 
involve regular checks and observations to ensure that safety standards are being maintained.
	
There are non-routine practices such as incidence analysis and surprise routine checks. These can further uncover 
any potential hazards or risks.
	
Taking corrective action based on intermediate, underlying, and root causes is crucial in addressing the identified 
hazards and risks. By addressing the root causes, similar incidents could be prevented from occurring in the future, 
rather than simply treating the symptoms.
	
Conducting walkthroughs to identify hazards, even at minor levels, demonstrates a proactive approach to safety. Once 
hazards and risks have been identified, we ensure they are closed promptly. This ensures that the workplace remains 
safe and minimizes the potential for incidents or accidents. It’s great to see that your team is taking swift action to 
address these identified points.
Everest Industries Limited
124
	
Raising awareness of incidents is crucial for maintaining a safe work environment. Toolbox talks, training sessions, 
meetings, and email communication are effective ways to disseminate information and ensure that everyone is 
informed about the incidents, lessons learned, and any necessary preventive measures.
c. 	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Yes/No)
	
Yes, workers are being motivated to report work-related hazards. Reward and recognition are in place to promote 
the reporting of hazards. It’s being monitored by the respective plant and project head for their effectiveness. Safety 
suggestions are being invited to report the work-related hazards and solutions. The reward for safety suggestions is 
being provided. We have implemented a process to record work-related hazards along with an action plan.
d. 	 Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
	
The worker has access to occupational medical, non-occupational medical and health care services. The Pre and 
periodical examination of workmen is being done. The necessary infrastructure and resources have been provided. 
Company’s health insurance and personal accident policy exists at plants.

Everest is improving as a part of excellent value in the safety incident categorization. Everest is redefining the incident 
categorization which shall be in line with BRSR reporting and it shall be reported in detail in the next FY 2023-24.
12. 	 Measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
The Company places strong emphasis on healthy and safe workplaces. The Company’s plants, facilities and equipment 
are designed based on careful consideration of a healthy and safe workplace.
	
The systematic process for identifying work-related hazards is an essential step in maintaining a safe environment for 
employees. The identification of fire hazards and the preparation of an action plan for control systems are crucial for 
mitigating potential risks.
	
The fail-safe approach adopted by Everest in its Safety management system demonstrates a commitment to eliminating 
hazards to the greatest extent possible. By implementing engineering controls and continuously improving safety measures, 
the Company aims to prevent accidents and ensure the well-being of its workers. Machine guarding is an excellent example 
of how the chances of man-machine interference can be reduced, thereby minimizing potential hazards.
	
Providing adequate health and safety resources, including manpower and infrastructure, is essential for maintaining a safe 
workplace. The provision of training, both at the time of joining and throughout employment, is crucial for ensuring that 
employees are equipped with the knowledge and skills to carry out their work safely. Regular pre-work safety briefings 
and periodic medical examinations further contribute to maintaining a healthy and safe workforce.
	
By focusing on preventive measures and creating a culture that values safety, the Company can minimize the occurrence of 
accidents and hazardous situations. Motivation in safety through rewards and recognition helps reinforce the importance 
of safe practices among employees, and conducting mock drills enhances preparedness and response capabilities.
	
Overall, the Company’s commitment to safety through various initiatives and practices demonstrates a proactive approach 
to ensuring the well-being of its workforce and maintaining a healthy work environment.

A high-impact accident occurred at a project site where we undertake steel building erection contracts. The accident was a 
result of sudden changes in weather conditions and was associated with an unsafe act. In response, we have taken several 
measures to address the issue and improve safety protocols.
	
Firstly, we have enhanced our training programs to ensure that all workers are well-informed about safety procedures and 
practices. Additionally, we have implemented new practices, such as air velocity monitoring, to complement our reliance 
on weather forecasts.
	
To reinforce the importance of safety, we regularly conduct leadership talks. These talks serve as a platform to raise 
awareness among management, supervisors, and employees about adhering to the defined Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) at all project locations and plants.
Principle 4: Businesses Should Respect the Interests of And Be Responsive To All Its Stakeholders.
Essential Indicators
1. 	 Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
At Everest, stakeholders play an integral role in our journey, and we recognise the need to partner with them and understand 
their concerns to deliver the targets which we have set for ourselves as a part of the organisational vision. Our multi-
stakeholder model aims to understand the requirement of our stakeholders and we attempt to respond to them through 
various initiatives and programmes.
	
Our process of stakeholder engagement involves identifying key internal and external stakeholders followed by analysing 
the impact of each of the stakeholder groups on our business and vice versa. Based on the exercise carried out, we 
prioritised our key stakeholders to understand their expectations and concerns. Through regular interactions with our 
stakeholders across various channels, we have been able to strengthen our relationships and enhance our organisational 
strategy.
	
We have identified the key stakeholder groups and each stakeholder continues to contribute in their own way in creating 
a shared value.
