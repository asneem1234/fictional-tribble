manufacturing 
(energy 
intensive 
production), 
packaging, 
transportation, warehousing, distribution, consumption, return 
and disposal.
• Complexity of myriad supplier relationships and border crossings 
makes supply chain sustainability challenging.
• Supply chain not offering dignified, safe work that respects and 
advances human rights across their value chain, can adversely 
impact our brand image globally and consequential impact on 
revenue and growth.

end- to-end operations to achieve greater cost savings and

is managed at all levels. It is therefore a management system, a 
tool that is used to assess all types of risks associated with the 
business and putting in place robust risk management system.
• Being in the pharmaceutical business, regulatory compliance 
risks are very high followed by other risks such as supply-chain 
risks, quality risks, geopolitical exposures risk, cyber threats, data 
breaches, etc.
