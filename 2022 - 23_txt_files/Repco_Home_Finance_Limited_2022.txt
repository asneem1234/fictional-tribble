In case of risk, approach to

Financial implications of

(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1
Corporate 
governance
Opportunity
The company adheres to 
corporate governance norms 
which help in adherence to legal 
and regulatory requirements, 
effective internal control 
systems, risk evaluations, 
timely and proper disclosure of 
information, etc.
Such practices ensure 
accountability and transparency. 
Not applicable
The efficient Corporate 
Governance system ensures the 
timely regulatory compliance 
which mitigate legal and 
compliance risks, and also 
reduces events of penalty.  
2
Data Security
Risk
Safeguarding customer data 
from cyberattacks, data 
security, and customer privacy 
is of utmost importance for 
the company otherwise it 
may have major repercussions 
for customers and also for the 
company which may result in 
non-compliance, financial risks, 
and reputational damage.  
The company follows data 
security standards and 
respond to cyber threats. 
Also, the Security Operation 
Centre (SOC) will be 
implemented shortly. 
Breach of data security will 
have an adverse impact on 
the company disruption in 
operations, legal and regulatory 
non-compliance, penalty, 
financial loss, etc.
3
Adoption of risky 
business model
Opportunity 
and Risk
Opportunity:
India’s housing loan market is 
still under penetrated especially 
in the semi-urban and rural 
areas. The Indian Government is 
also encouraging the affordable 
housing segment by providing 
incentives and subsidies to 
the buyers in lower income 
segments to buy /construct 
homes.
Risk:
Most of the middle and lower-
level segment customers do 
not have proper documented 
income to support cash flows. 
These customers are vulnerable 
to any downward change in the 
economy, Government policies, 
and natural calamities.
RHFL is adopting higher 
customer due diligence 
and put in place strong risk 
management policies and 
procedures to assess the 
customers’ willingness to pay 
and ability to pay at the pre-
sanction level itself.
The Company has 
implemented stringent credit 
appraisal processes and 
highly conservative Loan to 
value ratio and Income to 
instalment ratio in the credit 
sanctioning process which 
will avert quick mortality and 
result in lower delinquency. 
Moreover, the improved 
collection mechanism 
employed across all branches 
also helps in improving 
the collection efficiency in 
respect of self- employed and 
cash salary customers of the 
Company.
Positive:
The number of home loans 
outstanding per household in 
Urban India is around 14% and 
in rural India it is less than 1%. 
There is still huge potential for 
the housing loan and mortgage 
loan market, especially in the 
self-employed and MSME 
customers in semi-urban and 
Rural India. The Company will 
use this opportunity to its benefit 
and penetrate into Semi urban 
and Rural India to improve its 
business further in the coming 
years.

No.

Indicate 
whether

(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk/ opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
4
 Enhancement in 
Digitization 
Opportunity 
and Risk
Opportunity:
The Company is in the process 
of technological upgradation 
by  adoption of new software 
for the entire loan process 
cycle i.e. from lead generation 
to closure of a loan and Mobile 
App to onboard the customer. 
Digitization across all the 
functions of the Company will 
make customer on boarding 
easy and will also result in 
improved customer service and 
thereby customer retention. 
Risk:
Ensuring data security and 
customer privacy is critical to 
protecting customer information 
from cyberattacks and data 
breaches. 
  The Company has embarked 
on the digitization process by 
building adequate firewalls 
 and data encryption process 
and other protection systems 
in the digital platform 
and conducting IS audit, 
Vulnerability Assessment 
Test (VAPT) periodically to 
avert cyber-attacks. The 
Company is in the process 
of putting in place a Security 
Operation Centre (SOC) on 
full-time basis to detect and 
respond to cyber threats. The 
company is Implementing a 
governance framework, high 
standard information security 
practices to take care of 
data leakage, data security, 
and cyber security in the IT 
systems.
Positive: Engaging the customer 
digitally will enhance customer 
satisfaction and also increase 
the productivity of the branches. 
The lending software enables 
credit appraisal more user-
friendly and the automation of 
various verification processes 
in this software helps in a safe 
and faster lending process.  The 
data storage is more secure and 
user-friendly MIS helps in quick 
decision-making.
Negative:
Frequent disruptions and 
server/software downtime will 
adversely impact the quality of 
service and in productivity of 
branches. Putting in place high-
end data base management and 
maintenance systems involves 
huge costs.  Any customer data 
leakage, data compromise in 
the various third-party vendor 
systems forming part of our 
lending software, and the 
resultant reputational damage 
and cost involved in legal fees 
and regulatory penalties.
5
Retention of 
human Capital 
Opportunity
Retention of trained and 
talented human capital is really 
a challenge and important for 
Company’s growth. Human 
resource development and 
management are important 
criteria for the Organization’s 
success. Recognizing the 
importance of Human resource 
management, the Company has 
taken several measures to arrest 
attrition at all levels, employee 
satisfaction, and thereby 
improvement in employee 
productivity and customer 
service.
Not applicable
Positive:
The new and improved HR 
policy and processes improve 
employee satisfaction and 
thereby employee productivity. 
The Company has revised the 
pay scale of employees at all 
levels and introduced new 
quality-based training programs 
by inviting faculties from 
professional training institutes 
which helps in arresting 
employee attrition, improving 
employee development and 
Organization’s growth in the long 
run.   
6
Corporate Social 
Responsibility
Opportunity
Company has identified 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
as a key factor to contribute to 
the Society by providing funds 
generously to various CSR 
programs viz., in Preventive 
health care, Promoting education 
and rural development 
Not applicable
Positive:
The Company recognizes the 
importance of the development 
of human kind and other social 
welfare as a key factor in an 
Organization’s responsibility 
to society and contributes 
generously to the CSR funds by 
identifying various social welfare 
and funding initiatives.
