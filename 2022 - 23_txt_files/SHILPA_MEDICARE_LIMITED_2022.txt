Occupational 
health and safety
Risk  
We recognize that employees form 
the foundation of our operations, 
and it is incumbent upon us to 
prioritize their health, safety, and 
well-being by furnishing a nurturing 
and secure work environment.
•	 We have developed and integrated 
a Safety, Health and Environment 
(EHS) policy that governs our 
employees and applies to all our 
research, production operations, 
and business facilities
•	 All 
our 
employees, 
including 
permanent 
workers 
and 
contractors 
are 
trained 
on 
occupational health and safety, 
specific 
work-related 
hazards, 
hazardous 
activities 
and 
situations.
•	 We 
have 
developed 
and 
implemented strong Health and 
Safety systems (H&S) at all our 
plants.
•	 Periodic 
safety 
assessments 
against international standards 
are conducted to evaluate the 
effectiveness of current systems 
and appropriate measures are 
taken to further improve our 
safety 
posture 
performance 
continually.
Negative
2
Regulatory 
compliance
Opportunity, 
Risk
Regulatory 
guidelines 
and 
requirements heavily regulate the 
manufacturing of our products, 
including manufacturing quality 
standards. Periodic inspections are 
conducted on our manufacturing 
sites, and if the regulatory and 
quality standards and systems 
are not found adequate, it could 
result in observations. This might 
impact our ability to meet patient 
demand and generate value for 
our stakeholders
•	 We are fully dedicated to quality 
and have robust quality processes 
and systems in place at our 
developmental and manufacturing 
facilities to ensure that every 
product is safe and of high quality 
•	 We have integrated “Quality by 
Design” to build quality into all 
processes and use quality tools to 
minimize process risks. 
•	 We continue to spend significant 
time, money and effort in the areas 
of production and quality testing 
to help ensure full compliance 
with cGMP regulations.
•	 We 
leverage 
information 
technology to digitize and enhance 
our quality assurance and quality 
control processes.
•	 We are continuously focused 
on improving our quality culture 
across the organization.

Pharma 
covigilence
Risk 
The increase in digital central trials 
and accelerated speed to market 
of medicines and drugs amplifies 
the need for better drug quality 
and prevention of adverse side 
effects.
•	 We have a mature system in 
place to continuously monitor the 
benefit-risk profile of our products 
to ensure benefits overweigh the 
product-related safety risks for 
patients.
•	 We maintain compliance with 
region / country-specific legislative 
requirements.

Promoting 
diversity and 
inclusion
Opportunity
We fully appreciate the significance 
of diversity to our organization, as 
it fosters the introduction of new 
perspectives, diverse experiences, 
novel concepts, and inventive 
approaches 
that 
can 
provide 
sustainable value creation for 
our stakeholders over the long 
term. It is our steadfast effort to 
promote  inclusiveness through 
concerted 
interventions 
across 
different dimensions of business 
and embrace their distinctiveness.
We are also working to increase the 
representation of women across 
roles and teams, exploring new entry 
level routes such as apprentice hiring 
and actively recruiting women.
Positive
5
Talent attraction 
and retention
Opportunity 
Ability to attract and retain the 
right technical talent with differing 
skill sets is a difficult challenge to 
address. The industry is highly 
knowledge-driven and technology 
based, and heavily reliant on 
specialist individuals well versed 
with state-of-the-art technology.
We use people analytics to measure 
employee 
performance, 
identify 
current skill gaps, and flight risks 
to improve retention. We actively 
address 
and 
resolve 
structural 
talent gaps by providing long-term 
reskilling and upskilling opportunities 
to our workforce, including digital 
learning 
initiatives. 
We 
embed 
strategic workforce planning into 
our operations strategy. The benefits 
of this initiative are multifaceted 
e.g., fostering internal mobility for 
well-suited roles, enhancing people 
productivity and containing staff 
costs.
