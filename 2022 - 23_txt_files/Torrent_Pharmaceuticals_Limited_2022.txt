BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
FOREWORD
Torrent Pharma recognises the paramount importance of sustainability and has strategically integrated it into its decision-making 
process. The Company’s unwavering commitment to responsible business practices lies at the core of its comprehensive governance 
framework, built upon principles of Transparency, Integrity and Accountability.
The Company acknowledges the pressing environmental threats and the crises posed by climate change, which have underscored 
the need for sustainable practices to establish long-term profitable businesses.
At Torrent Pharma, we firmly believe that attaining long-term business success is intrinsically tied to the pursuit of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) goals. As a responsible Corporate Citizen, we are dedicated to creating a robust business that operates 
responsibly, aligning with national priorities such as zero-carbon objectives and adhering to recognised global frameworks like GRI, 
SASB and UN SDGs. In our ongoing sustainability journey and commitment to the National Voluntary Guidelines, we voluntarily 
presented our inaugural Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) last year, as envisioned by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
To further improve our processes, policies and reporting, we are delighted to present our latest BRSR report. It encompasses a 
comprehensive set of measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each of the nine principles which include ethical business 
practices, product stewardship, employee wellbeing, safety & development, stakeholder engagement, human rights, environmental 
stewardship, public policy advocacy, inclusive growth and responsible customer relationship.

Product quality 
and safety 
Risk
The use of high-quality and safe 
goods ensures that improved 
health outcomes are attained. 
Compromise on pharmaceutical 
product quality would imply a 
compromise on patients' overall 
health and wellbeing. This will 
also entail failure to comply 
with GxP (Good Laboratory 
Practices, Good Manufacturing 
Practices and Good Clinical 
Practices).
Any lapse can lead to product 
withdrawals, recalls, regulatory 
action, decreased sales, 
reputational risk, increased 
litigation followed by increase in 
litigation expense.
•	
Drug product quality and patient 
safety are the fundamental 
principles for Torrent Pharma. The 
Company being in the healthcare 
sector, the nature of its business 
requires the utmost attention to 
the quality of its product. We have 
taken following measures to ensure 
resilience against the risk:
•	
We have in place a strong 
Pharmacovigilance system 
through which all the stakeholders 
can access the adverse event / 
product complaint reporting form 
on the website of the Company 
or dedicated phone line and a 
dedicated mailbox.
•	
The Pharmacovigilance department 
of the Company oversees 
monitoring and managing the safety 
of all our products throughout 
their lifespan, employing rigorous 
systems and procedures to 
ensure that manufacturing quality 
standards, GMP compliance, and 
other regulatory criteria are met.
•	
Audits are conducted by the Quality 
Assurance department to ensure 
that our high-quality requirements 
are met.
•	
Risks are sought to be managed 
by appropriate laboratory and 
clinical studies for each new 
product, compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practices and 
independent quality assurance 
systems.
Negative
Innovation: 
Strengthening 
R&D pipeline 
Opportunity
Innovation and R&D play an 
important role in determining 
the long-term success of our 
Company. The cutting-edge 
research includes developing 
new processes for known APIs 
and developing value-added 
and differentiated formulations 
including complex generics. 
These developments come 
out as the differentiators for 
the Company, and thus, leads 
to an increase in revenues 
as well. We have committed 
to invest dedicatedly to tap 
opportunities and introduce new 
therapies, medical benefits, and 
formulations across the globe.

Water and 
wastewater 
management 
Risk
There is a great degree of 
dependency on uninterrupted 
supply of water for continued 
operations. Therefore, water 
management becomes crucial 
for the Company’s operations. 
With changing climate and 
drought like conditions, water 
availability is increasingly 
becoming a risk across different 
geographies.
Secondly, wastewater 
management is highly crucial 
for pharmaceutical industry. The 
presence of pharmaceutical 
compounds in the environment 
is recognized as emerging 
micro pollutants in aquatic 
environment, which can 
indirectly impact human and 
animal health. If not managed 
properly, it can lead to a high 
level of ecological risk.
The Company is not only adhering to 
the statutory criteria set forth by the 
Central Ground Water Authority, but it 
is also taking responsibility for reducing 
use through effective recycling.
Water recycling systems are in place in 
water-stressed locations such as Indrad 
& Pithampur manufacturing facilities, 
Bileshwarpura project site and R&D 
centre. The water efficient designs limit 
the amount of water that can be utilized 
in different operations. Water usage 
monitoring across units enables us to 
strategize the reduction efforts.
We also make certain that our effluents 
are treated properly before being reused 
or discharged. At our manufacturing 
facilities, we have a high-tech ETP and 
a three-stage effluent recycling RO 
system.
For more information, please refer 
to 'Natural Capital' section of the 
Integrated Report.
Negative
Energy 
efficiency and 
renewable 
energy 
Opportunity
Renewable energy is expanding 
at a quicker rate than it has 
ever been before. The cost of 
renewable energy has dropped 
dramatically because of 
increased government support 
and continued research and 
development.
Energy efficiency also serves as 
a major opportunity to reduce 
operational costs in the long 
term and is also one of the 
decarbonization levers for our 
Company.
For more information, please 
refer to 'Natural Capital' section 
of the Integrated Report.
Positive
Employee 
engagement, 
safety and well-
being 
Opportunity
Employees are our biggest 
assets. Robust employee 
engagement, safety, and 
well-being drives enhanced 
productivity for the Company.
This material aspect is therefore 
an opportunity to integrate 
employees’ views in the core 
functioning of the Company, 
while ensuring employee 
satisfaction and safety in each 
process.

Investing in equality and diversity 
brings numerous benefits to the 
Company. From bringing skills 
to the team, respecting each 
employee’s rights, promoting 
innovation and diverse views, 
enhancing a Company’s 
reputation, and promoting new 
talent. We believe in giving 
equal opportunities to everyone 
irrespective of caste, gender, 
color, religion or any other bias. 
Positive
Ethics and 
business 
integrity 
Risk
Torrent Pharma is a global 
Company with millions of 
stakeholders. Any ethical 
and business integrity breach 
can hamper the Company’s 
credibility, employee morale and 
may result in significant fines 
and financial loss. 
We have zero tolerance for any ethical 
and business integrity breach within 
the Company. The principles enshrined 
in the Company’s Code of Business 
Conduct guide the work culture in 
terms of ethics and law. The Code in 
a real sense promotes honesty, trust, 
accountability and transparency.
It establishes key corporate and 
organizational ideals that influence the 
value system and business operations.
Every new employee receives a Code 
of Business Conduct orientation at the 
time of joining, ensuring that they fully 
comprehend, embrace, and adapt to 
the Code.
Its implementation and adherence are 
aided by a powerful vigil mechanism 
that monitors deviations or disrespect in 
any form.
Negative
Adherence to 
laws
Risk
Torrent Pharma operates in 
various territories and markets, 
each having its own regulatory 
landscape, which continuously 
evolves changes, and 
undergoes increased scrutiny 
from the regulators. Any non-
compliance with regulations 
or scrutiny process can result 
in dilution of financial position 
or jeopardize the Company's 
reputation.
Regulatory risks are managed through 
a strong governance mechanism based 
on the philosophy of ‘zero tolerance to 
non-compliance’. This is implemented 
through:
•	
Assessment of regulatory and 
compliance requirements on regular 
basis
•	
Robust internal controls
•	
Compliance management systems 
and continuous monitoring
•	
Internal communication and training 
on the ethics standards and 
compliance systems
•	
Independent assessments and 
audits
•	
Monitoring of Legal and regulatory 
compliance by Senior management 
and the Board

SECTION C: PRINCIPLE WISE PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE
PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that is Ethical, 
Transparent and Accountable.
At Torrent Pharma, we always believe that the highest level of Corporate Governance practices is pre-requisite for 
growing sustainable and successful business. The sound governance processes and systems guide the Company 
on its journey towards continued success. We are always committed to fostering a culture where TRANSPARENCY, 
INTEGRITY and ACCOUNTABILITY is woven into the fabric of everything that we do. We ensure that the Company 
and its employees act in a way that is effective, ethical, accountable, and transparent at all levels. On a continual 
basis, we also maintain responsive, inclusive, participative, and representative decision-making.
Our Core Values, which we believe in and constantly strive to build are Integrity, Passion for Excellence, Participative Decision Making, 
Concern for Society & Environment, Fairness with Care and Transparency.
Each of these Timeless Values, a Pillar of Strength, ENSURES OUR LONGEVITY.
INTEGRITY: When Truth is Paramount
Thoughts and actions entail doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances; whether or not anyone is watching. This requires 
inner courage and conviction, no matter what the consequences are. It is honoring one’s commitments and being accountable for 
one’s actions, end-to-end.
PASSION FOR EXCELLENCE: When best is not enough
Passion for excellence means not doing extra-ordinary things, but doing ordinary things in all pursuits exceedingly well. Passion and 
excellence are forces that fuel each other on the exclusive path to leadership. As we are what we repeatedly do, excellence then is 
not an act, but a habit.
PARTICIPATIVE DECISION MAKING: Involvement that engenders effectiveness
An ideal organisation facilitates participation and involvement of each of its members in various decision making processes, thus 
ensuring their commitment to such decisions as well as its outcome. It provides a platform for seeking and nurturing constructive 
ideas from individuals, teams and units which eventually yields exceptional results.
CONCERN FOR SOCIETY & ENVIRONMENT: When every smile matters
Concern for Society & Environment is a sense of responsibility and contribution to society that defines our existence. It entails making 
a difference in the quality of lives and environment surrounding us. It is important to encourage fellow-members on collective as well 
as individual basis to fulfil the responsibility of leaving behind a world rich in flora and fauna and rich in time tested values and ideals 
and above all rich in social fervour for our future generations.
FAIRNESS WITH CARE: Harnessing equality
Fairness and Care towards all fellow members are inextricably linked. Weaving the threads of equality, irrespective of caste, creed, 
religion and gender, into the day-to-day fabric, ensures fairness for each and every individual. Empathic care recognizes needs and 
aspirations of all. Only such fairness and care eventually lead fellow members to the dawn of eternal success.
TRANSPARENCY: Openness that builds enduring trust
Transparency implies openness. It is the opposite of secrecy. It encourages more informed decision making and aids in creating 
enduring trust among all stakeholders.
Our Core values are aligned with the nine Principles of NGRBC.
Torrent Pharma firmly believes and adheres to transparent, fair and ethical governance practices to encourage professionalism, 
honesty, integrity and ethical behavior. We take inspiration from the value “INTEGRITY” and “TRANSPARENCY” and consistently 
maintains the high level of fairness in all our dealing with the Stakeholders. The Board of Directors have formulated a Code of Business 
Conduct (“the Code”), which is applicable to all the employees and Board Members of the Company, and which lays down the important 
corporate ethical practices that shape the Company’s business practices and represents the ever-cherished values of the Company. 
The Code is an extension of our values and reflects our continued commitment to ethical business practices across our operations.

PRINCIPLE 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
The Company’s core value “PASSION for EXCELLENCE” demonstrates its commitment to focus on Drug Product 
quality and patient safety. We invest significant amount in R&D for product development and sustainability. We 
also adopted innovative strategies to progress from clinical supply route to sustainable commercial manufacturing 
process that are cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. This directly reflects our commitment towards providing 
sustainable and safe products and services. 
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1. 
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by 
the entity, respectively. 
	
Torrent Pharma's commitment to enhancing the quality of life by producing high-quality drugs and making significant contributions 
to society is reflected in its in-house API manufacturing. With the API industry increasingly demanding simple and cost-effective 
manufacturing techniques, Torrent's in-house API R&D team focuses on novel, non-infringing, robust, and scalable processes 
for complex generics. The prime focus is on environmentally safe, efficient, and cost-effective processes and patenting them 
with a strategic plan.
	
As compared to the existing commercial process, the manufacturing process was designed and optimized in such a way that 
stoichiometric quantities of reagents were used leading to a clean reaction and thus avoiding the formation of toxic impurities / side 
products and thereby improving the yield, process time cycle reduced by 70% and substantial decrease in the waste generation.
	
The process development of an anticonvulsant medication for the treatment of a serious genetic brain disorder in children was done 
in such a way to include use of single solvent throughout the multiple step synthesis along with utilizing safe, mild reagents and 
process conditions. The input quantities of starting materials, reagents and solvents were studied and stoichiometric ratios were 
optimized to minimize the generation of impurities, by-products and waste. This is optimised to operate at ambient temperature 
and achieve desired particle size directly through crystallisation, resulting in less energy consumption and environmental impact.
	
Our R&D team has developed an innovative and robust process (patent applied) for a potentially more potent and safer steroid-
genesis inhibitor used to treat an orphan disease. The process avoids the use of hazardous chemicals and high-temperature 
reactions, resulting in a significantly cheaper API, and has been developed by minimising the number of steps.
	
As a part of the ESG roadmap, we have invested an amount of I 85 crores in Hybrid Solar-Wind project to meet the captive power 
requirement and to reduce the carbon footprints significantly. The renewable energy to be generated from the Hybrid project will 
contribute to 30% of the total electricity consumption at Indrad manufacturing facility, Bileshwarpura Project site and R&D Centre 
of the Company. Further, the investment of I 35 crores in Briquette Boiler for Indrad, Dahej and Baddi manufacturing facilities 
will result into replacement of fossil fuel with biofuel which will further lead to reduction in carbon footprint.
2.	
 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes / No). If yes, what percentage of 
inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
Torrent Pharma is on an ESG Transforming journey, and it believes supplier collaboration as crucial to doubling its effect. We 
have initiated sensitising and encouraging our vendors to follow the road of sustainability with the goal of driving sustainable 
behaviour beyond their manufacturing facilities. Keeping in mind the best interests of the patients, the Company endeavours to 
work with responsible suppliers who adhere to the uniform quality, social and environmental standards as Torrent.
	
We have standard operating procedures for the evaluation and selection of our vendors for sourcing of material. This includes the 
evaluation of the EHS resources and their compliance by suppliers and vendors for key raw materials / APIs and intermediates. 
We have system of identifying and / or developing alternate vendors where single vendor is considered critical for business 
continuity. For more information, please refer to ‘Manufacturing Capital’ section of Integrated report.
