Floatable shrink film can help to recycle the PET bottle crush without label contamination 
and easy separation during washing process as a part of recycling process of r-PET. This 
helps to make recycled r-PET resin contamination free (label contamination) to re-use in 
the film, fiber manufacture.  Improving the recycling process of r-PET resin contributes to 
avoiding the waste generation and contamination of soil and environment. The PET bottle 
recycling process eliminates a label separation stage during recycling as explained above.
The use of solid white shrink film offers the advantage of eliminating one step of printing 
white ink on the shrink label. This opaque nature makes it ideal for shrink labels used on 
containers containing photosensitive ingredients, such as milk products and cosmetics. By 
enhancing the shelf life of the contents inside these containers, the solid white shrink film 
contributes to the overall product quality and consumer satisfaction.
Peelable and sealable lidding films provide effective protection for food ingredients within 
various food containers, including APET/CPET trays, PS cups, and PP cups, commonly 
used in milk product packaging like yoghurt and curd. These films offer approximately 2 
times more coverage than traditional aluminum foil lids, optimizing resource utilization. 
Moreover, these lidding films provide barrier properties, further enhancing the shelf life of 
the food ingredients, preserving their freshness and quality.
Compared to aluminum foil lids, which may be fragile and require lamination to other 
substrate layers for improved strength and fold endurance, peelable and sealable lidding 
films offer a more efficient and reliable solution. Their durability and performance ensure 
the safe and effective sealing of food containers, reducing the risk of contamination and 
extending the overall shelf life of the food products.

Floatable shrink film can help to recycle the PET 
bottle crush without label contamination and 
easy separation during washing process as a 
part of recycling process of r-PET. This helps to 
make recycled r-PET resin contamination free 
(label contamination) to re-use in the film, fiber 
manufacture.  Improving the recycling process 
of r-PET resin contributes to avoiding the 
waste generation and contamination of soil and 
environment. The PET bottle recycling process 
eliminates a label separation stage during 
recycling as explained above.
