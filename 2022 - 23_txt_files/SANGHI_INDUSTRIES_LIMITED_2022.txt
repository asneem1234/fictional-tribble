The Business responsibility and Sustainability Report is one of the

company and the larger ecosystem. Our sustainability efforts go
beyond using nature's resources efficiently and staying compliant.
It is our mission to create shared value by empowering our
employees and communities to improve their lives, enabling our
value chain partners to prosper as we expand our footprint and,
above all, delivering quality products to our customers.
It is our goal to pave circular driven paths to produce cement
with zero waste as much as feasible, reducing our carbon footprint
and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Using recyclable industrials,
reducing the use of coal and PET coke, modifying our product
mix to include greener blended cement, and deploying waste
heat recovery systems to reuse hot waste gas are just some of the
measures we are taking to reduce our carbon footprint. In line
with our efforts to decrease the production of waste and increase
the adoption of alternative fuels and raw materials, we are in the
process of commissioning solar and wind energy assets at our
locations.
We thank our stakeholders for their continued belief in the
Company as we surge ahead with our mission of transforming
lives, protecting our planet and delivering sustained values.
