Financial implications

positive or negative

1.
GHG  
emission
Risk 
Iron and steel processing generates 
significant 
direct 
greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, primarily 
carbon 
dioxide 
and 
methane, 
from 
production 
processes 
and 
on-site 
fuel 
combustion. 
Although 
technological 
improvements 
have 
reduced 
the GHG emissions per ton of 
steel produced, steel process. 
Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG 
emissions in response to the 
risks posed by climate change 
may result in additional regulatory 
compliance costs and risks for 
iron and steel entities because of 
climate change mitigation policies.
The Company has effectively addressed 
and 
reduced 
the 
risk 
associated 
with 
GHG 
emissions 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
energy-efficient 
initiatives, 
embracing 
the 
shift 
towards renewable energy options, 
streamlining 
transportation 
logistics 
for 
greater 
efficiency, 
encouraging 
sustainable practices among suppliers, 
endorsing 
carbon 
offset 
projects, 
performing 
comprehensive 
climate 
risk assessments, and maintaining 
transparent 
communication 
with stakeholders.
Negative
implications
2
Air  
Quality
Risk
The 
rationale 
for 
identifying 
air quality as a risk lies in its 
significant impact on both health 
and operational aspects. Poor air 
quality can lead to serious health 
issues, 
impacting 
employees 
and the community. This can 
result in higher healthcare costs, 
reduced 
productivity, 
and 
potential legal concerns, affecting 
business operations. 
In addressing the risk of air quality, 
our approach focuses on proactive 
strategies. The Company aims to 
reduce emissions through advanced 
technologies and optimized processes, 
closely monitor air quality in real-time, 
collaborate 
with 
communities 
and 
experts, 
transition 
to 
renewable 
energy, invest in green infrastructure, 
ensure regulatory compliance, educate 
employees, 
and 
continually 
refine 
our strategies. This comprehensive 
approach 
demonstrates 
our 
commitment to mitigate air quality 
risks and contributing to a cleaner, 
healthier environment.

Waste &  
Hazardous  
Materials  
Management
Risk
Identifying waste and hazardous 
materials management as a risk 
is crucial due to its potential 
to 
harm 
the 
environment, 
trigger 
legal 
issues, 
damage 
reputation, and disrupt operations. 
Poor management can lead to 
pollution, 
regulatory 
problems, 
and health concerns, impacting 
both 
the 
ecosystem 
and 
company business. 
The company is actively addressing 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
waste 
and the management of hazardous 
materials through a proactive and 
comprehensive strategy. Our primary 
focus is on reducing waste to minimize 
the generation of hazardous materials 
and ensuring their responsible disposal 
in accordance with regulations. We also 
promote recycling, employ advanced 
technologies, and provide employee 
training to further enhance our efforts 
in this regard.
To 
bolster 
our 
preparedness 
and 
responsible 
practices, 
we 
have 
established robust emergency response 
plans and engage with our suppliers. 
Regular audits and transparent reporting 
mechanisms are in place to reinforce 
our 
commitment 
to 
continuous 
improvement and to earn the trust of 
our stakeholders.
Through this multifaceted approach, 
we 
are 
dedicated 
to 
mitigating 
risks, promoting sustainability, and 
safeguarding both the environment and 
our operations, ultimately preserving 
our reputation.

Employee  
Health  
& Safety
Opportunity
The 
company 
has 
put 
into 
action various health and safety 
management measures, including 
the provision of day care facilities, 
Our approach is centered on 
several 
key 
aspects 
which 
includes rigorous risk assessment, 
comprehensive 
training, 
clear 
standard procedures, ergonomic 
design, 
stringent 
handling 
of 
hazardous materials, emergency 
preparedness, health and wellness 
programs, continuous monitoring 
and many more. By implementing 
these 
measures, 
we 
ensure 
a 
safe 
workplace, 
minimize 
risks, enhance productivity, and

responsible practices.

are installed in the company’s washrooms. When an individual exits the washroom, all the lights and exhaust fans shut off 
on their own to save energy and electricity. All the 6 plants associated with the company are running on Natural gas and 
not on fossil fuels. The DG sets also use a combination of Gas and Diesel, leading to lesser emissions in comparison to DG 
sets utilising just Diesel.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
LED lights  
for energy  
conservation
NA
It helps to conserve energy, in various ways: 
1.  
High Energy Efficiency: LED (Light Emitting 
Diode) lights are highly energy-efficient 
compared to traditional incandescent or 
fluorescent bulbs.
2.	
Low Power Consumption: LED lights require 
significantly less power to produce the same 
amount of light as traditional bulbs.
3. 	
Long Lifespan: LED lights have a much longer 
lifespan compared to traditional bulbs.
2.
Installation 
of Solar Panels
NA
Solar utilizes lower powered items such as LED 
/ CFL lamps, lower powered electronics, etc. 
that do not use as much power as standard 
electric systems. Also, LEDs are powered from 
12 VDC initially and require AC adapters to power 
with standard electric. By using DC power for 
LEDs, they are able to operate more efficiently by 
providing more light and less heat. In this way, 
electricity can be saved.

Plantation of 
Miyawaki forests
The Company planted 5000 plants in 
total consisting of 30 different native 
species in an area of 1250 sq.m.
Growing of plants would keep the surrounding air 
fresh by absorbing all the pollutants and would 
also reduce Greenhouse gas emissions like CO2.
4
Installation 
of Effleunt 
Treatment Plant.
The Company has successfully 
installed ETP which treats wastewater 
through Primary, Secondary and 
Tertiary methods.
ETP treats the wastewater and reduces the toxicity 
and hazardousness of the water.
5
Installation 
of motion 
sensor lights 
and exhaust fans
Lights and exhaust fans automatically 
swtich on and off when an 
individual enters or leaves the

occurrences like: fire, earthquake, flood or storm, blackout, and man-made circumstances like riots or sabotage, as 
well as medical emergencies. The emergency controller directs the movement of persons and equipment during an 
emergency from the emergency control room. The emergency control room has a stretcher, an external telephone, and fire 
extinguishers. The overall direction of emergency management, including incident controller coordination, is the principal 
duty of the principal Incident Controller. The overall management of all preventative measures aimed at safeguarding the 
public, employees, the environment, and the site facilities, as well as the support and accident control measures to bring the 
emergency under control, are among the other roles. A deal has been struck with other businesses so that they will assist
