II. Product/Services
Five-Star Business Finance Limited is registered with the 
RBI as a non-deposit taking NBFC. The Company provides 
secured financial solutions –“small” business loans - to 
micro-entrepreneurs 
and 
self-employed 
individuals 
who are largely devoid of access to the formal financial 
ecosystem, predominantly in urban and semi-urban 
markets. These loans are collateralized and secured 
mostly against the self-occupied residential property 
of the customers in a majority of cases ( ~95+%). The 
ticket size of loan typically varies from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.10 
lakh with majority of loans falling in <Rs.5 lakh range, 
offered with longer tenures of primarily 5-7 years, for the 
convenience of the customers. The Company follows low 
Loan to Value (LTV) and Debt Burden Ratio (DBR) norms of 
50% at the time of origination, which ensure that the loan 
is more than adequately provided for during the tenure of 
the loan.

About Five Star
Five-Star Business Finance Limited is registered as a Systemically 
Important Non-deposit taking Non-banking Financial Company (‘SI-ND-
NBFC’) with the Reserve Bank of India. The Company came into existence 
in 1984. After about two decades of providing loans to micro-entrepreneurs 
and self-employed individuals for their business, asset creation and other 
requirements which has benefitted lakhs of customers, we stand tall as an 
industry leader. 
We have significant presence in Tamil Nadu (including corporate 
headquarters in Chennai), Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and 
Madhya Pradesh. We have also started making early in-roads in the states 
of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh,.  
It is significant to note that a large part of our branch presence is in tier 
3, tier 4, tier 5 and tier 6 cities and towns, which are semi-urban and rural 
geographies with rapid population growth, largely devoid of access to 
formal sources of financial services.
A formidable workforce of over 7,000 employees work tirelessly to help the 
organization continue on its stellar growth path. Of these, around 6,000 
employees are field agents, who help take our business to prospective and 
existing customers in every nook and corner of geographies where we are 
present.
Vision
Reaching the Unreached through suitable credit solutions.
Five Star has been attempting to bridge the credit gap in the market over 
the last couple of decades, extending financial service to the un-banked 
and under-banked sections of the society. This in turn, contributes to 
narrowing the socio-economic divide between urban and semi-urban/rural 
parts (to a large extent consisting of underprivileged segments of society) 
and helps achieve higher living standards. 
With years of experience and a sound understanding of the financing 
industry, Five Star strives to grow even farther while staying true to its 
vision.

Mission
Provide appropriate credit solutions to the hitherto unreached segment 
of the market by developing a niche underwriting model, built towards 
evaluating the twin strengths of the borrowers' intention to repay and 
ability to repay, with the ultimate objectives of increasing customers 
satisfaction and maximising stakeholders returns
What does ‘ESG’ mean to us? 
There is increasing awareness that businesses do not operates in silos. 
Social and environmental value created by organizations has come to be 
recognized as being critical and continue to gain importance, indicating 
a paradigm shift from the traditional metrices that defined business 
successes only in financial terms. Corporates world-over have also 
recognized that they have an important role to play in fostering social 
equity and creating opportunities for development of members of the 
communities in which they operate. There is increasing realization that 
business growth is intricately interlinked with the growth and wellbeing 
of communities. Likewise, on the environmental front, every individual or 
93
business is exposed to the risks emanating from irreversible climate change 
and its consequences, to varying extents.   
Financing businesses have the distinction of being uniquely positioned 
to contribute to sustainable development by empowering people and 
businesses to meet their growth aspirations. This is even more true in our 
case, given that for a substantial part of our customer base, hitherto, there 
may not have been access to structured financial services.
We recognize the importance of taking cognizance of ESG related risks and 
opportunities for continued business success. Keeping this in minds, in FY

2022-23, we undertook extensive stakeholder engagements to determine 
‘material’ ESG issues.
Stakeholder Engagement & Materiality Assessment 
Five Star accords paramount importance to setting high standards in 
corporate governance and creating social value. We recognize that there 
are a host of stakeholders with whom the organization interacts on a day-
to-day basis, who are impacted by the organization and its operations. 
The table below summarizes our key stakeholders and existing channels of 
engagement and topics of interest.
Materiality Assessment
It is important to understand ESG issues that may be of relative priority to 
each  stakeholder groups and which also have the potential to impact the 
organization in its journey to excellence.
During the reporting year, we undertook a materiality assessment exercise 
to strengthen stakeholder relationships and understand their views on a 
host of ESG issues relevant to Five Star. The study also reviewed industry 
trends, regulatory requirements and performance of peers to firm up on 
issues that may  be material to us.
Our approach to the materiality assessment  process and the material 
issues identified are highlighted below:

Five Star sees an opportunity to contribute to 
India's growth story by meeting the financial 
services needs of underserved segments. Access 
to structured finance could be a game-changer for 
MSMEs, entrepreneurs and small businesses which 
employ millions of people.
Financial services is an industry that is highly 
regulated and compliance driven. Multiple risks 
may arise from ongoing/ quick changes in the 
markets and the regulatory environment for the 
sector.
Five Star stands for good corporate 
governance and ethical business 
practises and has created strong 
governance 
frameworks 
and 
polices. Please refer the Corporate 
Governance Report for details of 
how our Corporate Governance 
structures 
work 
effectively 
to 
safeguard the organization from 
compliance and other risks.
Positive: Making financial services accessible 
offers strong growth prospects for the Company 
while also contributing to the national aspirations 
of achieving financial inclusion. 
Negative: 
Non-compliance/ 
any 
negative 
sentiments about our Corporate Governance may 
adversely affect our ability to raise fresh capital 
and threaten business continuity. In our case, 
the corollary has been observed to be true, i.e., 
recognition for strong corporate governance has 
been facilitating fresh investments in Five Star from 
financing partners from world-wide

We view employees as the Company's most valued 
asset and accord top priority to ensuring their 
wellbeing. 
In its functioning, Five Star engages with a host of 
stakeholders, each with different sets of priorities, 
governed by different sets of rules/conventions for 
engagement.
N.A
Positive: Our motivated workforce has been one 
of the cornerstones for our continued success. Our 
on-field employees are the principal touch-points 
for our customers; business prospects and the 
reputation of our brand are significantly influenced 
by how our employees engage with the customers. 
For this reason, employees receive appropriate 
trainings and are also rewarded by schemes such 
as ‘Lakshathipathi’. Please refer the ensuing Social 
section for details.
Negative: Weakness in stakeholder engagement 
& management might have a detrimental effect 
on the Company's brand, market standing, and 
clientele. Each stakeholder group is to be handled 
with due care, responding to their reasonable 
expectations and maintaining legal compliance.

To achieve our business objectives and provide 
long-term value for all our stakeholders, Five Star 
has recognised effective risk management as a 
key enabler. The Company has identified key risk 
categories and suitable safeguards. It is also in the 
process of identifying and integrating key ESG risks 
into the overall risk management framework. 
Digitization of business operations can contribute 
to improving service delivery quality and efficiency 
for last-mile solutions, including customer service 
and experience. Use of technology and linked data 
systems has the potential  to facilitate smooth 
client base growth.
Positive: Framework for risk management and 
effective risk supervision provided by the Risk 
Committee has helped the Company tide through 
challenges included the  COVID-19 pandemic, with 
efficiency. Effective risk management helped the 
business resume on its growth path in quick time.

N.A
Governance
At Five Star Business Finance, we believe that a sound corporate governance 
is integral to building long-term value for our stakeholders. Our operations 
are guided by an effective Board, that comprises industry stalwarts with 
decades of experience to their credit. 
The key pillars of our governance paradigm are accountability, 
transparency, fairness, and righteous behaviour. We have ensured that an 
effective governance framework is put in place based on these principles to 
safeguard the long-term interests of all our stakeholders including minority 
and individual shareholders. This is epitomized by the fact that several of 
our Board Committees (Audit Committee, Nomination and Remuneration 
committee, Risk Management Committee, IT Strategy Committee, 
Stakeholder Relationship Committee etc) are headed by Independent 
Directors.
BOARD LEVEL COMMITTEES
•	 Audit Committee
•	 Nomination and Remuneration Committee
•	 Corporate Social Responsibility Committee
•	 Business and Resource Committee
•	 Asset Liability Committee
•	 Risk Management Committee
•	 IT Strategy Committee
•	 Stakeholders Relationship Committee
Our strong governance framework enables us to improve our operational 
efficiency, boost financial returns, and reduce risks while ensuring 
compliance with applicable regulations. Periodic internal reviews are 
carried out to validate the functioning of the Management and the 
governance structures of the Company, including the Board and its 
committees. This goes a long way in ensuring that the organization adheres 
to its stated goals and business objectives, while staying true to its vision 
and mission. 
We have a comprehensive set of policies and guidelines that govern our 
actions. These policies provide a clear framework for decision making 
and are backed up by appropriate risk management frameworks to 
ensure compliance. In-line with the materiality assessment conducted 
and recognizing the rising importance of the ESG in our business, we have 
developed an ESG policy that has been reviewed and approved by our 
Board. The policy can be accessed in the link: ESG-Policy.pdf

Risk Management
At Five Star, we recognise multiple risks including strategic, regulatory, and 
operational risks that can put our finances, human resources, physical, 
informational, and intellectual property assets as well as our reputation 
at risk. Like any other business, our business is also exposed to various 
internal and external risks, and we ensure that these risks are identified 
through a structured process. We have placed the ‘unlent’ segment as our 
top priority and have developed a clear strategy to analyse and mitigate the 
potential risks arising from such a business proposition.
We have identified the below mentioned risks as primary and have clear 
policies and procedures in place for monitoring and mitigation of the same.
Our business priority is to connect with consumers residing largely outside 
of major cities and have the willingness to use trustworthy, established 
loan channels to fund their business or personal needs.
The independent risk assessment, tracking, and control tasks are facilitated 
by Five Star's independent risk governance structure.
The Risk Management Policy has been posted on the website of the 
Company and is available on the web link: Risk-Management.pdf.
Business Ethics & Transparency
At Five Star, we submit any cases relating to ethics & transparency to the 
Audit Committee which monitors them until satisfactory resolution. These 
are also documented rigorously and included in the minutes of the Audit 
Committee’s meetings. We have a well entrenched compliance framework 
managed by a capable team that ensures the Company's policies and 
business practices are in line with our established code. The stakeholders 
can file complaints about any unethical practices, misconduct, or 
grievances. We proactively maintain an ethics helpline that allows our 
employees to voice concerns or any incident of non-compliance. Every 
employee must immediately report to the management ethics helpline any 
real or potential breach of the Code, as well as any event of misconduct, 
misdemeanour, or act not in the best interests of the Company. 
Digitization
We are striving to digitise every aspect of our business as a means to 
facilitating ease of conducting business. Our front-facing employees' 
interactions with consumers are used to raise awareness of digital 
repayment options available, thereby reducing the need for handling/
transacting in physical cash. We take delight in observing a rise in online 
transactions during the previous fiscal year.
Data Privacy & Security
At Five Star, we have made significant progress in the recent years in data 
protection and cybersecurity. To reduce risks brought about by increasing 
complexities in the cyberspace, we have embraced cutting-edge technology, 
such the Amazon cloud platform, periodic Information Technology audits, 
vulnerability assessments and penetration testing carried out by an 
independent third party agency. We are increasingly switching to SaaS 
models, hosting partners like Salesforce or Oracle to minimise the risks. 
As already stated, an independent information technology audit was 
conducted during the previous fiscal year.
Social
Financial Inclusion
Our organisational motto has been "Reaching the Unreached" or in other 
words “Lending to the Unlent”. By providing financial services to the 
‘unbanked and under-banked’ segments of society, we open the door to 
financial inclusion and economic empowerment to the masses. Our loans 
range from INR 1 lakh to 10 lakhs with the average ticket size being around 
INR 3 to 5 lakhs and help our customers cover their business or personal 
needs.
The consumers of Five Star predominantly avail loans for meeting their 
business requirements. They are typically first-time borrowers to the 
secured borrowing space in the formal financial ecosystem, who may not 
have been focused upon by large banks or other financial institutions. 
While about 25% of our customers are completely new-to-credit, we are 
the first formal lender providing a loan of the size mentioned above, to 
more than 75% of our customers and this is probably their first experience 
of availing a secured borrowing from a structured financial organization. 
To cater to such customers,  a significant part of our branch presence is in 
Tier-3 and below cities and towns, which have limited presence of other 
structured players.

Our unwavering focus on such a customer base has resulted in a steady

Group. This reiterates our belief on our core business strategy and also 
creates positive societal value.
Given the favourable demography of the country, the credit business has 
large potential, particularly funding the demand from micro-entrepreneurs

Giving people from less fortunate circumstances access to formal credit and 
financial services safeguards them from exploitation and empowers them 
to fight the cycle of poverty, fosters inclusive progress and social peace. 
The knowledge and experience gained so far in our journey along with the 
strong brand credentials established in this segment augurs well for the 
next leg of growth for the Company towards building a robust portfolio. 
Customer Relationship Management
The success of Five Star is based on the confidence and steadfastness of our 
clients, and prioritizing meeting client needs. The organisation has made 
efforts in this direction through campaigns for financial literacy, product 
creation, innovation, and personnel training and development.  
We have established robust systems for customer grievance management. 
As a standard practice, we respond to customers within 10 days from 
receiving their complaints. In case the customer feels their grievances may 
not have been handled appropriately, they have the option of escalating 
their concerns to the Grievance Redressal Officer.  The Grievance Redressal 
officer is mandated to respond again within 10 working days. Issues that 
have not been resolved at this level too, may then be escalated to the Head 
of Risk & Compliance, who also serves as the Company's Principal Nodal 
Officer.
Grievance Redressal Mechanism
•	 Number: 044 - 2346 0957 / 044 - 2346 0958 / 78258 55555
•	 Email: customercare@fivestargroup.in
•	 Customers can get in touch with the branch and voice their compliants to 
the personnel. The compliant must be entered in the Branch's Compliant 
Register.
•	 Customers can file written compliants with branch manager of the 
branch where they obtained the loan by submitting a letter
In rare cases of non-resoultion at Company level, complainants may also 
reach out to the Reserve Bank of India, which oversees operations of non-
banking financial institutions.
However, most of the complaints are resolved at the Company level itself, 
which is a sign of our strong grievance redressal mechanism. A very small 
percentage of complaints get escalated to the regulator and even these

has been able to provide satisfactory responses to the regulator leading to 
closure of such complaints.  
We also have an Internal Ombudsman, who is an independent person 
looking at the merit of the complaints received, and resolutions provided 
thereon. We have not had any instance of the Ombudsman disagreeing 
with the view of the Company on the merits of complaints received at the 
Ombudsman office or from the regulator.
Talent Management and Retention
Our team of high-performing personnel are closely correlated with the 
organization's consistency in providing the best-in-class services. Our 
employees are our biggest assets and have been instrumental to our 
success since inception.
We select the ideal candidate from the market to ensure that top talents 
comprise our workforce at all levels. Recruitment in the Company is 
undertaken by a highly experienced team of Human Resource Personnel 
who identify and onboard candidates dynamically.
We are an equal opportunity employer and hire employees for permanent 
and contract positions. All our employees are on-roll employees and we do 
not engage any off the roll employees, as this may jeopardise their career 
prospects. For any senior and mid-level recruitment, internal applicants 
are primarily explored; the role extends to the external job market when the 
position does not get filled internally. In the last financial year, 771 number 
of employees were promoted to the managerial positions internally.

of the job. We reject all types of unjust and illegal discrimination. 
Diversity, Inclusion and Equity policy is available in the following weblink: 
Diversity-Inclusion-and-Equity-Policy.pdf.
While we have significant number of women employees in our corporate 
office, the overall percentage of women in the organization not being high 
is attributable to the fact that a majority of the organisation’s employees 
are field officers. While the Company is open to hiring women candidates 
for such positions, the job demands – i.e., job being predominantly travel 
based, having to securely carry cash from customers to the branch and 
having to work odd-hours at times – seem to be detrimental to women 
actively joining our ranks. We are actively working towards enhancing 
the number of women employees, where possible, in the face of such 
challenges.
Human Rights
Since inception, Five Star has grown and thrived based on a culture of 
treating people with respect, empathy and dignity. We ensure that our 
interaction with all stakeholders including employees and customers 
respect the core principles and practises of Human Rights. We have a zero-
tolerance policy regarding all forms of discrimination and harassment 
(including sexual harassment) at the workplace. Suitable trainings are 
provided to employees regarding important human rights issues.
No cases of sexual harassement or any other forms of human rights 
violations have been reported in the current year.
Community Engagement
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is essential to our organisation as 
we seek to establish Five Star’s credentials as a good corporate citizen. We 
have adopted a CSR strategy that enables us to improve the lives of the 
communities we impact. Our social initiatives are centred around four focus 
areas—Education, Skill Development, Health and Hygiene and Community 
Conservation. The CSR Committee of the Board coordinates and monitors 
our CSR functions to ensure the successful implementation of our initiatives 
and creating desired positive impact. The committee meets at least once 
every quarter to discuss progress and the way forward. The Board receives 
a quarterly status report on the execution of CSR programmes.
 As part of our annual CSR action plan, we have undertaken activities in the 
following areas under the Schedule VII of the Companies Act:
•	 Livelihood – Eradicating hunger, poverty, and malnutrition, promoting 
healthcare including preventive healthcare, sanitation and making 
available safe drinking water

Other areas – Ensuring environmental sustainability, ecological balance,

Environment
A key component of sustainable development is the environmental 
wellbeing. While environmental issues were traditionally thought to be 
less important than economic considerations, recent challenges such as 
climate change and water scarcity have been global in nature, not sparing 
any industry sectors, including financial services.
We maintain compliance with all applicable environmental regulations 
and aim to ensure that the environmental risks are identified and managed 
judiciously through all stages of operations.

Energy and Emission Management
Our direct energy consumption includes the usage of fuel such as diesel in 
DG set in headquarter (Chennai) and central hub offices in Andhra Pradesh 
and Karnataka. Indirect energy consumption includes the electricity 
purchased from the grid. Effective energy control and usage will not only 
help us to reduce our carbon footprint but also allow us to reduce costs, 
improve business sustainability and mitigate risks arising from the evolving 
climate situation.

Waste Management
We strive to increase operational eco-efficiency in our business by moving 
towards digital and paper-less transactions.
All e-wastes from our operations are duly disposed through authorized 
recyclers in-line with regulatory requirements.  Our operations do not 
otherwise carry any other significant risks or opportunities in the space of 
waste management.  
Water Management
Our water consumption is minimal and limited to personnel use only (i.e., 
for use in toilets, pantries etc). We ensure there is no water wastage at our 
corporate head office and have installed water efficient fixtures. We are in 
the process of installing systems to track and report on water usage.
