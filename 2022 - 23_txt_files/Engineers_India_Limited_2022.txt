Governance, leadership and oversight
7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements
	
The energy industry is witnessing rapid transformation in the wake of energy transition scenarios towards mitigation of climate 
change across the globe. The challenges faced by the industry in this journey are preparing the ground to germinate opportunities for 
technology service providers like EIL to develop and deploy cost effective green technologies. In its long journey since inception, EIL has 
always been focused on providing innovative technological solutions to the energy industry and has always been aligning its strategy 
with the needs of the Indian energy sector as well as the global trends. EIL has contributed significantly in technology development 
and its commercialisation towards indigenization of technologies relevant for the oil and gas segment. Some of the key achievements 
of the company in shaping India’s energy landscape includes Auto Fuel Technologies including BS-VI, Residue Upgradation, Refinery & 
Petrochemical Integration, niche petrochemicals and as recent as Bio Fuels, Green Hydrogen to name a few. 
	
EIL has always aligned its objectives with the Environment, Social and Corporate Governance framework. The organisation’s new vision 
statement “To be a Global Leader Offering Total Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future” clearly showcase the company’s commitment 
in this direction. EIL has embarked on the national decarbonisation bandwagon and accelerated its efforts to achieve a Net Zero carbon 
emitting corporate ahead of the targeted year of 2035. In this line, the company is adopting multipronged strategies and developing 
state of the art less carbon intensive technological solutions both on its own and in collaboration with reputed institutions in India 
and overseas. For instance, EIL is implementing one of the Bio-ATF projects in India in collaboration with CSIR-IIP, Dehradun that has a 
strong potential in decarbonizing the aviation sector. 
	
Cultural shift towards sustainability is one of the key ESG challenges faced by almost all the industrial sectors. EIL has taken several 
initiatives to create awareness among its stakeholders to adopt sustainable practices at work. For instance, the company has recently 
installed EV charging infrastructure at both its Head office and Gurugram office complex. These base charging facilities are anticipated 
to be a game changer in nudging employees to adopt EVs in the long run to commute from home to the workplace. This initiative has 
a strong bearing on reducing the organization’s scope-3 emission in the long run. The resultant augment in the scope-2 emissions shall 
be taken care by increasing the share of green power and adopting carbon offsetting mechanisms.
	
In addition, EIL took several initiatives to optimize the water and electricity consumption with strong emphasis on 3Rs principle (Reduce, 
Recycle and Reuse) of conservation of resources. The spillage of water reduced by installing water saving nozzles and water recovery 
from waste water streams at various office complexes of the organization in India. The generation of plastic and other waste materials 
in the office complexes has reduced by providing washable tea mugs to the employees. Also, there has been efforts by the organization 
to reduce the use of papers by gradually adopting digital interventions. It is worth noting that the company has augmented its solar 
power generation capability by installing additional 400 KW solar PV panels in the office premise to enhance its share of green power 
thereby reducing the Scope-2 emissions. 
	
Another important ESG imperative is the development of technologies or products which are sustainable. In this direction, EIL has 
also diversified its portfolio of products and services in the sunshine areas such as energy efficient infrastructure, Biofuels and Green 
Hydrogen. For instance, EIL implementing one of the Biorefineries in India for ABRPL (a JV of NRL, Fortum and Chempolis, OY, Finland) 
in Assam has strengthened EIL’s green technology portfolio. Further, EIL has also diversified its operation in the area of energy efficient 
infrastructure providing its services in building the GRIHA and LEED compliant infrastructure facilities, Data center etc. for its esteemed 
clientele. 
	
Finally, India's energy transition cannot be isolated with the rest of the world in light of changing geopolitical scenarios and technology 
running level of the development in the emerging areas of the energy sector across the globe. EIL has emerged as a key stakeholder 
in terms of providing ESG compliant sustainable low carbon technological solutions to the industrial sectors in their decarbonization 
journey.

Current Financial Year:
	
In its long journey of almost six decades, the role of EIL has been instrumental in building nation’s energy infrastructure. So far, EIL 
has developed several innovative technological solutions to address the climate change issues pertinent to its domain industries either 
on its own or in collaboration with private and public sector entities both in India and overseas. Sulphur Recovery Unit is one of the 
important units in the oil refinery and EIL has designed several Sulphur Recovery Units (SRU) in the past for its esteemed clients to 
mitigate emissions. EIL has continued its efforts in this direction in the current financial year as well and developed a unique process 
for preventing SO2 slippage into the Tail Gas Treating Unit (TGTU), part of the SRU block. Further, EIL executed collaborative agreements 
with reputed national laboratories and Oil majors to catapult its efforts towards environment and sustainability. Some of them includes, 
an agreement with CSIR-IIP and ONGC Energy Centre Trust (OECT) to develop a technology for recovery of rare gas from Natural Gas, 
Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with NRL for demonstration of technology for production of aqueous ammonia from ammonia rich 
sour gases generated in the refinery. These technologies would have a significant impact for mitigating emissions besides generating 
value added products. In an effort to decarbonize the aviation sector, EIL is providing its services for preparation of Basic Engineering and 
Design Package (BEDP) of BioATF plant for Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL). In the era of energy transition, EIL has 
uniquely positioned itself as carbon conscious knowledge company to address the needs of the energy sector. This can be reflected in its 
renewed vision “To be a Global Leader Offering Total Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future” and its commitment to achieve the net 
zero carbon emission by the year 2035.  Innovation and energy efficient technology development shall always remain two key strategic 
pillars to realize the organizational ESG targets in the upcoming years for the company.

Due to the nature of our business, solid waste generation is also fairly limited in EIL offices and restricted primarily to municipal solid 
waste (MSW). A major component of the solid waste generated is paper waste which is sent for recycling. Other wastes include e-waste 
and a small proportion of wastes like batteries, electrical waste, waste lube oil, etc. Our waste management practices seek to reduce 
the environmental impact of this limited waste to the extent possible by reduction in generation, segregation at source and proper 
management including recycling and disposal through authorized recyclers. Other mixed dry waste is sent to scrap dealers or municipal 
disposal. Also, EIL has state-of-the-art sewage treatment plants at its Gurugram, Chennai and Mumbai offices, wherein the treated sewage 
is recycled & reused for secondary applications within the office premises. Proper segregation philosophy is used for segregation of 
municipal wastes and is disposed through third party adopting standard practice as per applicable Municipal Waste handling Rules 2016. 
4.  
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity's activities (Yes /No). If yes, whether the waste collection 
plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken 
to address the same.
