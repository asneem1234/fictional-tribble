AT HAVELLS, WE CONTINUOUSLY STRIVE TO ACHIEVE EXCELLENCE IN MANUFACTURING 
AND BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL. WE ARE INVESTING CONSISTENTLY 
IN AUGMENTING OUR CAPACITIES AND ENHANCING EFFICIENCIES TO REINFORCE OUR 
LEADERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY. 
Manufacturing
Smarter. Sustainable. Self-Reliant.
We are recognised for our high 
quality products and manufacturing 
strength powered by deep innovation 
capabilities and sustainable practices. 
Regular and astute investments in 
manufacturing and R&D have enabled 
us to build a scalable portfolio. Our 
constant endeavour is to sharpen our 
manufacturing edge on all fronts – 
quality, operational efficiency, optimal 
use of assets, high level of automation, 
and backward integration. 
Manufacturing is one of the core 
strengths of the company wherein 
focus is on quality, scale and 
efficiency. The initial motivation for 
own manufacturing was the need to 
compete with high quality international 
brands and low cost imported 
alternatives. While Government’s 
recent initiatives such as ‘Make in 
While achieving self-reliance 
and sustainable growth, 
we are well-positioned 
to deliver through our 
commitment to  
‘Make in India’.
India’ have helped to create awareness 
towards local manufacturing, Havells 
has been practising this philosophy 
for over the last several decades. First 
large-scale manufacturing unit was set 
up in Alwar, Rajasthan in the year 1996 
for manufacturing Cables, followed by 
an internationally benchmarked setup 
for Switchgear in Baddi, Himachal 
Pradesh in the year 2003. The setting 
up of plants has since picked up pace 
and now Havells has 15 manufacturing 
units and 90% of the products sold are 
being manufactured in-house. 
This provides us full control over the 
quality and design of the product as 
well as the supply chain. 
Company’s investment in research 
complements the manufacturing 
setup and helps to develop innovative 
products. Moreover, In-house 
manufacturing helps in achieving the 
sustainability goals of the Company 
with focus on increasing use of 
green energy and responsible waste 
management.
Havells India Limited

Scale with flexibility: In-house 
manufacturing gives us full control 
over the supply chain and remain 
lean in terms of inventories. It enables 
us to ensure flexibility in operations 
and better manage the changes 
in customer demands owing to 
seasonality or change in consumer 
sentiments. 
Quality consciousness: Product 
quality along with best-in-class 
performance is the most crucial 
factor for us. We implement the best 
practices in manufacturing processes 
to ensure delivery of outstanding 
customer experience. We have also 
digitised our quality control processes 
and have been running various internal 
programs such as Six Sigma, Golden 
Hands, Quality by design, etc. 
Product differentiation: Product 
differentiation has been one of our 
biggest strengths and distinguishes 
us in the marketplace. Our products 
are known for their unique qualities, 
distinct features, and strong value 
proposition. Successful product 
differentiation leads to brand loyalty 
and ability to charge the right price and 
also ensures protection of intellectual 
property in the form of designs and 
technology adoption. 
Cost efficiencies: The production 
engineers and workers go through 
a learning curve while establishing 
manufacturing process. This leads 
to lower manufacturing costs, 
better efficiencies, and productivity 
improvement.
Customisation: Our in-house 
manufacturing operations give us the 
flexibility to customise products as 
per diverse customer requirements. 
This is particularly useful for the B2B 
business where product offerings can 
be adapted to the requirements of the 
customers. 
Marketing advantage: Showcasing 
our robust manufacturing infrastructure 
to channel partners and key customers 
serves as a marketing tool to 
enhance our brand recall. It boosts 
the confidence of the sales team and 
trade partners, assuring them of good 
quality, consistency, and technological 
superiority.
In another significant achievement, we crossed the unique milestone of achieving 50 crores MCB pole production cumulatively 
till now, a level achieved by a few companies globally. This achievement is the testimony of our sustained focus on innovation 
and manufacturing capabilities. 
Our product is now exported to almost 70+ countries and we are a reliable partner to leading global OEMs. What makes us 
unique is our depth of manufacturing with world-class tool room, plastic & sheet metal part manufacturing, automatic  
sub-assembly & testing machines. 
Our manufacturing infrastructure enables us with the following advantages:
During the year, we expanded our manufacturing base with the addition of Lloyd AC plant in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, India. 
While the new plant is expected to double our AC production capacity, it will also expand our manufacturing presence into the 
southern region of India.

Message from the Chairman  
and Managing Director
OUR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS,
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE INTEGRATED REPORT OF YOUR 
COMPANY FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2022-23. YOUR COMPANY DELIVERED A HEALTHY 
PERFORMANCE DESPITE A CHALLENGING MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, OWING TO 
INVESTMENTS IN ITS STRATEGIC PILLARS AND EFFICIENT EXECUTION. 
“We are proud of the Havells culture
developed over the past few decades
which evolves around customer
centricity, entrepreneurship, equality,
empathy, and ethics. Being customer 
centric enables us to deliver the 
highest level of service to our set of 
customers, including our channel 
partners and end consumers”
Performance was broad-based with 
each of the business segments 
contributing to the growth. The quality 
and consistency of our results reflect 
our competitive edge and consumer 
affinity. Your Company continued to 
meet consumers’ needs and improve 
the consumer experience, making 
meaningful progress on the entire 
portfolio.
Highlights of the Year
After three years of COVID-led 
disruptions, FY 2022-23 was in contrast 
a wholesome year. The year saw a very 
encouraging start with both B2B and 
B2C demand momentum continuing 
from the previous year; however, 
commodity price pressures impacted 
the B2C end markets, particularly in 
the second half of the year. Despite 
shrinkages in consumer spending, 
your Company continued the growth 
trajectory with a strong product portfolio 
and brand. 
It was heartening to see Lloyd regaining 
market share in the AC segment to 
be amongst the top 3 players in the 
industry. We believe that Lloyd is now 
well positioned to leverage the AC 
performance to spur growth of other 
products such as washing machines and 
refrigerators.
Continued commodity price increases 
asserted pressures on the margins as 
your Company took calibrated price 
increases, albeit not commensurate to 
the raw material cost increases. Margins 
in cables division and Lloyd witnessed 
volatility given sharp commodity price 
fluctuations.
A healthy balance sheet and strong 
cash flow generation provided us 
ample headroom to continue investing 
strategically in our growth while 
maintaining a consistent dividend pay-
out to our shareholders.
Sticking to Basics
We are proud of the Havells culture 
developed over the past few decades 
which evolves around customer 
centricity, entrepreneurship, equality, 
empathy, and ethics. Being customer-
centric enables us to deliver the highest 
level of service to our set of customers, 
including our channel partners and end 
Havells India Limited
10
consumers. Being ethical, empathic, 
fair, and equal to every stakeholder stem 
from being entrepreneurial, where even 
the most routine task is done with an 
ownership mindset.
Your Company continued its strategy 
of investing in the long-term growth 
drivers, including brand, omni-channel, 
innovation, digitisation, and talent. Our 
brands continue to command top-of-
the-mind awareness and is trusted 
by our customers. Our omni-channel 
approach ensures that brand reaches 
out to a wide set of customers giving 
a seamless experience whether it is 
traditional channel or modern formats. 
True to our DNA of continuously 
innovating, we expanded our team 
of engineers who are working across 
businesses to boost capabilities and 
serving consumers even better. Digital 
continues to remain a priority, as 
we made significant progress in our 
digitisation journey, which is acting as 
an enabler, partner, and driver of the 
business. Equally, we continue to ensure 
a great fusion of professional rigour and 
entrepreneurial mindset in our talent 
pool. I am glad to share that our success 
over the years has been deeply rooted 
in the human capital we have developed 
and nurtured at Havells. 
Our focussed investments have 
supported us to deliver across cycles, 
navigating multiple macroeconomic 
disruptions. We envisage continuity 
in our approach to build a strong and 
durable foundation for the next phase of 
growth trajectory.
Manufacturing: Smart. 
Sustainable. Self-Reliant
At Havells, manufacturing has been one 
of the key pillars. It ensures superior 
quality standards while also providing 
high level of agility towards changing 
customer needs and market dynamics. 
Complemented with strong R&D, it 
allows us to stand out with differentiated 
offerings, premiumisation, and higher 
customer loyalty. We continuously aspire 
to minimise waste, reduce our carbon 
footprint and ensure that our products 
are produced ethically and sustainably. 
Full control over sourcing also ensures 
right mix of strategic partners along with 
higher level of self-reliance. We believe 
this keeps a check on our costs and 
enables us to tide over disruptions. 
Building on this belief, during the year, 
our new Lloyd AC plant in Sri City, 
Andhra Pradesh was commissioned. 
The capacity expansion is aligned with 
our growth aspiration of tapping into the 
larger consumer durables opportunity. 
With such strategic investments over 
the past few years, we have built a 
formidable full-stack consumer  
durable play.
ESG
Environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) issues are becoming increasingly 
important for companies across 
industries. At Havells, sustainability has 
always been on our topmost agenda. 
We truly believe that in the long run, the 
companies which integrate sustainability 
with their business strategy will thrive 
and succeed. During FY 2022-23,  
Havells continued to focus on the 
aspects of ESG that would work 
towards building an inclusive society. 
We had published our first sustainability 
report in 2012-13 and through a 
persistent and structured set of 
measures in last 10 years of our ESG 
journey have made consistent progress 
towards our ESG goals. FY 2022-23 
was a landmark year in our journey for 
sustainable value creation and overall 
climate resilience. There was a 61% 
reduction in GHG & Energy Intensity 
from base year FY 2012-13. Utilising 
eco-friendly, lightweight, and sustainable 
product designs to create new products 
are some of the steps that have been 
taken to strengthen environmental 
responsibility. With diversity also 
being one of the focus areas, we are 
targeting to run the entire operations 
by 100% female workers at our newly 
commissioned plant in Sri City. 
We are also happy to announce that 
we have launched the Havells ESG 2.0 
framework, which serves as a launchpad 
for this decade of action. It comprises of 
the key performance indicators across 
ESG parameters that are of material 
relevance to our company and its 
stakeholders, now and into the future. 
The main focus areas that will top the 
agenda are achievement of emission 
reduction targets, capacity enhancement 
of solar-based renewable energy 
generation, reduction in energy intensity, 
gender diversity, life cycle assessment 
etc.
Outlook
The challenges around inflationary 
pressures may continue to impact the 
business outlook in the short term. 
However, we are positive about the 
medium to long-term growth and 
profitability outlook. 
I want to take this opportunity to 
express my sincere gratitude to our 
Board of Directors, employees, valued 
consumers, channel partners, suppliers, 
and our shareholders for their continued 
support and contribution to our shared 
success.
Regards,
Anil Rai Gupta

Key risks 
Risk response 
Geographical & 
channel concentration
Excessive dependence on a 
geography or channel with respect 
to key product categories and 
customers increases vulnerability 
to economic events and changing 
customer preferences. 
Capitals at risk: 
•	 Expanding beyond urban, we now lead rural penetration through:
o	 Distributor presence in 3,000 towns (10,000-50,000 population) covering 
42,000+ retail points through Rural Vistaar initiative 
o	 Presence in towns with <10,000 population through 400+ Havells UTSAV 
exclusive store in FY 2022-23, which is targeted to be increased to 2,000 by 
FY 2023-24
•	 We sell products through multiple channels like MFR/RR, CPC/CSD and 
e-commerce. Separate teams manage each channel with dedicated focus and 
follow different models to avoid conflicts. 
Technological obsolescence
Inability to timely leveraging 
technology to meet customer 
expectation and technological 
obsolescence may render products 
outdated.
Capitals at risk: 
•	 We ensure world-class product innovations powered by leading technology, 
design and UX (User Experience)
•	 We leverage our strategic investments to rapidly innovate consumer-centric 
products with potential for sizeable revenue contribution
Key product innovations and technology upgrades in FY 2022-23:
•	 Havells Studio Meditate Air Purifier
•	 Q-Tron MCCB Range
•	 Glamtubes and Nimbus downlights
•	 Premium BLDC Fans: Stealth Prime BLDC, Stealth Neo BLDC
•	 Lloyd ACs with AQI Indicator and on device voice (ODV) features
•	 Otto and Orizzonte storage water heater (new form factor)
Brand positioning and impact of 
digitalisation and social media
Possibility of negative impact 
on brand image and reputation 
by some events / social media 
activities.
Capitals at risk: 
•	 We have a Digital Command & Control Centre for engaging, addressing 
grievances, taking feedback and conducting sentiment analysis of customers 
(both online and offline)
•	 Established system for online reputation management that drives positive 
sentiment among consumers via digital media activities
•	 In FY 2022-23, we ran over 25+ digital campaigns
SUMMARY OF KEY RISKS AND THEIR RESPONSE
We have mapped our risk and responses to respective capitals. Key responses with respect to top identified risks are as under:
Havells India Limited
18
Key risks 
Risk response 
Compliance risk
Risk of non-compliance to laws and 
regulations and challenges of bad 
governance. 
Capitals at risk: 
•	 We ensure ‘zero-tolerance’ approach to non-compliance. Compliance status 
and exceptions (if any) are reported to Senior Management, Audit Committee 
and Board of Directors. Further, compliance refresh is done semi-annually
•	 Consequence Management Grid is prepared to gain insight on true impact of 
risks
•	 Our Internal Audit team (in-house and outsourced) undertake periodical 
business process review across locations
Protection of intellectual 
property (IP) rights & 
counterfeit products
Inability to protect IPs and 
counterfeit products can lead to 
opportunity losses and even cost 
brand reputation. 
Capitals at risk: 
•	 We have a defined mechanism to protect our IPs (trademarks, logos, patents, 
and product design) which include registering under relevant acts
•	 Appropriate civil and criminal actions are taken, both domestically and 
internationally, for any IP infringements
Material management 
Fluctuation in currency, 
commodity prices and 
import dependency can impact 
production and margins. 
Capitals at risk: 
	
•	 We use average price modelling, linked to LME or related indexes, to purchase 
key commodities of copper, aluminium, steel, engineering plastics etc. These 
prices are further benchmarked against current domestic and international 
market prices
•	 We have identified several alternate sources for buying critical parts and raw 
materials for de-risking
•	 Import dependency has been reduced to less than ~20% of total sourcing

INTEGRATED 
MANUFACTURING 
OPERATIONS
Aligned with the ‘Make in India’ 
philosophy, we manufacture over 90% 
of our products in-house. We have fully 
integrated manufacturing set-up across 
all our plants. During the year, we 
invested in setting up a new greenfield 
manufacturing plant spread across 45 
acres in the most modern industrial 
area of South India at Sri City near 
Chennai. With this, we now have 15 
state-of-the-art manufacturing plants 
spread across 8 locations in India. 
Each plant is equipped with high 
depth of in-house manufacturing 
with all major components being 
produced under the same roof. 
The “Quality first” is in-built in the 
operations which ensures production 
of a reliable product with a longer 
life and consistent performance. In 
addition, we are consistently investing 
in upgradation and establishment of 
the most modern manufacturing set-
up and optimum level of automation. 
Across the plants, we have automatic 
high-tech machines procured from 
Japan, Europe and other leading 
manufacturers across the globe. 
INDUSTRY 4.0
With more than 20,000 SKUs across 
the plants, we believe that Operational 
Excellence at the factory is paramount, 
and hence a roadmap has been drawn 
for implementation and strengthening 
of various key initiatives. Global 
benchmarking of manufacturing 
plants have helped us in continuous 
upgradation of manufacturing set-up 
to take it to Industry 4.0 standards. 
Across the plants, section-by-section 
analysis is done for promoting 
digitisation and use of Internet of 
Things (IoT). 
We have undertaken several steps 
for enhancing operational efficiency, 
upgrading machines and processes 
and making them digitally connected. 
Our intent is to maximise the use of 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, 
and Cloud Computing to raise the 
performance standards and drive the 
next chapter of Industry 4.0. 
NEW MANUFACTURING 
PLANT AT SRI CITY 
NEAR CHENNAI, INDIA
Our new greenfield manufacturing 
plant at Sri City near Chennai adds 
to the AC manufacturing capacity to 
produce 1 million ACs per year. With 
this addition, we have now 2 million 
ACs per year capacity (including 
Ghiloth). It is a fully-integrated and 
best-in-class plant with majority of 
the parts produced in-house. It will 
facilitate production of ACs in every 20 
seconds and will increase exports and 
sales to South Indian markets. We have 
in place a product testing laboratory, 
NABL accredited which allows us 
to make and test ACs for extreme 
test parameters. The use of robotic 
points and AGVs ensures deskilling 
of operation and lower manual 
dependence thereby delivering high 
productivity at global quality standards. 
We make our own Heat Exchangers 
here both for the Evaporator and the 
Condenser. These are made on globally 
best standard Japanese machines. We 
make high class plastic moulded parts 
for Indoor units, produced on world 
best fully electric Japanese Moulding 
Machines. The copper tubing section 
produces 100% in-house parts helping 
in maintaining high quality standards. 
This is a significant step and will 
reduce our dependence on the import 
of components in line with the Make in 
India vision of the Government of India.

Indoor air pollution is the degradation of 
indoor air quality by harmful chemicals and 
other materials; it can be up to 10 times 
worse than outdoor air pollution
This is because contained areas enable 
potential pollutants to build up more than

Various studies in India have reported 
harmful effects of indoor air pollution

WHILE ENSURING THEIR SAFETY AND WELFARE.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
We strive to foster people 
empowerment and imbibe an 
entrepreneurial zeal amongst our 
employees. Our managers aim to build 
a strong culture of putting people 
first while also focussing on serving 
our customers and communities. The 
people engagement charter has both 
strategic as well as tactical initiatives 
which are deployed at all levels across 
the organisation.
The Great Place to Work, India, has 
recognised Havells as India's Best 
WorkplacesTM, Building a Culture of 
Innovation by All, among the Top 50 
large organisations. This recognition 
identifies us as having successfully 
inspired our employees to innovate 
by fostering a culture that encourages 
and empowers them to try new and 
better ways of doing things. It is also 
a testimony, that we excel in people 
practices supporting innovation 
and creating a culture that nurtures 
innovation.
WORKPLACE SAFETY
The focus on employee safety 
continued with regular management 
reviews backed up with the rigorous 
regimen of safety drills, zone-wise daily 
audits, addressing fire safety using 
247 check points, training, inter-plant 
safety assessments, third party audits, 
and strengthening of the infrastructure. 
There was a large-scale involvement 
of our employees in the safety agenda 
through dedicated Kaizen Safety 
months. The number of safety kaizens 
increased from 2,500 in FY 2021-22 to 
3,131 in FY 2022-23. Workplace Safety 
& Implementation of Safety Culture 
is an ongoing journey and would 
continue to be our focus area.
TALENT DEVELOPMENT
We continuously promote learning and 
development in our organisation, and 
this year, there was a renewed focus on 
enhancing organisational capabilities 
for the future. We concentrated on 
hiring young people while also building 
capabilities of our existing talent pools.
From campuses, we made offers 
for about 212 final placements. 
We covered the best engineering, 
management institutes and 
polytechnics for campus selections to 
hire young Post-Graduate Trainees, 
Engineers, Management Trainees, 
and Diploma Engineer Interns. This 
is being done across functions viz. 
Sales & Marketing, E-Commerce, 
Manufacturing, R&D, Supply Chain, 
Packaging, etc. We also engaged 58 
summer interns. The idea of taking 
interns is to give them projects and 
assess them for PPOs (Pre-Placement 
Offers) next year. 
We have also created an organisation-
wide Learning & Development (L&D) 
framework across every level of the 
organisation. A career development 
centre “Pragati’ was launched for 
our frontline salespeople to become 
first-level managers. For our first-
level sales managers, a management 
development program called ‘Unnati’ 
was conducted. A learning and 
development roadmap has also been 
prepared for Plant Operations which 
would be rolled out next year. Our 
internal Learning Management System 
(LMS) ‘Saksham’ is being further 
augmented to meet the emerging 
learning needs and enhanced learner 
experience (LXP).
We completed a Talent Mapping 
exercise, for critical roles, so that we 
have a clear visibility of our internal 
talent, for meeting the Company’s 
future growth aspirations. To build 
leadership capabilities, a 360 degree 
feedback exercise was conducted 
covering multiple senior managers. 
This would be backed with individual 
feedback reports which would support 
their development plans. 
We also executed our talent strategy 
by completing the target of building 
a whole new team for our green 
field project in Sri City, through 
a combination of internal talent 
movement and lateral hires. This was 
done in a short span of five months 
which has been one of the contributing 
factors towards the successful early 
commissioning of the project. 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
We have undertaken meaningful efforts 
to foster diversity in our workforce. We 
understand that diversity of thoughts, 
backgrounds, and experiences adds 
value to the Company. As a progressive 
step to maximise gender diversity, it 
is our vision to make our new Sri City 
plant a role model within the Company, 
by targeting close to inducting 100% 
women on the shop floor. Presently, 
women hold ~80% of the shop floor 
positions at this plant.
At Havells, we ensure that there is full 
adherence to the Code of Ethics and 
fair business practices. We follow a no-
discriminatory policy, and the Company 
believes in creating workspaces where 
a diverse set of people can contribute 
and thrive. This will continue to be our 
thrust area as we continue responding 
to the changing needs of our 
customers and work towards providing 
a framework that is best suited towards 
creating long-lasting, collaborative 
relationships.

to the society, we are carrying out third-party assessment of our 
plantation project at Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh to ascertain the Biomass 
accumulation/carbon capture – Carbon sequestration of our plantation 
project through Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM). The survival 
rate of the plantation is more than 90% across the compartments, which 
is reflective of good management. The total amount of CO2 sequestration 
potential of the plantation after the final harvest (60 years) would be 
430687 tonnes. Additionally, these plantations will also contribute to other 
ecological benefits during the entire silvicultural management.

In 2021, we associated with Plaksha University to make a 
meaningful impact in technological change and evolution. 
This has been one of our biggest initiatives from CSR 
standpoint. Plaksha University, located in Mohali, Punjab, is 
one of India’s largest collective philanthropy efforts to build a 
tech university of global eminence and aims to cover 1,500 
students and more than 100 faculty on campus over the next 
five years. 
On December 17, 2022, Plaksha University celebrated its 
first Founder’s Day where “Havells Research Building” was 
inaugurated. The Havells Research Building spaces like the 
Makerspace, Physical World Lab, Nature Machines Lab, 
and others are being constantly leveraged by students 
for tinkering, innovation and enhancing their development

Our Performance
Upskilling professionals
During the year, we undertook initiative 
to train and upskill 5,000 in-store 
professionals in 45 cities across India 
with an objective to delight customers 
at the point of sales as well as improve 
employee productivity and build a 
reliable talent supply chain. Through 
this initiative, Havell’s in-store sales 
professionals got the opportunity to

skills based on detailed on-field analysis 
involving technology and human 
interventions. 
Retailer Direct Bank Transfer 
Process
We initiated settlement of retailer scheme 
through Direct Bank Transfer into the 
bank account registered with Havells. 
It eliminates the need for intermediaries 
in transferring the amount directly into 
the beneficiary accounts. It brings about 
transparency and reduces instances of 
pilferage.
Revamp of Dealer Portal
We believe in providing best-in-class 
experience to our stakeholders. Dealer 
portal has come a long way in making 
their journey simple and easy. The 
new, user-friendly interface provides 
easy functionalities with organised 
view and quick access menu bar. Any 
information needed is just a click away 
with faster and smoother access to all 
the functions of the portal. It allows the 
user to multitask and switch pages from 
anywhere on the dealer portal. 
Havells Sync Mobile App
Consumer engagement and service is a 
top priority at Havells. In the beginning 
of the year, we launched Havells Sync 
App – a one-stop app for all consumer 
needs. It allows consumers to get a 
hassle-free experience with complete 
solutions to all their needs. Consumers 
can see the new products and features 
and shop for all their home appliances 
needs, register, operate and monitor 
products along with raise and track 
service requests on the app. It also 
allows consumers to operate IoT-based 
products from Havells.
Customer Service
Customer delight is a top priority 
at Havells and we have rolled out 
several initiatives to enhance customer 
experience. We are reaching out to 
customers and making our brand 
available wherever they are. Care360 
is our unmatched post-sales support 
service with over 1,800 channel partners 
and more than 6,000 highly trained 
employees.
Our wide-ranging initiatives have 
resulted in achieving the industry highest 
Promotor Score of 74% & Field engineer 
rating of over 4.2. With our unique

customer has full control over service 
request opening and closing.
KEY INITIATIVES FOR GO-TO-MARKET (GTM) EXCELLENCE IN FY 2022-23
In FY 2022-23, we invited around 120 
strategic suppliers to Havells Manthan 
strategic partner meet where we 
showcased the strength and growth 
prospects of Havells. This event was 
a great opportunity to encourage the 
partners to engage with Havells on a 
strategic long-term partnership.
MANTHAN STRATEGIC PARTNER MEET
Aligned with the Make in India initiative, 
we prefer to buy from Indian sources 
and spend on Indian sources. In order to 
reduce carbon footprint and logistics, we 
conducted another initiative to source 
from near-to-factory suppliers. Nearly 
44% of our sourcing is from suppliers 
located within 100 km. 100% of the 
domestic suppliers are registered on the 
vendor portal where they can access 
their schedules and payment status. 
Moreover, digitisation of supplier KYC 
and changes in master data is already 
done. We are powering the Source to 
Procure & Procure to Pay process by 
taking it to the next level of digitisation. 
100% of the suppliers have signed 
the Code of Conduct and adhere to 
high standards of integrity and ethical 
practices in business.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS 
MANAGEMENT 
Energy efficiency and emissions 
reduction are the key drivers of our 
ESG strategy to combat climate 
change. We use technology-based 
innovations to reduce carbon footprint, 
enhance fuel efficiency, optimise 
electricity consumption, and deploy 
renewable and alternative clean energy 
sources to reduce indirect energy 
usage. 
To reduce indirect energy consumption 
in FY 2022-23, we have undertaken 
several efforts including improving 
the operating efficiency of industrial 
machinery. We are putting in state-
of-the-art equipment and upgrading 
older ones to make them more energy 
efficient. In the coming year, we intend 
to install additional 4.5 MW solar 
power plant in Alwar plant taking our 
overall solar capability to ~16 MW 
which will help to meet 67% electricity 
supply from renewable sources against 
contract demand in the plant. This 
will also help increase our renewable 
footprint and reduce Scope 2 
emissions. Since FY 2012-13,  
we have offset around 31,115 MT of 
CO2 through Renewable Energy Uses, 
31,843 MT CO2 Mitigation through 
Energy Saving initiatives, through 
18 Lakh trees plantations, 16,610 
MT CO2 Mitigation through EPR 
implementation. We have mitigated a 
79,568 MT of CO2 (Eq. 10% of Overall 
GHG Intensity from FY 2012-13 to 
FY 2022-23) from the environment 
through our sustainable initiatives. 
The production units are designed to 
maximise the use of natural light and 
are equipped with a sensor-triggered 
automated lighting system.
We have implemented ISO:50001 
energy management system and 
completed 42 energy-saving initiatives 
in FY 2022-23. This has resulted in 
total energy savings of 2,139 MWh and 
mitigation of 1,711 MT of CO2. We had 
replaced all Light Diesel Oil (LDO) fuel 
in Alwar plant. From FY 2023-24, we 
have Transitioned from High Speed 
Diesel to Piped Natural Gas (PNG) in 
Haridwar Fan factory which will offset 
~ 550 MT of CO2 and ~ 5.5% scope 
1 emission norms. ~5.5% Scope 1 
emission norms. We are also exploring 
Bio-based fuels uses in our operation 
towards emission reduction strategy.
Green buildings
Our manufacturing facilities at Ghiloth 
and Alwar, Rajasthan, have been 
accorded the Indian Green Building 
Council (IGBC) Gold-rated certification, 
under the IGBC Factory Building 
Rating system. In the coming years, 
we are planning to certify more green 
buildings.
Reducing Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) emissions
Direct (Scope 1) GHG 
emissions
Over the years, we have been working 
to reduce our carbon footprint and 
use of natural gas-based furnaces. In 
FY 2022-23, we had reduced Scope 
1 Intensity by 72% compared to base 
year 2012-13.
Indirect (Scope 2) GHG 
emissions
We have implemented ISO:50001 
energy management system and 
completed 42 energy saving initiatives, 
saving 1,616 tCO2e of emissions in  
FY 2022-23 and 59% Scope 2 Intensity 
reduction from the base year 2012-13.
Efficient use of raw materials
We use a variety of raw materials including different metals, plastics, resins, and 
PVC, among others. We are constantly engaged in reducing consumption of these 
resources while looking at alternative sources. The value of packaging materials 
made using recycled paper (Cartons, Corrugated Shippers, Paper Pulp Moulded 
tray) for FY 2022-23 is ` 213 crores which is 3% of total buying material value.

and underwater table. Along with 
water conservation, we also inculcate 
water treatment, recycling, and reuse 
practices. Our effluent treatment 
systems comprise a reverse osmosis 
process to increase the water quality 
to make it ready for recycling. The level 
of effluents are maintained well under 
the prescribed regulatory requirements. 
The recycled water is then used 
for various unit-level operations. 
We remain focussed on our goal of 
achieving resource-neutral operations 
and place a strong emphasis on water 
stewardship. We understand that water 
is a shared resource with surrounding 
communities, and we are committed 
to using it responsibly. Water is 
consumed in manufacturing operations 
that include process, domestic, and 
utility operations. We have deployed 
automatic water recirculation system 
in our factory kitchens for utensil 
cleaning in select plants to gauge 
water savings. All our factories are 
equipped with Sewage Treatment Plant 
(STP) and four of them are equipped 
with Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) as 
well. Almost all of the treated water 
is reused within our premises to flush 
toilets or in developing greenbelt and 
Circular economy
We are progressively including material 
circularity in our product design and 
processes while ensuring high quality 
and durability. We also undertake 
rigorous testing of our products and 
provide post-sales services to increase 
their shelf life, thereby reducing 
requirements for natural resources. Our 
all-plant production rejection material 
utilises in production with the help 
of own moulding facility and through 
circular economy with suppliers. We 
have developed a separate Waste 
Management wing which supervises 
the waste management process. All 
end-of-life products coming due to 
damage and warranty are dismantled 
and again reused and recycled in 
production with the circular economy 
infrastructure after passing several 
quality and product safety tests.
Water Stewardship
We believe that water usage 
sensitisation along with infrastructure 
that supports responsible water use 
is key to water conservation. We have 
set up dry powder-based paint shops 
instead of the conventional water-
based paint shops, flow regulated 
taps, arrested water leakages and 
closed unnecessary water distribution 
points across plants. Pilot studies have 
been taken up to increase the use of 
recycled water for domestic use. Our 
fresh water consumption is for Utility 
and Domestic water consumption. 
We are cognisant of our operational 
water economics and have undertaken 
responsible water management 
practices. In a bid to become 2x water 
positive organisation by 2030, we 
are committed to implement the 3R 
(Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) principle 
for conservation of water. Our initiatives 
are directed towards conservation 
and optimal use of water as well as its 
after use treatment, discharging and 
recycling. For this, we have equipped 
our units with systems and processes 
which reduce water consumption 
during manufacturing. As part of our 
efforts to continuously reduce usage of 
raw water, Digital Water Flow meters 
have been installed across all units, 
besides Piezometers to check the 
water level. This is augmented with 
several rainwater harvesting structures 
to meet the production water 
demands and recharge the aquifers

Our Performance
Waste Management 
Waste and plastic waste management 
is a crucial element of our sustainability 
practices. We perpetually strive 
to incorporate the principles of a 
circular economy as part of our waste 
reduction strategy. We have partnered 
with several Governmental and Non-
Governmental organisations to develop 
integrated systems, processes, and 
controls to manage both hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste and comply 
with the national and state level waste 
regulations.
Extended Producer 
Responsibility
In terms of Extended Producer’s 
Responsibility, we have taken a 
leadership position due to our efforts in 
plastic waste management. Havells is 
doing Extended producer responsibility 
in E-Waste and Plastic waste which 
means that we collect, process and 
recycle the desired amount of e-waste 
and plastic waste that we sell in 
product waste in a year as per E-waste 
and Plastic waste management rules 
in India, thereby complying with the 
Plastic Waste Management Rules, 
2016. Our waste collection partners 
pick up plastic waste, thereby diverting 
them from reaching oceans and 
landfills. 
We have collected a total of over 3,617 
MT of plastic waste and 5,187 MT of 
E-Waste in FY 2022-23 directly from 
the end users and through tie-ups with 
waste management agencies. 
We have collected 12,264 MT of 
E-waste from 2018-23 through 43 
Collection centres pan India. Along 
with this, our plastic collection 
waste was 7,117 MT from  
FY 2021-22 to FY 2022-23. We have 
mitigated 16,610 MT CO2 through our 
EPR Program.
Hazardous & Non-Hazardous 
Waste 
We have implemented waste 
segregation at sources. We have a 
stringent waste management system 
for hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste generated. We are strengthening 
our environmental protection policies 
by focussing on specific issues 
such as effective storage, handling, 
transportation, and disposal of 
hazardous waste generated at our 
units. Currently, all such waste is 
disposed of only through dealers 
authorised by Central/State Pollution 
Control Boards. During the year, we 
recycled 15,383 MT and reused 2,422 
MT of non-hazardous waste including 
metal, rubber, and plastic scrap. During 
the year, there were no significant spills 
to be reported. We disposed 593 MT of 
hazardous waste.

Biodiversity Management
We do not conduct any business 
activity which has an irreversible 
or negative impact on biodiversity. 
Also, we do not have any operational 
sites near high biodiversity value 
areas or protected areas. We 
have been proactively working to 
preserve ecosystems and reduce the 
accelerated loss of biodiversity through 
various programmes. 1.8 million trees 
were planted in Madhya Pradesh, 
Development of Kanha Upvan land 
park in Alwar. We are also planning to 
perform a detailed biodiversity study 
of our all operations and locations to 
check the minimal impacts and prepare 
a roadmap towards becoming nature 
positive.

Havells performance during the year was backed 
by strong growth across the product verticals. Over 
the years, Havells has evolved into a formidable 
FMEG and consumer durable player by seeding new 
categories and scaling them to create reasonably sized 
revenue pools.
	
Switchgear segment reported 18.7% revenue growth 
supported by pickup in the construction cycle. While the 
sudden & sharp movements in commodity prices impacted 
the market sentiments in cables segment, Havells grew 
the segment revenue by 19.1%. Lighting segment grew 
by 16.8% with healthy growth from both consumer and 
professional lighting. Professional lighting accelerated its 
growth with pickup in industrial and commercial sector.
	
Despite witnessing a major transition in the fans category 
during the year, the Electrical Consumer Durables (ECD) 
segment reported a 7.5% revenue growth. Havells 
continue to focus on premiumisation of the fan portfolio. 
The “others” segment which includes motor, solar, 
pumps, personal grooming and water purifier grew

Lloyd demonstrated encouraging performance with strong 
revenue growth of 49% and continued its journey to be a 
meaningful player in the consumer durable industry. The 
profitability of the segment was impacted given commodity 
prices pressures and continued hyper competition in the 
market. During the year, we commissioned Lloyd Air-
Conditioners plant in Sri City (Chittoor District in the State 
of Andhra Pradesh).
	
We stayed focussed on innovating, investing in our 
brands, expanding omni-channel presence, enhancing 
our digital capabilities and nurturing a strong talent pool. 
Continuous investment in the latest technology and 
innovation has helped the organization to stay ahead in 
a highly competitive landscape. In addition to multiple 
patents being filed during the year, we launched many new 
products including Havells Glamtubes and Meditate Air 
Purifier. Brand remained a key focus area during the year 
with significantly higher advertising and sales promotion 
expenditure vs FY22. We ensured that we are reaching 
out to the customers and making our brand available 
wherever they are. While steadily growing our distributors/
dealers network vertically and horizontally, we expanded 
our presence in emerging channels. E-commerce 
channel grew with a strong product portfolio and deep 
digital engagement with our consumers. Modern Format 
Retail (MFR) continues to emerge as a key channel with 
expanding shelf space at the counters. With emerging rural 
opportunity, we cemented our position of most penetrated 
FMEG brand in rural markets.
	
Backed by revenue growth and strong financial discipline, 
we continued to generate healthy cash flows. The 
balance sheet was further strengthened by pre-paying 
the outstanding borrowings during the year.

Gen-Z community is about 21%.

enhanced learner experience (LXP).

meeting the organization’ future growth aspirations.

Field Project in Sri City, through a combination of internal 
talent movement and lateral hires. In this plant, we are 
targeting to maximize gender diversity on the shop floor.

diversity within the Company, by targeting close to 100% 
women on shop floor.

technologies with many more product lines in domestic 
appliances localized to reduce import dependence (like 
hair dryers, room heaters, hand blenders, toasters, etc.); 
in-house manufacturing of washing machines starting 
with semi-auto version; and own designed, developed 
and manufactured Havells studio Meditate air purifier 
that uses a technology adapted from Space stations. 
Our strategic push towards leadership in Industrial 
Switchgear products has started to deliver now - 
with the launch of our own designed, developed and 
manufactured Q-Tron range of circuit breakers. From the 
onset, the Q-Tron range is benchmarked with the global 
gold standards and is realized by the strong collaboration 
of our R&D, manufacturing and vendor ecosystem. 
Further, progressing our journey of digitizing product 
development, the use of digital twin and simulation 
methodologies are now being successfully deployed 
across most of our product categories augmenting the 
robustness of our designs.
	
Overall, we are promoting a culture and mindset of 
intellectual asset creation. During 2022-23, we applied 
38 new patents and 213 new design registrations taking 
our cumulative tally to 150 and 985 respectively. Our 
journey of intellectual property protection has started to 
show results with Havells having a grant of 21 patents. 
As the disruption is becoming the new normal our strong 
resolute in R&D has helped to navigate many challenges 
like materials supply disruptions, cost escalations 
and changes in customer preferences. The wealth of 
knowledge and infrastructures that we have created over 
the last few years will stay with us and will continue to be 
a source of competitive advantage.

(BRSR)
	
As environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues 
become increasingly important for Companies, the way 
in which they report on these issues has also progressed. 
As the world becomes increasingly aware of the impact 
of business on society and the environment, the concept 
of ESG reporting warrants significant attention. Over the 
years Havells always believed in communicating its ESG 
performance in a transparent manner and in line with 
global standards to our stakeholders.
	
Last year i.e., FY 2021-22, we had published our First 
BRSR report of the Company ahead of the mandate. 
We are proud to publish our 2nd BRSR of the Company 
for the year 2022-23. The BRSR would follow the 
format detailed in the amendment to Regulation 34(2)
(f) of SEBI LODR Regulations vide Gazette notification 
no. SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2021/22 dated May 05, 2021 
and will form a part of this Integrated Annual Report. 
The BRSR for Financial Year 2022-23 is aligned with 
the nine principles of the National Guidelines on 
Responsible Business Conduct notified by the Ministry 
of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. We have 
further enhanced our existing strong reporting structure 
and mechanisms to ensure we capture reliable and 
accurate data for the requirements of BRSR disclosures. 
We will from this year also get the key BRSR indicators 
(aligned with GRI standards) validated as part of our 
sustainability assurance framework. Havells strongly 
believes that resilient and inclusive growth is only 
possible on strong pillars of environmental and social 
responsibility balanced with good governance. The 
report is a testimony to our continuous efforts towards 
embracing and implementing balanced approach to 
ESG parameters in our business operations that are 
communicated to the stakeholders in addition to our 
annually published voluntary sustainability disclosures 
based on globally accepted Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) standards and six capitals-based Value Reporting 
Foundation’s framework on Integrated Reporting that is 
available on our website at www.havells.com.
	
We have also provided the requisite mapping of information 
and principles between the Sustainability disclosures and 
the Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report as 
prescribed by SEBI. The same is also available on the 
website www.havells.com.

Nomination and Remuneration of the Key Managerial 
Personnel 
(other

Managing/

The executive management of a company is responsible for the 
day to day management of a company. The Companies Act,

the executive management.
The KMPs are the point of first contact between the company 
and its stakeholders. While the Board of Directors are 
responsible for providing the oversight, it is the key managerial 
personnel and the senior management who are responsible for 
not just laying down the strategies as well as its implementation.
The Companies Act, 2013 has for the first time recognized the 
concept of Key Managerial Personnel. As per section 2(51) “key 
managerial personnel”, in relation to a company, means—

the Chief Executive Officer or the Managing Director or the 
Manager;

the Chief Financial Officer;

(v)	
such other officer, not more than one level below the 
directors who is in whole-time employment, designated 
as key managerial personnel by the Board and
(v) 	 such other officer as may be prescribed.
Among the KMPs, the re-muneration of the CEO or the Managing 
Director and the Whole-time Director(s), shall be governed by 
the Section on REMUNERATION OF THE DIRECTORS of this 
Policy dealing with “Remuneration of Managing Director and 
Whole-time Director”.
Apart from the directors, the remuneration of
•	 All the Other KMPs such as the company secretary or any 
other officer that may be prescribed under the statute from 
time to time; and
•	 “Senior Management” of the Company which here means, 
the core management team comprising of such members 
of management as determined by the Company under 
Layer 1 of the System-Driven Disclosures in respect of 
Regulation 7(2)(b) of PIT Regulations, shall be determined 
by the Human Resources Department of the Company in 
consultation with the Managing Director and/ or the Whole-
time Director Finance.
The remuneration determined for all the above said senior 
personnel shall be in line with the Company’s philosophy to 
provide fair compensation to key - executive officers based 
on their performance and contribution to the Company and to 
provide incentives that attract and retain key executives, instill 
a long-term commitment to the Company and develop a pride 
and sense of Company ownership, all in a manner consistent 
with shareholder interests.
The break-up of the pay scale and quantum of perquisites 
including, employer’s contribution to P.F, pension scheme, 
medical expenses, club fees etc. shall be decided by the 
Company’s HR department.
Decisions on Annual Increments of the Senior Personnel shall be 
decided by the Human Resources Department in consultation 
with the Managing Director and/ or the Whole-time Director 
Finance of the Company.
Havells India Limited

Remuneration of other Employees
Apart from the Directors, KMPs and Senior Management, 
the remuneration for rest of the employees is determined on 
the basis of the role and position of the individual employee, 
including professional experience, responsibility, job complexity 
and local market conditions.
The Company considers it essential to incentivize the workforce 
to ensure adequate and reasonable compensation to the staff. 
The Human Resources Department shall ensure that the level 
of remuneration motivates and rewards high performers who 
perform according to set expectations for the individual in 
question.
The various remuneration components, basic salary, 
allowances, perquisites etc. may be combined to ensure an 
appropriate and balanced remuneration package.
The annual increments to the remuneration paid to the 
employees shall be determined based on the annual appraisal 
carried out by the HoDs of various departments.
Decisions on Annual Increments shall be made on the basis of 
this annual appraisal.
General
This Policy shall apply to all future employment of Company’s 
Senior Management including Key Managerial Personnel and 
Board of Directors.
Any or all the provisions of this Policy would be subject to the 
revision/ amendment in the Companies Act, 2013, related rules 
and regulations, guidelines and the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 on the subject 
as may be notified from time to time. Any such amendment shall 
automatically have the effect of amending this Policy without 
the need of any approval by the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee and/ or the Board of Directors.

Sustainability 
•	 Till now more than 4,00,000 Reusable Sanitary Pads 
kits have been distributed. Further, mechanism for 
distribution through Agencies/ NGOs & infrastructure 
is in place for enabling scalability. Volunteers have 
been adequately trained for conducting/ handling 
workshops. 
•	 Pads are considered to be expensive and people 
are shifting to reusable sanitary napkins & in this 
way attendance is also improving but still there are 
social taboos in the mind of people which need to be 
changed so the program will be sustainable.
Basis our naked eye assessment and that of villagers, 
survival rate of plants is around 75%-80% and density 
of forest has increased. Therefore, long term targets 
need to be discussed and defined post interaction with 
MPRVVN as to whether 80% would be sustained. In 
case, the plants get destroyed in the year of plantation, 
the same are replanted in the next year and this process 
is possible in the initial 1 to 2 years. It is therefore 
essential to look at sustainability of survival rate in the 
medium term at the end of 5/6 years post plantation to 
understand the overall impact.
Overall Impact
Though Self Confidence and awareness level have 
increased & people have shifted from cloth/ expensive 
pads to reusable sanitary napkins, still there exist 
challenges to be addressed like religious taboos which 
is most strongly observed, women in slum areas don’t 
take medicine for pain management and don’t discuss 
about menstruation. Need felt for spreading increased 
awareness through periodic workshops/ programs.
Short term objective of providing employment and 
enhancing the livelihoods for people met (16,00,000 teak 
saplings planted since 2019 till 31st March 2023 under 
Vidisha - Raison Project Board/ Division). However, 
overall socio economic impact can be assessed in long 
term in terms of soil fertility, creation of carbon sink and 
economic viability. Further, survival rate needs to be 
visited.

(A)	 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
(i)	
Steps taken or impact on Conservation of Energy
	
At Havells, our continuous approach is towards achieving 
maximum energy efficiency in our operations and 
products. We do it through implementing one of the best 
Energy Management Systems (ISO 50001-EnMs), Cutting 
Edge Technology and dedicated Research & Development 
Centres. During 2022-23 Havells undertook 42 projects 
towards conservation of energy. For optimising the energy 
requirement, replacing the motors and pumps with 
energy efficient motors is one of the key element. Also, 
initiatives are taken up for saving energy through control 
of idle running of machines and conveyors. Through our 
initiatives, we were able to mitigate 1711 tons of CO2 
emissions thereby contributing to combatting climate 
change. Details for the projects is given below:

(ii)	 Steps taken by the Company for utilizing alternate 
sources of energy
	
Energy saving using Solar Energy is another important 
drive Havells has taken. Through this addition of solar 
power, at present solar power generation capacity is 9.0 
MW, which is about 8.1 % of total electricity consumption. 
Through our initiatives, we were able to offset 7331 tons 
of CO2 emission by Solar. Projects are identified to add 
solar panels during 2023-24 and to enhance the operating 
efficiency of existing solar generation system.
(iii)	 Capital Investment on Energy Conservation 
Equipments
	
During the financial year the Company has invested 
` 152.84 Lakhs for alternate sources of energy and new 
technology. A focused action is on to identify opportunity 
for identifying all such equipment and machinery 
wherever new technologies are available which can help 
in optimizing energy requirements.
(B)	 TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION
(i)	
Efforts made towards technology absorption
	
Havells R&D Commitment:
	
Havells is leading the benchmark among FMEGs (Fast 
Moving Electrical Goods) in India with its well-established 
R&D capabilities. With the focus on Innovation as one of 
the main pillars for growth, we are investing significantly in 
R&D competency and infrastructure build-up. Our efforts 
are centered around the three Research and Innovation 
centers:
	
1.	
Havells Customer Experience and Design (CXD) 
studio based out of Noida which plays the vital role 
of understanding evolving consumer needs and key 
factors driving their preferences through advanced 
design thinking and research methodologies paving 
the way to consumer-centric product and user 
experience designs.
	
2.	
Bengaluru Innovation Center continues to lead 
the ownership of critical and future technologies 
delivering specific platform-based solutions that are 
applied across multiple business segments, thus 
enabling our products to maintain a competitive 
edge and gain from the synergies of the underlying 
technology platforms.
	
3.	
The R&D center at Noida powers the quality and 
reliability core of Havells brand promise with state-
of-the-art facilities for prototyping, endurance testing, 
materials characterization and advanced methods 
like simulations-based designs across the complete 
product portfolio.
	
The Company’s emphasis is on nurturing an Innovation 
culture and building long-term intellectual assets. A year-
on-year increase in the number of IP filings and prestigious 
awards from domestic and international accredited bodies 
is a living testimony of these efforts.
	
Basic Tenets of Technology Absorption:
	
We are living in a world where disruptions are the new 
normal, making it imperative to respond quickly to evolving 
customer preferences keeping technological advances at 
the core of our strategy. Our approach towards agility and 
flexibility combines both in-house R&D capabilities as well 
as leveraging our partners’ ecosystem.

Havells R&D vision is focused on going deeper into 
consumer life and homes in smart, healthy and 
intelligent ways. This year we expanded our range 
of smart products to include the Glamax light range 
providing connected and customizable mood lighting 
options, Smart IoT pump and Smart Monoblock 
switch panel for home automation. Beyond products, 
our own IoT platform continues to power the Havells 
Sync app for a seamless consumer experience from 
purchase to usage. Our IoT platform supports multiple 
communication protocols like Wifi, Bluetooth mesh, 
Zigbee topology and even ODV (On Device Voice) for 
direct voice commands.

Adherence to Regulations and Standards:
	
We are addressing the ever-increasing drive toward energy 
efficiency for electrical and electronic products.
	
The Bureau of energy efficiency (BEE) introduced 
mandatory Star ratings for ceiling fans from 1st January, 
2023. From the release of this mandate in June 2022, 
with a well-coordinated effort between business, R&D 
and manufacturing teams we managed updates and 
registration of our Fans portfolio within the stipulated 
timeline.
	
Another key BEE mandate this year was an increase in 
the energy efficiency index for AC Star ratings. All AC 
SKUs are upgraded to keep up with a more stringent 
requirement, specifically for 5-Star variants, it meant 
major upgrades in terms of updated compressor design, 
change to BLDC motor, electronic valve controls and 
chassis design changes.
	
Specific Efforts of Technology Absorption
	
To list a few examples where technology absorption has 
helped us create differentiated products in the market 
include:
	
•	
Democratizing technology for seamless 
consumer experience: Havells Studio Meditate air 
purifier with Space tech. is a great testimonial of 
our efforts towards in-house designed, developed 
and manufactured air purifiers. Apart from being 
aesthetically superior, it hosts many industry-
first features like TiO2-based photocatalytic 
disintegration of VOCs (Volatile Organic 
Compounds like microbes, etc.), a mobile AQI 
unit for real-time air quality check across the space 
and an intelligent user interface with predictive 
analytics.

Our in-house designed and developed Q-Tron industrial 
circuit-breaker range sets up a benchmark with global 
standards, driving us ahead of domestic players, 
a feat achieved by a relentless pursuit of excellence 
over the last couple of years, well supported by our 
manufacturing and vendor ecosystem.
	
Havells QTRON MCCB Range
	
Our current tally of highly energy-efficient BLDC fans 
stands at 22 models (vs 2 models in 2020) and we expect 
this range of fans to increase share in  our total portfolio in 
the coming years.

Pushing design boundaries with new forms and 
features: For long, light battens have followed the 
conventional linear shape with opaque end caps. 
With LED Glamtubes, we broke this monotonicity 
by introducing aesthetically superior designs with 
endless glow achieved by new manufacturing 
processes. Another breakthrough along the 
same lines is the Nimbus bezel glow downlights 
presenting differentiated aesthetics (compared to the 
conventional downlights) with higher lumen output. 
This has been achieved through innovative play of 
light optics to create a reflection of the emitted LED 
light through the bezel to give the effect of “illuminated 
bezel” or “rim-less panels”.

In water heaters, Havells launched an unconventionally 
beautiful range of storage water heaters- Otto and 
Orizzonte with unique circular designs and AC-type 
space-saving designs respectively along with features like 
digital display, color-changing LED and remote control. All 
these products have been extremely well-received by our 
consumers.

•	
Reduction in import dependence and contribution 
towards Make in India: In domestic appliances, we 
are on a path of self-reliance by reducing our import 
dependence. This year we have localized Hair dryers, 
Hand blenders, Toasters and Radiation type room 
heaters. This is being done in close collaboration with 
our local vendor base thereby pushing the “Make in 
India” proposition to newer heights.
	
•	
Lloyd Consumer Goods: Lloyd ACs introduced 
ODV (On Device voice) feature allowing direct voice 
commands by users without the need for any Wifi or 
Bluetooth connection delivering the ultimate hassle-
free experience. Other key features of ACs introduced 
this year include AQI (air quality indicator) and a 
5-Star variant of hot and cold AC with an operating 
temperature range of -10 to 52 degree Celsius.
Heavy Duty AC IAQ
	
•	
Pumps and Motors: We expanded our product lines 
by introducing Sewage submersible pumps and 
multi-stage booster pumps. Our complete motors 
portfolio is now IP66 certified.

Business Responsibility & 
Sustainability Reporting
FOREWORD
The world faces a set of risks that feel both wholly new and eerily familiar. The ongoing decade will be characterized by 
environmental and societal crises, driven by underlying geopolitical and economic trends. The recently published Global 
Risks Report 2023 by the World Economic Forum emphasizes that environmental risks will dominate the top 10 risks 
over the current decade. Failure to address this risk could result in severe consequences for the economy as a whole. 
Companies, at large, need to focus not just on integrating ESG strategy into their value story but also on communicating 
this strategy and vision to its stakeholders. The past year, Havells continued to focus on the aspects of Environment, 
Social and Governance (ESG) that would work towards an inclusive society, which is stronger and more resilient. 
Our business sustainability is the key metric for our entry and expansion into any new category. Sustainability is not 
confined to Environment, Social and Governance, it is in each aspect of the organization whether it is quality of the 
product or efficient utilization of resource in the manufacturing process. Energy efficiency and emission reduction are 
our key drivers in our overall ESG strategy to increase resilience towards climate change. During F.Y. 2023, we had 
undertaken multiple key energy efficient measures such as:
•	
Launching of fans with BLDC motor technology which saves ~ 50% power consumption in comparison to traditional 
fans. 
•	
In Washing Machines category ~ 90% of our products are energy efficient and BEE star rated. Further, we have 
reduced water consumption during water testing in manufacturing by usage of re-cycled water. 
•	
In Desert cooler category, design optimized for reduced power consumption by ~15%. Further, developed BLDC 
motor for air cooler resulting in power consumption saving by ~ 40%.
In the fiscal year 2022-23, we eliminated ~ 9,042 tC02 on account of implementation of over 40 energy conservation 
projects and through green electricity usage (solar renewable energy). Over the years, we have been working persistently 
towards reducing our carbon footprint and use of natural gas-based furnaces. In FY 2023, we had reduced Scope 1 
Intensity by ~ 72% and Scope 2 Intensity by ~ 59% from the base year i.e., FY 2013. 
We are progressively including material circularity in our product design and processes while ensuring high quality and 
durability. We also undertake rigorous testing of our products and provide post-sales services to increase their shelf life, 
thereby reducing requirements for natural resources. Being an industry leader in our business, we have a responsibility to 
think ahead of the curve and provide stewardship in the way we serve our customers and consumers. On the social front, 
we inaugurated one of biggest stores pan India which is being managed and run by 100% female staff at Bhubaneshwar. 
Further, at our newly commissioned plant in Sri City, we are targeting to run the entire operations by 100% female workers.
Havells strongly believe reporting company’s performance on environmental and social aspects is as vital as reporting on 
financial and operational performance. At Havells, Social and Environment responsibility has always been at the forefront 
of our operating philosophy. Havells has been consistently ranked in the top 10 global companies for ESG performance 
in the electrical sector for last four years, in addition to be featured in S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook. 
From this fiscal year i.e., 2022-23, compliance with Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR) requirements 
is mandatory for the top 1,000 companies. In order to provide disclosures on Havells’ ESG Practices and priorities 
in fiscal year 2022-23, we will be reporting on key leadership indicators voluntarily in addition to mandatory essential 
indicators. With a commitment to set standards for our business, transactions based on mutual trust and building long-
term relationships with all our associates, customers, partners, and employees, we present our 2nd BRSR for the financial 
year 2022-23. Havells has widened the scope of its limited assurance on key non-financial sustainability indicators to 
include assurance on quantitative indicators of BRSR principles in addition to GRI indicators as per ISAE 3000 (Revised).

Ameet Kumar Gupta

20.	 Turnover rate for permanent employees and workers (Disclose trends for the past 3 years)
In FY 2023, a lot of initiatives have been taken on talent retention and engagement at the company level. For retention of 
existing talent under managerial level, we have introduced a Talent Mapping exercise and identified employees who can be 
given larger roles in future to create career paths. We have launched a career development center “Pragati’ for our frontline 
salespeople to become first level Managers and a management development program called “Unnati”, for our first level sales 
managers. 360-degree survey has been launched for senior leaders.
We have a very robust program of engaging with campuses for our future young talent requirements. In line with the 
organizational growth aspirations and to ensure that our people are constantly in a state of future readiness, though we 
have developed an L&D strategy, to address the learning needs at every level of the organizational hierarchy. All of these has 
helped us to decrease our attrition rates as compared to last year. Some of initiatives are delivered through instructor lead 
training and others through online portal using our LMS platform - Saksham. For the fourth year in succession, we have been 
recognized as “Great Place to Work’ in India and our scores have consistently improved over the years, which has led to, 
Havells India Limited being recognized as India’s Best WorkplacesTM, among Top 50 large organizations. This recognition 
identifies us as having successfully inspired our employees to innovate, by fostering a culture that encourages and empowers 
them to try new and better ways of doing things. Please find the trend for last 3 years below:

which discharges treated water (after maintaining the minimum discharge standards) into municipal sewage line with consent 
from the concerned authorities during the reporting period. We follow all the necessary applicable guidelines and directions 
on maintaining the standards of STP and ETP required by CPCB and SPCBs.

Please provide details of air emissions (other than GHG emissions) by the entity, in the following format:
	
Our NOx and SOx emission are predominantly generated from our fossil fuel consumption especially diesel in manufacturing 
process and genset. While our emission is inherently of small quantum and well within permissible limits, we are still keen to 
improve our performance. Towards this, we are exploring by replacing diesel genset with other cleaner fuels gensets, install 
additional filtration systems at our stack emission outlets to capture emissions or replacing diesel with PNG where there is 
steady PNG infrastructure installed by government. 
	
Another approach adopted by us is moving to a stable electricity connect with minimum power cuts and load shedding so 
that Genset are not used often.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Context
Financial year 2022-23 witnessed a mixed operating 
environment as it had a healthy business outlook while at 
the same time faced challenges around commodity price 
fluctuations, rupee depreciation and accelerated inflation rates. 
In the backdrop of global challenges, India continued its strong 
growth with a rebound in private consumption and increase in 
government capital expenditure. During the year, India became 
the world’s fifth largest economy and its GDP is estimated to 
grow at 6.8% in FY23 (IMF World Economic Outlook). India is 
expected to maintain leading growth in coming years. 
The consumer electricals and durables industry continues to 
perform well with demand expanding on the back of increasing 
penetration, urbanisation, electrification and higher share of 
wallet for homes.
The megatrends shaping the business landscape include 
consumers becoming more informed, demanding and 
aspirational. Internet of Things (IoT) and smart connected 
homes are on the rise with the younger population contributing 
to buying decisions in the home. There is a clear preference 
for brands of trust and reliability as well as those ensuring 
deep engagement with consumers using an omni-channel 
approach.
Segment-wise overview including industry structure, 
developments and outlook
Switchgear
The Strategic Business Unit (SBU) comprises Building Circuit 
Protection (BCP) equipment,, switches and automation 
solutions, also called Electrical Wiring Accessories (EWA) and 
industrial switchgear. Havells is a pioneer in understanding 
changing customer requirements and filling any vacuum with 
well thought through advanced products that offer the latest 
technology and deliver best value to customers. The focus 
remained on developing and launching new products and 
offerings. We introduced downstream protection devices that 
offer protection from current leakage and voltage surges, 
reflecting our customer first approach. These devices ensure 
circuit protection at the socket level, and safeguard user 
equipment. The latest offerings from Havells switchgear—
ST^Dx range of MCBs, RCCBs, are intuitive and performance 
driven innovative protection devices.
In the switches category, the growing acceptance of smart and 
connected technologies is driving the transition towards smart 
homes. We are also expanding our smart portfolio and adding 
new product lines. Our new range of Signia smart products that 
was launched during the year has already proved successful 
by demonstrating rapid growth in the retrofit modular products 
segment.

Besides smart switches, we are also focused on the affordable 
segment with our REO Brand. We have added Matt Black 
switches to this portfolio to offer customers more variety with 
availability of choice even at the entry level. 
The Switchgear segment registered net revenues of ` 2,120 
crores during FY 2023 with contribution margins at 38.4% 
compared with net revenues of ` 1,786 crores with contribution 
margins at 38.6% during FY 2022. Our contribution margin 
continued to remain resilient despite raw material cost increases 
and inflation, achieved through effective price increases to 
market and alignment in product mix.
Electrical consumer durables (ECD)
This SBU comprises fans, small domestic appliances and 
water heaters. With effect from January 1, 2023, the fan 
industry moved to BEE rated energy efficient fans with all 
manufacturers phasing out non-rated fans by end of calendar 
year 2022. In the pre-transition phase there was initially some 
uncertainty with significant destocking in the channel, but just 
before the transition, there was healthy pickup by channels. 
Havells continued to focus on mass-premium offerings in the 
fans segment with a complete portfolio of decorative and 
designer star-rated fans. With the rating transition, Havells 
bolstered its range with a new range of designer BLDC fans. In 
2023, Havells is set to offer the widest range of star rated and 
BLDC fans to Indian consumers.
During the year, Havells unveiled a new advertising campaign 
under its iconic ‘Hawa Badlegi’ advertising platform. In addition, 
we kicked off 2023 summer season with Brand Standard new 
brand promise of “Performance Ka Higher Standard” and 
Havells fans campaign “Look up to great designs, wider range 
and energy savings” presenting widest range of star rated 
designer fans. 
Driven by strong research on changing consumer needs and 
subsequent innovative offerings to cater to those needs, 
Havells has been among the top three players in most of the 
key categories in the appliance space in across different states 
in India. 
The industry continues to witness higher demand for premium 
offerings across all sub-segments. The growth was also seen in 
deeper markets i.e., Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and beyond. Even 
specific channels like MFR, e-commerce showed promising 
growth.
While large categories like mixer grinder (MG) and juicer mixer 
grinder (JMG) are already flag bearers of the Make in India 
movement, other key categories like induction cooktops, 
steam iron and toasters, room heaters, hand blenders etc. have 
followed suit. Steps to indigenise these product categories 
were initiated to cut down reliance on imports. Capabilities 
are being developed for in-house manufacturing in order to 
achieve design, innovation and cost advantage in the market. 
We witnessed 37 new launches across different channels and 
geographies to cater to customised demand in the appliances 
segment.
The electronic consumer durables (ECD) division registered net 
revenues of ` 3,296 crores during FY 2023 with contribution 
margins at 23.3% compared with net revenues of ` 3,067 
crores with contribution margins at 23.3% during FY 2022.
Havells India Limited

Cable
The category experienced stable growth in FY 2023 inspite 
of decreasing metal prices for the major part of the year and 
copper price volatility. The industry continued its transition 
from the unorganised to the organised segment with increased 
consumer focus on buying branded and reliable products for 
homes and workplaces. Channel expansion and focus on 
semiurban and rural markets helped the business to register 
volume growth despite a high base. 
Increased government spending and focus on infrastructure 
development, 
educational 
institutes, 
health 
institutes, 
development of manufacturing hubs, expansion of 5G network 
etc. were some of the growth drivers in FY 2023. There is a 
strong demand visibility across all industrial segments which 
led to an overall improved environment for the industrial cable 
sector. Various sectors like renewable energy, data centres, 
metros, 5G, airports and defence, digitilisation are expected to 
provide the levers for sustained growth in coming years.
With increased consumer awareness about safety, the industry 
is focused on sales of specialised cables like the heat resistant 
flame retardant (HRFR) cables, the , flame retardant and low 
smoke halogen (FRLS-H) cables and the halogen free flame 
retardant (HFFR) cables. This year our new TV ad campaign 
focused on ‘halogen free flame retardant wires’ that has worked 
to clearly highlight the importance of safety in consumer minds. 
The cables division registered net revenues of ` 5,533 crores 
during FY 2023 with contribution margins at 12.9% compared 
with net revenues of ` 4,645 crores with contribution margins 
at 14.6% during FY 2022.
Lighting
Havells Lighting business comprises of two business units 
(BU) – consumer lighting and professional lighting. Both these 
BUs experienced strong performance during FY 2023 thereby 
strengthening Havells positioning as a leading lighting brand 
in India. With a wide variety of product offerings, innovative 
solutions, performance reliability, easy availability, and after-
sales service, Havells Lighting has evolved as a brand of choice 
for customers across segments and categories.
With our economy emerging stronger post-Covid, the 
professional lighting business too experienced a strong 
demand environment in many customer segments. Havells 
new streetlight offerings achieved increased spacing between 
poles while still meeting stringent light requirements, thereby 
maximising value for all stakeholders. We also introduced 
sensor based street lights that automatically switch ON and 
OFF based on daylight sensing, thus saving energy. For offices 
and modern workspaces, aesthetically designed luminaires 
were launched during the year. 
We have developed a competent team to engage with 
customers and understand their need for automation. Our 
smart solutions can deliver significant features such as human-
centric lighting, daylight saving, colour tunability, multi-sensor 
functionality, standalone and cloud-based working, etc. 
In the consumer lighting business, Havells has established 
itself as a leading innovative lighting brand through a series 
of differentiated product launches. One such highlight was 
the launch of Glamtubes that offer a single light solution to 
consumers, thus making battens look glamorous and beautiful 
yet perform the best! Glamtubes are based on industry best 
technology. on performance and elegant aesthetic designs.

Today’s consumers, embracing their own uniqueness, 
have a choice of designs that reflect their personalities and 
match their decor, whether at home or work. The demand 
for premium lighting is on the rise. Havells Home Art Light is 
a one-stop shop for all things lighting – from basic to high-
end, from minimalistic to opulent or ornate, as well as luxury 
lighting solutions. We have 30 Home Art Light Brand stores 
with experiential zones that provide consumers an opportunity 
for the real light experience.
The Lighting division registered net revenues of ` 1,602 crores 
during FY 2023 with contribution margins at 29.8% compared 
with net revenues of ` 1,371 crores with contribution margins 
at 31.3% during FY 2022.
Lloyd
Following two years of disrupted summer sales for air 
Conditioners and refrigerators due to COVID-19, this year 
witnessed a good summer with a full season on the market. 
Backed by strong in-house manufacturing, Lloyd capitalised 
on the opportunity, gained market share and cemented 
its position of being a meaningful player in the AC market. 
While increasing share of premium products in the portfolio, 
the Company strengthened the product portfolio with range 
completion to achieve its positioning of a full stack consumer 
durable player. Additionally, channel focus over the years has 
Havells India Limited
126
enabled Lloyd to achieve a meaningful presence in the market 
across traditional and emerging channels. 
The continued hyper competition in the market and commodity 
price volatility created some margin pressures for Lloyd. 
Despite that, we continued our accelerated investment in the 
brand, R&D, manufacturing and talent. With a strong R&D 
focus, we developed and brought to market differentiated 
offerings for our customers with new product feature additions. 
We launched the New Lloyd Grande Heavy Duty AC with 
superior features like powerful cooling (even at 60 degrees) and 
indoor air purification technology. We kicked off the summer of 
2023 with Lloyd’s new brand promise of ‘Khayal jo ghar ko 
ghar banaye’ which captures the role of Lloyd products as 
an enabler of love and care at home. We commissioned the 
new Lloyd air-conditioner plant at Sri-City in Chittoor District 
in the state of Andhra Pradesh during the year. This plant will 
not only double the AC production capacity but also augment 
the GTM with manufacturing presence in the southern part of 
the country, besides unlocking export opportunities and better 
inventory management during the peak season.
The Lloyd consumer division registered net revenues of 
` 3,369 crores during FY 2023 with contribution margins at 
4.4% compared with net revenues of ` 2,261 crores with 
contribution margins at 6.9% during FY 2022.

Opportunities
A.	
Industry growth and under penetration: Electricals and 
consumer durables categories are still under penetrated 
and poised for strong growth on the back of increasing 
urbanisation and personal disposable income.
B.	
Increasing electrification: Government efforts towards 
enhanced power availability is continually increasing 
electrification in semi-urban and rural areas, along with 
stable electricity supply in urban areas. This has translated 
into better demand for electrical and consumer durable 
products in new and existing markets.
C.	
Infrastructure expansion: The government’s strong 
focus on infrastructure expansion including highway 
construction, railway modernisation and airport additions 
is expected to create demand for electrical goods.
D.	
Favourable demographics: While the world is rapidly 
aging, India’s population is among the youngest globally. 
With a median age of less than 29 years and 67% of the 
population in the working age group of 15-64 years this is 
a key demographic dividend for India.
E.	
Exports: A sizeable global market is looking to diversify 
its supply chain in order to tide over any probable regional 
challenges or geopolitical issues. With a strong business 
environment and enhanced ease of doing business, India 
is emerging as a strong country and as a manufacturing 
alternative to other Asian countries.
F.	
Product Portfolio: With a strong full stack product 
portfolio across electricals and durables, industrial and 
infrastructure, consumer and residential segments, the 
Company is well-positioned to capitalise on a great 
opportunity to increase shelf space at the retail counter 
and share of wallet of the consumer. Alongside providing 
a natural hedge in case of an economic downturn, a 
complete product portfolio enhances the opportunity to 
cross sell with channel partners and final consumers.
G.	
Accelerated shift from unorganised to organised: 
A large portion of the consumer electrical market 
continues to be unorganised.. However, increasing brand 
awareness, formalisation and aspirations, can accelerate 
the shift in consumer preference from unorganised to 
organised, which shall be beneficial for the key players.
Risk and Concerns
A.	
Economic slowdown: Slowdown in the Indian economy 
due to global developments could adversely impact 
growth in the short-term.
B.	
Commodity pressures: Sharp increase in commodity 
prices could lead to increase in cost of finished goods 
thereby impacting affordability and consumer sentiment.
C.	
Competitive intensity: Irrational market behaviour with 
increased competitive intensity could cause value erosion 
for the industry as a whole especially with the entry of 
new disruptive players with access to low cost capital and 
extended ability to sustain losses to capture market share.
D.	
Power disruptions: Any impact on power distribution and 
electricity delivery can impact the demand for electrical 
products. Availability of stable and quality power supply 
continues to be an important factor for the industry’s 
growth prospects.
E.	
Pandemic: Deterioration in supply chain and demand 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic or similar disruptions 
have emerged as a significant business risk.
F.	
Geopolitical crisis: Volatility in the commodity and foreign 
currency markets may impact raw material availability due 
to geopolitical challenges in different geographies around 
the world.

Report on Corporate Governance
In terms of Regulation 34(3) read with Section C of SCHEDULE V to SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, a Report on Corporate 
Governance for the year ended 31st March, 2023 is presented below:
(1)	 A Brief Statement on Listed Entity’s Philosophy 
on Code of Governance
	
Who we are is defined by what we do and how 
we do
	
This simple philosophy underlines our approach to 
Corporate Governance. So, if growth is our intention, 
how we achieve this growth is a part of our Corporate 
Governance. For us, Corporate Governance goes 
beyond philanthropy and compliance but actually deals 
with how we manage our triple bottom lines – economic, 
social and environmental impacts. It monitors our role as 
well as the quality of our relationships in key spheres of 
influence including the workplace, the market place, the 
supply chain, the community and the public policy realm.
	
As a Company, we distinguish ourselves in the market 
by offering a portfolio of ecologically responsible electrical 
products and services that deliver powerful, sustainable 
and energy efficient solutions that do not compromise on 
capacity or security.
	
Our eco-friendly approach is evident in our efforts to 
develop an alternate energy strategy so as to reduce the 
environmental impact from our business. We are equally 
committed to managing a responsible supply chain in a 
manner that is consistent and compliant with our high 
standards for environment and business practices.
	
We recognise that there are barriers that constrain 
innovation, both, in individuals and communities and 
we work to overcome them. We build communities 
and promote the exchange of ideas through assistive 
technologies; participative programs and standardization 
that transforms the way people experience our products. 
Our energy efficient solutions enable people to save money 
and protect their capital investment while also lowering 
their energy usage and protecting the environment.
	
This contributes to our social responsibility of sustenance 
of depleting environmental resources.
	
Corporate Governance and Ethics
	
As a Company we have always worked on the side of 
ethics and have shunned expediency in any form. We 
believe that if something is important enough to be done, 
it is important that we do it ethically. We supplement our 
traditionally held values of ethical behaviour and moral 
conduct with explicit rules and regulations that guide our 
efforts in financial, propriety, customer care and business 
excellence.
	
We uphold the policy of “Leadership with trust” that has 
come to play a vital role in how our customers perceive us. 
This is important, given the climate of unparalleled public 
distrust of people in positions of power and authority in 
contemporary business and politics.
(2)	 Board of Directors
	
The Board of Directors has an optimum combination of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors with One Woman 
Director while fifty per cent of the Board of Directors 
comprises of Independent Directors. The Chairperson 
of the Board is an Executive Director. The profiles of 
Directors can be accessed on the Company’s website at 
https://www.havells.com/en/aboutus/directors.html
	
The Board meets at least 4 (Four) times a year and more 
often if Company needs merit additional oversight and 
guidance. During the financial year 2022-23, the time gap 
between any two board meetings did not exceed 120 
(One Hundred and Twenty) days. The Board of Directors 
periodically reviews compliance reports pertaining to 
all laws applicable to the Company. All statutory and 
other matters of significance including information as 
mentioned in Part A of Schedule II to the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 are informed to the Board to enable it to discharge 
its responsibility of strategic supervision of the Company.
	
Tenure of Independent Directors
	
The Board has adopted the provisions with respect 
to appointment and tenure of Independent Directors 
consistent with the Companies Act, 2013 and the Listing 
Regulations. As per the provisions of the Companies Act, 
2013, the Independent Directors shall be appointed for 
not more than two terms of maximum of five years each 
and shall not be liable to retire by rotation. At the time of 
appointment of an Independent Director, the Company 
issues a formal letter of appointment outlining his/ her 
role, function, duties and responsibilities as a Director. 
The template of the letter of appointment is available on 
our website.
	
Lead Independent Director
	
The Independent Directors of the Board had nominated 
Shri Upendra Kumar Sinha as the Lead Independent 
Director of the Company. The role of the Lead Independent 
Director is to provide leadership to the Independent 
Directors, liaise on their behalf and ensure effective 
functioning of the Board.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Havells India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion 
1.	
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of Havells India Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Standalone Balance Sheet as at 
March 31, 2023, and the Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the 
Standalone Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
Standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the year then 
ended, and notes to the financial statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information. 
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information required 
by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so 
required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the 
state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and 
total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other 
comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash 
flows for the year then ended.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible 
assets with indefinite useful lives
Refer Note 4 to the standalone financial statements.
As at March 31, 2023, the standalone financial statements 
include goodwill of ` 310.47 crores and intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives of ` 1,029 crores pertaining to acquisition 
of Lloyd business in an earlier year.
In accordance with the requirements of Indian Accounting 
Standard (Ind AS) 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, the management 
has allocated the said goodwill and intangible assets to the 
underlying Cash Generating Unit (CGU) and tested the same 
for impairment using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. 
Based on such testing, the recoverable amount of the CGU 
is higher than the carrying amount of the said assets and 
accordingly no adjustment for impairment is necessary.
We considered this as a key audit matter because of the 
significant carrying value of the above mentioned assets and 
high estimation uncertainty in assumptions used such as 
discount rate, rate of growth over the estimation period and 
terminal growth rate which are affected by future market and 
economic conditions and, hence, are inherently uncertain.
Our audit procedures among others, included the 
following:
a.	
Understanding and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal controls over the impairment 
assessment process, including preparation of the DCF model; 
b.	
Evaluating the Company’s accounting policy in respect of 
impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets 
with indefinite useful lives; 
c.	
Understanding the cash flow projections and assumptions 
used in the DCF model, evaluating the mathematical accuracy 
and reading the report of the management’s expert; 
d.	
Together with auditor’s valuation experts, testing the 
appropriateness of the DCF model and key assumptions 
therein and performing sensitivity analysis over key 
assumptions to corroborate that the recoverable amount 
of the CGU is within a reasonable range; and
e.	
Testing related presentation and disclosures in the 
standalone financial statements.
Based on the above procedures performed, the management’s 
impairment assessment of the goodwill and intangible assets 
was found to be reasonable.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are 
further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Key audit matters 
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance in our 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current 
period. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a 
whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matter described below to be the key 
audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Other Information
5.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual report but does not 
include the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. 
	
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. 
	
We have nothing to report in this regard.
	
Responsibilities of management and those 
charged with governance for the financial 
statements
6.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these standalone financial statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows 
of the Company in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of 
the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the 
Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
7.	
In preparing the financial statements, management 
is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board 
of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
8.	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
9.	
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgement 
and 
maintain 
professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
•	
Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
	
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by 
management. 
	
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
Havells India Limited
154
report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Company to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
	
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
10.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. 
11.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
12.	 From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
13.	 As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 
2020 (“the Order”), issued by the Central Government 
of India in terms of sub-section (11) of Section 143 of 
the Act, we give in the Annexure B a statement on the 
matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to 
the extent applicable. 
14.	 As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that: 
	
(a)	
We have sought and obtained all the information and 
explanations which to the best of our knowledge and 
belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit. 
	
(b)	
In our opinion, proper books of account as required 
by law have been kept by the Company so far as it 
appears from our examination of those books. 
	
(c)

Statement of Profit and Loss (including other 
comprehensive income), the Standalone Statement 
of Changes in Equity and the Standalone Statement 
of Cash Flows dealt with by this Report are in 
agreement with the books of account. 
	
(d)	
In our opinion, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements comply with the Accounting Standards

from the directors as on March 31, 2023, taken

being appointed as a director in terms of Section 
164(2) of the Act. 
	
(f)	
With respect to the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the 
Company and the operating effectiveness of such 
controls, refer to our separate Report in “Annexure A”. 
	
(g)	
With respect to the other matters to be included in 
the Auditor’s Report in accordance with Rule 11 of 
the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 (as 
amended), in our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us: 
	
	
i.	
The Company has disclosed the impact of 
pending litigations on its financial position in its 
standalone financial statements – Refer Note 
31 to the standalone financial statements; 
	
	
ii.	
The Company was not required to recognise 
a provision as at March 31, 2023 under the 
applicable law or accounting standards, as it 
does not have any material foreseeable losses on 
long-term contract. The Company did not have 
any derivative contracts as at March 31, 2023.
	
	
iii.	
There has been no delay in transferring 
amounts, required to be transferred, to the 
Investor Education and Protection Fund by the 
Company during the year. 
	
	
iv.	
(a)	
The management has represented that, 
to the best of its knowledge and belief, 
as disclosed in the notes to the accounts, 
no funds have been advanced or loaned 
or invested (either from borrowed funds 
or share premium or any other sources or 
kind of funds) by the Company to or in 
any other person(s) or entity(ies), including 
foreign entities (“Intermediaries”), with 
the understanding, whether recorded in 
writing or otherwise, that the Intermediary 
shall, whether, directly or indirectly, lend or 
invest in other persons or entities identified 
in any manner whatsoever by or on behalf 
of the Company (“Ultimate Beneficiaries”)

like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries 
(Refer Note 32(19)(ii) to the standalone

like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries 
(Refer Note 32(19)(ii) to the standalone

(c)

our notice that has caused us to believe that 
the representations under sub-clause (a)

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to Financial Statements under clause (i) of sub-section 
3 of Section 143 of the Act
1.	
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of Havells India Limited 
(“the Company”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction 
with our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
2.	
The 
Company’s 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 
Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under 
Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the 
ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects. 
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls 
system with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to financial statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to financial statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls system with 
reference to financial statements and such internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note issued by ICAI.

The Company has chosen cost model for its Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right-of-Use assets) and intangible 
assets. Consequently, the question of our commenting on whether the revaluation is based on the valuation by a Registered

class of Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right-of-Use assets) or intangible assets does not arise.

Company for holding benami property under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (as amended in 
2016) (formerly the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988)) and Rules made thereunder, and therefore the 
question of our commenting on whether the Company has appropriately disclosed the details in its financial statements does 
not arise. 
ii. (a)	The physical verification of inventory, excluding stocks with third parties, has been conducted at reasonable intervals by the

In respect of inventory lying with third parties, these have substantially been confirmed by them.The discrepancies noticed on 
physical verification of inventory as compared to book records were not 10% or more in aggregate for each class of inventory.

- There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
	
	
All other liabilities are classified as non current.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are

The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realization in cash and cash equivalents. the 
Company has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
	
2.03	 Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Freehold Land is carried at historical cost. All 
other items of Property, Plant and equipment are 
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net 
of accumulated impairment loss, if any. The 
historical cost comprises of purchase price, taxes, 
duties, freight and other incidental expenses 
directly attributable and related to acquisition 
and installation of the concerned assets and are 
further adjusted by the amount of input tax credit 
availed wherever applicable. 
	
	
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of 
the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for 
long-term construction projects if the recognition 
criteria are met. When significant parts of plant 
and equipment are required to be replaced 
at intervals, the Company depreciates them 
separately based on their specific useful lives. 
Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, 
its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 
recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair 
and maintenance costs are recognised in profit 
or loss as incurred. The present value of the 
expected cost for the decommissioning of an 
asset after its use is included in the cost of the 
respective asset if the recognition criteria for a 
provision are met. 
	
	
Subsequent costs are included in asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as separate assets, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefit associated with the item will 
flow to the Company and the cost of item can be 
measured reliably. 
	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognised is derecognized 
upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the 
asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset) is included in the income statement 
when the asset is derecognised.
	
	
Capital work- in- progress includes cost of 
property, plant and equipment under installation / 
under development as at the balance sheet date.
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
	
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment 
is calculated on prorata basis on straight-line 
method using the useful lives of the assets 
estimated by management. The useful life is as 
follows:
Assets 
Useful life (in years)
Building

The useful lives of all the assets except moulds 
and dies, mobile phones and laptops have 
been determined as those specified by part ‘C’ 
of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. In 
respect of moulds and dies and mobile phones, 
useful lives are lower than those specified by 
schedule II to the Companies Act 2013 and 
are depreciated over the estimated useful lives 
of 6 years, 3 years respectively, in respect of 
laptop useful life is more than those specified 
by schedule II to the Company Act 2013 and 
are depreciated over the estimated useful life of 
4 years, in order to reflect the actual usage of 
assets. The residual values are not more than

5% of the original cost of the assets. The asset’s 
residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate.
	
	
Lease hold improvements are depreciated on 
straight line basis over shorter of the asset’s 
useful life and their lease term unless the entity 
expects to use the asset beyond the lease term.
	
	
Leasehold land is amortized on a straight line 
basis over the unexpired period of their respective 
lease ranging from 90-99 years.
	
2.04	 Intangible assets
	
	
Separately acquired intangible assets
	
	
Intangible 
assets 
acquired 
separately 
are 
measured on initial recognition at cost. Cost 
of intangible assets acquired in business 
combination is their fair value at the date of 
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization 
and 
accumulated 
impairment 
losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, 
excluding capitalized development cost, are 
not capitalized and the related expenditure is 
reflected in statement of Profit and Loss in the 
period in which the expenditure is incurred. Cost 
comprises the purchase price and any attributable 
cost of bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use.
	
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed 
as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with 
finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
and assessed for impairment whenever there 
is an indication that the intangible asset may 
be impaired. The amortization period and the 
amortization method for an intangible asset with 
a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of 
each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption 
of future economic benefits embodied in the asset 
is accounted for by changing the amortization 
period or method, as appropriate, and are 
treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortization expense on intangible assets with 
finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit 
and loss.
	
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either individually or at the cash-generating unit 
level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life 
continues to be supportable. If not, the change 
in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a 
prospective basis. The Company has assessed 
indefinite life for such brand considering the 
expected usage, expected investment on brand, 
business forecast and challenges to establish a 
premium electronic segment. These are carried at 
historical cost and tested for impairment annually.
	
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses 
arising from disposal of the intangible assets are 
measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and are recognized in the statement of 
profit and loss when the assets are disposed off.
	
	
Intangible assets with finite useful life are 
amortized on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful life as under

Research and development cost
	
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred. 
Development 
expenditure 
incurred 
on 
an 
individual project is recognized as an intangible 
asset when the Company can demonstrate all 
the following:
	
	
i)	
The technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that it will be available 
for use or sale;
	
	
ii)	
Its intention to complete the asset;
	
	
iii)	
Its ability to use or sale the asset;
	
	
iv)	
How the asset will generate future 
economic benefits;
	
	
v)	
The availability of adequate resources to 
complete the development and to use or 
sale the asset; and

vi)	
The ability to measure reliably the 
expenditure attributable to the intangible 
asset during development.
	
	
	
Following the initial recognition of the 
development expenditure as an asset, the 
cost model is applied requiring the asset 
to be carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortization of the asset begins 
when development is complete and the 
asset is available for use. It is amortized 
on straight line basis over the estimated 
useful life and is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. During the 
period of development, the asset is tested 
for impairment annually.
	
	
Trademarks 
	
	
Brand and Trademarks acquired in business 
combination are initially recognised at fair 
value at the date of acquisition. Following initial 
recognition, brand and trademark are carried at 
the above recognised value less accumulated 
amortization 
and 
accumulated 
impairment 
losses, if any. These Brand and trademarks have 
been in existence for considerable period and 
Company intends to continue use this intangible 
assets. Consequently it is believed that they have 
an indefinite life and are not amortised. Instead 
impairment testing is performed annually and 
whenever a triggering event has occurred to 
determine whether the carrying value exceeds 
the recoverable amount.
	
	
Distributor/ Dealer Network
	
	
Distributor/ 
Dealer 
Network 
acquired 
in 
business combination are initially recognised at 
fair value at the date of acquisition. Following 
initial recognition, Distributor/ Dealer Network 
are carried at the above recognised value less 
accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. They are amortised on 
a straight line basis over their estimated useful life 
of 8 years assessed by the management.
	
	
Goodwill 
	
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred over the fair value of net identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the 
fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess 
of the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Company re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identified all of the assets acquired and all of the 
liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures 
used to measure the amounts to be recognised 
at the acquisition date. If the reassessment 
still results in an excess of the fair value of net 
assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no 
clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity 
recognizes the gain directly in equity as capital 
reserve, without routing the same through other 
comprehensive income.
	
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Company’s cash-generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities 
of the acquire are assigned to those units. 
	
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has 
been allocated is tested for impairment annually 
or earlier, when there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 
of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount 
of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss 
for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An 
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in subsequent periods.
	
	
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-
generating unit and part of the operation within that 
unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with 
the disposed operation is included in the carrying 
amount of the operation when determining the 
gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in 
these circumstances is measured based on the 
relative values of the disposed operation and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
	
2.05	 Impairment of non- financial assets
	
	
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, 
whether there is an indication that an asset may 
be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
Havells India Limited
172
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
(CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and 
its value in use. The recoverable amount is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the 
asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets 
or groups of assets. When the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount.
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted 
share prices for publicly traded companies or 
other available fair value indicators.
	
	
The Company bases its impairment calculation 
on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, 
which are prepared separately for each of the 
Company’s CGUs to which the individual assets 
are allocated. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of five 
years. For longer periods, a long-term growth 
rate is calculated and applied to project future 
cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash 
flow projections beyond periods covered by the 
most recent budgets/forecasts, the Company 
extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget 
using a steady or declining growth rate for 
subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can 
be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not 
exceed the long-term average growth rate for the 
products, industries, or country or countries in 
which the Company operates, or for the market 
in which the asset is used.
	
	
Impairment losses of continuing operations, 
including 
impairment 
on 
inventories, 
are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss, 
except for properties previously revalued with 
the revaluation surplus taken to OCI. For such 
properties, the impairment is recognised in OCI 
up to the amount of any previous revaluation 
surplus.
	
	
For assets excluding goodwill and intangible 
assets having indefinite life, an assessment 
is made at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is an indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses no longer exist 
or have decreased. If such indication exists, 
the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been 
a change in the assumptions used to determine 
the asset’s recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is 
limited so that the carrying amount of the asset 
does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor 
exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss unless the asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the 
reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and 
when circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired. Impairment is determined 
for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount 
of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the 
goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount 
of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses 
relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future 
periods.
	
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
are tested for impairment annually as at March 
31 at the CGU level, as appropriate, and when 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
	
2.06	 Financial instruments 
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity.
	
	
(i)	
Financial Assets
	
	
	
The Company classifies its financial assets 
in the following measurement categories:
Integrated Report
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Standalone
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
173
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
	
-	
Those to be measured subsequently at fair 
value (either through other comprehensive 
income, or through profit or loss)
	
	
-	
Those measured at amortized cost
	
	
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and the 
Company’s business model for managing them
	
	
Initial recognition measurement
	
	
With the exception of trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component or 
for which the Company has applied the practical 
expedient, the Company initially measures a 
financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of 
a financial asset not at fair value through profit or 
loss, transaction costs. 
	
	
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component or for which the Company 
has applied the practical expedient are measured 
at the transaction price determined under Ind AS 
115. Refer to the accounting policies in section 
‘Revenue from contracts with customers’.
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows 
that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest 
(SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This 
assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is 
performed at an instrument level. Financial assets 
with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified 
and measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
	
	
The Company’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages its 
financial assets in order to generate cash flows. 
The business model determines whether cash 
flows will result from collecting contractual cash 
flows, selling the financial assets, or both.
	
	
Financial assets classified and measured at 
amortised cost are held within a business model 
with the objective to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows while financial 
assets classified and measured at fair value 
through OCI are held within a business model 
with the objective of both holding to collect 
contractual cash flows and selling.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement 
financial assets are classified in following 
categories:
	
	
-	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
	
	
-	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with 
recycling of cumulative gains and losses 
(debt instruments)
	
	
-	
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI with no recycling of cumulative 
gains and losses upon derecognition 
(equity instruments) 
	
	
-	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss
	
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised 
cost if both the following conditions are met:
	
	
a)	
Business Model Test : The objective is 
to hold the financial asset to collect the 
contractual cash flows (rather than to 
sell the instrument prior to its contractual 
maturity to realize its fair value changes) 
and;
	
	
b)	
Cash flow characteristics test: The 
contractual terms of the financial asset 
give rise on specific dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on principal amount outstanding.
	
	
This category is most relevant to the Company. 
After initial measurement, such financial assets 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of 
EIR. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the 
estimated future cash receipts over the expected 
life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, 
where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount 
of the financial asset. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Company estimates 
Havells India Limited
174
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
the expected cash flows by considering all the 
contractual terms of the financial instrument but 
does not consider the expected credit losses. The 
EIR amortization is included in other income in 
profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment 
are recognized in the profit or loss. This category 
generally applies to trade and other receivables.
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through OCI (FVTOCI) 
(debt instruments)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if 
both of the following criteria are met: 
	
	
a)	
Business Model Test : The objective of 
financial instrument is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling the financial assets; and
	
	
b)	
Cash flow characteristics test: The 
contractual terms of the Debt instrument 
give rise on specific dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on principal amount outstanding.
	
	
Debt instrument included within the FVTOCI 
category are measured initially as well as at 
each reporting date at fair value. Fair value 
movements are recognized in the other 
comprehensive income (OCI), except for the 
recognition of interest income, impairment gains 
or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses 
which are recognized in statement of profit and 
loss and computed in the same manner as for 
financial assets measured at amortised cost. 
The remaining fair value changes are recognised 
in OCI. Upon derecognition, the cumulative fair 
value changes recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to profit or loss.
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair 
value with net changes in fair value recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. This 
category includes derivative instruments and 
listed equity investments which the Group 
had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair 
value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity 
investments are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss when the right of payment has 
been established.
	
	
Financial assets designated at fair value through 
OCI (equity instruments)
	
	
Upon initial recognition, the Company can elect 
to classify irrevocably its equity investments 
as equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI when they meet the definition of 
equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation and are not held for trading. The 
classification is determined on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. Equity instruments which 
are held for trading and contingent consideration 
recognised by an acquirer in a business 
combination to which Ind AS103 applies are 
classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the statement of 
profit and loss when the right of payment has 
been established, except when the Company 
benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of 
part of the cost of the financial asset, in which 
case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity 
instruments designated at fair value through OCI 
are not subject to impairment assessment. 
	
	
Embedded Derivatives
	
	
A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, 
with a financial liability or non-financial host, 
is separated from the host and accounted 
for as a separate derivative if: the economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related 
to the host; a separate instrument with the same 
terms as the embedded derivative would meet the 
definition of a derivative; and the hybrid contract 
is not measured at fair value through profit or 
loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognised in 
profit or loss. Reassessment only occurs if there 
is either a change in the terms of the contract that 
significantly modifies the cash flows that would 
otherwise be required or a reclassification of a 
financial asset out of the fair value through profit 
or loss category. 
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of 
a financial asset or part of a Company of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. 
removed from the Company’s statement of 
financial position) when:

for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
	
-	
The rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset have expired, or 
	
	
-	
the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset or has 
assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a “pass through” 
arrangement and either;
	
	
(a)	
the Company has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
	
	
(b)	
the Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
	
	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered 
into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates 
if and to what extent it has retained the risks 
and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred 
control of the asset, the Company continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the extent of 
the Company’s continuing involvement. In that 
case, the Group also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects 
the rights and obligations that the Group has 
retained.
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the group could be required to repay.
	
	
Investment in associates, joint venture and 
subsidiaries
	
	
the Company has accounted for its investment 
in subsidiaries and associate and joint venture at 
cost.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with IND AS 109, the Company 
applies expected credit losses(ECL) model for 
measurement and recognition of impairment loss 
on the following financial asset and credit risk 
exposure
	
	
-	
Financial assets measured at amortized 
cost;
	
	
-	
Financial 
assets 
measured 
at 
fair 
value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income(FVTOCI);
	
	
ECLs are based on the difference between the 
contractual cash flows due in accordance with 
the contract and all the cash flows that the 
Group expects to receive, discounted at an 
approximation of the original effective interest 
rate. The expected cash flows will include cash 
flows from the sale of collateral held or other 
credit enhancements that are integral to the 
contractual terms.
	
	
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit 
exposures for which there has not been a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses 
that result from default events that are possible 
within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For 
those credit exposures for which there has been 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit 
losses expected over the remaining life of the 
exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default 
(a lifetime ECL).
	
	
The Company follows “simplified approach” for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on:
	
	
-	
Trade receivables or contract revenue 
receivables; Trade receivables which are 
held to collect and sale basis accounted 
for as FVTPL
	
	
-	
All lease receivables resulting from the 
transactions within the scope of Ind AS 
116 -Leases
	
	
Under the simplified approach, the Company 
does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, it 
recognizes impairment loss allowance based on 
lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its 
initial recognition. The Company uses a provision 
matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on 
the portfolio of trade receivables. The provision 
matrix is based on its historically observed default 
rates over the expected life of trade receivable 
and is adjusted for forward looking estimates. 
Havells India Limited
176
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
At every reporting date, the historical observed 
default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized as 
income/ expense in the statement of profit and 
loss. This amount is reflected under the head 
‘other expenses’ in the statement of profit and 
loss. The balance sheet presentation for various 
financial instruments is described below:
	
	
(a)	
Financial 
assets 
measured 
as 
at 
amortised cost: ECL is presented as 
an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of 
the measurement of those assets in the 
balance sheet. The allowance reduces 
the net carrying amount. Until the asset 
meets write-off criteria, the group does 
not reduce impairment allowance from the 
gross carrying amount.
	
	
(b)	
Loan commitments and financial guarantee 
contracts: ECL is presented as a provision in 
the balance sheet, i.e. as a liability. 
	
	
(c)	
Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: 
For 
debt 
instruments 
measured 
at 
FVTOCI, the expected credit losses do 
not reduce the carrying amount in the 
balance sheet, which remains at fair 
value. Instead, an amount equal to the 
allowance that would arise if the asset was 
measured at amortised cost is recognised 
in other comprehensive income as the 
accumulated impairment amount.
	
	
(ii)	
Financial liabilities:
	
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified at initial 
recognition as financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss, loans and 
borrowings, and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. All financial 
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans and borrowings 
and payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Company financial 
liabilities include loans and borrowings, 
trade payables, trade deposits, retention 
money, liabilities towards services, sales 
incentive and other payables.
	
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial liabilities are classified in two 
categories: 
	
	
	
(i)	
Financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss 
	
	
	
(ii)	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(loans and borrowings)
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading 
and financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition as at fair value through profit or 
loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for 
trading if they are incurred for the purpose of 
repurchasing in the near term. This category also 
includes derivative financial instruments entered 
into by the Company that are not designated 
as hedging instruments in hedge relationship as 
defined by Ind AS 109. The separated embedded 
derivate are also classified as held for trading 
unless they are designated as effective hedging 
instruments.
	
	
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading 
are recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or loss 
are designated as such at the initial date of 
recognition, and only if the criteria in IND AS 
109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as 
FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to 
changes in own credit risk are recognized in 
OCI. These gains/ loss are not subsequently 
transferred to profit and loss. However, the 
Company may transfer the cumulative gain 
or loss within equity. All other changes in fair 
value of such liability are recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss. the Company has 
not designated any financial liability as at fair 
value through profit and loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (Loans and 
borrowings)
	
	
After 
initial 
recognition, 
interest-bearing 
borrowings are subsequently measured at

amortized cost using the Effective interest rate 
method. Gains and losses are recognized in 
profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised 
as well as through the Effective interest rate 
amortization 
process. 
Amortized 
cost 
is 
calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the Effective interest rate. The 
Effective interest rate amortization is included as 
finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. 
	
	
Trade Payables
	
	
These amounts represents liabilities for goods and 
services provided to the Company prior to the end 
of financial year which are unpaid. The amounts 
are unsecured and are usually paid per the term of 
contract with suppliers. Trade and other payables 
are presented as current liabilities unless payment 
is not due within 12 months after the reporting 
period. They are recognized initially at fair value 
and subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using Effective interest rate method.
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts 
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the 
Company are those contracts that require a 
payment to be made to reimburse the holder 
for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor 
fails to make a payment when due in accordance 
with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial 
guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a 
liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured 
at the higher of the amount of loss allowance 
determined as per impairment requirements of 
IND AS 109 and the amount recognized less 
cumulative amortization.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The 
difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financials assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognized amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
	
Reclassification of financial assets/ financial 
liabilities
	
	
The Company determines classification of 
financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. 
After initial recognition, no reclassification is made 
for financial assets which are equity instruments 
and financial liabilities. For financial assets 
which are debt instruments, a reclassification is 
made only if there is a change in the business 
model for managing those assets. Changes 
to the business model are expected to be 
infrequent. The Company’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as 
a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Company’s operations. 
Such changes are evident to external parties. A 
change in the business model occurs when the 
Company either begins or ceases to perform 
an activity that is significant to its operations. 
If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it 
applies the reclassification prospectively from 
the reclassification date which is the first day of 
the immediately next reporting period following 
the change in business model. The Company 
does not restate any previously recognised gains, 
losses (including impairment gains or losses) or 
interest.
	
2.07	 Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
	
	
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
	
	
Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which 
a derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when 
the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities 
when the fair value is negative.
	
	
The purchase contracts that meet the definition 
of a derivative under Ind AS 109 are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. Commodity 
contracts that are entered into and continue to 
be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery 
Havells India Limited
178
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
of a non-financial item in accordance with the 
Company’s expected purchase, sale or usage 
requirements are held at cost.
	
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in 
the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to 
profit or loss, except for the effective portion of 
cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI 
and later reclassified to profit or loss when the 
hedge item affects profit or loss or treated as 
basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction 
subsequently results in the recognition of a non-
financial asset or non-financial liability.
	
	
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges 
are classified as:
	
	
(i)	
Fair value hedges when hedging the 
exposure to changes in the fair value 
of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment 
	
	
(ii)	
Cash flow hedges when hedging the 
exposure to variability in cash flows that 
is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or 
liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction or the foreign currency risk in 
an unrecognised firm commitment
	
	
(iii)	
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign 
operation
	
	
Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for, as described 
below:
	
	
(i)	
Fair value hedges
	
	
	
The change in the fair value of a hedging 
instrument is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss as finance costs. The 
change in the fair value of the hedged item 
attributable to the risk hedged is recorded 
as part of the carrying value of the hedged 
item and is also recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss as finance costs.
	
	
For fair value hedges relating to items carried 
at amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying 
value is amortised through profit or loss over 
the remaining term of the hedge using the EIR 
method. EIR amortization may begin as soon as 
an adjustment exists and no later than when the 
hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in 
its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
	
	
If the hedged item is derecognised, the 
unamortised fair value is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss. When an unrecognised firm 
commitment is designated as a hedged item, the 
subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of 
the firm commitment attributable to the hedged 
risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a 
corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit 
and loss.
	
	
(ii)	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument is recognised 
in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, 
while any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the statement of profit and 
loss.
	
	
The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency 
contracts is recognised in finance costs and the 
ineffective portion relating to commodity contracts 
is recognised in other income or expenses. 
	
	
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to 
profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects 
profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial 
income or financial expense is recognised or 
when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged 
item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-
financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI 
are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the 
non-financial asset or liability.
	
	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement 
or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), 
or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or 
when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in OCI remains separately 
in equity until the forecast transaction occurs or 
the foreign currency firm commitment is met.
	
2.08	 Investment in Subsidiaries and joint venture
	
	
The investment in subsidiary and Joint venture are 
carried at cost as per IND AS 27. The Company 
regardless of the nature of its involvement with

an entity (the investee), determines whether it 
is a parent by assessing whether it controls the 
investee. The Company controls an investee 
when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the investee. Thus, the Company 
controls an investee if and only if it has all the 
following:
	
	
(a)	
power over the investee;
	
	
(b)	
exposure, or rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and
	
	
(c)	
the ability to use its power over the investee 
to affect the amount of the returns.
	
	
Investments are accounted in accordance with 
IND AS 105 when they are classified as held for 
sale. On disposal of investment, the difference 
between its carrying amount and net disposal 
proceeds is charged or credited to the statement 
of profit and loss
	
2.09	 Inventories
	
	
a)	
Basis of valuation:
	
	
	
i)	
Inventories 
other 
than 
scrap 
materials are valued at lower of 
cost and net realizable value after 
providing cost of obsolescence, if 
any. However, materials and other 
items held for use in the production 
of inventories are not written down 
below cost if the finished products 
in which they will be incorporated 
are expected to be sold at or above 
cost. The comparison of cost and 
net realizable value is made on an 
item-by-item basis.
	
	
	
ii)	
Inventory of scrap materials have been 
valued at net realizable value.
	
	
b)	
Method of Valuation:
	
	
	
i)	
Cost of raw materials has been 
determined 
by 
using 
moving 
weighted average cost method and 
comprises all costs of purchase, 
duties, taxes (other than those 
subsequently 
recoverable 
from 
tax authorities) and all other costs 
incurred in bringing the inventories 
to 
their 
present 
location 
and 
condition.
	
	
	
ii)	
Cost of finished goods and work-
in-progress includes direct labour 
and an appropriate share of fixed 
and variable production overheads. 
Fixed production overheads are 
allocated on the basis of normal 
capacity of production facilities. 
Cost is determined on moving 
weighted average basis.
	
	
	
iii)	
Cost of traded goods has been 
determined 
by 
using 
moving 
weighted average cost method and 
comprises all costs of purchase, 
duties, taxes (other than those 
subsequently 
recoverable 
from 
tax authorities) and all other costs 
incurred in bringing the inventories 
to 
their 
present 
location 
and 
condition.
	
	
	
iv)	
Net realizable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
	
2.10	 Non-current assets held for sale
	
	
The Company classifies non-current assets 
as held for sale if their carrying amounts will 
be recovered principally through a sale rather 
than through continuing use and the sale is 
considered highly probable. Such non-current 
assets classified as held for sale are measured at 
the lower of their carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. Any expected loss is recognized 
immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The criteria for held for sale classification is 
regarded as met only when the assets is available 
for immediate sale in its present condition, subject 
only to terms that are usual and customary for 
sales of such assets, its sale is highly probable; 
and it will genuinely be sold. The Company treats 
sale of the asset to be highly probable when:
	
	
i)	
The appropriate level of management is 
committed to a plan to sell the asset
Havells India Limited
180
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
	
ii)	
An active programme to locate a buyer 
and complete the plan has been initiated 
(if applicable)
	
	
iii)	
The asset is being actively marketed for 
sale at a price that is reasonable in relation 
to its current fair value,
	
	
iv)	
The sale is expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one 
year from the date of classification, and
	
	
v)	
Actions required to complete the plan 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant 
changes to the plan will be made or that 
the plan will be withdrawn.
	
	
The criteria for held for sale classification is 
regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition and the assets 
must have actively marketed for sale at a price 
that is reasonable in relation to its current fair 
value. Actions required to complete the sale 
should indicate that it is unlikely that significant 
changes to the plan to sale these assets will be 
made. Management must be committed to the 
sale, which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year 
from the date of classification.
	
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets once classified as held for sale are not 
depreciated or amortized. Assets and liabilities 
classified as held for sale are presented separately 
as current items in the balance sheet.
	
2.11	 Income Tax
	
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period 
is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable 
income based on the applicable income tax rate 
adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and 
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and 
to unused tax losses. Income Tax expense for the 
year comprises of current tax and deferred tax.
	
	
a)	
Current income tax
	
	
	
	
Current income tax, assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected 
to be paid to or recovered from the 
taxation authorities in accordance with 
the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Income 
Computation and Disclosure Standards 
(ICDS) enacted in India by using tax rates 
and the tax laws that are enacted at the 
reporting date. 
	
	
	
The 
current 
income 
tax 
charge 
is 
calculated on the basis of the tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at 
the end of the reporting period in the 
countries where the company operate and 
generate taxable income. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in 
which applicable tax regulation is subject 
to interpretation and considers whether 
it is probable that a taxation authority will 
accept an uncertain tax treatment. The 
group measures its tax balances either 
based on the most likely amount or the 
expected value, depending on which 
method provides a better prediction of the 
resolution of the uncertainty.
	
	
	
Current income tax relating to item 
recognized outside the statement of profit 
and loss is recognized outside profit or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income or 
equity).Current tax items are recognized in 
correlation to the underlying transactions 
either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
b)	
Deferred Tax
	
	
	
Deferred tax is provided in full using the 
balance sheet method on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. 
However, deferred tax liabilities are not 
recognised if they arise from the initial 
recognition of goodwill. 
	
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences, except:
	
	
	
	
i)	
When the deferred tax liability arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit 
nor taxable profit or loss

ii)	
In respect of taxable temporary 
differences 
associated 
with 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint 
ventures, when the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences 
can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and 
any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised, except:
	
	
	
i)	
When the deferred tax asset 
relating to the deductible temporary 
difference arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss.
	
	
	
ii)	
In respect of deductible temporary 
differences 
associated 
with 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint 
ventures, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable 
profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be 
utilised.
	
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized 
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at 
each reporting date and are recognized 
to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realized or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.
	
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognized 
outside the statement of profit and loss is 
recognized outside the statement of profit 
and loss (either in other comprehensive 
income or in equity). Deferred tax items are 
recognized in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or direct in equity.
	
	
	
Tax benefits acquired as part of a business 
combination, 
but 
not 
satisfying 
the 
criteria for separate recognition at that 
date, are recognised subsequently if new 
information about facts and circumstances 
change. Acquired deferred tax benefits 
recognised within the measurement period 
reduce goodwill related to that acquisition 
if they result from new information obtained 
about facts and circumstances existing at 
the acquisition date. If the carrying amount 
of goodwill is zero, any remaining deferred 
tax benefits are recognised in OCI/ capital 
reserve 
depending 
on 
the 
principle 
explained for bargain purchase gains. All 
other acquired tax benefits realized are 
recognised in profit or loss.
	
2.12	 Revenue from contract with customers
	
	
The Company manufactures/ trades and sells 
a range of consumer electrical and electronic 
products. Revenue from contracts with customers 
involving sale of these products is recognized at a 
point in time when control of the product has been 
transferred, and there are no unfulfilled obligation 
that could affect the customer’s acceptance of 
the products which usually happen on delivery of 
goods. The Company also provides installation, 
annual maintenance and warranty services 
that are either sold separately or bundled 
together with the sale of goods. The Company 
recognizes these service revenue from sales 
Havells India Limited
182
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
of services over a period of time, because the 
customer simultaneously receives and consumes 
the benefits provided by the Company. The 
Company has objective evidence that all criterion 
for acceptance has been satisfied. A receivable 
is recognised when the control of the product is 
transferred as the consideration is unconditional 
and payment becomes due upon passage of 
time as per the terms of contract with customers.
	
	
(a)	
Sale of goods
	
	
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised 
at the point in time when control of the 
goods is transferred to the customer, 
generally on delivery of the goods and 
there are no unfulfilled obligations.
	
	
	
The Company considers, whether there 
are other promises in the contract in which 
their are separate performance obligations, 
to which a portion of the transaction price 
needs to be allocated. In determining the 
transaction price for the sale of goods, 
the Company allocates a portion of the 
transaction price to different performance 
obligations goods bases on its relative 
standalone prices and also considers the 
following:-
	
	
	
(i)	
Variable consideration
	
	
	
	
The Company recognizes revenue 
from the sale of goods measured at 
the standalone selling price of the 
consideration received or receivable, 
net of returns and allowances, trade 
discounts and volume rebates. 
If the consideration in a contract 
includes a variable amount, the 
Company estimates the amount 
of consideration to which it will be 
entitled in exchange for transferring 
the 
goods 
to 
the 
customer. 
The 
variable 
consideration 
is 
estimated at contract inception 
and constrained until it is highly 
probable that a significant revenue 
reversal in the amount of cumulative 
revenue recognised will not occur 
when the associated uncertainty 
with the variable consideration 
is 
subsequently 
resolved. 
The 
Company operates several sales 
incentive 
programmes 
wherein 
the customers are eligible for 
several benefits on achievement of 
underlying conditions as prescribed 
in the scheme programme such 
as credit notes, reimbursement, 
investments etc. Revenue from 
contract with customer is presented 
after deducting cost of all these 
schemes.
	
	
(ii)	
Warranty obligations
	
	
	
The Company generally provides for 
warranties for general repair of defects. 
These warranties are assurance-type 
warranties under Ind AS 115, which 
are accounted for under Ind AS 37 
(Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets). However, in certain 
non-standard contracts in respect of sale 
of consumer durable goods, the Company 
provides extended warranties and such 
warranties are termed as service-type 
warranties and therefore, accounted for 
as separate performance obligations to 
which the Company allocates a portion 
of the transaction price. Revenue from 
service-type warranties is recognised over 
the period in which the service is provided 
based on the time elapsed
	
	
(iii)	
Significant Financing Components
	
	
	
	
In respect of short-term advances from its 
customers, using the practical expedient in 
Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust 
the promised amount of consideration 
for the effects of a significant financing 
component if it expects, at contract 
inception, that the period between the 
transfer of the promised good or service 
to the customer and when the customer 
pays for that good or service will be within 
normal operating cycle.
	
	
	
In respect of long term contracts, the transaction 
price for these contracts is discounted, using 
the interest rate implicit in the contract (i.e., 
the interest rate that discounts the cash selling 
price of the equipment to the amount paid in 
advance).

No significant element of financing is deemed 
present as the sales are made with a credit 
term of 21 to 90 days, which is consistent with 
market practice.
	
	
	
(b)	
Sale of services
	
	
	
	
The 
Company 
provides 
installation, 
annual 
maintenance 
and 
extended 
warranty services that are sold separately. 
The Company recognizes revenue from 
sales of services over time, because the 
customer simultaneously receives and 
consumes the benefits provided by the 
Company. Revenue from services related 
activities is recognised as and when 
services are rendered and on the basis of 
contractual terms with the parties.
	
	
	
(c)	
Contract balances
	
	
	
	
A contract asset is the right to 
consideration 
in 
exchange 
for 
goods or services transferred to the 
customer. Contract assets are in the 
nature of unbilled receivables, which 
arises when Company satisfies a 
performance obligation but does 
not have an unconditional rights 
to consideration. A receivables 
represents the Company’s right to 
an amount of consideration that is 
unconditional. Contract assets are 
subject to impairment assessment. 
Refer to accounting policies on 
impairment of financial assets in 
section (Financial instruments – 
initial recognition and subsequent 
measurement).
	
	
	
	
A contract liability is the obligation 
to transfer goods or services to a 
customer for which the Company 
has received consideration (or an 
amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer 
pays 
consideration 
before 
the 
Company 
transfers 
goods 
or 
services to the customer, a contract 
liability is recognised when the 
payment is made or the payment is 
due (whichever is earlier). Contract 
liabilities are recognised as revenue 
when the Company performs under 
the contract (i.e., transfers control 
of the related goods or services to 
the customer).
	
	
	
	
	
A trade receivable is recognised 
if an amount of consideration 
that is unconditional (i.e., only the 
passage of time is required before 
payment of the consideration is 
due). Refer to accounting policies of 
financial assets in section (Financial 
instruments – initial recognition and 
subsequent measurement).
	
	
	
(d)	
Income from Service Concession 
Arrangement
	
	
	
	
	
Revenue related to Street Lights 
Upgrade services provided under 
service concession arrangement is 
recognized as per the agreement 
with the grantor. The Company 
recognizes a financial asset arising 
from 
the 
service 
concession 
agreement 
when 
it 
has 
an 
unconditional contractual right to 
receive cash or another financial 
asset from or at the direction of the 
grantor of the concession for the 
upgrade services provided. Such 
financial assets are measured at fair 
value upon initial recognition.
	
2.13	 Other Income
	
	
(a)	
Interest Income 
	
	
	
For all debt instruments measured either at 
amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, interest income is 
recorded using the effective interest rate 
(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments or 
receipts over the expected life of the 
financial instrument or a shorter period, 
where appropriate, to the gross carrying 
amount of the financial asset or to the 
amortised cost of a financial liability. When 
calculating the effective interest rate, the 
Company estimates the expected cash 
flows by considering all the contractual 
terms of the financial instrument (for 
example, prepayment, extension, call and

similar options) but does not consider the 
expected credit losses. Interest income is 
included in other income in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
2.14	 Other Operating Revenues
	
	
(a)	
Export benefit
	
	
	
Revenue from export benefits arising 
from Duty entitlement pass book (DEPB 
scheme), 
duty 
drawback 
scheme, 
merchandise export incentive scheme, 
Remission of duties and taxes on exported 
product scheme are recognised on 
export of goods in accordance with their 
respective underlying scheme at fair value 
of consideration received or receivable.
	
	
(b)	
Government Grants 
	
	
	
Government Grants are recognized at 
their fair value when there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received 
and all the attached conditions will be 
complied with.
	
	
	
When the grant relates to an expense 
item, it is recognized as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods that the 
related costs, for which it is intended to 
compensate, are expensed. Government 
grant related to the non-monetary asset 
are recognised at nominal value and 
presented by deducting the same from 
carrying amount of related asset and the 
grant is then recognised in profit or loss 
over the useful life of the depreciable asset 
by way of a reduced depreciation charge.
	
2.15	 Retirement and other employee benefits
	
	
(i)	
Short-term obligations
	
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including 
non monetary benefits that are expected 
to be settled wholly within twelve months 
after the end of the period in which the 
employees render the related service are 
recognized in respect of employee service 
upto the end of the reporting period and 
are measured at the amount expected 
to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
The liabilities are presented as current 
employee benefit obligations in the balance 
sheet.
	
	
(ii)	
Post employment
	
	
a)	
Gratuity
	
	
	
The Employee’s Gratuity Fund Scheme, 
which is defined benefit plan, is managed 
by Trust with its investments maintained 
with Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co.Ltd. 
The liabilities with respect to Gratuity Plan 
are determined by actuarial valuation on 
projected unit credit method on the balance 
sheet date, based upon which the Company 
contributes to the Gratuity Scheme. The 
difference, if any, between the actuarial 
valuation of the gratuity of employees at 
the year end and the balance of funds is 
provided for as assets/ (liability) in the books. 
Net interest is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability or asset. The Company recognizes 
the following changes in the net defined 
benefit obligation under Employee benefit 
expense in statement of profit or loss:
	
	
	
a)	
Service costs comprising current 
service costs, past-service costs, 
gains and losses on curtailments 
and non-routine settlements
	
	
	
b)	
Net interest expense or income
	
	
	
Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial 
gains and losses, the effect of the asset 
ceiling, excluding amounts included in net 
interest on the net defined benefit liability 
and the return on plan assets (excluding 
amounts included in net interest on the 
net defined benefit liability), are recognized 
immediately in the Balance Sheet with a 
corresponding debit or credit to retained 
earnings through other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
	
b)	
Provident fund
	
	
	
Retirement benefit in the form of provident 
fund is a defined contribution scheme. the 
Company has no obligation, other than the 
contribution payable to the provident fund. 
The Company recognizes contribution 
payable through provident fund scheme 
as an expense, when an employee renders 
the related services. If the contribution

payable to scheme for service received 
before the balance sheet date exceeds 
the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable to the scheme is recognized as 
liability after deducting the contribution 
already paid. If the contribution already 
paid exceeds the contribution due for 
services received before the balance sheet 
date, then excesses recognized as an 
asset to the extent that the prepayment 
will lead to, for example, a reduction in 
future payment or a cash refund. 
	
	
(iii)	
Other employee benefits
	
	
	
Employees (including senior executives) of 
the Company receive remuneration in the 
form of share based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services as 
consideration 
for 
equity 
instruments. 
In accordance with the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Share Based 
Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 and 
the Ind-AS 102 Share based payments, 
the fair value of options granted under the 
Havells Long Term cumulative expense 
recognized for equity-settled transactions 
at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the 
Company’s best estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The expense or credit recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognized as at the beginning 
and end of that period and is recognized 
in employee benefits expense.
	
	
	
Where the terms of an equity-settled 
transaction award are modified, the 
minimum expense recognized is the 
expense as if the terms had not been 
modified, if the original terms of the 
award are met. An additional expense 
is recognized for any modification that 
increases the total intrinsic value of the 
share-based payment transaction, or is 
otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification. 
The Employee stock option scheme is 
administered through Havells Employee 
Welfare Trust.
	
	
The Company provides long term incentive plan 
to employees via equity settled share based 
payments as enumerated below:
	
	
(a)	
Havells Employee Stock Purchase Plan:   
The fair value of options granted under this 
option plan is recognised as an employee 
benefit 
expense 
with 
corresponding 
increase in equity in accordance with 
recognition and measurement principles 
as prescribed in Ind AS 102 Share Based 
Payments when grant is made. The total 
expense is recognised over the vesting 
period, which is the period over which 
all of the specified vesting conditions are 
to be satisfied. At end of the reporting 
period, the entity revises its estimates of 
the number of options that are expected 
to vest based on the non-market vesting 
and service conditions. It recognizes the 
impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in profit or loss, with corresponding 
adjustment to equity.	
	
	
	
	
	
(b)	
Havells Employees Long term Incentive 
plan : These are in nature of employee 
benefit wherein employees (including 
senior 
executives) 
of 
the 
Company 
purchase shares of the Company at fair 
value on the grant cum allotment date and 
receives remuneration in the form of ex-
gratia equivalent to predefined percentage 
of purchase price paid by designated 
employee subject to serving of relevant 
period of service after the grant cum 
allotment date. These are recognised at 
fair value of shares granted and allotted as 
employee benefit expense over the period 
of employee serving relevant period.
	
2.16	 Leases
	
	
The Company assesses at contract inception 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That 
is, if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.
	
	
Company as a lessee
	
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily 
comprise of lease for land and building. The 
Company applies a single recognition and 
Havells India Limited
186

measurement approach for all leases, except 
for short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities 
to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying 
assets.
	
	
i)	
Right-of-use assets (ROU)
	
	
	
The Company recognises right-of-use 
assets at the commencement date of the 
lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is 
available for use). Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and 
adjusted for any remeasurement of lease 
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets 
includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and the 
estimated useful lives of the building (i.e. 
30 and 60 years)
	
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers 
to the Company at the end of the lease 
term or the cost reflects the exercise 
of a purchase option, depreciation is 
calculated using the estimated useful life 
of the asset. The right-of-use assets are 
also subject to impairment. Refer to the 
accounting policies in section ‘Impairment 
of non-financial assets’.
	
	
	
The Company classifies ROU assets as 
part of Property plant and equipment 
in Balance Sheet and lease liability in “ 
Financial Liability”.
	
	
ii)	
Lease Liabilities
	
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, 
the Company recognises lease liabilities 
measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed 
payments (including in substance fixed 
payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments that 
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts 
expected to be paid under residual value 
guarantees. The lease payments also 
include the exercise price of a purchase 
option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Company and payments of penalties 
for terminating the lease, if the lease term 
reflects the Company exercising the option 
to terminate. Variable lease payments that 
do not depend on an index or a rate are 
recognised as expenses (unless they are 
incurred to produce inventories) in the 
period in which the event or condition that 
triggers the payment occurs.
	
	
	
In calculating the present value of 
lease payments, the Company uses its 
incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is not readily 
determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest 
and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of 
lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, 
a change in the lease payments (e.g., 
changes to future payments resulting 
from a change in an index or rate used 
to determine such lease payments) or a 
change in the assessment of an option to 
purchase the underlying asset.
	
	
	
Lease payments are allocated between 
principal and finance cost. The finance 
cost is charged to profit or loss over the 
lease period so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period.
	
	
	
Variable lease payments that depend on 
sales are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which the condition that triggers 
those payments occurs.
	
	
(iii)	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets
	
	
	
The Company applies the short-term 
lease recognition exemption to its short-
term leases (i.e., those leases that have a 
lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a 
purchase option). It also applies the lease

Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
of low-value assets recognition exemption 
to leases that are considered to be low 
value. Lease payments on short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets are 
recognised as expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
	
2.17	 Segment reporting :
	
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the decision making authority. The Board of 
directors monitors the operating results of all 
product segments separately for the purpose of 
making decisions about resource allocation and 
performance assessment. 
	
	
The operating segments have been identified 
on the basis of the nature of products/services. 
Further: 
	
	
1	
Segment revenue includes sales and other 
income directly identifiable with / allocable 
to the segment including inter - segment 
revenue.
	
	
2	
Expenses that are directly identifiable with 
/ allocable to segments are considered for 
determining the segment result. Expenses 
which relate to the Company as a whole 
and not allocable to segments are included 
under unallocable expenditure.
	
	
3	
Income which relates to the Company as 
a whole and not allocable to segments is 
included in unallocable income.
	
	
4	
Segment assets and liabilities include 
those 
directly 
identifiable 
with 
the 
respective segments. Unallocable assets 
and liabilities represent the assets and 
liabilities that relate to the Company as a 
whole and not allocable to any segment.
	
2.18	 Earnings Per Share
	
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit or loss for the period attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. The weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period is adjusted 
for events such as bonus issue, bonus element in 
a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split 
(consolidation of shares) if any that have changed 
the number of equity shares outstanding, without 
a corresponding change in resources.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings 
per share, the net profit or loss for the period 
attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding 
during the period are adjusted for the effect of all 
potentially dilutive equity shares. 
	
2.19	 Borrowing Costs
	
	
Borrowing cost includes interest and other 
costs incurred in connection with the borrowing 
of funds and charged to Statement of Profit 
& Loss on the basis of effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Borrowing cost also includes 
exchange differences to the extent regarded as 
an adjustment to the borrowing cost.
	
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of an 
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period 
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are 
capitalized as part of the cost of the respective 
asset. All other borrowing costs are recognized 
as expense in the period in which they occur.
	
2.20	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet 
comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less, that are readily convertible 
to a known amount of cash and subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
	
For the purpose of presentation in the statement 
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes 
cash on hand, deposit held at call with financial 
institutions, other short - term, highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months 
or less that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank 
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities in the balance sheet.
	
2.21	 Foreign currency translation
	
	
(i)	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
	
Items included in the financial statements 
are measured using the currency of the 
Havells India Limited
188
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The Company’s financial statements are 
presented in Indian rupee (INR) which 
is also the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
	
	
(ii)	
Transactions and balances 
	
	
	
Foreign 
currency 
transactions 
are 
translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rate prevailing at the 
date of the transaction. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transaction and from 
the translation of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
at year end exchange rate are generally 
recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss.
	
	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates at 
the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in 
a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair 
value is determined.
	
	
(iii)	
Exchange differences
	
	
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement 
or translation of monetary items are 
recognized as income or expense in 
the period in which they arise with the 
exception of exchange differences on 
gain or loss arising on translation of non-
monetary items measured at fair value 
which is treated in line with the recognition 
of the gain or loss on the change in 
fair value of the item (i.e., translation 
differences on items whose fair value gain 
or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or loss 
are also recognized in OCI or profit or loss, 
respectively).
	
2.22	 Provisions and Contingent Liabilities 
	
	
Provisions (including reimbursement)
	
	
A provision is recognized when the Company has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. These estimates are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current 
best estimates. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognized as a 
finance cost.
	
	
Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis 
of claims admitted / expected to be admitted and 
to the extent that the amount recoverable can 
be measured reliably and realisation in respect 
thereof is virtually certain.
	
	
Warranty Provisions
	
	
Provision 
for 
warranty-related 
costs 
are 
recognized when the product is sold or service 
is provided to customer. Initial recognition is 
based on historical experience. the Company 
periodically reviews the adequacy of product 
warranties and adjust warranty percentage and 
warranty provisions for actual experience, if 
necessary. The timing of outflow is expected to 
be with in one to seven years.
	
	
Provision for E-Waste/Plastic-Waste
	
	
Provision for E-Waste/Plastic-Waste management 
costs are recognized when the liability in respect 
of products sold to customer is established in 
accordance with E-waste Management Rules, 
2016 as notified by Government of India. Initial 
recognition is based on liability computed 
based on Extended Producer Responsibility 
as promulgated in said Rules including cost to 
comply the said regulation and as reduced by 
expected realisation of collectable waste. The 
Company has assessed the liability to arise on 
year to year basis.
	
	
Contingent liabilities
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that 
arises from past events whose existence will be 
confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events beyond the 
control of the Company or a present obligation 
that is not recognized because it is not probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation. A contingent liability also 
arises in extremely rare cases, where there is 
Integrated Report

Standalone
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
189
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
a liability that cannot be recognized because it 
cannot be measured reliably. the Company does 
not recognize a contingent liability but discloses 
its existence in the financial statements unless 
the probability of outflow of resources is remote.
	
	
Provisions, 
contingent 
liabilities, 
contingent 
assets and commitments are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date.
	
2.23	 Dividend Distributions
	
	
The Company recognizes a liability to make 
the payment of dividend to owners of equity, 
when the distribution is authorised and the 
distribution is no longer at the discretion of the 
Company. As per the corporate laws in India, 
a distribution is authorised when it is approved 
by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is 
recognised directly in equity.
	
2.24	 Fair value measurement
	
	
The Company measures financial instruments at 
fair value at each balance sheet date.
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place 
either:
	
	
(i)	
In the principal market for asset or liability, 
or
	
	
(ii)	
In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset 
or liability.
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Company.
	
	
The fair value of an asset or liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non- financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1- Quoted(unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement is unobservable
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorization (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
2.25	 Business Combinations
	
	
(i)	
Business combinations are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. The 
cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred 
measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquire. For each business 
combination, 
the 
Company 
elects 
whether to measure the non-controlling 
Havells India Limited
190
Notes to Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
interests in the acquire at fair value or at 
the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred. 
	
	
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable 
assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed 
are recognised at their acquisition date 
fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities 
assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they 
are measured at their acquisition fair values 
irrespective of the fact that outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits 
is not probable.
	
	
(ii)	
Business Combinations involving entities 
or businesses in which all the combining 
entities or businesses are ultimately 
controlled by the same party or parties 
both before and after the business 
combination, and where that control is not 
transitory is accounted using the pooling 
of interests method as enumerated below:
	
	
	
a)	
The assets and liabilities of the 
combining entities are reflected at 
their carrying amounts.
	
	
	
b)	
No adjustments are made to 
reflect fair values, or recognise any 
new assets or liabilities. The only 
adjustments that are made are to 
harmonise accounting policies.
	
	
	
c)	
The financial information in the 
financial statements in respect of 
prior periods should be restated 
as if the business combination had 
occurred from the beginning of the 
preceding period in the financial 
statements, irrespective of the 
actual date of the combination. 
However, if business combination 
had occurred after that date, the 
prior period information shall be 
restated only from that date.
	
	
	
d)	
The 
balance 
of 
the 
retained 
earnings appearing in the financial 
statements of the transferor is 
aggregated 
with 
corresponding 
balance appearing in the financial 
statements of the transferee or is 
adjusted against revenue reserve.
	
	
	
e)	
The identity of the reserves shall 
be preserved and shall appear 
in the financial statements of the 
transferee in the same form in 
which they appeared in the financial 
statements of the transferor.
	
	
	
f)	
The difference, if any, between 
the amounts recorded as share 
capital issued plus any additional 
consideration in the form of cash 
or other assets and the amount 
of share capital of the transferor is 
transferred to revenue reserves/ 
capital reserves.
	
2.26	 Significant 
accounting 
judgments, 
estimates and assumptions
	
	
The preparation of these standalone financial 
statements requires the management to make 
judgments, use estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
and 
the 
accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure 
of 
contingent 
liabilities. 
Uncertainty 
about 
these judgements, assumptions and estimates 
could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or 
liability affected in future periods.
	
	
a)	
Leases
	
	
	
The Company determines the lease term 
as the non-cancellable term of the lease, 
together with any periods covered by an 
option to extend the lease if it is reasonably 
certain to be exercised, or any periods 
covered by an option to terminate the 
lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be 
exercised.
	
	
	
The Company has several lease contracts 
that include extension and termination 
options. The Company applies judgement 
in evaluating whether it is reasonably 
certain whether or not to exercise the 
option to renew or terminate the lease. 
That is, it considers all relevant factors 
that create an economic incentive for it to

exercise either the renewal or termination. 
After the commencement date, the 
Company reassesses the lease term if 
there is a significant event or change in 
circumstances that is within its control 
and affects its ability to exercise or not to 
exercise the option to renew or to terminate 
(e.g., construction of significant leasehold 
improvements or significant customisation 
to the leased asset).
	
	
b)	
Taxes
	
	
	
Uncertainties exist with respect to the 
interpretation of tax regulations, changes 
in tax laws, and the amount and timing 
of future taxable income. Given the wide 
range of business relationships differences 
arising between the actual results and the 
assumptions made, or future changes to 
such assumptions, could necessitate future 
adjustments to tax income and expense 
already recorded. The Company establishes 
provisions, based on reasonable estimates. 
The amount of such provisions is based 
on various factors, such as experience of 
previous tax assessments and differing 
interpretations of tax regulations by the 
taxable entity and the responsible tax 
authority. (Refer Note 17)
	
	
c)	
Gratuity benefit
	
	
	
The cost of defined benefit plans (i.e. 
Gratuity benefit) is determined using 
actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation 
involves making various assumptions which 
may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of 
the discount rate, future salary increases, 
mortality 
rates 
and 
future 
pension 
increases. Due to the complexity of the 
valuation, the underlying assumptions 
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date. In 
determining the appropriate discount 
rate, management considers the interest 
rates of long term government bonds with 
extrapolated maturity corresponding to the 
expected duration of the defined benefit 
obligation. The mortality rate is based 
on publicly available mortality tables for 
India. Future salary increases and pension 
increases are based on expected future 
inflation rates for India. Further details 
about the assumptions used, including a 
sensitivity analysis, are given in Note 32(4).
	
	
d)	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
	
The Company assesses at each reporting 
date whether there is an indication that an 
asset including intangible assets having 
indefinite useful life and goodwill may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset 
is required, the Company estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An assets 
recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s CGU’S fair value less cost of 
disposal and its value in use. Where the 
carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset 
is considered impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount.
	
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are estimated based on 
past rend and discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If no 
such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These 
calculations are corroborated by valuation 
multiples, or other fair value indicators. 
	
	
e)	
Provision for warranty
	
	
	
Warranty provisions is determined based 
on the historical percentage of warranty 
expense to sales for the same types of 
goods for which the warranty is currently 
being determined. The same percentage 
to the sales is applied for the current 
accounting period to derive the warranty 
expense to be accrued. It is adjusted to 
account for unusual factors related to the 
goods that were sold, such as defective 
inventory lying at the depots. The warranty 
claims may not exactly match the historical 
warranty percentage, so such estimates 
are reviewed annually for any material

for the year ended March 31, 2023
changes in assumptions and likelihood 
of occurrence. The assumptions are 
consistent with prior years. (Refer Note 19)
	
	
f)	
Provision for expected credit losses (ECL) 
of trade receivables and contract assets 
	
	
	
The Company uses a provision matrix to 
calculate ECLs for trade receivables and 
contract assets. The provision rates are 
based on days past due for groupings 
of various customer segments that have 
similar loss patterns (i.e., by geography, 
product type, customer type and rating, 
and coverage by letters of credit and other 
forms of credit insurance). The provision 
matrix is initially based on the Company’s 
historical observed default rates. The 
Company will calibrate the matrix to adjust 
the historical credit loss experience with 
forward-looking information. At every 
reporting date, the historical observed 
default rates are updated and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are 
analysed. 
	
	
	
The 
assessment 
of 
the 
correlation 
between historical observed default rates, 
forecast economic conditions and ECLs is 
a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs 
is sensitive to changes in circumstances 
and of forecast economic conditions. 
The Company’s historical credit loss 
experience and forecast of economic 
conditions may also not be representative 
of customer’s actual default in the future. 
The information about the ECLs on the 
Company’s trade receivables and contract 
assets is disclosed in Note 32(10)
	
	
g)	
Property, Plant and Equipment and 
intangible assets
	
	
	
Property, Plant and Equipment represent 
significant portion of the asset base of the 
Company. The charge in respect of periodic 
depreciation is derived after determining 
an estimate of assets expected useful 
life and expected value at the end of its 
useful life. The useful life and residual value 
of Company’s assets are determined by 
Management at the time asset is acquired 
and reviewed periodically including at the 
end of each year. The useful life is based 
on historical experience with similar assets, 
in anticipation of future events, which may 
have impact on their life such as change in 
technology.
	
2.27	 Exceptional items
	
	
The Company recognises exceptional item when 
items of income and expenses within Statement 
of Profit and Loss from ordinary activities are 
of such size, nature or incidence that their 
disclosure is relevant to explain the performance 
of the enterprise for the period.
	
2.28	 New and amended standards adopted by 
the Company
	
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs had vide 
notification dated March 23, 2022 notified 
Companies 
(Indian 
Accounting 
Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2022 which amended 
certain accounting standards, and are effective 
April 1, 2022. These amendments did not have 
any impact on the amounts recognised in prior 
periods and are not expected to significantly 
affect the current or future periods.
	
	
New and amended standards issued but not 
effective
	
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide 
notification dated March 31, 2023 notified 
Companies 
(Indian 
Accounting 
Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023 (the ‘Rules’) which 
amends certain accounting standards, and are 
effective April 1 2023.
	
	
The Rules predominantly amend Ind AS 12, 
Income taxes, and Ind AS 1, Presentation of 
financial statements. The other amendments to 
Ind AS notified by these rules are primarily in the 
nature of clarifications.
	
	
These amendments are not expected to have a 
material impact on the company in the current or 
future reporting periods and on foreseeable future 
transactions. Specifically, no changes would be 
necessary as a consequence of amendments 
made to Ind AS 12 as the companies accounting 
policy already complies with the now mandatory 
treatment.

Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill and Brand & Trademarks acquired on acquisition of Lloyd business having indefinite useful lives have been allocated to a separate single cash 
generating unit (CGU) i.e. LLOYD consumers. The Company has performed an annual impairment test to ascertain the recoverable amount of such goodwill 
and intangible assets. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculation. These calculations uses management assumptions and pre 
tax cash flow projections based on financed budgets approved by management covering a 5 years period. Cash flow projection beyond 5 years time period 
are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which is consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to industry in which CGU operates. 
Management has determined following assumptions for impairment testing of CGU as stated Below :-
Assumption
March 31, 2023
Approach used in determining value
Weighted average Cost of capital % (WACC) 
before tax (discount rate)
15.30%
It has been determined basis risk free rate of return adjusted for equity 
risk premium.
Long Term Growth Rate
5.00%
Long term growth rate has been taken basis on overall economic growth 
rate, industry trend & expected long-term inflation in india.

Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development. The 
weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The calculations performed 
indicate that there is no impairment of GGU of the company. Management has performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to 
changes in assumptions for assessment of value-in-use of CGU. Based on this analysis, management believes that change in any 
of above assumption would not cause any material possible change in carrying value of unit’s CGU over and above its recoverable 
amount.

(C)	 Nature and Purpose of Reserves
	
(a)	
Capital reserve
	
	
During amalgamation/ merger approved by honourable court, the excess of net assets taken over the consideration 
paid, if any, is treated as capital reserve. This capital reserve has arisen as a result of scheme of amalgamation in the 
past periods.

purposes such as issuance of bonus shares in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.
	
(c)	
General reserve
	
	
Under the erstwhile Companies Act 1956, general reserve was created through an annual transfer of net income at a 
specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations adjusted by utilisation of reserve in accordance with 
scheme of Amalgamation in earlier years. The requirement to mandatorily transfer a specified percentage of the net profit 
to general reserve before declaration of dividend has been withdrawn. However, the amount previously transferred to the 
general reserve can be utilised only in accordance with the specific requirements of Companies Act, 2013.
	
(d)	 Share options outstanding account
	
	
The share option outstanding account is used to recognise the grant date fair value of options issued to employees 
under Employee stock purchase plan.

of ` 27.51 crores will expire in financial year 2029-30 and capital loss of ` 21.27 crores will expire in financial year 2030-31, on which no 
deferred tax asset has been created by the management due to lack of probability of future capital gain against which such deferred tax

Provision for warranties
(i)	
Warranties
	
A provision is recognized for expected warranty claims and after sales services on products sold during the last one to 
seven years, based on past experience of the level of repairs and defective returns. It is expected that significant portion 
of these costs will be incurred in the next financial year and all will be incurred within seven years after the reporting date. 
Assumptions used to calculate the provisions for warranties are based on current sales levels and current information 
available about defective returns based on one to seven years warranty period for all products sold and are consistent with 
those in the prior years. The assumptions made in relation to the current year are consistent with those in the prior year.

Defined Benefit Plan
The employees’ Gratuity Fund Scheme, which is a defined benefit plan, is managed by the trust which maintains its investments 
with Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd. The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the gratuity 
plan, every employee who has completed at least five years of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days of last drawn 
basic salary for each completed year of service. The present value of obligation is determined based on actuarial valuation using 
the Projected Unit Credit Method, which recognises each period of service as giving rise to additional unit of employee benefit 
entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
The following tables summaries the components of net benefit expense recognised in the statement of profit or loss, the funded 
status and amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the respective plans:

Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the balance sheet date for the 
estimated term of the obligations.

obligation as a result of reasonable changes in an assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period while holding all 
other assumption constraint. In practice it is unlikely to occur and change in some of the assumption may be correlated. When 
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value 
of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been 
applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.

The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, other current financial assets and 
other current financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the other financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions 
were used to estimate the fair values:
1)	
The fair value of unquoted instruments, other non-current financial assets and non-current financial liabilities is estimated by 
discounting future cash flows (DCF model) using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining 
maturities. The valuation requires management to use unobservable inputs in the model, of which the significant unobservable 
inputs are disclosed in the tables below. Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those 
significant unobservable inputs and determines their impact on the total fair value.
2)	
The fair values of the Company’s interest-bearing borrowings are determined by using DCF method using discount rate that 
reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at March 31, 2023 
was assessed to be insignificant.
3)	
Long-term receivables/payables are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates, risk factors, 
individual creditworthiness of the counterparty and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, 
allowances are taken into account for the expected credit losses of these receivables. 
4)	
Fair value hierarchy
	
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:
	
Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted (unadjusted) market prices at the 
end of the reporting period for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques 
which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant 
inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. 
This is the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent consideration and indemnification asset included in level 3.
	
There are no transfers among levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.
	
This section explains the judgement and estimates made in determining the fair value of financial assets that are:
	
a) Recognised and measured at Fair value
	
b) Measured at amortised cost and for which fair value is disclosed in financial statements

is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
	
The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior management oversees the 
management of these risks. The senior professionals working to manage the financial risks and the appropriate financial

risks, such as equity price risk and commodity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risks include loans 
and borrowings, deposits, investments, and foreign currency receivables and payables. The sensitivity analysis in the 
following sections relate to the position as at reporting date. The analysis exclude the impact of movements in market 
variables on: the carrying values of gratuity and other post-retirement obligations; provisions; and the non-financial 
assets and liabilities. The sensitivity of the relevant Profit and Loss item and equity is the effect of the assumed changes 
in the respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as of March 31, 2023 and 
March 31, 2022
	
(i)	
Foreign Currency Risk
	
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 
relates primarily to the Company’s operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in foreign currency). 
Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods from the respective countries. 
The Company basis their assessment believes that the probability of the occurrence of their forecasted transactions is 
not impacted by COVID‐19 pandemic. The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency 
transactions and follows established risk management policies.
	
	
Foreign currency risk sensitivity
	
	
The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD,EUR, JPY, CNY and other 
currencies including KES,NPR, CHF, LKR, MWK,AED,SLL and GBP exchange rates, with all other variables held 
constant. The impact on the Company profit before tax and equity is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets 
and liabilities. Foreign currency exposures recognised by the Company that have not been hedged by a derivative 
instrument or otherwise are as under:

Interest Rate Risk
	
Interest rate is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Company’s long term debt obligation at floating interest rates. The Company’s borrowings outstanding as at March 31, 2023 
and March 31, 2022 comprise of long term loans.

(iii)	 Commodity Price Risk
	
The Company is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing manufacture 
of industrial and domestic cable and other electronic items and therefore require a continuous supply of copper and aluminium 
being the major input used in the manufacturing. To mitigate the risk of supply and price fluctuations, Domestic and overseas 
sources are bench-marked to Optimize the allocation of business share among various sources. The Company’s Board 
of Directors has developed and enacted a risk management strategy regarding commodity price risk and its mitigation. 
The Company mitigated the risk of price volatility by entering Long Term & Short term contracts for the Purchase of these 
commodities basis estimated annual requirements.
(b)	 Credit Risk
	
Credit Risk is the risk that the counter party will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
	
(i)	
Trade Receivables and Contract Assets
	
	
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and 
control relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive 
credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer 
receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by Trade Receivable 
buyout facility without recourse, letters of credit and other forms of security. 
	
	
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on trade receivables by lifetime expected credit loss method 
based on provision matrix. The Company does not hold collateral as security. The Company evaluates the concentration 
of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions 
and industries and operate in largely independent markets.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Havells India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements of Havells India Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred 
to as “the Group”) (refer Note 30B to the attached 
consolidated financial statements), which comprise 
the consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, 
and the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
including Other Comprehensive Income, the consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and 
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
consolidated financial statements”).
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of 
the Group, as at March 31, 2023, and consolidated total 
comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other 
comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity 
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the 
Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group, in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements in India in terms 
of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the 
Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit 
evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their 
reports referred to in sub-paragraph 15 of the Other 
Matters section below, other than the unaudited financial 
statements as certified by the management and referred 
to in sub-paragraph 14 of the Other Matters section 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined 
the matters described below to be the key audit matters 
to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter 
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives
Refer Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 
As at March 31, 2023, the consolidated financial statements includes 
goodwill of ` 310.47 crores and intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives of ` 1,029 crores pertaining to acquisition of Lloyd business in 
an earlier year.
In accordance with the requirements of Indian Accounting Standard 
(Ind AS) - 36 'Impairment of Assets', the management has allocated the 
said goodwill and intangible assets to the underlying Cash Generating 
Unit (CGU), and tested the same for impairment using a Discounted 
Cash Flow (DCF) model. Based on such test, the recoverable amount 
of the CGU is higher than the carrying amount of the said assets and 
accordingly no adjustment for impairment is necessary. 
We considered this as a key audit matter because of the significant carrying 
value of the above mentioned assets and high estimation uncertainty 
in assumptions used such as discount rate, rate of growth over the 
estimation period and terminal growth rate which are affected by future 
market and economic conditions and, hence, are inherently uncertain.
Our audit procedures among others, included the following:
a.	
Understanding and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal controls over the impairment 
assessment process, including preparation of the DCF model; 
b.	
Evaluating the Group's accounting policy in respect of 
impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives; 
c.	
Understanding the cash flow projections and assumptions used 
in the DCF model, evaluating the mathematical accuracy and 
reading the report of the management’s expert; 
d.	
Together with auditor's valuation experts, testing the 
appropriateness of the DCF model and key assumptions therein 
and performing sensitivity analysis over key assumptions to 
corroborate that the recoverable amount of the CGU is within a 
reasonable range; and 
e.	
Testing related presentation and disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Based on the above procedures performed, the management's 
impairment assessment of the goodwill and intangible assets was 
found to be reasonable.

Other Information
5.	
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual report but does 
not include the consolidated financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
	
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, 
based on the work we have performed and the reports of 
the other auditors as furnished to us (Refer paragraph 15 
below), we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
6.	
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that 
give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, 
consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash 
flows, and changes in equity of the Group in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Accounting Standards specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors 
of the companies included in the Group are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which 
have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
7.	
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of 
the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
8.	
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
9.	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements.
10.	 As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
	
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by 
management.
	
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern.

•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
	
•	
Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements 
of such entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent 
auditors. For the other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
11.	 We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
12.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
13.	 From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
14.	 We did not audit the financial statements of one subsidiary 
located outside India, whose financial statements reflect 
total assets of ` Nil and net assets of ` Nil as at March 31, 
2023, total revenue of ` Nil, total comprehensive income 
(comprising of loss and other comprehensive income) of ` 
(0.04) crores and net cash outflows amounting to ` 4.39 
crores for the period April 01, 2022 till October 27, 2022 
(dissolution date), as considered in the consolidated financial 
statements. These financial statements are unaudited and 
have been furnished to us by the Management, and our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements in so far as 
it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect 
of this subsidiary and our report in terms of sub-section (3) of 
Section 143 of the Act including report on Other Information 
in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiary, is based 
solely on such unaudited financial statements. In our opinion 
and according to the information and explanations given to 
us by the Management, these financial statements are not 
material to the Group.
15.	 The financial statements of one subsidiary located outside 
India, included in the consolidated financial statements, 
which constitute total assets of ` 14.69 crores and net 
assets of ` 11.42 crores as at March 31, 2023, total revenue 
of ` 42.35 crores, total comprehensive income (comprising 
of loss and other comprehensive income) of ` 0.36 crores 
and net cash inflows amounting to ` 0.55 crores for the 
year then ended have been prepared in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in its country 
and have been audited by other auditors under generally 
accepted auditing standards applicable in its country. 
The Holding Company’s management has converted the 
financial statements of such subsidiary located outside 
India from the accounting principles generally accepted in 
its country to the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. We have audited these conversion adjustments 
made by the Holding Company’s management. Our opinion 
in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such 
subsidiary located outside India, including other information, 
is based on the report of other auditors and the conversion 
adjustments prepared by the management of the Holding 
Company and audited by us.
	
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and 
our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 
below, is not modified in respect of the above matters 
with respect to our reliance on the work done and the 
reports of the other auditors and the financial statements 
certified by the Management.

statements of the Holding Company which are included

Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements under clause (i) 
of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company as of and for the year ended 
March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of Havells 
India Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding 
Company”). Reporting under clause (i) of sub section 3 
of Section 143 of the Act in respect of the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements is not applicable to two subsidiaries as they 
are not incorporated in India namely Havells Guangzhou 
International Limited and Havells Holdings Limited 
(dissolved on October 27, 2022).
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
2.	
The Board of Directors of the Holding Company, is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued 
by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing deemed to 
be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies 
Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Holding Company’s internal financial 
controls system with reference to consolidated financial 
statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to financial statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial control with reference to financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
Referred to in paragraph 17(f) of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the 
members of Havells India Limited on the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended March 31, 2023
Havells India Limited
248
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to financial statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Holding Company has, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls system 
with reference to financial statements and such internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note issued by the ICAI.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
classified as non- current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realization in cash and 
cash equivalents. the Group has identified twelve months 
as its operating cycle.
2.03	Basis of Consolidation
	
The consolidated financial statements comprises the 
financial statement of the Havells India Limited (‘the 
Parent company’) and subsidiaries (collectively “the 
Group) as at March 31, 2022. Control is achieved when 
the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if 
and only if the Group has:
	
(i)	
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that 
give it the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee)
	
(ii)	
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
	
(iii)	
The ability to use its power over the investee to 
affect its returns.
	
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting 
rights result in control. To support this presumption and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting 
or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it 
has power over an investee, including:
	
(i)	
The contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee
	
(ii)	
Rights arising from other contractual arrangements 
	
(iii)	
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting 
rights
	
(iv)	
The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights 
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings 
of the other voting rights holders.
	
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements of 
control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the 
Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired 
or disposed of during the year are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary. 
	
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other 
events in similar circumstances. If a member of the Group 
uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the 
consolidated financial statements for like transactions and 
events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments 
are made to that Group member’s financial statements 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements to 
ensure conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.
	
The financial statements of all entities used for the 
purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting 
date as that of the parent company, i.e., year ended on 
March 31. When the end of the reporting period of the 
parent company is different from that of a subsidiary, 
the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, 
additional financial information as of the same date as the 
financial statements of the parent company to enable the 
parent company to consolidate the financial information 
of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so or 
there are no significant transaction or event between the 
date of those financial statement and date of financial 
statement of parent company.
2.04	Consolidation Procedure:
(A)	
Subsidiaries:
	
a)	
Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with 
those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income 
and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the 
amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised 
in the consolidated financial statements at the 
acquisition date.
	
b)	
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the 
parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. 
Business combinations policy explains how to 
account for any related goodwill.
	
c)	
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows 
relating to transactions between entities of the 
group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup 
transactions that are recognised in assets, such 
as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in 
full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment 
that requires recognition in the consolidated 
Integrated Report
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Consolidated
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
257
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
financial statements. Ind AS - 12 “Income Taxes” 
applies to temporary differences that arise from 
the elimination of profits and losses resulting from 
intragroup transactions.
	
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a 
deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting 
policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between members of the Group are eliminated in full on 
consolidation.
	
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without 
a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. 
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
	
(i)	
Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and 
liabilities of the subsidiary
	
(ii)	
Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-
controlling interests 
	
(iii)	
Derecognises the cumulative translation differences 
recorded in equity
	
(iv)	
Recognises the fair value of the consideration 
received 
	
(v)	
Recognises the fair value of any investment 
retained 
	
(vi)	
Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss 
	
(vii)	
Reclassifies the parent’s share of components 
previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or 
retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be 
required if the Group had directly disposed of the 
related assets or liabilities.
(B)	
Investment in associates and joint ventures
	
An associate is an entity over which the Group has 
significant influence. Significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions 
of the investee, but is not control or joint control over 
those policies.
	
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby 
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint 
control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of 
an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the 
parties sharing control. The considerations made in 
determining whether significant influence or joint control 
are similar to those necessary to determine control over 
the subsidiaries.
	
The Group’s investments in its associate and joint venture 
are accounted for using the equity method. Under the 
equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint 
venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount 
of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in 
the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint 
venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to 
the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying 
amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment 
individually.
	
The statement of profit and loss reflects the Group’s 
share of the results of operations of the associate or 
joint venture. Any change in OCI of those investees 
is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, 
when there has been a change recognised directly in 
the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, 
in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains 
and losses resulting from transactions between the 
Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated 
to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint 
venture.
	
If Group’s share of losses of an associate or a joint 
venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or 
joint venture (which includes any long term interest that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in 
the associate or joint venture), the Group discontinues 
recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses 
are recognised only to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports 
profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those 
profits only after its share of the profits equals the share 
of losses not recognised.
	
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an 
associate and a joint venture is shown on the face of the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
The financial statements of the associate or joint venture 
are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the 
accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
After application of the equity method, the Group 
determines whether it is necessary to recognise an 
impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint 
venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the investment 
in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is 
such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of 
impairment as the difference between the recoverable 
amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying 
value, and then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of 
an associate and a joint venture’ in the statement of profit 
or loss.
	
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or 
joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures 
and recognises any retained investment at its fair 
value. Any difference between the carrying amount of 
the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant 
influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained 
investment less cost to sell is recognised in profit or loss.
	
The Group discontinue the use of equity method from 
the date the investment is classified as held for sale in 
accordance with Ind AS 105 - Non-current Assets Held 
for Sale and Discontinued Operations and measures the 
interest in associate and joint venture held for sale at the 
lower of its carrying amount and fair value less cost to 
sell.
(C)	
Business combination and goodwill
	
Business 
combinations 
other 
than 
those 
under 
common control transactions are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree. For each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. In respect to 
the business combination for acquisition of subsidiary, 
the Group has opted to measure the non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree at the proportionate share of 
the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they are measured 
at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is 
not probable. However, the following assets and liabilities 
acquired in a business combination are measured at the 
basis indicated as mentioned hereinafter 
	
(i)	
Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the assets or 
liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements 
are recognised and measured in accordance with 
Ind AS 12 “Income Tax” and Ind AS 19 “Employee 
Benefits” respectively. 
	
(ii)	
Potential tax effects of temporary differences 
and carry forwards of an acquiree that exist at 
the acquisition date or arise as a result of the 
acquisition are accounted in accordance with Ind 
AS 12.
	
(iii)	
Liabilities or equity instruments related to share 
based payment arrangements of the acquiree 
or share – based payments arrangements of 
the Group entered into to replace share-based 
payment arrangements of the acquiree are 
measured in accordance with Ind AS 102 “Share-
based Payments” at the acquisition date. 
	
(iv)	
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as 
held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 “Non-
current Assets Held for Sale” and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that 
standard. 
	
(v)	
Reacquired rights are measured at a value 
determined on the basis of the remaining 
contractual term of the related contract. Such 
valuation does not consider potential renewal of 
the reacquired right.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with 
the contractual terms, economic circumstances and 
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This 
includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host 
contracts by the acquiree. 
	
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in profit or loss or OCI, as appropriate. 
(D)	
Change in ownership interest
	
The Group treats transaction with non-controlling 
interests that do not result in a loss of control as 
transaction with the equity owners of the Group. A change 
in ownership interest results in adjustment between the

carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling 
interest to reflect their relative interest in the subsidiary. 
Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to 
non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or 
received is recognised within equity.
2.05	Property, plant and equipment
	
Freehold Land is carried at historical cost. All other items 
of Property, Plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Capital work in progress is stated at cost, 
net of accumulated impairment loss, if any. The historical 
cost comprises of purchase price, taxes, duties, freight 
and other incidental expenses directly attributable and 
related to acquisition and installation of the concerned 
assets and are further adjusted by the amount of input 
tax credit availed wherever applicable. 
	
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the 
plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-
term construction projects if the recognition criteria are 
met. When significant parts of plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group 
depreciates them separately based on their specific 
useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is 
performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount 
of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 
recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and 
maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the 
decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in 
the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria 
for a provision are met. 
	
Subsequent costs are included in asset’s carrying amount 
or recognised as separate assets, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefit 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and the 
cost of item can be measured reliably. 
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognised is derecognized 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income 
statement when the asset is derecognised.
	
Capital work- in- progress includes cost of property, plant 
and equipment under installation/under development as 
at the balance sheet date.
	
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is 
calculated on prorata basis on straight-line method using 
the useful lives of the assets estimated by management. 
The useful life is as follows:
Assets
Useful life (in years)
Building
30 and 60
Plant and Equipment
15
Moulds and Dies

The useful lives of all the assets except moulds and 
dies, mobile phones and laptops have been determined 
as those specified by part ‘C’ of Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013. In respect of moulds and dies 
and mobile phones, useful lives are lower than those 
specified by schedule II to the Companies Act 2013 
and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of 
6 years, 3 years respectively, in respect of laptop useful 
life is more than those specified by schedule II to the 
Group Act 2013 and are depreciated over the estimated 
useful life of 4 years, in order to reflect the actual usage 
of assets. The residual values are not more than 5% of 
the original cost of the assets. The asset’s residual values 
and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate.
	
Lease hold improvements are depreciated on straight 
line basis over shorter of the asset’s useful life and their 
lease term unless the entity expects to use the asset 
beyond the lease term.
	
Leasehold land is amortized on a straight line basis over 
the unexpired period of their respective lease ranging 
from 90-99 years.
2.06	Intangible assets
	
Separately acquired intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured 
on initial recognition at cost. Cost of intangible assets 
Havells India Limited
260
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
acquired in business combination is their fair value at 
the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalized 
development cost, are not capitalized and the related 
expenditure is reflected in statement of Profit and Loss 
in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. Cost 
comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost 
of bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use.
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as 
either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite 
lives are amortized over their useful lives and assessed 
for impairment whenever there is an indication that the 
intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization 
period and the amortization method for an intangible 
asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end 
of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful 
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted 
for by changing the amortization period or method, as 
appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting 
estimates. The amortization expense on intangible 
assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. 
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually 
to determine whether the indefinite life continues to 
be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 
The Group has assessed indefinite life for such brand 
considering the expected usage, expected investment 
on brand, business forecast and challenges to 
establish a premium electronic segment. These are 
carried at historical cost and tested for impairment 
annually.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from disposal 
of the intangible assets are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement 
of profit and loss when the assets are disposed off.
	
Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortized on a 
straight line basis over their estimated useful life as under

Research and development cost
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development 
expenditure incurred on an individual project is recognized 
as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate 
all the following:
	
i)	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
	
ii)	
Its intention to complete the asset;
	
iii)	
Its ability to use or sale the asset;
	
iv)	
How the asset will generate future economic 
benefits;
	
v)	
The availability of adequate resources to complete 
the development and to use or sale the asset; and
	
vi)	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
attributable 
to 
the 
intangible 
asset 
during 
development.
	
Following the initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied 
requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortization of the asset begins when 
development is complete and the asset is available 
for use. It is amortized on straight line basis over the 
estimated useful life and is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss. During the period of development, the 
asset is tested for impairment annually.
	
Trademarks
	
Brand and Trademarks acquired in business combination 
are initially recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, brand and trademark are 
carried at the above recognised value less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
These Brand and trademarks have been in existence for 
considerable period and Group intends to continue use 
this intangible assets. Consequently it is believed that 
they have an indefinite life and are not amortised. Instead 
impairment testing is performed annually and whenever a 
triggering event has occurred to determine whether the 
carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.

Distributor/Dealer Network
	
Distributor/Dealer 
Network 
acquired 
in 
business 
combination are initially recognised at fair value at the date 
of acquisition. Following initial recognition, Distributor/
Dealer Network are carried at the above recognised 
value less accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. They are amortised on a 
straight line basis over their estimated useful life of 8 
years assessed by the management.
	
Goodwill 
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of 
the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the 
fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in 
excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all 
of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed 
and reviews the procedures used to measure the 
amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the 
reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value 
of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity as 
capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of 
bargain purchase, the entity recognizes the gain directly 
in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same 
through other comprehensive income.
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses, if any. For 
the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 
acquire are assigned to those units. 
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated is tested for impairment annually or earlier, when 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less 
than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset 
in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised 
in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
	
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating 
unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation 
when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill 
disposed in these circumstances is measured based 
on the relative values of the disposed operation and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
2.07	Impairment of non- financial assets
	
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If 
any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing 
for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) 
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The 
recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups 
of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded 
companies or other available fair value indicators.
	
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed 
budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared 
separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the 
individual assets are allocated. These budgets and 
forecast calculations generally cover a period of five 
years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future cash flows 
after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections 
beyond periods covered by the most recent budgets/
forecasts, the Group extrapolates cash flow projections 
in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate 
for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be 
justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed 
the long-term average growth rate for the products, 
industries, or country or countries in which the Group 
operates, or for the market in which the asset is used.
	
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including 
impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement 
Havells India Limited
262
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
of profit and loss, except for properties previously revalued 
with the revaluation surplus taken to OCI. For such 
properties, the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the 
amount of any previous revaluation surplus.
	
For assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets having 
indefinite life, an assessment is made at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist 
or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group 
estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only 
if there has been a change in the assumptions used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited 
so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in 
prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued 
amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by 
assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or 
group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment 
losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future 
periods.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually as at March 31 at the CGU level, as 
appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.
2.08	Financial instruments 
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
(i)	
Financial Assets
	
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
measurement categories:
	
-	
Those to be measured subsequently at fair value 
(either through other comprehensive income, or 
through profit or loss)
	
-	
Those measured at amortized cost
	
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition 
depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics and the Group’s business model for 
managing them
	
Initial recognition measurement
	
With the exception of trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component or for which 
the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group 
initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, 
in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs. 
	
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component or for which the Group has applied 
the practical expedient are measured at the transaction 
price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the 
accounting policies in section ‘Revenue from contracts 
with customers’.
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments 
of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI 
test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial 
assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective 
of the business model.
	
The Group’s business model for managing financial assets 
refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to 
generate cash flows. The business model determines 
whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual 
cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.
	
Financial assets classified and measured at amortised 
cost are held within a business model with the objective 
to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual 
cash flows while financial assets classified and measured 
at fair value through OCI are held within a business model 
with the objective of both holding to collect contractual 
cash flows and selling.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement financial 
assets are classified in following categories:
	
-	
Financial 
assets 
at 
amortised 
cost 
(debt 
instruments)
	
-	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)

OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses upon derecognition (equity instruments) 
	
-	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
	
a)	
Business Model Test: The objective is to hold 
the financial asset to collect the contractual cash 
flows (rather than to sell the instrument prior to its 
contractual maturity to realize its fair value changes) 
and;
	
b)	
Cash flow characteristics test: The contractual 
terms of the financial asset give rise on specific 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on principal amount 
outstanding.
	
This category is most relevant to the Group. After initial 
measurement, such financial assets are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of EIR. EIR is the rate 
that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts 
over the expected life of the financial instrument or a 
shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying 
amount of the financial asset. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Group estimates the expected 
cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the 
financial instrument but does not consider the expected 
credit losses. The EIR amortization is included in other 
income in profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment 
are recognized in the profit or loss. This category generally 
applies to trade and other receivables.
	
Financial assets at fair value through OCI (FVTOCI) 
(debt instruments)
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of 
the following criteria are met: 
	
a)	
Business Model Test: The objective of financial 
instrument 
is 
achieved 
by 
both 
collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling the financial 
assets; and
	
b)	
Cash flow characteristics test: The contractual 
terms of the Debt instrument give rise on specific 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on principal amount 
outstanding.
	
Debt instrument included within the FVTOCI category are 
measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value. Fair value movements are recognized in the other 
comprehensive income (OCI), except for the recognition 
of interest income, impairment gains or losses and 
foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognized 
in statement of profit and loss and computed in the same 
manner as for financial assets measured at amortised 
cost. The remaining fair value changes are recognised 
in OCI. Upon derecognition, the cumulative fair value 
changes recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity 
to profit or loss.
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 
carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes 
in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
This category includes derivative instruments and listed 
equity investments which the Group had not irrevocably 
elected to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on 
listed equity investments are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss when the right of payment has been 
established.
	
Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI 
(equity instruments)
	
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify 
irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI when they meet 
the definition of equity under Ind AS 32 Financial 
Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. 
The classification is determined on an instrument-by-
instrument basis. Equity instruments which are held for 
trading and contingent consideration recognised by an 
acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS103 
applies are classified as at FVTPL.
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never 
recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as 
other income in the statement of profit and loss when 
the right of payment has been established, except when 
the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of 
part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such 
gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated 
at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment 
assessment. 
	
Embedded Derivatives
	
A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, with a 
financial liability or non-financial host, is separated from 
the host and accounted for as a separate derivative if: the 
economic characteristics and risks are not closely related 
Havells India Limited
264
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
to the host; a separate instrument with the same terms 
as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of 
a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at 
fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives 
are measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss. Reassessment only occurs if 
there is either a change in the terms of the contract that 
significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise 
be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out of 
the fair value through profit or loss category. 
	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group’s 
statement of financial position) when:
	
-	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or 
	
-	
the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a “pass 
through” arrangement and either;
	
	
(a)	
the Group has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, or
	
	
(b)	
the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the 
asset.
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises 
an associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects 
the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the 
maximum amount of consideration that the group could 
be required to repay.
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
In accordance with IND AS 109, the Group applies 
expected credit losses (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial asset and credit risk exposure
	
-	
Financial assets measured at amortized cost;
	
-	
Financial assets measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income(FVTOCI);
	
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual 
cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the 
cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted 
at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. 
The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the 
sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that 
are integral to the contractual terms.
	
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures 
for which there has not been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided 
for credit losses that result from default events that are 
possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). 
For those credit exposures for which there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, 
a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected 
over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the 
timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
	
The Group follows “simplified approach” for recognition 
of impairment loss allowance on:
	
-	
Trade receivables or contract revenue receivables; 
Trade receivables which are held to collect and 
sale basis accounted for as FVTPL
	
-	
All lease receivables resulting from the transactions 
within the scope of Ind AS 116 -Leases
	
Under the simplified approach, the Group does not track 
changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition. The Group uses a 
provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance 
on the portfolio of trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of trade receivable and is adjusted 
for forward looking estimates. At every reporting date, 
the historical observed default rates are updated and 
changes in the forward looking estimates are analysed.
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized 
during the period is recognized as income/expense in

the statement of profit and loss. This amount is reflected 
under the head ‘other expenses’ in the statement of 
profit and loss. The balance sheet presentation for 
various financial instruments is described below:
	
(a)	
Financial assets measured as at amortised 
cost: ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an 
integral part of the measurement of those assets 
in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces the 
net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-
off criteria, the group does not reduce impairment 
allowance from the gross carrying amount.
	
(b)	
Loan commitments and financial guarantee 
contracts: ECL is presented as a provision in the 
balance sheet, i.e. as a liability. 
	
(c)	
Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: For debt 
instruments measured at FVTOCI, the expected 
credit losses do not reduce the carrying amount 
in the balance sheet, which remains at fair value. 
Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that 
would arise if the asset was measured at amortised 
cost is recognised in other comprehensive income 
as the accumulated impairment amount.
(ii)	
Financial liabilities:
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. All financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans 
and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Group financial liabilities include 
loans and borrowings, trade payables, trade deposits, 
retention money, liabilities towards services, sales 
incentive and other payables.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
liabilities are classified in two categories: 
	
(i)	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
	
(ii)	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and 
borrowings)
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are 
classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the 
purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category 
also includes derivative financial instruments entered 
into by the Group that are not designated as hedging 
instruments in hedge relationship as defined by Ind 
AS 109. The separated embedded derivate are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated 
as effective hedging instruments.
	
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at 
fair value through profit or loss are designated as such 
at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria 
in IND AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as 
FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes 
in own credit risk are recognized in OCI. These gains/
loss are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. 
However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or 
loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such 
liability are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. 
the Group has not designated any financial liability as at 
fair value through profit and loss.
	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (Loans and 
borrowings)
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the Effective 
interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognized in 
profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well 
as through the Effective interest rate amortization process. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the Effective interest rate. The Effective 
interest rate amortization is included as finance costs in the 
statement of profit and loss. 
	
Trade Payables
	
These amounts represents liabilities for goods and 
services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial 
year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and 
are usually paid per the term of contract with suppliers. 
Trade and other payables are presented as current 
liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months 
after the reporting period. They are recognized initially at 
fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using Effective interest rate method.
	
Financial guarantee contracts 
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are 
those contracts that require a payment to be made to 
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the 
Havells India Limited
266
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as 
a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. 
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the 
amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment 
requirements of IND AS 109 and the amount recognized 
less cumulative amortization.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or 
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as the 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financials assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
	
Reclassification of financial assets/financial liabilities
	
The Group determines classification of financial assets 
and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, 
no reclassification is made for financial assets which are 
equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial 
assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification 
is made only if there is a change in the business model 
for managing those assets. Changes to the business 
model are expected to be infrequent. The Group’s 
senior management determines change in the business 
model as a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Group’s operations. Such changes 
are evident to external parties. A change in the business 
model occurs when the Group either begins or ceases 
to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. 
If the Group reclassifies financial assets, it applies the 
reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date 
which is the first day of the immediately next reporting 
period following the change in business model. The Group 
does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses 
(including impairment gains or losses) or interest.
2.09	 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
	
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when 
the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when 
the fair value is negative.
	
The purchase contracts that meet the definition of 
a derivative under Ind AS 109 are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. Commodity contracts 
that are entered into and continue to be held for the 
purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item 
in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale 
or usage requirements are held at cost.
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except 
for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is 
recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss 
when the hedge item affects profit or loss or treated 
as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction 
subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability.
	
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are 
classified as:
	
(i)	
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to 
changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or 
liability or an unrecognised firm commitment 
	
(ii)	
Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to 
variability in cash flows that is either attributable to 
a particular risk associated with a recognised asset 
or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction 
or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm 
commitment
	
(iii)	
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
	
Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting 
are accounted for, as described below:
	
(i)	 Fair value hedges
	
The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss as finance 
costs. The change in the fair value of the hedged item 
attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the 
carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss as finance costs.
Integrated Report

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
For fair value hedges relating to items carried at 
amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying value is 
amortised through profit or loss over the remaining term 
of the hedge using the EIR method. EIR amortization 
may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later 
than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for 
changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being 
hedged.
	
If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair 
value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When 
an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a 
hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in 
the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the 
hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a 
corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit and loss.
	
(ii)	 Cash flow hedges
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge 
reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
	
The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency 
contracts is recognised in finance costs and the 
ineffective portion relating to commodity contracts is 
recognised in other income or expenses. 
	
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to profit or 
loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, 
such as when the hedged financial income or financial 
expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. 
When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as 
OCI are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the 
non-financial asset or liability.
	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised without replacement or rollover (as part of 
the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge 
is revoked, or when the hedge no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in OCI remains separately in 
equity until the forecast transaction occurs or the foreign 
currency firm commitment is met.
2.10	Inventories
a)	
Basis of valuation:
	
i)	
Inventories other than scrap materials are valued 
at lower of cost and net realizable value after 
providing cost of obsolescence, if any. However, 
materials and other items held for use in the 
production of inventories are not written down 
below cost if the finished products in which they 
will be incorporated are expected to be sold at 
or above cost. The comparison of cost and net 
realizable value is made on an item-by-item basis.
	
ii)	
Inventory of scrap materials have been valued at 
net realizable value.
b)	
Method of Valuation:
	
i)	
Cost of raw materials has been determined by 
using moving weighted average cost method and 
comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes 
(other than those subsequently recoverable from 
tax authorities) and all other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition.
	
ii)	
Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress 
includes direct labour and an appropriate share 
of fixed and variable production overheads. Fixed 
production overheads are allocated on the basis 
of normal capacity of production facilities. Cost is 
determined on moving weighted average basis.
	
iii)	
Cost of traded goods has been determined by 
using moving weighted average cost method and 
comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes 
(other than those subsequently recoverable from 
tax authorities) and all other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition.
	
iv)	
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less estimated 
costs of completion and estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.
2.11	Non-current assets held for sale
	
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale 
if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally 
through a sale rather than through continuing use and 
the sale is considered highly probable. Such non-current 
assets classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell. Any expected loss is recognized immediately in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as 
met only when the assets is available for immediate sale 
in its present condition, subject only to terms that are 
usual and customary for sales of such assets, its sale is 
highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold. The Group 
treats sale of the asset to be highly probable when:
Havells India Limited

i)	
The appropriate level of management is committed 
to a plan to sell the asset
	
ii)	
An active programme to locate a buyer and 
complete the plan has been initiated (if applicable)
	
iii)	
The asset is being actively marketed for sale at a 
price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair 
value,
	
iv)	
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification, and
	
v)	
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that 
it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will 
be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
	
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as 
met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition 
and the assets must have actively marketed for sale at a 
price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. 
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate 
that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan to 
sale these assets will be made. Management must be 
committed to the sale, which should be expected to 
qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one 
year from the date of classification.
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or 
amortized. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 
are presented separately as current items in the balance 
sheet.
2.12	Income Tax
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax 
payable on the current period’s taxable income based 
on the applicable income tax rate adjusted by changes 
in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences and to unused tax losses. Income 
Tax expense for the year comprises of current tax and 
deferred tax.
a)	
Current income tax
	
Current income tax, assets and liabilities are measured at 
the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the 
taxation authorities in accordance with the Income Tax 
Act, 1961 and the Income Computation and Disclosure 
Standards (ICDS) enacted in India by using tax rates and 
the tax laws that are enacted at the reporting date. 
	
The current income tax charge is calculated on the 
basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the end of the reporting period in the countries 
where the Group operate and generate taxable 
income. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation 
and considers whether it is probable that a taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The 
group measures its tax balances either based on the 
most likely amount or the expected value, depending 
on which method provides a better prediction of the 
resolution of the uncertainty.
	
Current income tax relating to item recognized outside 
the statement of profit and loss is recognized outside 
profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or 
equity).Current tax items are recognized in correlation 
to the underlying transactions either in OCI or directly in 
equity.
b)	
Deferred Tax
	
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet 
method on temporary differences arising between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred 
tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill. 
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
	
i)	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
	
ii)	
In respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, when the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences 
can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

i)	
When the deferred tax asset relating to the 
deductible temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
	
ii)	
In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred 
tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that the temporary differences will 
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit 
will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are 
recognized to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax 
asset to be recovered.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the 
statement of profit and loss is recognized outside the 
statement of profit and loss (either in other comprehensive 
income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognized in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
direct in equity.
	
Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, 
but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition 
at that date, are recognised subsequently if new 
information about facts and circumstances change. 
Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised within the 
measurement period reduce goodwill related to that 
acquisition if they result from new information obtained 
about facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition 
date. If the carrying amount of goodwill is zero, any 
remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in OCI/
capital reserve depending on the principle explained for 
bargain purchase gains. All other acquired tax benefits 
realized are recognised in profit or loss.
2.13	Revenue from contract with customers
	
The Group manufactures/trades and sells a range of 
consumer electrical and electronic products. Revenue from 
contracts with customers involving sale of these products 
is recognized at a point in time when control of the product 
has been transferred, and there are no unfulfilled obligation 
that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the 
products which usually happen on delivery of goods. The 
Group also provides installation, annual maintenance and 
warranty services that are either sold separately or bundled 
together with the sale of goods. The Group recognizes 
these service revenue from sales of services over a period 
of time, because the customer simultaneously receives and 
consumes the benefits provided by the Group. The Group 
has objective evidence that all criterion for acceptance 
has been satisfied. A receivable is recognised when the 
control of the product is transferred as the consideration is 
unconditional and payment becomes due upon passage of 
time as per the terms of contract with customers.
(a)	
Sale of goods
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point 
in time when control of the goods is transferred to the 
customer, generally on delivery of the goods and there 
are no unfulfilled obligations.
	
The Group considers, whether there are other promises 
in the contract in which their are separate performance 
obligations, to which a portion of the transaction price 
needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction 
price for the sale of goods, the Group allocates a 
portion of the transaction price to different performance 
obligations goods bases on its relative consolidated 
prices and also considers the following:
	
(i)	
Variable consideration
	
	
The Group recognizes revenue from the sale of 
goods measured at the consolidated selling price 
of the consideration received or receivable, net 
of returns and allowances, trade discounts and 
volume rebates. If the consideration in a contract 
includes a variable amount, the Group estimates 
the amount of consideration to which it will be 
entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the 
customer. The variable consideration is estimated at 
contract inception and constrained until it is highly 
probable that a significant revenue reversal in the 
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not 
occur when the associated uncertainty with the 
variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The 
Group operates several sales incentive programmes 
Havells India Limited
270
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
wherein the customers are eligible for several 
benefits on achievement of underlying conditions 
as prescribed in the scheme programme such 
as credit notes, reimbursement, investments etc. 
Revenue from contract with customer is presented 
after deducting cost of all these schemes.
	
(ii)	
Warranty obligations
	
	
The Group generally provides for warranties 
for general repair of defects. These warranties 
are assurance-type warranties under Ind AS 
115, which are accounted for under Ind AS 37 
(Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets). 
However, 
in 
certain 
non-standard 
contracts in respect of sale of consumer durable 
goods, the Group provides extended warranties 
and such warranties are termed as service-
type warranties and therefore, accounted for 
as separate performance obligations to which 
the Group allocates a portion of the transaction 
price. Revenue from service-type warranties is 
recognised over the period in which the service is 
provided based on the time elapsed
	
(iii)	
Significant Financing Components
	
	
In respect of short-term advances from its 
customers, using the practical expedient in Ind 
AS 115, the Group does not adjust the promised 
amount of consideration for the effects of a 
significant financing component if it expects, at 
contract inception, that the period between the 
transfer of the promised good or service to the 
customer and when the customer pays for that 
good or service will be within normal operating 
cycle.
	
	
In respect of long term contracts, the transaction 
price for these contracts is discounted, using the 
interest rate implicit in the contract (i.e., the interest 
rate that discounts the cash selling price of the 
equipment to the amount paid in advance).
	
	
No significant element of financing is  deemed 
present as the sales are made with a credit term 
of 21 to 90 days, which is consistent with market 
practice.
(b)	
Sale of services
	
The Group provides installation, annual maintenance and 
extended warranty services that are sold separately. The 
Group recognizes revenue from sales of services over 
time, because the customer simultaneously receives and 
consumes the benefits provided by the Group. Revenue 
from services related activities is recognised as and when 
services are rendered and on the basis of contractual 
terms with the parties.
(c)	
Contract balances
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange 
for goods or services transferred to the customer. 
Contract assets are in the nature of unbilled receivables, 
which arises when Group satisfies a performance 
obligation but does not have an unconditional rights 
to consideration. A receivables represents the Group’s 
right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional. 
Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment. 
Refer to accounting policies on impairment of financial 
assets in section (Financial instruments – initial recognition 
and subsequent measurement).
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or 
services to a customer for which the Group has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from 
the customer. If a customer pays consideration before 
the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a 
contract liability is recognised when the payment is made 
or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract 
liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group 
performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the 
related goods or services to the customer).
	
A trade receivable is recognised if an amount of 
consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage 
of time is required before payment of the consideration 
is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets 
in section (Financial instruments – initial recognition and 
subsequent measurement).
(d)	
Income from Service Concession Arrangement
	
Revenue related to Street Lights Upgrade services 
provided under service concession arrangement is 
recognized as per the agreement with the grantor. The 
Group recognizes a financial asset arising from the service 
concession agreement when it has an unconditional 
contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset 
from or at the direction of the grantor of the concession for 
the upgrade services provided. Such financial assets are 
measured at fair value upon initial recognition.
2.14	Other Income

Interest Income

cost or at fair value through other comprehensive

income, interest income is recorded using the effective 
interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments or receipts over 
the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter 
period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount 
of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a 
financial liability. When calculating the effective interest 
rate, the Group estimates the expected cash flows by 
considering all the contractual terms of the financial 
instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call 
and similar options) but does not consider the expected 
credit losses. Interest income is included in other income 
in the statement of profit and loss.

scheme are recognised on export of goods in accordance 
with their respective underlying scheme at fair value of 
consideration received or receivable.
(b)	
Government Grants 
	
Government Grants are recognized at their fair value 
when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be 
received and all the attached conditions will be complied 
with.
	
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized 
as income on a systematic basis over the periods that 
the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, 
are expensed. Government grant related to the non-
monetary asset are recognised at nominal value and 
presented by deducting the same from carrying amount 
of related asset and the grant is then recognised in profit 
or loss over the useful life of the depreciable asset by 
way of a reduced depreciation charge.
2.16	Retirement and other employee benefits
(i)	
Short-term obligations
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non monetary 
benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 
twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employees render the related service are recognized in 
respect of employee service upto the end of the reporting 
period and are measured at the amount expected to be 
paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the 
balance sheet.
(ii)	
Post employment
	
a)	
Gratuity
	
	
The Employee’s Gratuity Fund Scheme, which 
is defined benefit plan, is managed by Trust with 
its investments maintained with Bajaj Allianz Life 
Insurance Co.Ltd. The liabilities with respect 
to Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial 
valuation on projected unit credit method on 
the balance sheet date, based upon which the 
Group contributes to the Gratuity Scheme. The 
difference, if any, between the actuarial valuation of 
the gratuity of employees at the year end and the 
balance of funds is provided for as assets/(liability) 
in the books. Net interest is calculated by applying 
the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability 
or asset. The Group recognizes the following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation under 
Employee benefit expense in statement of profit 
or loss:
	
	
a)	
Service costs comprising current service 
costs, past-service costs, gains and losses 
on curtailments and non-routine settlements
	
	
b)	
Net interest expense or income
	
	
Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains 
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding 
amounts included in net interest on the net defined 
benefit liability and the return on plan assets 
(excluding amounts included in net interest on the net 
defined benefit liability), are recognized immediately 
in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit 
or credit to retained earnings through other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they 
occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit 
or loss in subsequent periods.
	
b)	
Provident fund
	
	
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme. the Group has 
no obligation, other than the contribution payable 
to the provident fund. The Group recognizes 
contribution payable through provident fund 
scheme as an expense, when an employee renders 
the related services. If the contribution payable to 
scheme for service received before the balance 
sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, 
the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized 
as liability after deducting the contribution already 
paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the 
Havells India Limited
272
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
contribution due for services received before the 
balance sheet date, then excesses recognized as 
an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead 
to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a 
cash refund. 
(iii)	
Other employee benefits
	
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group 
receive remuneration in the form of share based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services as 
consideration for equity instruments. In accordance with 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based 
Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 and the Ind-AS 
102 Share based payments, the fair value of options 
granted under the Havells Long Term cumulative expense 
recognized for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The expense or credit recognized in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at 
the beginning and end of that period and is recognized in 
employee benefits expense.
	
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award 
are modified, the minimum expense recognized is the 
expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. An additional expense 
is recognized for any modification that increases the total 
intrinsic value of the share-based payment transaction, 
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured 
at the date of modification. The Employee stock option 
scheme is administered through Havells Employee 
Welfare Trust.
	
The Group provides long term incentive plan to 
employees via equity settled share based payments as 
enumerated below:
	
(a)	
Havells Employee Stock Purchase Plan: The 
fair value of options granted under this option 
plan is recognised as an employee benefit 
expense with corresponding increase in equity in 
accordance with recognition and measurement 
principles as prescribed in Ind AS 102 Share 
Based Payments when grant is made. The total 
expense is recognised over the vesting period, 
which is the period over which all of the specified 
vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At end of the 
reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of 
the number of options that are expected to vest 
based on the non-market vesting and service 
conditions. It recognizes the impact of the revision 
to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
	
(b)	
Havells Employees Long term Incentive plan: 
These are in nature of employee benefit wherein 
employees (including senior executives) of the 
Group purchase shares of the Group at fair value 
on the grant cum allotment date and receives 
remuneration in the form of ex-gratia equivalent to 
predefined percentage of purchase price paid by 
designated employee subject to serving of relevant 
period of service after the grant cum allotment 
date. These are recognised at fair value of shares 
granted and allotted as employee benefit expense 
over the period of employee serving relevant 
period.
2.17	Leases
	
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a 
contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset 
for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
	
Group as a lessee
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily comprise of 
lease for land and building. The Group applies a single 
recognition and measurement approach for all leases, 
except for short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make 
lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the 
right to use the underlying assets.
	
i)	
Right-of-use assets (ROU)
	
	
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The 
cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount 
of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs 
incurred, and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on 
a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease 
term and the estimated useful lives of the building 
(i.e. 30 and 60 years)
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to 
the Group at the end of the lease term or the 
Integrated Report
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Consolidated
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
273
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, 
depreciation is calculated using the estimated 
useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are 
also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting 
policies in section ‘Impairment of non-financial 
assets’.
	
	
The Group classifies ROU assets as part of 
Property plant and equipment in Balance Sheet 
and lease liability in “ Financial Liability”.
	
ii)	
Lease Liabilities
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the 
Group recognises lease liabilities measured at 
the present value of lease payments to be made 
over the lease term. The lease payments include 
fixed payments (including in substance fixed 
payments) less any lease incentives receivable, 
variable lease payments that depend on an index 
or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase 
option reasonably certain to be exercised by the 
Group and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 
exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease 
payments that do not depend on an index or a 
rate are recognised as expenses (unless they 
are incurred to produce inventories) in the period 
in which the event or condition that triggers the 
payment occurs.
	
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 
interest and reduced for the lease payments made. 
In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities 
is remeasured if there is a modification, a change 
in the lease term, a change in the lease payments 
(e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a 
change in an index or rate used to determine such 
lease payments) or a change in the assessment of 
an option to purchase the underlying asset.
	
	
Lease payments are allocated between principal 
and finance cost. The finance cost is charged 
to profit or loss over the lease period so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability for each period.
	
	
Variable lease payments that depend on sales are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which 
the condition that triggers those payments occurs.
	
(iii)	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
	
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those 
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less 
from the commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-
value assets recognition exemption to leases that 
are considered to be low value. Lease payments 
on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
2.18	Segment reporting:
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the decision 
making authority. The Board of directors monitors the 
operating results of all product segments separately 
for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. 
	
The operating segments have been identified on the 
basis of the nature of products/services. Further: 
	
1.	
Segment revenue includes sales and other income 
directly identifiable with/allocable to the segment 
including inter - segment revenue.
	
2.	
Expenses that are directly identifiable with/allocable 
to segments are considered for determining the 
segment result. Expenses which relate to the 
Group as a whole and not allocable to segments 
are included under unallocable expenditure.
	
3.	
Income which relates to the Group as a whole and 
not allocable to segments is included in unallocable 
income.
	
4.	
Segment assets and liabilities include those 
directly identifiable with the respective segments. 
Unallocable assets and liabilities represent the 
assets and liabilities that relate to the Group as a 
whole and not allocable to any segment.
2.19	Earnings Per Share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period. The weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
Havells India Limited
274
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus 
element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share 
split (consolidation of shares) if any that have changed 
the number of equity shares outstanding, without a 
corresponding change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, 
the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the 
effect of all potentially dilutive equity shares. 
2.20	Borrowing Costs
	
Borrowing cost includes interest and other costs 
incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds and 
charged to Statement of Profit & Loss on the basis of 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Borrowing cost also 
includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as 
an adjustment to the borrowing cost.
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost 
of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are 
recognized as expense in the period in which they occur.
2.21	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less, that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, 
deposit held at call with financial institutions, other short 
- term, highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities in the balance sheet.
2.22	Foreign currency translation
(i)	
Functional and presentation currency
	
Items included in the financial statements are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The Group’s financial statements are presented in Indian 
rupee (INR) which is also the Group’s functional and 
presentation currency.
(ii)	
Transactions and balances 
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at 
the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transaction 
and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange 
rate are generally recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined.
(iii)	
Exchange differences
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation 
of monetary items are recognized as income or expense 
in the period in which they arise with the exception of 
exchange differences on gain or loss arising on translation 
of non-monetary items measured at fair value which is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss 
on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation 
differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is 
recognized in OCI or profit or loss are also recognized in 
OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
	
Group Companies
	
On consolidation, the results and financial position of 
foreign operations that have a functional currency different 
from the presentation currency (INR) are translated to the 
presentation currency (INR) in the following manner:
	
a)	
Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting date 
	
b)	
Their statements of profit and loss are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. For practical reasons, the group 
uses an average rate to translate income and 
expense items, if the average rate approximates 
the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions
	
c)	
All resulting exchange differences arising on 
translation of financial statement of foreign 
operations for consolidation are recognised in 
other comprehensive income.
	
d)	
On disposal of a foreign operation, the component 
of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in profit or loss.

e)	
Any Goodwill arising on the acquisition/business 
combination of a foreign operation and any fair 
value adjustments to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the spot rate of 
exchange at the reporting date.
	
f)	
Gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any 
foreign operation excludes translation differences 
that arose before the date of transition but includes 
only translation differences arising after the 
transition date.
2.23	Provisions and Contingent Liabilities 
	
Provisions
	
A provision is recognized when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation. These estimates are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimates. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-
tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in 
the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as 
a finance cost.
	
Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis of claims 
admitted/expected to be admitted and to the extent that 
the amount recoverable can be measured reliably and 
realisation in respect thereof is virtually certain.
	
Warranty Provisions
	
Provision for warranty-related costs are recognized when 
the product is sold or service is provided to customer. 
Initial recognition is based on historical experience. the 
Group periodically reviews the adequacy of product 
warranties and adjust warranty percentage and warranty 
provisions for actual experience, if necessary. The timing 
of outflow is expected to be with in one to seven years.
	
Provision for E-Waste/Plastic-Waste
	
Provision 
for 
E-Waste/Plastic-Waste 
management 
costs are recognized when the liability in respect of 
products sold to customer is established in accordance 
with E-waste Management Rules, 2016 as notified 
by Government of India. Initial recognition is based 
on liability computed based on Extended Producer 
Responsibility as promulgated in said Rules including 
cost to comply the said regulation and as reduced by 
expected realisation of collectable waste. The Group has 
assessed the liability to arise on year to year basis.
	
Contingent liabilities
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group 
or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is 
not probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in 
extremely rare cases, where there is a liability that cannot 
be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. 
the Group does not recognize a contingent liability but 
discloses its existence in the financial statements unless 
the probability of outflow of resources is remote.
	
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets and 
commitments are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
2.24	Dividend Distributions
	
The Group recognizes a liability to make the payment 
of dividend to owners of equity, when the distribution 
is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in 
India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by 
the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised 
directly in equity.
2.25	Fair value measurement
	
The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at 
each balance sheet date.
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
	
(i)	
In the principal market for asset or liability, or
	
(ii)	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group.
	
The fair value of an asset or liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
Havells India Limited
276
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
A fair value measurement of a non- financial asset takes 
into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate 
in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of 
unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1- Quoted(unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset 
or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.
2.26	Business Combinations
(i)	
Business combinations are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquire. For each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests 
in the acquire at fair value or at the proportionate share of 
the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred. 
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they are measured 
at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is 
not probable.
(ii)	
Business Combinations involving entities or businesses 
in which all the combining entities or businesses are 
ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both 
before and after the business combination, and where 
that control is not transitory is accounted using the 
pooling of interests method as enumerated below:
	
a)	
The assets and liabilities of the combining entities 
are reflected at their carrying amounts.
	
b)	
No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, 
or recognise any new assets or liabilities. The 
only adjustments that are made are to harmonise 
accounting policies.
	
c)	
The financial information in the financial statements 
in respect of prior periods should be restated as if 
the business combination had occurred from the 
beginning of the preceding period in the financial 
statements, irrespective of the actual date of the 
combination. However, if business combination 
had occurred after that date, the prior period 
information shall be restated only from that date.
	
d)	
The balance of the retained earnings appearing 
in the financial statements of the transferor is 
aggregated with corresponding balance appearing 
in the financial statements of the transferee or is 
adjusted against revenue reserve.
	
e)	
The identity of the reserves shall be preserved 
and shall appear in the financial statements of the 
transferee in the same form in which they appeared 
in the financial statements of the transferor.
	
f)	
The difference, if any, between the amounts 
recorded as share capital issued plus any additional 
consideration in the form of cash or other assets 
and the amount of share capital of the transferor is 
transferred to revenue reserves/capital reserves.

2.27	Significant accounting judgments, estimates and 
assumptions
	
The 
preparation 
of 
these 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
requires 
the 
management 
to 
make 
judgments, use estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets 
and liabilities, and the acGrouping disclosures, and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about 
these judgements, assumptions and estimates could 
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to 
the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in 
future periods.
a)	
Leases
	
The Group determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods 
covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably 
certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an 
option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain 
not to be exercised.
	
The Group has several lease contracts that include 
extension and termination options. The Group applies 
judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain 
whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate 
the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that 
create an economic incentive for it to exercise either 
the renewal or termination. After the commencement 
date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is 
a significant event or change in circumstances that is 
within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not 
to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g., 
construction of significant leasehold improvements or 
significant customisation to the leased asset).
b)	
Taxes
	
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of 
tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount 
and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide 
range of business relationships differences arising 
between the actual results and the assumptions 
made, or future changes to such assumptions, could 
necessitate future adjustments to tax income and 
expense already recorded. The Group establishes 
provisions, based on reasonable estimates. The 
amount of such provisions is based on various factors, 
such as experience of previous tax assessments 
and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the 
taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. (Refer 
Note 16)
c)	
Gratuity benefit
	
The cost of defined benefit plans (i.e. Gratuity benefit) 
is determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial 
valuation involves making various assumptions which 
may differ from actual developments in the future. These 
include the determination of the discount rate, future 
salary increases, mortality rates and future pension 
increases. Due to the complexity of the valuation, the 
underlying assumptions and its long-term nature, a 
defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate, management considers the interest 
rates of long term government bonds with extrapolated 
maturity corresponding to the expected duration of the 
defined benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on 
publicly available mortality tables for India. Future salary 
increases and pension increases are based on expected 
future inflation rates for India. Further details about the 
assumptions used, including a sensitivity analysis, are 
given in Note 31(3).
d)	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there 
is an indication that an asset including intangible assets 
having indefinite useful life and goodwill may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing 
for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s CGU’S fair value less cost of 
disposal and its value in use. Where the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are estimated based on past rend and discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions 
are taken into account. If no such transactions can be 
identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These 
calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, or 
other fair value indicators. 
e)	
Provision for warranty
	
Warranty provisions is determined based on the historical 
percentage of warranty expense to sales for the same 
types of goods for which the warranty is currently being 
Havells India Limited
278
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
determined. The same percentage to the sales is applied 
for the current accounting period to derive the warranty 
expense to be accrued. It is adjusted to account for 
unusual factors related to the goods that were sold, such 
as defective inventory lying at the depots. The warranty 
claims may not exactly match the historical warranty 
percentage, so such estimates are reviewed annually for 
any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of 
occurrence. The assumptions are consistent with prior 
years. (Refer Note 18)
f)	
Provision for expected credit losses (ECL) of trade 
receivables and contract assets 
	
The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs 
for trade receivables and contract assets. The provision 
rates are based on days past due for groupings of various 
customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e., 
by geography, product type, customer type and rating, 
and coverage by letters of credit and other forms of 
credit insurance). The provision matrix is initially based on 
the Group’s historical observed default rates. The Group 
will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss 
experience with forward-looking information. At every 
reporting date, the historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed. 
	
The assessment of the correlation between historical 
observed default rates, forecast economic conditions 
and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs 
is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast 
economic conditions. The Group’s historical credit loss 
experience and forecast of economic conditions may also 
not be representative of customer’s actual default in the 
future. The information about the ECLs on the Group’s 
trade receivables and contract assets is disclosed in 
Note 31(9)
g)	
Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets
	
Property, Plant and Equipment represent significant 
portion of the asset base of the Group. The charge 
in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after 
determining an estimate of assets expected useful 
life and expected value at the end of its useful life. 
The useful life and residual value of Group’s assets 
are determined by Management at the time asset is 
acquired and reviewed periodically including at the 
end of each year. The useful life is based on historical 
experience with similar assets, in anticipation of future 
events, which may have impact on their life such as 
change in technology.
2.28	Exceptional Item
	
Exceptional Items Group recognises exceptional item 
when items of income and expenses within Statement 
of Profit and Loss from ordinary activities are of 
such size, nature or incidence that their disclosure is 
relevant to explain the performance of the enterprise 
for the period.
2.29	New and amended standards adopted by the 
Group
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs had vide notification 
dated March 23, 2022 notified Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022 which 
amended certain accounting standards, and are effective 
April 1, 2022. These amendments did not have any 
impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and 
are not expected to significantly affect the current or 
future periods.
	
New and amended standards issued but not effective
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide notification 
dated March 31, 2023 notified Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 (the 
‘Rules’) which amends certain accounting standards, 
and are effective April 1, 2023.
	
The Rules predominantly amend Ind AS 12, Income 
taxes, and Ind AS 1, Presentation of financial 
statements. The other amendments to Ind AS 
notified by these rules are primarily in the nature of 
clarifications.
	
These amendments are not expected to have a material 
impact on the group in the current or future reporting 
periods and on foreseeable future transactions. 
Specifically, no changes would be necessary as a 
consequence of amendments made to Ind AS 12 as 
the group’s accounting policy already complies with 
the now mandatory treatment.

Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill and Brand & Trademarks acquired on acquisition of Lloyd business having indefinite useful lives have been allocated to a separate single cash 
generating unit (CGU) i.e. LLOYD consumers. The Group has performed an annual impairment test to ascertain the recoverable amount of such goodwill 
and intangible assets. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculation. These calculations uses management assumptions and pre 
tax cash flow projections based on financed budgets approved by management covering a 5 years period. Cash flow projection beyond 5 years time period 
are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which is consistent with forecasts included in industry reports specific to industry in which CGU operates. 
Management has determined following assumptions for impairment testing of CGU as stated Below:
Assumption
March 31, 2023
Approach used in determining value
Weighted average Cost of capital % (WACC) 
before tax (discount rate)
15.30%
It has been determined basis risk free rate of return adjusted for equity 
risk premium.
Long Term Growth Rate
5.00%
Long term growth rate has been taken basis on overall economic growth 
rate, industry trend & expected long-term inflation in India.
Havells India Limited

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2023
Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development. The weighted average 
growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The calculations performed indicate that there is no impairment 
of GGU of the Group. Management has performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to changes in assumptions for assessment of value-in-use 
of CGU. Based on this analysis, management believes that change in any of above assumption would not cause any material possible change in 
carrying value of unit’s CGU over and above its recoverable amount.

of Amalgamation in earlier years. The requirement to mandatorily transfer a specified percentage of the net profit to general 
reserve before declaration of dividend has been withdrawn. However, the amount previously transferred to the general 
reserve can be utilised only in accordance with the specific requirements of Companies Act, 2013.

or transaction with shareholders.

Defined Benefit Plan
The employees’ Gratuity Fund Scheme, which is a defined benefit plan, is managed by the trust which maintains its investments 
with Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd. The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the gratuity 
plan, every employee who has completed at least five years of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days of last drawn 
basic salary for each completed year of service. The present value of obligation is determined based on actuarial valuation using 
the Projected Unit Credit Method, which recognises each period of service as giving rise to additional unit of employee benefit 
entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
The following tables summaries the components of net benefit expense recognised in the statement of profit or loss, the funded 
status and amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the respective plans:

The average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 21.87 years (March 31, 2022: 
21.66 years).
k)	
The Group expects to contribute ` 29.08 crores (March 31, 2022: ` 8.65 crores) to the plan during the next financial year.
l)	
The estimates of rate of escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation are after taking into account inflation, seniority, 
promotion and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information is as 
certified by the Actuary.
m)	
Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the balance sheet date for the 
estimated term of the obligations.
n)	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit 
obligation as a result of reasonable changes in an assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period while holding all 
other assumption constraint. In practice it is unlikely to occur and change in some of the assumption may be correlated. When 
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value 
of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been 
applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.
o)	
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period

The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, other current financial assets and 
other current financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the other financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions 
were used to estimate the fair values:
1)	
The fair value of unquoted instruments, other non-current financial assets and non-current financial liabilities is estimated by 
discounting future cash flows (DCF model) using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining 
maturities. The valuation requires management to use unobservable inputs in the model, of which the significant unobservable 
inputs are disclosed in the tables below. Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those 
significant unobservable inputs and determines their impact on the total fair value.
2)	
The fair values of the Group’s interest-bearing borrowings are determined by using DCF method using discount rate that 
reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at March 31, 2023 
was assessed to be insignificant.
3)	
Long-term receivables/payables are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates, risk factors, 
individual creditworthiness of the counterparty and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, 
allowances are taken into account for the expected credit losses of these receivables.

Fair value hierarchy
	
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
	
Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted (unadjusted) market prices at the 
end of the reporting period for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques 
which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant 
inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. 
This is the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent consideration and indemnification asset included in level 3.
	
There are no transfers among levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.
	
This section explains the judgement and estimates made in determining the fair value of financial assets that are:

receivables, and cash and cash equivalents that are derived directly from its operations.

is enough liquidity in these situations through internal and external source of funds. These forecast and assumptions are 
reviewed by board of directors.
	
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarized as below:
	
(a)	
Market Risk
	
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market prices comprises three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price 
risks, such as equity price risk and commodity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risks include loans 
and borrowings, deposits, investments, and foreign currency receivables and payables. The sensitivity analysis in the 
following sections relate to the position as at reporting date. The analysis exclude the impact of movements in market 
variables on: the carrying values of gratuity and other post-retirement obligations; provisions; and the non-financial 
assets and liabilities. The sensitivity of the relevant Profit and Loss item and equity is the effect of the assumed changes 
in the respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as of March 31, 2023 and 
March 31, 2022
	
(i)	
Foreign Currency Risk
	
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates 
primarily to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in foreign currency). Foreign 
currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods from the respective countries. The Group 
basis their assessment believes that the probability of the occurrence of their forecasted transactions is not impacted 
by COVID‐19 pandemic. The Group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and 
follows established risk management policies.
	
	
Foreign currency risk sensitivity
	
	
The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD, EUR, CNY and other currencies 
including JPY, KES, NPR, CHF, LKR, MWK, AED, SLL and GBP exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. 
The impact on the Group profit before tax and equity is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. 
Foreign currency exposures recognised by the Group that have not been hedged by a derivative instrument or otherwise 
are as under:

Interest Rate Risk
	
Interest rate is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
long term debt obligation at floating interest rates. The Group’s borrowings outstanding as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 
2022 comprise of long term loans.

(iii)	 Commodity Price Risk
	
The Group is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing manufacture of 
industrial and domestic cable and other electronic items and therefore require a continuous supply of copper and aluminium 
being the major input used in the manufacturing. To mitigate the risk of supply and price fluctuations, Domestic and overseas 
sources are bench-marked to Optimize the allocation of business share among various sources. The Group’s Board of 
Directors has developed and enacted a risk management strategy regarding commodity price risk and its mitigation. The 
Group mitigated the risk of price volatility by entering Long Term & Short term contracts for the Purchase of these commodities 
basis estimated annual requirements.
(b)	 Credit Risk
	
Credit Risk is the risk that the counter party will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

Trade Receivables and Contract Assets
	
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating 
scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are 
regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by Trade Receivable buyout facility without 
recourse, letters of credit and other forms of security.
	
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on trade receivables by lifetime expected credit loss method 
based on provision matrix. The Group does not hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with 
respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries 
and operate in largely independent markets.
	
The group assigns the following internal credit ratings to each class of financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and 
factors specific to the class of the financial assets. The group provides for expected credit loss based on the following:
