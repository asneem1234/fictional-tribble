PRINCIPLE 2 Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe . 
Essential Indicators 
1. 
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in speciﬁc technologies to improve the environmental and 
social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity, respectively. 
 
Environmental and Social impact assessment is one of the key inputs for the new product development/process changes. Capital 
expenditure and R&D spends incurred by the Company embeds cost incurred to mitigate environmental & social hazards. These are 
inseparable cost of the projects and hence separately identifying such cost is not feasible. Increasing share of renewable energy in 
overall energy portfolio is a ﬂagship initiative which demonstrated our commitment towards sourcing clean energy and transition to 
low carbon operation having a direct impact on the environment. 
2. 
a. 
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
 
b. 
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 
EKC manufactures seamless steel cylinders for which seamless tubes are required in speciﬁc size and speciﬁcation which currently 
are imported from China as Indian Steel Companies are still not providing material as per EKC's speciﬁc requirement. 16% of the raw 
material spend was sourced locally (within India).
3.

(a)  Plastics  (including  packaging)  (b)  E-waste  (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
 
By virtue of being a cylinder industry, our products, in general, get completely utilized once it reaches consumers. However, we are 
focused on reducing the generation of damaged and defective materials on the inventory management front. These stocks are 
collected back, reprocessed, and utilized to the maximum extent possible. EKC does not recycle the products manufactured. The 
non- hazardous scrap generated by the Company is sold for further recycling. (a)  Plastics  (including  packaging): Not applicable(b)

Provide  the  processes  for  consultation  between  stakeholders  and  the Board  on economic, environmental,  and  social  
topics  or  if  consultation  is  delegated,  how  is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
 
At EKC, stakeholder engagement mechanism is a key driving force towards strengthening and diversifying the stakeholder 
relationship, which further facilitates the identiﬁcation of key material issues impacting the Company’s growth. The stakeholder 
engagement and materiality assessment exercise conducted in FY2022-23 led to the prioritisation of material issues, mapping of the 
risks relevant to each material topic and development of consequent risk mitigation steps. The primary outcome of the stakeholder 
engagement exercise resulted in identiﬁcation and prioritisation of material issues relevant to environment, social, governance and 
economic aspects. The identiﬁed material issues were presented to the highest governing member and the Board for their feedback 
and guidance on strategising the sustainable growth model of the Company. As part of the Company’s eﬀorts to continually engage with 
internal and external stakeholder groups for identiﬁcation of key material issues impacting them, the stakeholder engagement exercise 
undergoes periodic review. 
2.  
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental, and social topics 
(Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
 
Yes, the identiﬁcation, prioritisation of material issues relevant to the environment, social, economic and governance topics is done in 
consultation with the stakeholders. The identiﬁed issues are then subsequently mapped with relevant risks. As part of the risk 
management plan, the Company subsequently strategises and develops mitigation action plans for the identiﬁed risk. The material  
issues form the guiding framework for the nonﬁnancial disclosures of the Company through its Sustainability Report. As per the
42
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting
 
relevant national and international guidelines and standards, the Company discloses its management approach, targets/goals and its 
non-ﬁnancial performance in the reporting year for each of the identiﬁed material topic. Additionally, the identiﬁcation of material issues 
enables the company to focus on its key improvement areas and subsequently develop future action plans such as policy development, 
initiatives implementation among others. 
3. 
Provide  details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
