Employee turnover is a crucial metric for measuring the performance of human resources departments or human resource management apps.
High turnover means that many people are leaving the company, while low turnover means that people tend to stay in their jobs longer. The employee
turnover rate is a way to measure how often employees leave a company and are replaced by new ones.
Analyzing turnover rates can help organizations identify areas for improvement in terms of employee engagement, retention strategies, and overall
workplace culture. It can also be used to compare turnover rates within different departments or industries, providing insights into the relative health and
stability of different work environments.

Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions & 
Climate Change 
Management 
Risk & 
Opportunity 
A significant part of SEIL production is through 
the blast furnace route, which is an emission 
intensive process and contributes towards 
global warming.  
SEIL is trying to set up targets to treat the emissions in a much 
responsible manner and transition to low carbon steelmaking 
is critical for the long-term success of the Company. SEIL also 
aims to maximize the amount of scrap charged into its 
existing blast furnace based steelmaking operations 
Both Negative & 
Positive based on 
treatment 
2 
Energy 
Management 
Opportunity 
Production of steel is a highly energy intensive 
process and consumes a large quantity of 
energy from multiple sources: coal, natural 
gas, electricity and other fossil fuel. 
 
We are striving to reducing our energy footprint by 
embracing energy-efficient technologies. Moreover, we are 
proactively trying to integrate renewable energy sources into 
our energy mix and contribute to a greener and more 
sustainable world.  
Positive 
3 
Water 
Consumption 
and Effluent 
Discharge 
Risk 
SEIL utilises a large quantity of water in its 
processes and draws this water from multiple 
sources. 
Minimizing withdrawal of fresh water from rivers by 
maximising the recycling of treated waste effluents within 
the plant by setting up effluent treatment plants. 
Negative 
4 
Circular 
Economy 
Opportunity 
Steel as a material lends itself to circularity and 
is recyclable as ferrous scrap to produce new 
steel. Steel produced through recycling has a 
significantly lower carbon footprint, as opposed 
to producing primary steel by reducing iron ore. 
SEIL aims to maximize the amount of scrap charged into its 
existing blast furnace based steelmaking operations 
Positive

Employee & 
Workforce 
Engagement, 
Wellbeing 
Opportunity 
SEIL believes that Employee Well-being and 
Development creates a healthy company 
culture, better employee satisfaction and 
higher employee engagement and therefore, 
helps attract and retain talent. The Company’s 
ability to attract and retain talent provides the 
Company with a competent and experienced 
workforce and reduces recruitment costs for 
the Company. A high quality and motivated 
workforce is critical for company sustainability.
 
We adopt best practices to ensure healthy employee 
relations, employee growth and development as well as work 
satisfaction. We have strived to build caring and collaborative 
relationships based on trust and mutual respect, paving the 
way for a respectful workplace for all. 
Positive 
6 
Occupational 
Health & Safety 
Risk 
Ensuring the safety of its employees, contract 
workers and communities is critical for 
continued regulatory and social license to 
operate, especially considering process related 
hazard in steelwork. In case safety related 
processes or performance of the Company is 
deemed inadequate, or in case of a significant 
safety incident, prohibition order from the 
government may also lead to partial closure of 
the plant. 
We endeavour to achieve the objective of safety and health 
responsibilities through a robust safety management system 
framework and a sound safety governance structure.

Further the steel slag generated during the production is sold to cement manufacturers which helps in reducing the emmission intensity of cement
production.
