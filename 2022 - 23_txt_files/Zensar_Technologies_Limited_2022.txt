Chairman's Communique
Dear Shareholders,
Building resilience. 
Powering progress. 
At Zensar, we are preparing for the 
next wave of growth by focusing 
on high-quality services, pushing 
the boundaries of innovation, 
and creating sustainable value 
for our customers. While macro 
headwinds may exist, we believe 
that with strategic investments in 
our service lines and our vertical 
bets, we are well-positioned to 
capture opportunities created in 
the evolving business landscape. 
Long-term prospects in the IT 
sector remain attractive as digital 
transformation and technology 
investments become increasingly 
critical to the growth ambitions of 
organisations. 
Our efforts toward clients’ 
transformation initiatives, continued 
thrust on refining our portfolio, 
and identifying replicable success 
stories within our operations are 
driven by a deep understanding of 
our clients' needs. During the year, 
we strengthened our management 
team, bringing together a 
combination of skills, experience 
and vision at the executive and 
board levels. We have forged new 
alliances and partnerships with 
major technology players. 
Zensar has been at the forefront 
with industry-leading work-from-
anywhere flexibility, diversity, 
equity, and inclusion policies, and 
best-in-class wellness benefits. The 
Zensar Learning Academy embodies 
our commitment to upskilling 
and growth. With significant 
investments in capability-building, 
career progression, learning, 
compensation, and recognition, we 
are training the next generation of 
tech talent and developing leaders 
for the future. We believe that 
by providing the right tools and 
resources, we can create a culture 
of innovation and excellence that 
benefits both our people and clients 
alike.
I am happy to share that our 
recently acquired company - M3BI 
- is now well integrated into the 
overall organisation. 
We are committed to addressing 
the pressing issues of climate 
change, carbon emissions, and 
water pollution, and collaborate 
with businesses and communities 
to drive meaningful action toward 
mitigating these challenges. 
We have increased reliance on 
green energy across our locations 
worldwide. We are also a water-
positive organisation.
Additionally, our UI/UX business 
has been working closely with our 
clients on their sustainable business 
initiatives with a unique offering 
that combines climate experts, 
experience designers, and design 
strategists to offer a cutting- edge 
standard of sustainability expertise 
that is firmly rooted in design 
thinking methodologies. 
I would like to thank our clients 
and partners for their unwavering 
support and our esteemed 
shareholders for continuing to place 
their trust in Zensar as we walk 
together toward an exciting and 
digital future.
Regards,
H.V. Goenka
Chairman, Non-Executive Director

Zensar Technologies Limited
CEO and Managing Director's 
Message
Dear Shareholders,
It is my honour and privilege to 
address you as this esteemed 
organisation’s CEO and Managing 
Director for the first time. In the 
four months since starting this 
role, I have had the pleasure 
of meeting many fascinating 
people — Zensarians, industry 
thought leaders, and clients 
who passionately believe in their 
products and services. 
With each interaction, I’ve been 
reminded why I was so excited 
to take on this role: At Zensar, 
we create experiences that put 
people first. We do more than sell 
and deliver to our clients — we 
build relationships with them. And 
through these relationships, we are 
always learning more about our 
clients’ drive and desire to serve 
their customers with greater speed, 
agility, and purpose.
Globally, we stand on the cusp of 
both challenge and opportunity. 
Economic uncertainties are 
countered by digital innovation 
that powers fresh ways of working 
and connecting in a post-pandemic 
world. As our clients navigate this 
environment, they continue to look 
to digital transformation to move 
forward with velocity. A steadfast 
partner, Zensar continues to provide 
design, data, and engineering 
offerings to help meet — and 
redefine — the challenges that 
matter most, from optimizing hybrid 
work to harnessing AI.
As I look ahead at the future 
of Zensar, I am met with eager 
anticipation and an undaunted 
sense of innovation and exploration. 
Zensar is a singular organisation 
— one that is unafraid to take the 
best of today and reimagine it for 
tomorrow. As we do this work, 
we are guided by five pillars of 
progress:
1 	 Client-centricity:  
Client-centricity is at the core 
of our business. Indeed, I am 
amazed by the unwavering 
client focus that Zensarians 
demonstrate every day. As we 
unlock the next phase of growth 
for Zensar, we honour that 
approach by making decisive 
moves that will propel us 
forward to deliver the highest 
value to our clients and their 
customers.
2 	 Sales transformation:  
To increase our addressable 
market, we are looking from 
the inside out, identifying our 
key strengths and capitalizing 
on our substantial service 
line investments. With this 
foundation, we seek to move 
beyond our traditional sales 
priorities, penetrating additional 
C-suite opportunities and 
leading with a robust alliance-
based strategy supported by 
vertical-specific solutions.   
3 	 Delivery excellence:  
Delivery excellence starts with 
client-centric ways of working. 
Whether we are defining 
ways to foster the sales-
through-delivery continuum or 
redefining how we manage the 
client feedback lifecycle, our 
ideas are rooted in delivering 
superior value. Likewise, our 
ongoing growth in operational 
excellence — from proactive 
governance and reporting to 
streamlined processes and 
systems — provides essential 
support for bolstering delivery 
excellence.   
4 	 Talent transformation: 
The people of Zensar are 
the company’s heartbeat, 
and by investing in our 
employees, we keep our 
entire ecosystem healthy and 
strong. From growing our 
internal leadership program 
and creating opportunities 
for upskilling and reskilling to 
providing meaningful company 
experiences, we are committed 
to nurturing a happy workforce, 
which, in turn, will create 
delight for our clients.
5 	 Emphasis on ESG:  
At Zensar, our environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) 
vision is to create smart 
connections and experiences 
for a sustainable tomorrow — 
and that work starts today. We 
rely on the three tenets of our 
Globally, we stand on the 
cusp of both challenge 
and opportunity. Economic 
uncertainties are countered 
by digital innovation that 
powers fresh ways of 
working and connecting 
in a post-pandemic world. 
As our clients navigate 
this environment, they 
continue to look to digital 
transformation to move 
forward with velocity.

ESG Framework to guide us in 
building sustainable and lasting 
technology solutions. First, in 
all aspects of our work, we take 
responsibility for our planet and 
our communities. Second, we 
drive key initiatives dedicated 
to the greater common good, 
including environmental 
protection, employability, 
and education. Third, we are 
committed to a progressive 
inclusion policy, inspiring a 
workplace free of discrimination 
and focused on empathy.
FY23 performance: 
Recapping a pivotal year
In FY23, our BFSI business 
vertical has delivered impressive 
growth, with a 22.3% increase 
in performance and strong 
momentum from both existing 
clients and marquee new logos. We 
successfully scaled these accounts 
through advanced engineering and 
data services. Looking ahead, we 
are dedicated to driving sustainable 
growth and delivering exceptional 
value to our clients.
Despite a slowdown in the HTM 
and consumer services verticals, 
we have remained committed 
to improving our go-to-market 
strategies and aligning efforts to 
industry requirements. The strong 
performance of BFSI helped to 
offset some challenges, and we 
are poised to emerge stronger by 
responding proactively to market 
conditions and maintaining our 
focus on excellence.
Our European operations registered 
notable growth of 20.0% in constant 
currency, despite geopolitical 
uncertainty, thanks to our strong 
relationships with key clients. The 
South African market, too, reported 
strong growth of 18.3% in constant 
currency. Operations in the US, 
however, saw a slowdown in the 
HTM vertical, impacting overall 
performance. 
Our gross margin stood at 27.7%, 
while our EBITDA stood at 11.3%. 
Throughout the fiscal year, we 
concentrated on six core areas: 
enhancing our service mix, 
optimizing our commercial strategy, 
increasing utilisation rates, and 
optimizing the pyramid structure, 
support costs, and cost of talent 
acquisition. This targeted approach 
led to sustained growth across key 
metrics despite a drop in revenue.
Finally, our order book for the fiscal 
year amounted to USD 572.1 million, 
driven by multiple wins across 
verticals. We also successfully 
expanded the scale of three clients 
to the USD 10 million-plus bracket, 
bringing the total number of clients 
in this category to 14.
Big wins: Driving success 
with integrated solutions 
and strategic partnerships 
In the past year, Zensar has 
delivered exceptional value through 
integrated solutions that span 
multiple capabilities and service 
lines. Notable achievements include 
modernizing the data warehouse of 
a top American insurance provider, 
providing application development 
services to a specialist investment 
management firm, and being 
selected as a key systems integrator 
and strategic partner for a leading 
payment card manufacturer’s 
enterprise transformation program.
In addition, Zensar has forged 
a strategic partnership with a 
prominent mobility services 
company to develop an enterprise 
cloud data platform integrating 
seven lines of business and multiple 
applications. We also won a multi-
year managed services deal to 
provide end-to-end application 
support for the same client. 
Likewise, we worked with a US-
based omnichannel retailer to 
modernize its enterprise platform; 
we also partnered with its POS 
transformation program to achieve 
stability, scalability, and resiliency. 
Finally, we are proud to announce 
our partnership with Salesforce. 
Leveraging the Salesforce 
Experience Cloud and Commerce 
Cloud, we are able to work with 
new clients and deliver exceptional 
customer experiences through 
innovative solutions that drive 
results.

service and innovative solutions has

The road ahead:  
Ensuring sustainable 
growth with lasting

Over the past year, our efforts 
to refine our services, enhance 
our go-to-market strategies, and

impressive results. Despite global 
uncertainties, our order book has 
steadily improved, and we stand

opportunities — always with a 
commitment to being the preferred 
partner for our clients worldwide.
In closing, I would like to express 
my deep appreciation to our valued

Our strategy of focusing on sales, 
talent, partnerships, and executing 
mergers and acquisitions (M&A) 
transactions has been successful 
in expanding our market share, 
retaining top talent, showcasing 
our expertise, and expanding our 
offerings to better serve our clients.
Our strategy is geared 
towards execution 
through accelerated go-
to-market, partnerships 
and alliances, and sales 
rigor. Our constant 
endeavor is to execute 
our strategy effectively 
and deliver sustainable, 
profitable growth while 
keeping our clients at the 
forefront of our decision-
making.
In the HTM (Hi-Tech 
Manufacturing) vertical, 
we have managed to 
steady the ship and gain 
strong traction. We have 
taken critical steps to 
address any underlying 
issues and are now well-
positioned to capitalize 
on opportunities in the 
sector. With emerging 
technologies such as IoT, 
AI, and cloud computing 
transforming the 
manufacturing landscape, 
our focus on innovation 
and digital solutions 
appears to be paying off.
We are committed to strengthening 
our new businesses by expanding 
through alliances and partnerships 
while also developing vertical-
specific solution offerings in areas 
such as Guidewire and supply chain 
capabilities in the retail sector.
We recognize that client 
relationships are critical to our 
success. Therefore, we are driving 
relationships through a client-
centric account management 
process. We believe this approach 
ensures that we are providing 
our clients with the best possible 
service and solutions while 
also identifying new growth 
opportunities.
Similarly, in the BFSI (Banking, 
Financial Services, and Insurance) 
vertical, we have consistently 
maintained our growth momentum. 
We have managed to add marquee 
logos to our client roster, which is 
a testament to our expertise in the 
sector. The BFSI industry is highly 
competitive and is constantly 
evolving, and our ability to stay 
ahead of the curve is a key factor in 
our success.
In the CS (Consumer Services) 
vertical, we have augmented our 
leadership team and delivered 
encouraging results. Customer 
service is a critical component of 
any business, and our focus on 
providing high-quality services 
has enabled us to build enduring 
relationships with our clients. 
By augmenting our leadership

Navigating Uncertainties, 
Leveraging Opportunities 
We have established a comprehensive approach that enables us 
to manage risks proactively and effectively and drive enterprise 
velocity. We continue our efforts to generate value with a 
balanced risk management methodology and by capitalizing on 
identified opportunities. 
We are constantly advancing 
our efforts to create a robust risk 
management framework that 
provides precise guidance and 
governance in the systematic 
management of potential threats. 
This framework encompasses 
the entire spectrum of risk 
management, which involves 
identifying, analyzing, mitigating, 
and disclosing potential risks that 
may arise within our business 
environment and minimizing any 
adverse impact on our operations, 
stakeholders, or value creation, 
ensuring sustainable growth.
Our enterprise risk management 
(ERM) program ensures compliance 
with applicable government and 
regulatory requirements and, 
through proposed mitigations and 
regular monitoring and reporting, 
acts on potential risks in various 
economic, environmental, social, 
and industrial environments that 
Zensar operates in.
Governance
Our commitment to strong governance practices is deeply rooted in our organisational 
philosophy. The Company’s Board of Directors, management, and employees work together 
to ensure that the highest standards of accountability, transparency, and fairness are 
upheld in all their transactions with stakeholders. This commitment has enabled us to build 
a robust corporate governance framework that assures good governance, compliance, risk 
management, and sustainability.
Comprehensive Code of 
Conduct
Exemplary leadership for 
strong governance
Our commitment to good governance 
practices is reflected in our exemplary 
leadership. Zensar’s Board of Directors 
is committed to continuously 
improving our corporate governance 
principles, policies, and practices by 
staying abreast of evolving regulations 
and benchmarking best practices. 
Our Board of Directors comprises 
experts with a wide range of 
experience in the IT industry, cyber 
security, general management, 
business operations, thought 
leadership, international business, 
strategy, mergers and acquisitions, 
restructuring, human resources 
management, public policy and 
governmental regulations, finance, 
marketing, and risk management. 
Their collective expertise and 
commitment to strong governance 
practices ensure that Zensar 
adheres to the highest standards 
of governance in areas such as 
compliance, risk, and sustainability.
Board diversity
We recognize the critical role a diverse 
board plays in fostering effective 
leadership and understand the value 
that inclusivity brings to the table. 
By prioritizing board diversity and 
inclusivity as an essential component 
of our leadership approach, we create 
an environment that fosters a culture 
of diverse perspectives, enabling us 
to generate innovative solutions and 
drive improved performance.
At the core of our work culture is the 
value of inclusion, which has also 
been integrated into our policies and 
processes. As an integral part of our 
Nomination and Remuneration Policy 
and our commitment to diversity 
initiatives, we actively seek candidates 
from wide-ranging backgrounds and 
emphasize promoting diversity among 
our leaders. 
Anti-corruption and  
anti-bribery policies
As an integral part of Zensar’s Code 
of Conduct (CoC), the Company has 
put in place anti-corruption and anti-
bribery policies that all employees are 
expected to adhere to. The policies 
are designed to ensure that Zensar 
conducts its business ethically and 
with integrity and to prevent any form 
of corruption or bribery in all the 
regions where it operates.
To ensure that all employees 
understand and comply with the anti-
corruption policies, we have made 
it mandatory for every employee to 
complete certification training on 
anti-corruption as a part of the CoC. 
This training is conducted annually to 
ensure that employees are kept up-to-
date with the latest developments in 
anti-corruption practices.
To ensure adherence to robust 
governance practices, we have put 
in place a comprehensive Code of 
Corporate Governance and Ethics, 
which applies to all Zensar employees.
The Corporate Governance and 
Ethics Committee (CGEC) facilitates 
the monitoring of the Code of 
Conduct (CoC) implementation and 
acts as a central body for ensuring 
compliance. The Code of Conduct 
covers several critical areas — conflict 
of interest, gifting, membership 
of social services, directorship of 
firms and companies, relatives as

All employees of Zensar are required

to ensure that they are fully aware of 
the principles contained therein. In 
addition, Board members and senior 
management must sign off annually 
to acknowledge their adherence to 
the Code of Conduct. This process 
underscores the importance we place 
on compliance with ethical standards 
and ensuring that all employees 
uphold these values.

our methodical approach to margin

to prudently manage our financial 
capital with strategic improvement in 
operational indicators, rationalizing 
costs, and hiring fresh talent. 
Subsequently, our strong pillars 
of training and learning help us 
pivot to improve our operational 
performances. As a consequence, 
we are able to improve our margins 
by end of this fiscal year, and we aim 
to ensure our sustained growth and 
financial stability by implementing 
these cost-optimizing strategies.
Expanding capabilities 
and addressable market
Our investments in service lines 
have increased our capabilities and 
expanded our addressable market, 
generating positive feedback from 
clients across the spectrum. Our 
current collaborations with various 
platforms and hyperscalers are 
experiencing a steady and robust 
upward trajectory. Our hyperscaler

Governance and control 
framework for financial 
risk management
With the global economy 
experiencing instability, the IT 
industry cannot remain immune to 
the impact of unstable economic 
conditions, particularly the 
fluctuation of major currencies. In 
response, we have a hedging policy 
in place that is actively monitored 
on a regular basis to minimize 
the risks associated with foreign 
currency rate fluctuations. 
We recognize the importance 
of other financial risks and have 
incorporated risk mitigation 
measures into our governance and 
control framework. Our internal 
controls architecture includes 
a robust system of checks and 
balances, with the Head of Treasury 
being responsible for ensuring 
compliance with internal controls. 
Compliance is assessed by our 
Tax governance and 
control framework
At Zensar, we recognize that our 
contribution to the exchequer 
through taxes plays an essential role 
in the development of the regions 
and jurisdictions where we operate. 
The CFO and Head of Tax assess 
our tax strategy annually to ensure 
compliance with all tax laws and 
regulations in these jurisdictions.
The tax governance and control 
framework is integrated into our 
internal controls and monitored 
regularly through audits by 
our internal audit function and 
independent external auditors. 
The Head of Tax is responsible for 
ensuring compliance with these 
controls. Tax disclosures are also 
included in our financial statements, 
which are audited by independent 
external auditors. 
Our client-centric culture being the core of our 
business has led to deal wins across verticals 
resulting in revenue growth of 10.3% (in USD) 
in constant currency. Our focus on driving 
operational excellence through disciplined cost 
management program and optimizing operating 
matrices has helped in improving profitability 
by end of the year. Our focused efforts on ‘Bill 
to Cash’ process has resulted in improving our 
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) by 16 days y-o-y, 
as the company ended the year with $201.5 Mn 
cash, an increase of $45.8 Mn. Our focus remains 
on expanding our client portfolio through 
cross selling of our service line offerings and 
maintaining a healthy margin. This is going to be 
key for our long-term profitable growth.
Sachin Zute
Senior Vice President and 
Chief Financial Officer
Moving forward, we aim to solidify our position as the partner of choice and 
a strategic ally within our existing ecosystem of partners. To this end, we 
are undertaking measures to enhance our outreach, such as forging new 
alliances and developing specialized solutions tailored to specific verticals.
Monitoring market 
developments for growth 
opportunities
Our unwavering focus is on executing 
our operations with precision in our 
three core geographies — the United 
States, Europe, and South Africa. We 
are closely monitoring market trends, 
and any prospective expansion of 
our target regions or delivery center 
capabilities will be assessed against 
our overall strategy and linked with 
our service line capabilities to meet 
our clients' increasing demand 
requirements.

by independent external auditors. 
We consult with forex consultants,

and mitigation of forex risk. We also 
mitigate financial risk by diversifying 
our investment portfolio to reduce

explore opportunities provided by us.
Boosting recruitment with referrals
Our proven strategy involves 
leveraging our extensive network of

equal opportunities for all and 
are committed to creating a level

global employee population. Hence, 
we are committed to addressing 
this through comprehensive talent-
sourcing strategies.

facilitate a seamless transition into 
our Company culture and to provide 
our team members with the skills 
they need to deliver exceptional 
results.

Creating a culture of 
engagement
At Zensar, we believe that a happy 
workforce is a productive workforce. 
We are committed to creating a 
culture of engagement where our 
employees feel valued, connected, 
and supported. From monthly 
celebrations to customized training 
programs, we take concrete steps 
to ensure a happy, healthy, and 
connected workplace.
Celebrating together
At Zensar, we understand the 
significance of cultural diversity and 
how different locations celebrate 
events uniquely. We cherish every 
opportunity to celebrate with our 
employees, regardless of their 
cultural background. We make an 
effort to mark each employee's 
birthday with a monthly birthday 
bash, making them feel cherished 
and valued on their special day.
Enabling positive impact 
through volunteering
We believe that giving back to 
society is essential to our ethos. 
We organize food banks for 
Thanksgiving in Westborough, MA, 
Princeton, NJ, Durham, NC, and 
Milpitas, CA. We also involve our 
employees in the Adopt a Highway 
program aimed at maintaining and 
greening the highways. 
Strengthening connections 
across locations
At Zensar, we believe that a 
connected workforce is a happy 
workforce. That's why we organize 
team-building workshops, monthly 
in-person fun activities, and potlucks 
that encourage our employees 
to connect with each other. 
Our Happiness Survey helps us 
understand our employees' needs 
and preferences, and our leadership 
connect sessions foster open 
communication and collaboration. 
We conduct two-week periodic 
drives to strengthen connections 
through meaningful non-work-related 
conversations and recognizing efforts 
with special eCards.
Going beyond employee 
satisfaction surveys
We go beyond traditional employee 
satisfaction surveys by conducting 
holistic happiness surveys to 
measure our employees’ overall 
well-being. These surveys help us 
understand their level of happiness, 
contentment, growth, and passion 
for their work. It also enables us 
to identify areas where we can 
improve and make changes that 
will positively impact their overall 
happiness and well-being.

Rewards and recognition
We are committed to ensuring that 
our employees feel valued and 
appreciated for their hard work and 
contribution to the organisation. 
Our rewards and recognition (R&R) 
framework is an integral part of our 
culture, and we strive to make it 
better every day. To ensure effective 
governance and participation, our 
leadership champions the entire 
initiative. We also publish bi-weekly 
dashboards so our leaders can track 
participation and ensure our R&R 
practices are effective and inclusive.
Our R&R framework includes 
peer-to-peer recognitions, spot 
awards, quarterly awards, annual 
awards, and CEO awards. We also 
run appreciation weeks at periodic 
intervals throughout the year 
to ensure maximum employee 
participation. Our quarterly and 
annual awards are governed 
by a best-in-class practice of 
nominations and objective selection 
of winners. This helps us identify 
and reward top performers and 
contributors to the organisation.
Moreover, we personally welcome 
new hires and transfers to help them 
settle in and feel at home in their 
new environment. At other locations, 
we have hosted Christmas tree 
parties, ugly sweater parties, and 
Halloween get-togethers, embracing 
the diverse cultural backgrounds 
of our employees. We celebrate 
appreciation week every year, taking 
the time to express our gratitude to 
our employees for their contribution 
to the organisation's success.

Culture of listening
In line with our value of commitment to people, we provide numerous 
avenues for employees to express their thoughts, offer suggestions, and 
discuss career growth with leaders, managers, and HR across all levels. We 
have offered various platforms to foster open communication.
New joinee feedback
This platform facilitates obtaining 
feedback and recommendations from 
newly onboarded personnel, enabling 
identification of potential areas 
for improvement. The new joinee 
interacts with talent acquisition, 
HR operations, admin teams, and 
rates them through a feedback form 
available in the HRMS system. 
360-degree feedback 
This process enables leaders to 
receive comprehensive feedback 
from subordinates, peers, and 
superiors. Directors and above 
undergo this annually, while it is 
optional for lower-level managers 
during performance appraisals. 
This process helps identify areas 
of strength and improvement for 
leadership development.
Focus group discussion
The human resources team facilitates 
group sessions comprising 18 
to 20 employees from various 
grades, projects, and functions 
to gather constructive feedback 
and suggestions for targeted 
improvements. The resulting 
suggestions are documented and 
submitted to the relevant department 
for review and action.
One-on-one meetings
Scheduled on a monthly, quarterly, 
biannual, or annual basis, senior 
managers convene with employees 
deemed as top talent or in critical 
roles. These formal meetings foster 
career dialogues and facilitate 
discussions on role enrichment, job 
rotation, and career aspirations.
Group and skip-level meetings
Group-level meetings provide 
employees with the opportunity 
to engage and communicate with 
managers and senior managers 
periodically. These discussions 
involve business plans and 
updates and seek input from 
employees. Similarly, skip-level 
meetings enable one-on-one or 
one-to-many interactions with 
two-up managers, promoting team 
health, connectivity, and clarity. 
All-hands
Quarterly all-hands meetings are 
held to celebrate awards and 
enable employees to communicate 
directly with their business unit 
leadership. Employees can inquire 
about and discuss changes and 
processes here.
Performance appraisal 
An appraisal discussion, 
facilitated by the employee's 
manager, evaluates the overall 
contributions to the Company. 
This review occurs during our 
annual, mid-term, and project-
end appraisals. Its benefits 
include goal focus, increased 
job satisfaction, identification of 
learning and development areas, 
and understanding of employee 
aspirations. Additionally, our PMS 
system includes a disagreement 
feature and a consent feature, 
allowing employees to report 
dissatisfaction with ratings and 
verifying whether they have had 
an appraisal discussion with their 
manager.

Zensar Technologies Limited
ZenVerse application
This innovative application 
provides an exclusive platform for 
employees to directly engage and 
interact with the CEO/Executive 
Committee members, enabling 
fruitful discussions, feedback, and 
suggestions that have led to notable 
improvements in the organisation.
Digicast
This platform serves as a means 
for leaders to communicate 
significant quarterly achievements 
and future plans, as well as address 
any inquiries or solicit feedback 
from employees regarding the 
organisation.
Talent@Zensar
This integrated platform provides 
an efficient resolution for HR, 
finance, payroll, admin, and 
travel desk concerns. Employees 
can submit their inquiries and 
complaints through the app, 
which are promptly addressed by 
the appropriate party within the 
designated timeframe. Queries left 
unresolved are promptly elevated to 
the next level.
Zenlounge+
Our intranet was transformed into 
a more collaborative and social 
platform, offering employees the 
chance to voice their thoughts on 
various engagements and programs. 
Zenlounge+ follows the social media 
approach, allowing comments, likes, 
and shares. A poll feature allows 
employees to share their opinions on 
any topic, providing the organisation 
with the opportunity to listen and 
implement changes.
Amber
We have initiated the pilot phase 
of Amber, an external chatbot that 
facilitates continuous listening 
through anonymous/named 
pulses. Through pre-determined 
engagement points such as work 
anniversaries and promotions, 
the bot generates group-level 
sentiment and early warning 
signals for attrition. The objective is 
to preemptively address potential 
areas of improvement and reduce 
attrition rates.
Exit interviews
The interview serves as a formal 
channel for departing employees 
to provide constructive feedback 
and suggestions through a 
standardized template within 
the Oracle HRMS system. The 
HR representative conducts the 
interview in person prior to the 
employee's departure, and the 
process is subject to auditing for 
continuous improvement.
Grievance redressal policy
When striving to create a happier 
workplace, it is imperative to be 
vigilant of employee concerns 
and keep access open to raise 
grievances when required. To 
ensure we facilitate all types of 
grievance reporting and redressal, 
a Grievance Review Committee 
(GRC) has been established 
for all our valued employees to 
raise concerns. The GRC teams 
meticulously investigate each 
grievance, endeavoring to obtain 
a comprehensive view of the 
situation and diligently collating 
all relevant information and 
evidence. To ensure accessibility 
and convenience, any employee 
can report their grievance 
through our website portal. 
Upon completion of a thorough 
investigation, GRC members 
submit their recommendations on 
the appropriate course of  
action to effectively address  
the matter at hand.
Learning and development
At Zensar, we understand the 
significance of learning to remain 
relevant in today's rapidly evolving 
business landscape. As a result, we 
prioritize building next-generation 
capabilities for our employees by 
encouraging them to take charge of 
their growth through our  
learn-disrupt-grow approach. Our 
training programs are designed to 
integrate technical, managerial, 
and behavioural learning to equip 
our employees with the necessary 
skills. We utilize service line skill-
focus areas, market trends, and 
alliance partnerships to identify our 
organisational learning needs. This 
approach allows us to continuously 
evolve our capabilities and stay 
ahead of industry trends,  
ultimately delivering exceptional 
value to our clients.

the organisation. In the fiscal year, 
we conducted a gender sensitisation 
program for all leaders and managers. 
Creating an enabling 
environment
Our diversity program aims to create 
an enabling environment for people 
from diverse categories, such as 
women, members of the LGBTQ+ 
community, people with disabilities, 
and people with generational, ethnic, 
and cultural diversity. We have set a 
2030 vision and target for diversity 
hiring, implemented policies and 
processes to promote diversity, and 
conducted gender sensitisation 
programs. Our leadership 
development program and employee 
resource groups like ZENWEN for 
women and PRISM for the LGBTQ+ 
community further demonstrate our 
commitment to diversity.  
Enliven 
This program is designed to support 
women professionals in India who 
wish to return to the workforce after 
a career break. This enables a smooth 
transition for women professionals 
into the workplace, regardless of the 
nature of their career break. 
Providing care and support to 
expecting mothers and new 
mothers
We are committed to providing 
flexible work arrangements to 
all our employees, including 
telecommuting and flexible 
schedules. We offer extended 
leave options beyond the standard 
maternity leave period to help new 
mothers adjust to their new role as a 
parent and bond with their children. 
We also provide childcare support 
through in-house facilities or 
referrals to reputable providers. Our 
unique Pregnancy Care Program, 
ZIVA, supports female employees 
before and during pregnancy, while 
our Employee Assistance Program, 
ZAAP, offers confidential support on 
personal and professional issues.
PRISM
Last year, Zensar launched PRISM, 
an ally group for the LGBTQ+ 
community. Through this, the 
policy coverage benefits have been 
extended to include the partners 
of our employees, both same-sex 
and heterosexual. They will now 
be recognized as equivalent to a 
“spouse.” Their legally adopted 
children will be recognized as 
“dependents.” This policy extension 
provides comprehensive insurance 
coverage, leave, statutory social 
security, and retirement benefits.

Employee health awareness
We organize events like World 
Heart Day and World Earth Day 
to promote heart health and 
sustainability. We encourage our 
employees to participate in fitness 
events accessible in their respective 
locations, such as marathons, 
cricket tournaments, badminton, 
fun walks, and more. We have also 
been driving CHARM (Charity as We 
Run), which encourages employees 
to run miles that equate to points 
that will be converted into currency 
and contributed to charity on their 
behalf. At the RTP US delivery center, 
employees marked the occasion 
of World Earth Day by adopting a 
sustainable mode of transportation 
and cycling their way to work.
World Heart Day celebrations 
held in Westborough, MA, and 
Princeton, NJ, included a range of 
activities such as vital sign checks, 
heart-healthy lunches, and fitness 
challenges to raise awareness 
about heart health. The addition 
of a team walk in Princeton further 
emphasized the importance of 
physical activity in maintaining 
a healthy heart. Through these 
events, Zensar continues to foster 
heart-healthy habits among its 
employees and beyond.
Occupational health and safety
We are dedicated to continually 
improving our health and safety 
practices for employees/workers 
(permanent and contractual), 
service providers, and visitors. Our 
Environment, Health, Safety and 
Energy (EHSEn) policy and objectives  
are defined at an organisational 
level, and we review them annually 
or on a need basis to ensure they 
are compatible with the strategic 
direction of the organisation.
Creating a culture of safety
We believe that health and safety 
should be integrated into our 
business planning, decision-making, 
and management practices. We 
regularly undertake health awareness 
initiatives, and all employees have 
access to a special e-learning module 
on health and safety.
Our organisation-level objectives 
are translated into function/
Health and safety training
We regularly conduct health and 
safety training for our employees 
through internal and external domain 
experts. This ensures that our 
employees are well-equipped with 
the knowledge and skills necessary to 
maintain a safe and healthy workplace.
delivery-level objectives and are 
monitored and measured based 
on performance indicators that 
carry targets. We have objective 
achievement plans that include 
roles and responsibilities of the 
employees against each action 
identified to achieve the objective, 
and we measure actuals against 
these targets on a periodic basis.
Mitigating workplace injury
At Zensar, we recognize the 
importance of creating a healthy and 
safe workplace for all our employees. 
We understand that long hours of 
continuous sitting at the workplace 
or travel to various customer 
locations can lead to various 
health risks such as strain, injury, 
and mental fatigue. To mitigate 
these risks, we have implemented 
various measures to ensure that 
our employees can work in a 
comfortable and safe environment.

meet ergonomic 
requirements

facilities to meet

needs

safety for all employees

Disaster and incident 
management
We conduct half-yearly training on 
disaster and incident management, 
covering fire, natural calamities, 
accident response and first 
aid, environmental emergency, 
chemical spillage, snake and animal 
bites, terrorism, and mob violence. 
Our premises have an emergency 
response plan in place with a 
roadmap and incident reporting 
flowchart at appropriate locations. 
We consider safety during travel 
of utmost importance in our EHS 
practices. We ensure that our 
employees are well-equipped with 
the knowledge and skills necessary 
to handle any emergency or 
disaster situation, both within and 
outside the workplace.
Smarter HR processes  
Zensar recognises the value 
of digitisation in streamlining 
HR processes. Our core HCM 
(human capital management) 
systems serve as the foundation 
for driving all essential HR 
processes digitally. While highly 
integrated and seamless tech 
platforms such as SuccessFactors, 
Workday, and Oracle lead this 
effort, we understand that 
standalone solutions for specific 
HR processes integrated well with 
the HCM systems generate higher 
satisfaction rates.
Simplifying processes for 
employees
Digital employee self-service 
instruments, such as leave booking 
and individual information access, 
make assignments more available 
for representatives. 
Shorter meetings
We value time, and hence, we 
have made it a default setting 
in Microsoft Outlook to have 
shorter meetings of 25/50 minutes 
instead of the traditional one-
hour meetings. By having shorter 
meetings, we ensure that our 
employees have enough time to 
focus on their work while also 
encouraging them to maintain a 
healthy work-life balance.
Innovative HR process 
solutions
Employee experience platforms, 
such as ServiceNow and Microsoft 
Viva, manage hybrid work, 
employee onboarding, and custom 
career and development tracks 
together as a set of integrated 
process flows. Talent intelligence 
platforms help companies with 
sourcing, internal talent matching, 
intelligent succession management, 
and data-driven solutions for 
assessment, job design, and skills 
analysis. We have pilot-launched 
Amber, a listening bot that captures 
the real-time pulse of employees 
and helps us identify areas of 
improvement to reduce attrition. 
Democratizing leadership and 
rewards
Technology is uplifting traditionally 
manual processes like coaching and 
leadership to democratize them 
for the entire organisation. It is also 
assisting in managing rewards and 
recognition programs of companies 
to introduce gamification elements 
and make rewarding easy and more 
engaging for both HR teams and 
employees.

Key performance 
indicators for FY23
At Zensar, we are excited about what is next. Thus, we are always exploring 
new avenues of growth and identifying potential collaborators, ranging 
from small-scale startups to industry giants. For this, we conduct a 
comprehensive analysis of market demand and technological advancements 
in various domains. Our partnerships are focused on emerging technologies 
such as cloud computing, deep learning, augmented reality, AI engineering,

As technology continues to evolve 
at an unprecedented pace, we 
remain at the forefront of this 
revolution, particularly with the 
advent of foundational models such 
as ChatGPT. The advanced research 
that we conduct in Zenlabs has 
also aided in sharpening our novel 
capabilities.  
Over the years, we have strived to 
position ourselves as a trailblazer 
in experience-led, domain-driven, 
cloud-native transformation 
partnerships and sought to forge 
strong alliances with hyperscalers. To 
achieve this, we remain focused on 
protecting our intellectual property. 
Additionally, we are investing in 
a revamped technical learning 
academy, experiential learning 
platforms, and contextual learning 
programs for our key clients.

Brand refresh 
We initiated a brand revitalisation campaign the preceding year, which has helped to develop a robust brand identity, 
articulate our brand narrative, and cultivate consumer loyalty. Our refreshed brand story effectively communicates our 
core values and the underlying motives that drive us. 
Rolling out our new brand identity on social media
Experiencing #ANewZensar via a central hub
Objective 
To launch the rebranded 
Zensar on social media 
platforms by interacting with 
audiences through compelling 
communication that matches the 
brand’s new and exciting visual 
style and voice.
Objective 
To ensure all employees have 
a consistent and seamless 
experience of #ANewZensar via 
the Brand Center, a one-stop 
solution for all things brand. 
Strategy 
The communication strategy followed a logical sequence: introducing the 
new brand, expressing the meaning of Think velocity — our go-to-market 
proposition — to businesses and prospective employees, and articulating 
our services and solutions using the concept of velocity. To further establish 
the new brand in the minds of our clients, we launched the Enterprise 
Velocity campaign, where we shared the results of a Zensar survey in which 
300 global C-suite business leaders from diverse industries responded to 
questions concerning velocity in the business context. We also launched 
a sub-campaign, #ArtInVelocity, where our employees demonstrated their 
understanding of velocity through art. 
Strategy 
Our Brand Center, a central repository for all Zensar assets, helped us 
provide our people with a uniform  understanding of the revamped Zensar 
brand. We spoke with Microsoft to explore how we could use Microsoft 
Viva to set up the Brand Center. Due to its familiarity, intuitiveness, and 
accessibility to current users, Viva Connections was the best option, 
taking into consideration the use of the Microsoft ecosystem and the wide 
adoption of MS Teams within the organisation. The decision to embrace 
Microsoft Viva was strengthened further by the integration of existing 
Microsoft assets and the capability to create custom HTML code.
Approach
We launched campaigns on all 
four social media channels but 
focused primarily on LinkedIn, 
as we are a B2B company, and 
Instagram, since it is extremely 
popular among our prospective 
employees, making it our major 
channel for employer branding.
Approach
For a long time, brand assets 
were shared manually via 
e-mail. Numerous versions with 
multiple stakeholders meant 
countless iterations, which led to 
inconsistencies and significant 
problems. With Viva Connections, 
we created a Brand Center that 
is completely centralized, and all 
brand assets are accessible to our 
workforce of 10,500+ individuals. 
The Brand Center is a dynamic 
entity that serves as a space 
for our people to interact with 
the brand via typefaces, logos, 
letterheads, templates, blogs, 
videos, news, and more. Sharing 
information is now effortless, 
immersive, and engaging.

Innovation strategy
Our innovation strategy is rooted in 
three key elements: observe, invest, 
and collaborate.
Client success aligned - innovation and IP framework
In the observe category, we closely 
track emerging technologies 
and industry trends. This helps 
us stay ahead of the curve and 
make informed decisions about 
incorporating new technologies into 
our offerings. Our team worked on 
several collaborative projects and 
jointly published thought leadership 
papers on quantum computing and 
blockchain tokenisation.
In the invest category, we 
strategically invest in sectors with 
long-term growth potential. This 
year, we made investments in the 
geographic information system 
(GIS) and artificial intelligence (AI) 
spaces. Our prudent investments 
have already started yielding positive 
results. We continue to invest in 
the blockchain and deep learning 
domains, as these align with our 
long-term vision for growth. 
Our collaborate category is focused 
on fostering collaboration, both 
within our Company and with 
external partners. This year, we 
accomplished a record number 
of co-innovation projects with 
our clients, and we are exploring 
collaboration opportunities with 
prominent academic institutions 
to remain apprised of the latest 
research and technological 
advancements.

Intellectual property
Zensar prioritises intellectual 
property advancements through 
collaborative partnerships with 
esteemed clients and stakeholders. 
It helps develop innovative solutions 
that contribute to the creation of 
valuable intellectual property assets 
for the Company. 
We empower our employees with 
advanced training on emerging 
technologies, actively engage in co-
innovation projects, and champion 
an open model of engagement. 
We take necessary measures 
to safeguard our proprietary 
technology and systems by filing 
appropriate patents.
The following patents were filed 
during the fiscal year:
Client-focused innovation in service offerings
At Zensar, we collaborate closely with clients to deliver effective digital 
solutions. We offer an overview of the problem and possible solutions and 
work with clients to identify the best approach. Through continuous iteration 
(via proof of principle, proof of viability, proof of concept, etc.) and regular 
ideation sessions, our teams identify technology solutions that address 
emerging business needs in specific industry verticals.
Empowering clients with new service offerings
This year, we made considerable progress in several areas and 
demonstrated the same to our clients. Some of these are:
GIS and AI
AIOps
We have created a solution 
that combines geographic 
information systems (GIS) and 
artificial intelligence (AI). Using 
this, businesses can identify 
potential excavation hazards, 
such as gas pipelines or electrical 
wires, and take necessary 
precautions to prevent accidents.
The software stability predictor in 
our AIOps (artificial intelligence 
for IT operations) solution 
assists enterprises in estimating 
potential defects. By employing 
machine learning algorithms, 
it can identify patterns and 
anomalies in data to predict 
probable failures, helping 
businesses take proactive steps 
to minimize downtime and 
optimize their IT operations.
Syndata using AIGAN
Our innovative solution Syndata 
uses AI-generated data to provide 
synthetic data that is comparable 
to actual data. This is especially 
useful in situations where the 
privacy of the original data needs 
to be preserved. Syndata creates 
synthetic data that is statistically 
similar to the real data using 
an AI technology called AIGAN 
(Adversarial Input Generator).
Diverse service lines portfolio
Our five service lines include Advanced Engineering Services, Experience 
Services, Data Engineering and Analytics, Application Services, and 
Foundation Services. We offer a variety of services under each of these 
service categories.
Refer page 05 of the report 
for a detailed overview of our 
service offerings

We have directed our effort and resources to the advancement of our Velocity StackTM to develop a 
comprehensive solution, full-stack, which consists of customizable frameworks encompassing forward-thinking 
reference architectures, sophisticated automation technologies, versatile platforms, and domain-specific 
solutions. It allows global businesses to add value, expedite time-to-market, enhance agility, and optimize

We were approached by a global 
digital payment technology 
platform looking to revamp its brand 
experience across its global sites. 
Using Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) 
and cloud-based technology, we 
designed and implemented a DXP 
solution that helps the marketing 
team reuse components to build 
campaigns, microsites, and mobile 
applications. It created omnichannel 
experiences and offered self-service 
options to users. The solution 
involved creating a platform with 
106 reusable components and a 
customized low-code solution that 
can host 400+ sites from different 
brands and geographies. With our 
expertise, the client achieved a top-
notch digital brand experience that 
helped it scale its business.
A Dutch design company making 
parental products faced challenges 
pertaining to daily operational 
support, content publishing, and 
translation errors. Zensar stepped in 
and developed multilingual content 
templates for the client, supporting 
more than 40 languages, along with 
an interactive product configurator. 
This innovative solution contributed 
to a 20% reduction in order lead 
time, assisting the client in offering 
a better experience to its users. 
Zensar's expertise helped the client 
streamline its operations and boost 
client satisfaction.
An Australian chain of supermarkets 
faced several challenges in sales and 
decision-making, including unreliable 
sales forecasts, changing consumer 
behavior, missing data, and 
processing limitations. We developed 
a solution to create a demand 
data pipeline and an MDM solution 
that would facilitate markdown 
optimisation with MLOps. The 
solution involved the use of advanced 
analytics techniques to improve 
forecast accuracy and optimize 
markdowns. This helped achieve 
over 20% improvement in forecast 
accuracy with 60% estimated cost 
savings. The data streaming was 
recorded at 99% accuracy.

ultimately driving new monetisation 
opportunities across premium 
segments. The solution helped 
record USD 5 million+ in NFT since 
its launch, achieving participation of 
3,000+ bidders with total trades of 
1,300+ that drove royalty proceeds. 
A US-based medical services 
provider faced challenges related 
to conventional security measures,

and incorporate built-in quality 
assurance to prevent accidents. 
Zensar created a solution that involved 
hyperautomation, computer vision, 
and GIS to automate the retrieval and 
pre-processing of maps. The solution 
also included object detection and 
segmentation within individual maps, 
as well as the connection of maps 
with geospatial data and descriptive 
metadata. The result was a mobile app 
called “Safe Dig Pack” that enabled 
safe excavation through automation, 
helping reduce operational costs by 
~USD 1 million per year and reducing 
the turnaround time to less than 30 
minutes from 8 hours. The tool helped 
achieve 41/42 accurate results.

ACs and lights. Standby ACs have 
been installed in hub rooms, and 
central ACs are switched off at 
night. Offshore development 
centres (ODCs) have separate 
ACs, and heating, ventilation, and 
air-conditioning systems (HVAC) 
are serviced regularly to ensure 
efficiency. Portable ACs and fans 
are also provided for areas where 
less than ten employees work.
Occupancy sensors and 
emergency lighting
We have installed occupancy 
sensors in parking areas, 
washrooms, and other areas to 
control energy wastage. The 
emergency lights circuit has 
also been modified to switch on 
necessary lights only during the day 
and night.
Reducing energy consumption
Monitoring and control of emissions
We strive to minimize our overall energy usage and optimize energy utilisation across the organisation with various 
initiatives. With the resumption of office, we anticipated that energy consumption would increase. However, our 
per-seat energy consumption has decreased from 983 units per seat to 882 units per seat, and we have successfully 
achieved energy savings of 10.26% per seat, a remarkable feat that bears testimony to our dedicated efforts. In 
addition, we are committed to reducing our energy consumption by 1% every year through the implementation of 
projects that augur energy efficiency. 
In line with our commitment to promoting energy conservation, we have implemented several strategic initiatives 
aimed at managing our energy consumption. 
At our Pune facility, we monitor 
emissions from our backup diesel 
generators (DGs) for sulfur oxide 
(SOx), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and 
particulate matter (PM).  We use low-
sulfur diesel to reduce the amount 
of sulfur from emissions, which has 
fewer health risks and is better for the 
environment. Our DG chimney height 
IT optimisation
With the use of more than 90% 
of laptops at the workplace, 
uninterruptible power supply 
(UPS) to workstations has 
reduced drastically. By removing 
the unnecessary load, we have 
optimized the power consumed 
by laptops and desktops. Besides, 
all desktop monitors are switched 
off to save power.
Data center energy 
conservation
We focus on data center energy 
conservation by utilizing 
virtualisation technologies, 
implementing hot and cold aisle 
containment, and upgrading to 
eco-friendly and energy-efficient 
hardware. We have deployed power 
management policies for end-user 
devices and encourage the use of 
energy-efficient hardware among 
our employees. We also recycle 
e-waste to reduce harmful chemicals 
in the environment and recover 
valuable resources. Our efforts have 
resulted in an average of 10% energy 
savings compared to FY22.
Enhancing energy 
efficiency
We recognize the urgent need 
to arrest climate change and are 
actively working toward reducing 
our greenhouse gas emissions. 
Our objective for Scope 1 and 2 
emission reduction is to attain net 
zero GHGs by the end of FY40. 
We are also currently observing 
emission levels for categories 6 
(business travel) and 7 (employee 
commuting) as part of our

Improving indoor and  
outdoor air quality
We have undertaken a scientific 
approach to improve our indoor 
air quality. Our green building 
policy entails the use of low Volatile 
Organic Compound (VOC) material, 
an air filtration system, and an 
indoor plantation program. We also 
run an outdoor plantation program 
that involves the planting of trees 
and other vegetation that act as 
natural air filters.
Ensuring water 
conservation
We are dedicated to reducing 
our water footprint and adopting 
sustainable water management 
practices. Our unwavering 
commitment to responsible water 
usage drives us to plan and manage 
our water resources sustainably 
while undertaking diverse initiatives 
for minimizing water consumption 
and conserving this precious 
resource. We firmly believe that 
our focused efforts will not only 
enable us to achieve our long-term 
environmental objectives but also 
have a transformative impact on 
society at large.
Groundwater recharge pits
Our groundwater recharge pits 
play a vital role in maintaining the 
groundwater table at our Pune 
campus. These pits are connected 
to stormwater drains that help 
recharge the groundwater level, and 
are cleaned at regular intervals to 
maintain optimum water quality.  
Sensor-based taps and 
irrigation systems
We have installed sensor-based 
taps, waterless urinals, drip 
irrigations, and sprinkler systems, 
among other initiatives, to 
minimize water consumption. The 
potable and non-potable water 
consumption is monitored through 
the municipal water meters on 
our campus and leased premises. 
We also monitor potable water 
consumption in some of our leased 
premises through the number of 
water bottles purchased.
Air-cooled technology for 
water conservation
Our Pune campus is located in an 
area that has been identified as a 
water-risk region. As a result, we 
have adopted air-cooled technology 
for air conditioning systems in 
place of water-cooled technology. 
It has resulted in reduced water 
consumption and minimized our 
reliance on municipal water.
Nurturing a greener 
tomorrow
In commemoration of the National 
Environment Month in June 2022, 
we united with the Tomorrow 
Trust to spread environmental 
consciousness among students 
at a primary school. This project 
not only fostered creativity and 
resourcefulness among the 
students but also instilled a deep 
respect for the environment and the 
importance of sustainability in their 
young minds.
World Nature Conservation Day 
and World Environment Day are 
also commemorated through the 
implementation of tree plantation 
drives as a means of demonstrating 
our commitment to preserving 
and protecting the natural world. 
Through the act of planting trees, 
we are actively contributing to 
the restoration of ecosystems, 
enhancing biodiversity, and 
fostering a sustainable future for 
generations to come.
Maintaining a rich and 
diverse green cover
Our campus is home to over 590 
different floral species and 2,350 
types of shrubs, covering 48% of 
our total area. We water the plants 
and use manure, organic fertilizers, 
and pesticides to ensure their 
healthy growth. Before pruning the 
bushes, we make sure to check 
for nests of birds like the Indian 
Robin or Red-Vented Bulbul. The 
leaves and litter are also collected 
and converted into manure, using 
our vermicompost plant. It is used 
for gardening purposes within our 
premises. During summers, we 
provide water for birds and host 
fodder plant species for butterflies.
Upgraded STP for efficient 
wastewater recycling
We have upgraded our sewage 
treatment plant (STP) to improve its 
capacity for recycling wastewater, 
which is essential for avoiding its 
negative impact on the environment 
and human health. Our STP 
eliminates impurities from the water 
before reusing it within our premises. 
It has also improved the efficiency of 
the STP as it recycles 80%-90% of the 
water consumed daily.
At the moment, we are water positive 
as the amount of water extracted 
is less than the water restored. Our 
estimates show that our total yearly 
water requirement is 22,989 KL, 
whereas our overall groundwater 
replenishment stands at 30,161 KL. 
We have been replenishing the 
groundwater table with an average of 
64.01 lakh liters of rainwater annually, 
which plays an important role in 
maintaining the ecological balance.

Dedicated  
conservation areas 
We have reserved a dedicated area 
for kitchen gardens and medicinal 
plants. Useful information about 
these plants is shared with visitors 
as well as employees. Small patches 
along corridors and intermittent 
open spaces are also converted into 
flower beds to attract butterflies. 
Collaboration spaces have been 
developed in the most prominent 
areas and are often used for 
informal meetings, discussions, and 
as stress-reliever spots.
Development of a biodiversity park
Zensar's team has collaborated with the Pune Municipal 
Corporation to develop a dedicated biodiversity park. The team is 
working with the Forest Department to create a park near Pune in 
FY24. Biodiversity surveys of the park are also being carried out by 
third-party organisations. 
Preservation of critical 
wildlife habitats and 
promotion of native plants
We take a proactive approach 
to protect and conserve critical 
wildlife habitats within our 
premises. Nesting sites of certain 
species are identified, and native 
plants are left undisturbed to 
preserve their natural habitat. We 
promote the use of native trees and 
vegetation that are easily adaptable 
to local conditions and require low 
maintenance. These plants also 
act as a natural barrier to floods, 
prevent droughts, and attract 
insects useful for maintaining local 
biodiversity.  
Wetlands are also preserved with 
paver blocks to conserve water 
and avoid unnecessary drainage 
of water. The Company also uses 
environment-friendly products 
and methods for pest control and 
employs organic fertilizers that 
have minimal residual effects. The 
green waste is collected, shredded, 
and decomposed through 
vermicomposting pits and used as 
manure.
Community outreach program 
to preserve biodiversity
We encourage our employees to 
participate in volunteering activities 
such as sapling plantation and 
compost-making. We also took the 
initiative of planting trees within 
the Koyna Sanctuary. Our efforts 
have been focused on nurturing 
the growth of native species, which 
not only complement the existing 
ecosystem but also contribute to 
the sustenance of the sanctuary's 
natural balance.
We have taken on the responsibility 
of participating in the ‘Adopt a 
Highway’ program initiated by 
the North Carolina Department of 
Transportation. The core objective 
of this program is to safeguard 
and conserve the natural beauty 
and ecological balance of the 
region. Over the course of the next 
four years, we have pledged to 
diligently maintain and ensure the 
immaculate cleanliness of a 1.7-mile 
stretch highway.
Judicious management 
and reduction of waste 
We have adopted a comprehensive 
waste management policy that 
revolves around the 3-R philosophy 
of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Our 
objective is to mitigate the adverse 
effects of our business on the 
environment while simultaneously 
fostering a culture of consciousness 
and education among our 
colleagues. By adhering to this 
approach, we aspire to minimize our 
ecological footprint and promote 
sustainability, thereby contributing 
to the larger goal of preserving our 
planet for future generations.
Segregating and managing 
hazardous waste
At Zensar, we understand the 
importance of handling hazardous 
waste responsibly. To prevent its 
impact on the natural environment, 
personnel, and the workplace, we 
collect, segregate, store, treat, 
and dispose of all hazardous waste 
in accordance with our waste 
management policy through an 
authorized recycler.
Our comprehensive waste 
management process involves the 
segregation of waste based on 
type, identification of authorized 
recyclers, transfer of reusable waste 
to facilities, and disposal of waste 
Effective management of 
non-hazardous waste
In addition to hazardous waste, 
we recognize the importance 
of managing non-hazardous 
waste effectively. All solid waste, 
including municipal waste, is 
segregated into dry and wet waste. 
Dry waste is sent to authorized 
recyclers, while wet waste is used 
to generate biogas on-site. Our 
green waste is collected, shredded, 
and decomposed through 
vermicomposting pits.
Circular economy
We are committed to incorporating 
circular economy practices within our 
operations. For instance, during the 
hybrid work mode, we reused laptop 
cartons for laptop packaging and 
shipping, and all courier documents 
are shared digitally to reduce 
paper usage. We also reuse usable 
infrastructure, such as furniture and 
fixtures, electrical consumables, 
chairs, and light fittings.

We have made significant strides toward reducing our carbon footprint, and 
our initiatives demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and reducing our 
environmental impact.
Real-time energy 
management system for 
control and optimisation
All our facilities are integrated with 
a building management system  
(BMS) that provides centralized 
information on various systems 
such as energy meters, fire alarms, 
CCTV, air conditioning, UPS, 
temperature and relative humidity 
sensors, and hydrogen sensors to 
detect hydrogen gas leaks from 
batteries. With just a single click, 
we can monitor and control these 
systems, ensuring they operate at 
peak efficiency.
Building secure and 
resilient workplaces
As a responsible company, we 
place high value on the safety and 
accessibility of our workspaces. 
We also take a holistic approach 
to protect our human and 
infrastructure assets, information 
and network resources, and 
computer systems. Our data 
centres in Pune and Hyderabad 
play a crucial role in supporting our 
security infrastructure framework.
We prioritize the safety and 
well-being of our employees 
and stakeholders. Our prudent 
investments today equip our 
facilities with all the necessary 
safety measures. We also have extra 
precautions and safety action points 
in place to ensure the well-being of 
our employees. 
premises via CCTVs and track the 
authorized movement of employees 
and visitors within the building 
premises, including entry/exit points 
and emergency exits. 
Our offshore development centres 
(ODCs) have state-of-the-art safety 
and security measures. We have 
access-controlled entry, a fire alarm 
system, public address system, 
fire-fighting system, CCTV, and 
occupancy sensors that control 
lighting, all designed to ensure our 
employees' protection.
Building green 
workspaces for a 
better tomorrow
At Zensar, we hold ourselves 
accountable for our impact 
on the environment and are 
dedicated to fostering sustainable 
practices across our campuses. 
Through advanced technology 
and innovative solutions, we 
have implemented several green 
initiatives to ensure energy 
efficiency and sustainability. Our 
offices have received IGBC Green 
Interiors Platinum certification and 
are designed to optimize energy 
consumption while maintaining an 
employee-friendly environment. We 
have also implemented a real-time 
energy management system to 
control and optimize energy usage 
and ensure that our data centres 
maintain precise cooling and 
humidity requirements. 
Transport
Travel
Office infrastructure
We have taken a 
significant step 
toward reducing our 
carbon footprint by 
ensuring that 60% of 
our fleet is managed 
by CNG cabs. 
These cabs emit 
the least amount of 
greenhouse gases 
compared to any 
other fuel, making 
them an ideal choice 
for responsible 
transportation.
We have taken 
proactive measures 
to reduce business-
related journeys 
by implementing 
stringent controls 
on both domestic 
and international air 
travel. As a result, 
all project meetings, 
client interactions, 
audits, and other 
such events are now 
conducted online, 
and travel requests 
are approved only 
when essential.
As part of our 
mission to reduce 
our carbon footprint, 
we have leased 
multiple premises 
that generate a 
substantial portion of 
renewable energy for 
our organisation.
20% of the energy required 
for our Pune campus is 
generated through an on-site 
rooftop solar plant.
To further optimize energy 
consumption, we have implemented 
a real-time energy management 
system that provides us with inputs 
to identify and control energy 
wastage by taking corrective 
actions. We also ensure that our 
data centres maintain precise 
cooling and humidity requirements 
to prevent high cooling and energy 
consumption.

Energy efficient designs in our infrastructure
We have implemented various measures to minimize energy wastage. For 
example, all our existing and new offices have 100% LED lighting with lighting 
control through motion and daylight sensors, which ensures that work 
areas that are not regularly occupied do not consume unnecessary energy. 
Moreover, our heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems (HVAC) have 
been programmed to maintain a temperature of 24°C, and the temperature 
regulating function of indoor units has been disabled to prevent users from 
lowering the temperature setting.
Customized workspaces 
In our new facilities, we have taken 
the next step in modernizing our 
infrastructure to meet the dynamic 
needs of our customers. We 
have added dedicated offshore 
development centres (ODCs) to 
provide a focused and collaborative 
environment for our teams working 
on complex projects. Additionally, 
we have physically separated 
network rooms to ensure data 
security and privacy.
To achieve these enhancements, 
we added partitions between the 
open workstation areas that were 
already designed in blocks, with 
separate lighting controls and air 
conditioning. This has enabled us 
to customize workspaces based 
on the specific requirements of 
each project, resulting in faster 
turnaround times and the ability to 
meet client expectations.
Powering operations 
with predictive analysis 
and automation 
We have enhanced our usage of 
Power BI for predictive analysis, 
helping us gain deeper insights 
into various aspects of our 
operations. We have also been 
extensively using Power Automate 
for automation purposes, enabling 
us to streamline our workflows 
and increase efficiency.
In addition to these efforts, we 
have been collaborating with 
clients in the BFSI and Retail 
sectors to offer services in AI 
and supply chain automation, 
understanding consumer 
behavior, and predictive analysis. 
These collaborations have  
helped us develop solutions 
tailored to our clients' specific 
needs and have enabled us to 
provide them with a competitive 
advantage in the market.
Infrastructure transformation initiative
Zensar faced a significant challenge in the form of outdated hardware 
that was energy-inefficient and costly to maintain. We also had a mix of 
leased and owned offices with varying levels of infrastructure quality, 
which led to an inconsistent employee experience across locations. 
To address these challenges, Zensar embarked on a multi-faceted 
infrastructure transformation initiative.
Zensar's infrastructure transformation initiative was multi-pronged and 
included the following:
Challenge
Solution
Replacing outdated 
hardware
We replaced our outdated 
hardware with energy-
efficient, state-of-the-
art equipment, ranging 
from end-user laptops 
to on-premises data 
center networks and 
server infrastructure. This 
move helped us improve 
energy efficiency, reduce 
maintenance costs, and 
enhance overall performance.
Repurposing furniture and fixtures
To further enhance efficiency, we decided to reuse the furniture 
and fixtures from the surrendered facilities to refurbish and improve 
the facilities at our Pune campus. As a result, we can increase floor 
efficiency by 20%, which means we can accommodate 20% more seats 
without sacrificing the standard seating requirements.
Surrendering 
leased offices
We decided to surrender a 
few of our leased offices of 
varying quality to consolidate 
operations at major locations 
with higher seating capacity 
and at our owned campus. 
This move enabled us to 
create a consistent employee 
experience across locations 
and reduce operational 
expenses.
Focus on building client-
centric workspaces
We have established offshore 
development centres and 
implemented innovative security 
measures that have bolstered our 
infrastructure to safeguard data 
privacy and foster a collaborative 
work environment for our teams. 
We have also seamlessly transitioned 
to cloud-based systems, reducing 
reliance on traditional on-premises 
infrastructure and expanding our 
technological horizons by adopting 
emerging innovations such as 
predictive analysis and automation 
to optimize efficiency. Our 
unwavering dedication to proactively 
securing sensitive information and 
delivering superlative services has 
positioned us as one of the leading 
players in the industry.
Certified for business continuity 
management system
ISO 22301:2019 
The certification of the business 
continuity management system 
(BCMS) in the previous year 
has yielded multiple benefits, 
including forming a centralized 
core team and steering 
committee responsible for 
implementing stringent processes 
and practices. Moreover, an 
organisation-wide business 
continuity testing exercise was 
carried out with the participation 
of several delivery, support, and 
end-user teams, giving a real-time 
understanding of the response 
to a potential disruption scenario 
affecting an entire location. 
The BCMS implementation also 
resulted in an enhanced Business 
Impact Analysis methodology, 
which utilises a quantitative rating 
mechanism to identify recovery 
time objectives and recovery 
point objectives and covers all 
internal and external impact 
parameters.
Innovation centres

To enhance our operations and 
ensure maximum efficiency, 
we have undertaken several 
initiatives after extensive research 
on current and projected 
business operation trends. From 
relinquishing some offices to 
building our first satellite office 
in Kolkata, we are moving in the 
right direction to strengthen 
our presence across locations. 
Recently, we opened another 
satellite office in Bengaluru.  
The hybrid model introduced 
post-pandemic allows our 
employees to choose the most 
convenient work location, saving 
their travel time. In addition, our 
move to the cloud platforms 
has reduced our on-premises 
infrastructure footprint.

Committed to data privacy
We have enhanced our 
cybersecurity architecture during 
the year by adopting multi-factor 
authentication, Crowdstrike, 
Cloud Access Security Broker, 
Data Loss Prevention, and Mobile 
Device Management solutions. 
These measures have helped 
us protect our operations from 
potential threats and ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of our data.
At the heart of our operations 
and services lies a steadfast 
commitment to data privacy. To this 
end, we take a proactive approach, 
conducting impact assessments 
and corrective actions prior to the 
release of any new or redefined 
processes. In addition, we mandate 
that all employees undergo 
annual training on data privacy 
and cybersecurity, reflecting our 
deep-rooted belief in safeguarding 
sensitive information. 
Strategic global 
delivery centres
Our delivery centres are 
strategically located across key 
regions, including the US, India, the 
UK, and South Africa, all equipped 
with cutting-edge hardware and 
software infrastructure, high-speed 
communication networks, and 
fortified security protocols. Our 
offshore development centres 
(ODCs) function as an extension 
of our clients' offices, providing 
an equivalent level of network, 
architecture, and security. 
Our commitment to information 
security at Zensar is all-
encompassing. We apply it to every 
aspect of our business, including 
IT and business process-related 
consulting, solutions, services, 
data centres, infrastructure, 
products, and platforms, along with 
all associated support functions, 
carried out in all our locations in 
India, the United States (including 
Dallas and Westborough), 
Singapore, and the United Kingdom 
(including London and Norwich).
We adhere to the ISO 27001 
security framework and guidelines, 
ensuring that we maintain the 
highest levels of security and 
protection for our clients' sensitive 
data. Our corporate security policy 
covers personnel security, physical 
and environmental security, 
infrastructure security and systems, 
and data security, ensuring that we 
always comply with international 
security standards.
We ensure that our ODCs offer 
unparalleled safety, security, 
and sustainability, creating an 
environment where our employees 
can work peacefully while delivering 
high-quality services to our clients. 
Our offshore delivery facilities are 
connected to our ODCs based 
on the client's infrastructure and 
security software deployed. This 
allows us to offer seamless service 
to our clients, regardless of their 
location or IT infrastructure.
We employ over 10,500 employees globally, including offices in Pune, Hyderabad, and 
Bengaluru. During the pandemic, Zensar, like many other businesses, faced the challenge 
of managing office spaces while guaranteeing employee safety and well-being.
Innovative approach for 
managing office space
Innovative infrastructure for remote working
Zensar's team consulted with project and support departments to identify the number of 
colleagues from each project who would be working from office. Based on the information 
gathered, the Technical Infrastructure Management team made necessary infrastructure and 
configuration changes, including setting up new VLANs and configuring the network to enable 
end-users to work from anywhere in the office. The team ensured that basic infrastructure was 
in place before opening the Hot ODCs and made necessary additional arrangements.
Seating was restricted to projects at Hot ODCs, with all other areas closed for operations. Strict 
control over air conditioning operations was implemented to manage energy consumption 
effectively. As the count of employees coming to the office increased, more Hot ODCs were 
opened to accommodate everyone.
Successful initiative that delivered results
Creating a safe working environment 
Zensar’s Hot ODC (offshore development 
center) initiative’s primary objective was 
to optimize office space utilisation while 
addressing the concerns of employees who 
worked in hybrid mode. We also aimed to 
reduce energy consumption and maintain 
a safe and healthy working environment for 
those who work from the office.
By implementing a flexible, efficient, and 
safe working environment, we were able 
to meet the needs of our employees while 
continuing to deliver quality services to our 
clients. We plan to continue the Hot ODC 
concept, demonstrating our commitment 
to meeting the evolving needs of our 
employees and the market.

Shivkanya Patole
Kajal Waghari
Vaishanvi Rathod
Her story is one of perseverance 
and determination. After losing 
her husband, she was left without 
any means of support. However, 
with the help of the government's 
Mahila Sakshamikaran scheme, 
she was able to find a way 
forward.
Now, Shivkanya is on a mission 
to educate people about this life-
changing program. She knows  
first-hand the power it has to 
transform the lives of women 
who have lost their partners. She 
is committed to ensuring this 
scheme is accessible to every 
woman who can profit from it.
She was left alone to care for her 
two children when her drug-addict 
husband abandoned her. She had 
to beg on the streets for a year to 
provide for her children after losing 
her job as a babysitter due to the 
pandemic. She accepted any job 
that came her way because she was 
determined to provide her kids with 
the best education possible. 
However, she built a business by 
selling covers for electrical appliances 
and basic items like sofas and pillows. 
She now earns enough to cover her 
children's schooling and basic needs. 
Her story is a testament to the human 
spirit and its ability to overcome even 
the toughest of challenges.
She is a bright and enthusiastic 
young girl who could not enroll in 
any school as all seats were filled. 
Her family could not afford the 
high admission fees demanded 
by private or semi-private 
schools. Fortunately, through our 
community development project 
intervention, she could secure 
admission by paying a nominal fee.
Vaishanvi could finally pursue her 
dreams and work toward a better 
future. Her story proves the power 
of community and its potential 
impact on the lives of individuals. 
Her tale serves as an inspiration to 
those facing similar challenges in 
their pursuit of education.
At Zensar, we have launched 
multiple community development 
endeavors. One of which is assisting 
two communities in Pune to access 
the government health schemes and 
public distribution system (PDS). Our 
efforts have sought to empower and 
uplift underserved communities by 
ensuring they can avail themselves  
of various government initiatives 
designed to improve public health 
and alleviate poverty. 
We have also collaborated with the 
National Health Mission and the 
Public Health Department of the 
Government of Maharashtra to build 
quality healthcare infrastructure in 
rural and semi-urban Maharashtra. 
We have created and installed 
state-of-the-art fever clinics using 
porta cabins to achieve this. These 
fever clinics provide primary 
medical care and are staffed with 
operators, doctors, and qualified 
nurses. By leveraging our resources 
and expertise, we are positively 
impacting the lives of rural residents 
in Maharashtra.
Along with the Pune Municipal 
Corporation, we have also worked to 
preserve the Udaan Biodiversity Park. 
Through our collaboration, we have 
been able to protect a vital natural 
resource that fosters ecological 
diversity and serves as a haven for a 
variety of flora and fauna.

planning and executing client 
feedback surveys. The team's 
core mandate involves analyzing 
and reporting the survey results, 
setting and revising targets, and 
implementing survey process 
automation.
Upon completing the survey, 
the Quality team at Zensar takes 
charge of detailed action planning 
and execution. This process is 
rigorously tracked through periodic 
progress reviews with the delivery 
leaders, ensuring that every detail 
of client feedback is considered 
and addressed. We strive for 
complete client satisfaction and 
are committed to continuously 
enhancing our services to achieve 
this goal.
Our stringent information 
security management systems 
(ISMS), accredited under 
ISO 27001, demonstrate that 
Zensar prioritises securing the 
confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of sensitive client 
information. At Zensar, we take 
every precaution to safeguard 
our clients’ data by requiring all 
employees to attend mandatory 
awareness training on important 
aspects of IT security. As a 
testament to our security 
practices, we recorded no 
complaints during the fiscal year 
with regard to material impact on 
client privacy or data loss.
We recognize the importance of 
business-enabling functions as 
crucial pillars for our delivery teams. 
These functions were established 
to ensure that the critical services 
required for facilitating delivery are 
regularly monitored, measured, and 
reported per our internal objectives 
and operating level agreements 
(OLAs). 
We understand that in addition to 
these internal needs, our clients 
may have specific demands and 
requests that must be addressed 
promptly. Our business-enabling 
functions teams can manage and 
efficiently satisfy these additional 
requirements. 
We must have a strong focus on the 
accuracy, quality, and timeliness of 
our business-enabling functions. 
By building a robust and reliable 
infrastructure, we provide seamless 
and efficient operations, delivering 
high-quality service to our clients. 
We ensure these functions are 
continually refined and improved to 
support our delivery teams.
Fostering trust through  
precise reporting
We understand that building and 
retaining the trust of our investors 
depends on regular and accurate 
communication. We arrange press 
conferences and analyst meetings 
frequently to update investors on 
our activities, results, and future 
projections. Investors who could 
not attend in person can still 
access the transcripts of these 
meetings uploaded on our website. 
We provide financial results and 
presentations to shareholders, 
including institutional investors and 
analysts, that help them stay up-to-
date with our financial performance. 
Also, we publish quarterly investor 
updates and official press releases 
with data pertinent to our investors.
We disclose requisite details as 
required by law and circulate them 
widely through newspapers and our 
website. This move is essential as it 
facilitates our investors' awareness 
of any regulatory changes or legal 
obligations that may affect their 
investments.
Upholding ethical standards
At Zensar, we encourage ethical 
business conduct in all our vendor 
interactions. Suppliers must follow 
a Code of Conduct that includes 
abiding by all rules, regulations, and 
guidelines that may be in effect. We 
also sign non-disclosure agreements 
with third parties to safeguard the 
confidentiality of information.
We ensure that we conduct our 
business in a way that is free from 
corruption and bribery. Therefore, 
we expect our partners to be familiar 
with and adhere to all anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery laws in all areas of 
their operations. We do not tolerate 
unethical behavior and have a zero-
tolerance policy in place.
Implementing responsible 
procurement practices
We emphasize sustainability 
and human rights and therefore, 
undertake measures to ensure that 
vendors satisfy screening criteria 
based on quality, hygiene, safety, 
and other aspects. New vendors 
must submit a registration form 
that includes these screening 
requirements. Also, we assess 
vendors' performance annually using 
the same screening criteria.
Our procurement process is built 
on a structured techno-commercial 
evaluation methodology, which 
ensures a transparent and 
competitive process. Along with 
quality, delivery, and pricing, 
compliance with local government 
regulations and labor laws is crucial 
when selecting value chain partners. 
Taking accountability through 
compliance and oversight
In addition to the aforementioned 
communication channels, we have 
an investor grievance policy. This 
policy lays out the framework for 
handling grievances from investors 
and ensures that their concerns are 
resolved promptly and efficiently. 
This helps in ensuring that our 
investors feel heard and valued.
We are committed to maintaining 
fair accounting policies that 
comply with applicable regulations. 
Additionally, we have established 
a strong and independent Board 
composed of competent individuals 
with the expertise and diverse 
experience required to provide 
effective oversight. By doing 
this, we ensure that investors are 
convinced that a Board dedicated 
to acting in their best interests is 
safeguarding their objectives.
Empowering our 
investors
At Zensar, we are cognizant of 
the fact that effective investor 
engagement is necessary for 
building trust, fostering long-term 
relationships, and ultimately creating 
value for our stakeholders. To achieve 
this, we have put in place several 
channels of communication with our 
investors that are transparent and 
investor-centric. 
Empowering our 
vendors
When it comes to providing clients 
with innovative solutions, Zensar is 
aware of the vital role that its value 
chain partners play. The unwavering 
support from our partners helps us 
develop top-notch solutions and 
build enduring client relationships 
worldwide.

Management Discussion and 
Analysis
Economy overview
Global economy
The world witnessed a remarkable recovery from the 
pandemic during FY 2022-23. However, sticky inflation, 
geopolitical tensions and recent financial sector turmoil 
have impacted economic growth. 
Global inflation is moderating and is projected to 
decelerate from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% by end of 2023 
and 4.3% in 2024 as per IMF World Economic Outlook, 
January 2023. This is expected to restore growth oriented 
monetary and fiscal stance in due course, resulting in a 
more normalized global growth and outlook. 
Review of key market economies
United States
Inflation and financial uncertainties resulted in a 
considerable slowdown in the economy, with GDP 
growth rate at 2.1% 1 and unemployment rising above 5% 
in CY 2022. However, there is optimism for a rebound in 
CY 2023 and CY 2024, as inflation settles to 2% by the 
end of CY 2023. 2
Euro area
The Eurozone economy is estimated to have grown 3.5% 
in CY 2022, slowing down from later part of the year. The 
region is expected to grow at 0.8% in CY 2023. 
South Africa
South Africa GDP grew by ~2.5 % during CY 2022, which 
is expected to decline to ~1.4% per annum over the 2023-
25 period. Inflation is expected to fall back within the 
South African Reserve Bank's target range of 3-6% in the 
latter half of CY 2023.
Indian economy
India’s economy demonstrated a fair degree of  resilience 
to global headwinds in FY2022-23, remaining one of the 
fastest-growing major economies in the world, with GDP 
growth of~7.2% 3.
A conducive domestic policy environment and the 
Government’s  focus on structural reforms have kept 
India’s economic activity robust despite the gloomy 
global outlook. A combination of rising disposable 
income, easy availability of credit and  moderate increase 
in interest rates due to the stabilizing inflation trajectory 
will bode well for economic growth going forward.
Industry overview
Global technology industry
The global technology sector continues to witness 
growth driven by digital transformation, advances in cloud 
computing, cyber security, automation, AI, ML and IoT. 
According to Gartner, worldwide IT spending is expected 
to reach USD 4.6 trillion in 2023, marking a 5.5% increase 
from the previous year. While consumer purchasing 
power is being eroded by inflation, resulting in a decrease 
in device spending, enterprise IT spending is anticipated 
to stay robust.4 Businesses are likely to increasingly rely 
on technology to scale automated services, streamline 
supply chains, enhance cyber resilience, and achieve 
sustainability goals.
Indian technology industry
Indian technology industry is estimated to have touched 
USD 245 billion in FY2022-23, an increase of 8.4% from the 
previous financial year.5 India’s IT exports are estimated 
at USD 194 billion, growing at ~9.4% in reported currency 
and ~11.4% in constant currency terms. Domestic IT 
sector has grown ~4.9% y-o-y to reach USD 51 billion. The 
sector is estimated to have added 2.9 lakh people to the 
workforce in FY2022-23.
Accelerated innovation and transformation are being 
supported by various factors, including a rise in hybrid work 
modes, and reduced overhead expenses when compared 
to operations in Tier I cities.  Digitalisation is also gaining 
momentum, with the technology industry seeing a 32-34% 
share of digital revenues in their total revenue mix and an 
estimated 2 million digitally competent professionals. 
India has a robust digital infrastructure for telecom and 
is poised to benefit from the new 5G connections. With

ERM Section
Introduction
To safeguard the organisation’s strategic objectives 
and operational endeavours, Zensar has established 
a robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program 
through which risks are assessed and managed at 
various levels in the organisation with a Top-down and 
Bottom-up approach covering the Enterprise, Business 
units, Geographies and Functions. The ERM program 
covers compliance with applicable government and 
regulatory requirements, and potential risk areas in 
various economic, social, and industrial environments 
Zensar operates in. The ERM framework encompasses 
the risks that the organisation is facing under different 
categories, 
such 
as 
Strategic, 
Operational/Cyber 
security, Financial, Compliance/Regulatory, and ESG, 
with each of these categories having internal/external 
dimensions. Systematic and proactive identification of 
risks and mitigations thereof enable effective and timely 
decision-making.

Key Components of ERM Framework
The Company has adopted an integrated ERM Framework that is being implemented across the organisation by the 
Chief Risk Officer and ERM team.
Approach and  Methodology
Risk governance processes include identification, prioritisation, monitoring and reporting of risks identified at the 
various levels of organisation, business units, functions, and geographies. The Risk Governance model is regularly 
updated based on our interactions with internal and external sources, including experts in the risk advisory domain, to 
ensure that the model aligns with the achievement of strategic objectives of the organisation.

Risk Assessment
The Risks are calculated based on their impacts and 
probabilities. Using a combination of Risk Impact from 
insignificant to catastrophic, and risk probability ranging 
from rare to almost certain, a Risk Score is deduced 
which helps identify if the Risk Rating is Low, Medium, 
or High. The Risk scores are then used to arrive at a Risk 
Prioritisation matrix, which guides the allocation of time 
and resources towards risk mitigation. 
Risk governance
A multi-level governance structure has been established 
by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team, which 
ensures monitoring, reporting and mitigation of risks. 
The ERM program is headed by the Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO), who ensures that the function executes its 
primary responsibilities of formulation and deployment 
of risk management policies and procedures. In terms 
of reporting, the function provides quarterly updates to 
the Risk Management Council and periodic updates to 
the Board Risk Management Committee on risks which 
impact key business objectives, with an insight into 
their mitigations. Also, ad-hoc updates may be provided 
in case of any emerging risks and change in internal/
external factors influencing risk assessment.  
Enterprise Level Risk Register
The ERM function has defined and implemented a 
detailed Risk Register with risks defined at Organisational, 
Business Unit, Functional and Regional levels, which 
enables risk-based decision making and reviews by 
various stakeholders in the Risk management process. 
Risk Categories
Strategic: Risks arising out of strategy definition and 
successful execution of these strategies are covered 
in this category. For example, risks associated with the 
choice of the target markets, the Company’s market 
offerings and business models. Details of the Company’s 
strategy are described in other sections of the Integrated 
Annual Report.
Operational/Cyber security: Risks arising out of internal 
and external factors affecting policies, procedures, 
people, and systems, thereby impacting service delivery. 
These also include potential risks arising out of breach 
of Company’s network and possible impact on its 
operations, including risks of cyber attacks and data 
privacy breaches.  
Compliance/Regulatory: Risks arising from potential 
litigations, violations to laws, regulations, and major 
regulatory/geopolitical 
changes. 
Also 
includes 
Reputational Risks, which are likely to affect brand or 
reputation due to non-ethical behaviours. 
Financial: Risks related to financial liquidity, currency 
fluctuation and capital management.
ESG: Risks related to business impact due to mismatch 
in approach versus implementation of sustainability 
initiatives linked to climate changes, alignment with 
stakeholders, and regulatory reporting compliances.
Risk Management
Listed below are some of the key risks, anticipated impact, and mitigations:
Key Risk
Impact on Organisation
Mitigations
Risk of talent availability, 
attrition skilling and re-
skilling
Unavailability of timely and requisite 
skilled talent hampers the organisation’s 
vision 
of 
meeting 
customer 
requirements. Delay in arresting this 
may impact the   quality of customer 
services and subsequently the revenue 
stream.
•	 Accelerated Freshers program focused 
towards organic talent build
•	 Experiential 
training 
framework 
focussed on faster deployment
•	 Fresher absorption enabling practices
•	 Cross pollination and rotation
High dependency on 
certain key customers and 
sectors
With high dependency on limited 
number of clients, revenue growth may 
not be sustainable and a change in 
customer’s strategy would have a far-
reaching impact on revenue, margin, 
and market share.
•	 Focussed 
approach 
for 
strategic 
account identification and planned 
growth momentum to address business 
concentration in limited accounts. 
Ensure 
revenue 
spread 
across 
customers with defined growth criteria.

In view of current geo-political unrest in some regions, we 
are cognizant of the potential risks and the importance 
of customer service continuity.  The Company has 
delivery capabilities from not only India, but several 
European countries, the United States, South Africa, 
Colombia, Canada and Mexico. Hence, it has flexibility to 
accommodate movement of work to remain compliant 
with applicable laws and sanctions regimes.  The Company 
continues to monitor related legal, and compliance 
matters to mitigate risk and to ensure business continuity.

(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1
Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk and 
opportunity
Rationale for identifying risk-
The identification of risks is important 
because if quality and timeliness are 
not maintained and customer-centric 
issues are not resolved, it will negatively 
impact customer satisfaction, which in 
turn will have a direct negative impact 
on the business
Rationale for identifying opportunity- 
Identifying opportunities is crucial 
because when customers are satisfied 
with the services, it can result in 
repeat business, customer retention, 
and the expansion of the customer 
base. This highlights the significance 
of 
establishing 
strong 
customer 
relationships and consistently providing 
exceptional experiences that meet or 
surpass customer expectations.
Risk 
mitigation 
approach: 
Customer Satisfaction: 
The 
company 
has 
implemented 
proactive 
measurement 
mechanisms, 
including the establishment of 
a customer feedback cell, to 
assess customer satisfaction 
levels and gather feedback 
from multiple angles. This 
includes evaluating customer 
satisfaction 
with 
ongoing 
work, 
tracking 
account 
growth, 
and 
assessing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
company's 
innovative 
and 
cost-effective solutions.
Positive:
The Company's profitability is 
greatly influenced by customer 
satisfaction 
and 
loyalty, 
which 
have 
a 
substantial 
positive 
impact. 
Enhancing 
customer satisfaction can also 
result in improved business 
prospects and foster growth 
opportunities.
Negative: 
The loss of trust in Zensar's 
ability 
to 
deliver 
the 
promised 
quality 
services 
can result in missed business 
opportunities. 
Additionally, 
any breach of privacy and 
data security can have severe 
consequences.

(Indicate positive or negative

2
Data Security
Risk
Data security is of utmost importance 
in risk management strategy, given 
the 
potential 
risks 
and 
negative 
consequences associated with the 
loss, theft, or unauthorized access 
to sensitive data. These risks include 
financial losses, damage to reputation, 
legal liabilities, and loss of customer 
trust.
The Company has established 
policies 
concerning 
information 
technology/ 
cyber security risks that define 
limits, mitigation strategies, 
and internal controls. 
Negative:
The erosion of customer trust 
in Zensar's ability to deliver 
the promised quality services 
can result in missed business 
prospects and opportunities. 
3
Innovation 
and digital 
transform-
ation
Opportunity
To remain competitive in the fast-
paced 
technology 
landscape, 
businesses need to embrace the latest 
advancements and make digitisation 
and innovation essential parts of their 
strategies. By implementing solutions 
based on this approach, companies 
can effectively facilitate the growth 
objectives of their customers, enabling 
them to advance rapidly.
-
Positive: 
Zensar achieves cost savings 
and 
increased 
productivity 
through digital transformation, 
leading 
to 
enhanced 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
profitability. Moreover, digital 
transformation enables Zensar 
to better understand and serve 
their 
customers, 
fostering 
loyalty and retention, which 
can drive higher revenues and 
strengthen 
overall 
financial 
performance.
4
Ethical 
governance 
and 
compliance 
Opportunity
By upholding ethical principles and 
complying with regulations, Zensar 
fosters a culture of integrity that not 
only builds trust with stakeholders 
but also enhances the organisation's 
reputation. 
This 
commitment 
to 
responsible 
business 
practices 
mitigates the potential for legal and 
reputational challenges, establishing a 
solid foundation for sustained trust and 
credibility.
-
Positive:
By 
maintaining 
ethical 
governance and compliance, 
we 
can 
bolster 
investor 
confidence, foster customer 
loyalty, 
and 
enhance 
employee 
engagement. 
This commitment to ethical 
practices 
enables 
us 
to 
attract and retain top talent, 
minimizing 
turnover 
costs 
while boosting productivity 
and 
innovation. 
Ultimately, 
ethical 
governance 
and 
compliance 
offer 
a 
competitive advantage and 
play a vital role in driving long-
term financial success.
5
Digitisation of 
operations and 
sustainable 
infrastructure
Opportunity
To 
ensure 
energy 
efficiency, 
implementing 
sustainable 
infrastructure 
projects 
such 
as 
migrating 
enterprise 
systems 
to 
the cloud, upgrading data center 
infrastructure 
with 
virtualisation 
technologies 
like 
VMware, 
and 
improving UPS systems will play a 
crucial role. Additionally, adopting 
power management policies to reduce 
consumption during inactivity and 
implementing equipment procurement 
policies that prioritize eco-friendly 
and 
energy-efficient 
hardware 
for 
data centers and end-user devices will 
optimize energy usage. Leveraging 
digitally enabled operational processes 
with extensive network connections 
and efficient data management will 
facilitate adaptation to the rapidly 
evolving business landscape.
-
Positive:
The 
implementation 
of 
digitisation has the capacity 
to improve efficiency and 
productivity, resulting in cost 
reductions 
and 
increased 
profitability for businesses.
By 
adopting 
green 
infrastructure and sustainable 
practices, 
Zensar 
can 
minimize their environmental 
impact 
through 
reduced 
energy 
consumption 
and 
lower carbon emissions.

Talent 
retention and 
acquisition
Risk and 
opportunity
Rationale for identifying risk-
1.	 High turnover rates: Losing skilled 
employees 
leads 
to 
increased 
recruitment and training expenses, 
reduced 
productivity, 
and 
disruptions in team dynamics.
Risk mitigation approach:
The risk mitigation strategy 
for 
this 
challenge 
entails 
the 
implementation 
of 
impactful talent management 
strategies. 
Positive: 
Retaining exceptional talent 
can effectively lower turnover 
costs and extend employee 
tenure, resulting in heightened 
efficiency and profitability.
2.	 Skills gap: Difficulty in finding 
qualified professionals creates a 
skills gap that hinders achieving 
business objectives and strategic 
goals.
3.	 Competitive disadvantage: Inability 
to retain or attract top talent puts 
the organisation at a competitive 
disadvantage, allowing competitors 
to gain an advantage
4.	 Succession 
planning: 
Retaining 
or attracting top talent impacts 
succession planning by posing 
challenges 
in 
identifying 
and 
developing future leaders, affecting 
long-term organisational success.
Rationale for identifying opportunity-
1. 	 Talented and motivated workforce 
crucial for organisational objectives 
and competitive edge
2. 	 Retaining and attracting top talent:
	
- 	Enhances productivity
	
- 	Drives innovation
	
-	 Increases customer satisfaction
3.	 Reduces costs related to turnover 
and recruitment
These 
include 
offering 
competitive 
compensation 
and 
benefits 
packages, 
providing 
avenues 
for 
professional 
growth 
and 
development, 
cultivating 
a 
positive 
work 
culture, 
and utilizing data analytics 
to 
monitor 
employee 
engagement and satisfaction.
Acquiring 
and 
retaining 
top talent can also elevate 
productivity, as skilled and 
engaged 
employees 
tend 
to 
demonstrate 
greater 
effectiveness in their roles. 
This, in turn, enhances the 
quality of customer service 
and contributes to higher 
levels of customer satisfaction, 
fostering increased loyalty and 
repeat business.
Negative:
Neglecting to address this risk 
results in adverse financial 
consequences, 
including 
elevated 
expenses 
related 
to recruiting, training, and 
onboarding new employees, 
diminished 
productivity, 
reduced 
morale 
among 
existing staff, and potential 
harm 
to 
the 
company's 
reputation 
as 
a 
desirable 
employer. Furthermore, high 
turnover can disrupt project 
timelines, diminish customer 
satisfaction, 
and 
impede 
innovation and growth
7
Employee 
wellbeing
Opportunity
Rationale: 
Employee wellbeing leads to enhance 
employee satisfaction, engagement, 
and productivity. When employees 
feel appreciated and receive adequate 
support, they are more likely to be 
motivated and dedicated to their 
work, resulting in improved business 
outcomes.
-
Positive: 
Allocating 
resources 
to 
employee 
wellbeing 
yields 
substantial 
financial 
advantages, 
such 
as 
heightened 
productivity, 
lowered healthcare expenses, 
improved employee retention, 
increased job satisfaction, and 
an enhanced employer brand.
8
Energy 
management 
/ Emissions 
management
Opportunity
Rationale: 
Implementing a chiller visualisation 
system 
(CVS) 
monitors 
real-time 
energy consumption, identifies waste. 
Upgrading to LED lighting with motion/
daylight sensors, optimizing fresh air 
usage, and improving cross-ventilation 
save energy, offering financial benefits 
and reducing environmental impact.
-
Positive: 
Energy 
and 
emission 
management 
strategies 
reduce 
costs 
by 
lowering 
energy 
consumption 
and 
associated expenses. The use 
of energy-efficient equipment 
and 
processes 
enhances 
productivity, 
minimizing 
downtime and maintenance 
needs, leading to increased 
output 
and 
revenue 
for 
businesses.

Business 
continuity
Opportunity
Through the implementation of a 
comprehensive 
business 
continuity 
plan, we minimize the effects of 
disruptive events and sustain critical 
operations. This proactive approach not 
only fosters customer trust and loyalty 
but also bolsters brand reputation, 
potentially unlocking new markets 
and revenue streams. Furthermore, 
investing 
in 
business 
continuity 
measures 
enables 
businesses 
to 
identify and rectify vulnerabilities, 
enhancing 
overall 
resilience 
and 
fostering long-term advantages for 
sustainable growth.
-
Positive: 
The 
implementation 
of 
business continuity planning 
minimises financial losses and 
enhances the organisation's 
capacity to swiftly rebound 
from 
unforeseen 
events, 
thereby positively influencing 
its financial performance. By 
investing in such initiatives, 
we position ourselves for long-
term success and sustainable 
growth.
10
Diversity 
and equal 
opportunity
Opportunity
1.	 A 
diverse 
workplace 
promotes 
inclusivity, providing equal rights 
and opportunities for all employees, 
contributing to an equitable society.
2.	 Increased 
gender 
and 
ethnic 
diversity 
enhance 
inclusiveness, 
challenging biases and promoting 
equality. This mindset shift leads 
to improved propositions, higher 
productivity, and the creation of 
value.
-
Positive: 
A 
diverse 
workforce 
comprising individuals from 
different 
genders, 
ages, 
ethnicities, 
nationalities, 
socio-economic backgrounds, 
religious 
beliefs, 
cultural 
practices, 
and 
sexual 
orientations 
enables 
the 
organisation 
to 
improve 
services 
and 
manage 
operational 
risks. 
Diversity 
brings 
fresh 
perspectives, 
experiences, 
and 
ideas, 
driving innovation, enhancing 
performance, and fostering a 
positive organisational culture.
11
Water 
management 
/ Waste 
management
Opportunity
Water and waste management is a 
significant priority in our daily lives, 
and we perceive it as an opportunity 
to effectively address these concerns 
within our premises. It allows us to save 
money, showcase our environmental 
commitment, comply with regulations, 
drive innovation, engage employees, 
and 
attract 
sustainability-focused 
customers.
-
Positive: 
Effective water and waste 
management 
can 
improve 
operational efficiency, reduce 
costs, create new revenue 
streams, 
enhance 
brand 
value, and ensure compliance 
with regulations, all of which 
can have positive financial 
implications.
12
Community 
development
Opportunity
Community development empowers 
individuals, 
fosters 
connections, 
and builds stronger communities. It 
promotes social cohesion, creates 
supportive 
environments, 
and 
enhances quality of life. Additionally, 
community 
development 
drives 
economic growth by supporting local 
businesses and creating jobs. It also 
addresses social issues, promotes 
social justice, and improves the well-
being of marginalized communities 
through increased access to essential 
services. This helps the company to 
create a positive image which attracts 
more clients.
-
Positive: 
Supporting 
CSR 
activities 
creates a positive impact on 
the communities we engage 
with, 
addressing 
needs, 
promoting 
sustainability, 
and enhancing stakeholder 
relationships.

13
Human rights 
and grievances
Risk and 
Opportunity
Rationale for identifying as Risk: 
Neglecting human rights throughout 
functions and the value chain can 
cause reputational harm and erode 
trust from stakeholders, including the 
community, customers, investors, and 
shareholders.
Rationale 
for 
identifying 
it 
as 
opportunity:
Incorporating human rights into policies 
and 
processes 
fosters 
community 
connections, ethical practices, and 
elevated 
societal 
standards. 
This 
enhances branding, reputation, and 
attracts investor recognition for a high 
human rights quotient. 
Risk Mitigation approach 
Raising awareness within the 
organisation and throughout 
the 
value 
chain 
about 
human rights requirements, 
along with focused training 
initiatives, 
helps 
mitigate 
risks. 
Establishing 
a 
well-
defined policy and process 
for 
handling 
grievances 
and ensuring that relevant 
stakeholders are aware of 
this mechanism, builds trust 
by demonstrating that issues 
will be acknowledged and 
resolved. 
Positive: 
Integrating a focus on human 
rights and a robust grievance 
handling 
mechanism 
into 
operational 
policies 
and 
procedures 
will 
attract 
investors, 
employees, 
and 
customers. 
This 
increased 
awareness and commitment 
contribute to business growth 
and a strong market share.
Negative: 
Ignoring human rights and 
grievances 
can 
lead 
to 
reputational 
damage, 
legal 
consequences, 
employee 
dissatisfaction and turnover, 
stakeholder 
disengagement, 
supply chain disruptions, and 
increased operational risks for 
Zensar.
14
Climate 
change 
vulnerability
Risk
Rationale: 
Zensar's operations can be affected by 
climate change, which includes extreme 
weather events such as cyclones, 
heatwaves, floods, and other disruptive 
occurrences.
Risk Mitigation approach:
1.	 All our facilities in India are 
categorized as having a 
low environmental impact.
2.	 To 
mitigate 
climate-
related risks, we prioritize 
resource mobilisation and 
implement early recovery 
mechanisms to protect our 
IT infrastructure. Zensar 
has a well-defined crisis 
management 
framework 
in 
place, 
ensuring 
stakeholders 
are 
aware 
of activities, checklists, 
and 
responsibilities 
during 
climate-related 
emergencies. 
We 
have 
designated 
crisis 
managers, 
initiators, 
and monitors at regional 
and 
functional 
levels 
for 
both 
anticipated 
and 
unforeseen 
crises. 
Our 
processes 
include 
pre-crisis 
measures, 
during-crisis actions, and 
post-crisis 
evaluations 
for 
learning 
and 
improvement.
Negative:
Meeting 
environmental 
standards 
and 
compliance 
can result in higher operating 
costs. Failure to do so can lead 
to adverse incidents that may 
incur financial losses, impact 
employee 
well-being, 
and 
damage reputation.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
At Zensar, we recognize that addressing ESG challenges is not only a responsibility but also an opportunity to 
create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.
	
In terms of environmental challenges, we have set ambitious targets to reduce our carbon footprint, minimize 
waste generation, and conserve natural resources. Through implementing energy-efficient practices, adopting 
renewable energy sources, and promoting recycling initiatives, we aim to make a positive impact on the 
environment.
	
Socially, we understand the importance of fostering an inclusive and diverse work environment. Our goal 
is to create a workplace where everyone feels valued, respected, and has equal opportunities for growth and 
development. We have implemented “Enliven” to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Apart from this we have 
the experiential learning initiative to meet the expectations of the delivery units for resources with a vast range of 
skills. The program concentrates on training freshers. We partner with various institutions in the HTD model and 
train the selected candidates with in-demand market skills per our requirements.
	
In terms of governance, we have maintained a strong commitment to transparency, ethical practices, and robust 
corporate governance. We have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with relevant 
regulations, prevent corruption, and safeguard data privacy. Furthermore, we have established mechanisms for 
stakeholder engagement and have actively sought feedback from our customers, employees, suppliers, and 
communities to enhance our governance practices.
	
While we have made significant progress in addressing ESG challenges, we recognize that there is always room 
for improvement. Going forward, we remain dedicated to setting ambitious targets and implementing innovative 
solutions to further advance our ESG performance. We will continue to integrate sustainability considerations into 
our decision-making processes, collaborate with stakeholders, and transparently report on our progress.
	
We firmly believe that by embracing ESG principles, we not only contribute to a better future for our company but 
also play a vital role in creating a more sustainable and inclusive world.

To the Members of Zensar Technologies Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of Zensar Technologies Limited (“the 
Company”), which comprise the Balance sheet as at 
March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including 
the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash 
Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity 
for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone 
financial statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the 
Company as at March 31, 2023, its profit including other 
comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes 
in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are 
further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the ‘Standalone Financial Statements’ section 
of our report. We are independent of the Company 
in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements under the provisions of the 
Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements for the 
financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our 
description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context.
We have determined the matters described below to be the 
key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We 
have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial 
statements section of our report, including in relation to these 
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements. The results of our audit procedures, including 
the procedures performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying 
standalone financial statements.
Independent Auditor’s Report
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (as described in Notes 2 (a) and 3(a) to the standalone financial statements)
The Company engages into various contracts for software 
development, and maintenance of software/hardware 
and related services. The contracts with ultimate 
customers have defined delivery milestones with agreed 
scope of work and pricing for each milestone based on 
the nature of service. On the basis of scope of work and 
terms, the pricing arrangement of these contracts is time 
and material and/or fixed price.
Revenue 
from 
fixed 
price 
contracts, 
where 
the 
performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time 
has been recognised using the percentage of completion 
computed as per the input method based on estimate 
of total contract costs. Use of percentage -of-completion 
method requires the determination of the actual efforts 
or costs expended to date as proportion of estimated 
total efforts or costs to be incurred.
Our audit procedures include the following:
1. 
 Obtained the understanding of the processes, 
systems and the controls implemented by the 
Company for recording and computing revenue 
and the associated contract assets and unearned 
revenue; 
and 
assessed 
appropriateness 
of 
accounting policy with Ind AS 115.
2.  Tested the design and operating effectiveness of 
management’s key internal financial controls around 
revenue recognition;
3.  Tested sample revenue contracts and performed the 
following procedures to assess whether revenue is 
appropriately recognised as per principles of Ind AS 115 :

Other Information
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the information included in the 
Directors’ Report, but does not include the standalone 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether such 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Responsibilities 
of 
Management 
for 
the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these standalone financial statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of 
the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility 
also includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Company or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these standalone financial 
statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised 
basis the time spent by employee/vendors on a contract 
as approved by the project manager. Such services are 
recognised as and when the services are rendered and 
necessary approvals are obtained.
We identified revenue recognition as a key audit matter 
since :
•	
There is an inherent and presumed fraud risk around 
the revenue recognition considering application 
of revenue recognition standard is complex and 
involves number of key judgements and estimates 
mainly in identifying performance obligations, 
related transaction price (including estimates of 
variable consideration) and estimating the future 
cost to completion of the fixed price contracts, which 
is used to determine the percentage of completion 
of the relevant performance obligation;
•	
Time and material contracts are billed basis approval 
of effort estimate by project manager and also 
through customer acceptances in certain cases; and
•	
At year end, significant amount of unbilled revenue 
related to these contracts are recognised on the 
balance sheet.
a)	 Evaluated management’s assessment with respect 
to identification of performance obligation;
b)	 Agreed the transaction price to the underlying 
contracts;
c)	 In case of time and material type contract, tested 
samples to verify whether revenue has been correctly 
recorded based on approved effort estimate by 
project manager and where applicable, is backed by 
customer acceptances wherever revenue is invoiced 
to the customer;
d)	 In respect of fixed price type contracts, tested 
samples to verify whether management has 
appropriately accrued revenue as per milestones 
defined in the contract with necessary approvals and 
that the estimated cost to complete the contract is 
appropriate;
e)	 Assessed aging of unbilled revenue as on the balance 
sheet date and in case of aged items obtained 
reasons for delays if any and expected timelines for 
invoicing of the same.
f)	
Performed analytical procedures on unbilled revenue 
and customer margin’s and obtained reasons for 
significant unexpected variations.
g)	 Obtained and read the disclosures made in the 
standalone financial statements.
Impairment assessment of Goodwill (as described in Notes 2 (f) and 33 to the standalone financial statements)
As at March 31, 2023, the Company has a goodwill of INR 
956 million pertaining to various business combinations 
which took place in the past. The carrying value of goodwill 
is tested annually for impairment using discounted cash 
flow models of recoverable value compared to the 
carrying value of assets. A deficit between recoverable 
value and carrying value would result in impairment. 
Determination of recoverable amount is complex and 
typically requires a high level of judgment.
The key assumptions to the impairment testing model 
includes:
•	
Projected revenue growth, operating margins and 
operating cash flows during the forecasted period,
•	
Long-term growth rate beyond explicit forecast 
period and in perpetuity; and
•	
Discount rate used
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these 
assumptions and because of the materiality of the 
balance to the standalone financial statements of the 
Company, the matter is considered a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures include the following:
1.	
Assessed Company’s evaluation of identification 
of cash-generating unit’s (CGU) and allocation of 
goodwill to the respective CGU.
2.	 Tested design and operating effectiveness of 
management’s key internal controls over the 
impairment assessment process.
3.	 Involved 
our 
specialists 
evaluated 
the

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•	
 Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding 
the 
financial 
statements/financial 
information of the branches to express an opinion 
on the standalone financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements/
financial information of the components which have 
been audited by us. We remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone 
financial statements for the financial year ended March 
31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter

ended March 31, 2022, included in these standalone 
financial statements, have been audited by the 
predecessor auditor who expressed an unmodified 
opinion on those statements on May 10, 2022.

establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's internal financial controls with reference 
to these standalone financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and 
the Standards on Auditing, as specified under section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
these standalone financial statements was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively 
in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to these 
standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to these standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference 
to 
these 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial 
Controls With Reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
standalone 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date

as a reduction of revenue. When the amount 
of discount varies with the levels of revenue, 
volume discount is recorded based on estimate 
of future revenue from the customer.
The Company applies judgement to determine 
whether each product or services promised to a 
customer are capable of being distinct, and are 
distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the 
promised product or services are combined and 
accounted as a single performance obligation. 
The Company allocates the transaction price to 
separately identifiable performance obligations 
based on their relative stand-alone selling 
price. In cases where the Company is unable 
to determine the stand-alone selling price the 
Company uses expected cost-plus margin 
approach in estimating the stand-alone selling 
price.
The billing schedules agreed with customers 
include periodic performance based payments 
and / or milestone based progress payments. 
Invoices are payable within contractually agreed 
credit period.
	
	
i.	
Time and material contracts:
	
Revenues and costs relating to time and 
materials contracts are recognized as the 
related services are rendered.
	
	
ii.	
Fixed- price contracts:
	
Revenue for fixed-price contracts where 
performance obligations are satisfied over 
time is recognised using percentage-of-
completion method. In respect of such fixed-
price contracts, revenue is recognised using 
percentage-of-completion method (‘POC 
method’) of accounting with contract costs/
efforts incurred (input) determining the 
degree of completion of the performance 
obligation.
	
	
iii.	 Sale of licenses:
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer 
obtains a “right to use "the licenses is 
recognized at the time the license is made 
available to the customer. Revenue from 
licenses where the customer obtains a “right to 
access” is recognized over the access period.
	
Contract assets are recognised when there 
is excess of revenue earned over billings on 
contracts. Contract assets are classified as 
unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is 
pending) when there is unconditional right 
to receive cash, and only passage of time is 
required, as per contractual terms.
	
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract 
liability”) is recognised when there is billings 
in excess of revenues.
	
b)	 Income Tax:
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognized in statement of 
profit and loss, except when they relate to items 
that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the 
current and deferred tax are also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, respectively.
	
	
i.	
Current Income Tax:
	
Current income tax for the current and 
prior periods are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities based on the 
taxable income for the period. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the current 
tax amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted as at the reporting 
date and applicable for the period.
	
The Company offsets current tax assets and 
current tax liabilities, where it has a legally 
enforceable right to set off the recognized 
amounts and where it intends either to settle 
on a net basis, or to realize the asset and 
liability simultaneously.
	
	
ii.	
Deferred Tax:
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for deductible and taxable 
temporary differences arising between the 
tax base of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amount in financial statements, 
except when the deferred income tax arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profits or loss at the 
time of the transaction.

2.	 Summary 
of 
significant 
accounting 
policies
	
a)	 Revenue Recognition:
The Company earns revenue primarily from 
software 
development, 
maintenance 
of 
software/hardware and related services, and sale 
of software licenses.
The 
Company’s 
contracts 
with 
customers 
include promises to transfer multiple products 
and services to a customer. Revenues from 
customer 
contracts 
are 
considered 
for 
recognition and measurement when the contract 
has been approved, in writing, by the parties 
to the contract, the parties to the contract 
are committed to perform their respective 
obligations under the contract, and the contract 
is legally enforceable. At the inception of every 
contract, transaction price and performance 
obligations are determined. Transaction price 
reflect amount of consideration expected to be 
received in exchange for transferring goods and 
services plus estimate of variable consideration 
i.e. discounts, price concession, rebates etc. 
Transaction price is allocated to identifiable 
performance obligations in a manner that depicts 
exchange for transferring of promised goods 
and services. Volume discounts are recorded

individual asset basis unless the asset does not 
generate cashflows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets. In such cases, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not 
readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the 
leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a 
corresponding adjustment to the related right of 
use asset if the Company changes its assessment 
of whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
	
Lease liability and ROU asset are separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments are classified as cash flows used in 
financing activities.
	
	
Company as a lessor:
	
At the inception of the lease the Company 
classifies each of its leases as either an operating 
lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises 
lease payments received under operating leases 
as income on a straight- line basis over the lease 
term. In case of a finance lease, finance income 
is recognised over the lease term based on a 
pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of 
return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. 
When the Company is an intermediate lessor it 
accounts for its interests in the head lease and 
the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease 
classification of a sub-lease with reference to the 
right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not 
with reference to the underlying asset. If a head 
lease is a short term lease to which the Company 
applies the exemption described above, then it 
classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.
	
Whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified 
as a finance lease.
	
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease 
components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to 
allocate the consideration in the contract.
	
d)	 Foreign Currency Translation:
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. Foreign currency denominated 
monetary assets and liabilities are restated at 
the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting 
date and exchange gains and losses arising on 
settlement and restatement are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in foreign currencies are not 
restated.
	
Assets and liabilities of branches with functional 
currency other than the functional currency 
of the Company have been translated using 
exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. 
Statement of profit and loss of such entities 
has been translated using weighted average 
exchange rates. Translation adjustments have 
been reported as Foreign Currency Translation 
Reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity 
through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).
	
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on 
initial recognition of the related asset, expense 
or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of 
a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability 
relating to advance consideration, the date of the 
transaction is the date on which the Company 
initially recognises the non-monetary asset or 
non-monetary liability arising from the advance 
consideration. If there are multiple payments or 
receipts in advance, the Company determines 
the transaction date for each payment or receipt 
of advance consideration.
	
e)	 Business Combinations:
	
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The consideration 
transferred 
in 
a 
business 
combination 
is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the 
sum of acquisition date fair values of the assets 
transferred by the Company, liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities assumed by the Company 
to the former owners of the acquiree and the 
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the 
extent it is probable that taxable profit will 
be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilized.
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences except in 
respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with foreign branches where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period 
when the asset is realized or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date.
	
The Company offsets deferred tax assets and 
liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable 
right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity, or on different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to 
settle the current tax liabilities and assets on 
a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities 
will be realized simultaneously.
	
Deferred Tax includes MAT credit, if any and 
it is recognized as an asset only when and to 
the extent there is convincing evidence that 
the Company will pay income tax higher than 
that computed under MAT, during the period 
that MAT is permitted to be set off under the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 for a specified period. 
Credit on account of MAT is recognized as an 
asset based on the management’s estimate 
of its recoverability in the future.
	
c)	 Leases:
	
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for 
consideration. 
The 
Company 
assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception 
of a contract. To assess whether a contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Company assesses whether: 
(1) the contract involves the use of an identified 
asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the 
economic benefits from use of the asset through 
the period of the lease and (3) the Company has 
the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
Company as a lessee:
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these 
short-term and low value leases, the Company 
recognises the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. Certain lease arrangements include 
the options to extend or terminate the lease 
before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and 
lease liabilities includes these options when it is 
reasonably certain that they will be exercised. 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the 
lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement date 
of the lease plus any initial direct costs less 
any lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses.
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life 
of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are 
evaluated for recoverability whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost 
to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an

or issue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (other than financial assets and 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss) are added to or deducted from the 
fair value measured on initial recognition of 
financial asset or financial liability.
	
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset 
only when the contractual rights to the 
cash flows from the asset expire, or when it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the asset to another entity. The Company 
derecognises financial liabilities when, and 
only when, the Company’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or have expired.
	
	
ii.	
Initial recognition:
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets 
not recorded at fair value through profit or 
loss, transaction costs that are attributable 
to the acquisition of the financial asset.
	
	
iii.	 Measurement:
	
	
	
Financial assets carried at amortized cost:
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at 
amortized cost if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold the asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and 
the contractual terms of the financial asset 
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
The Company intends to hold its investment 
in open ended target maturity funds till 
maturity. It may be noted that these funds 
have a pre-determined maturity date. These 
funds follow a passive buy and hold strategy; 
in which the existing underlying investment 
bonds are expected to be held till maturity 
unless sold for meeting redemptions or 
rebalancing requirements as stated in the 
scheme document. In our view, such strategy 
mitigates intermittent price volatility in open 
ended target maturity funds’ underlying 
investments; and investors who remain 
invested until maturity are expected to 
mitigate the market/volatility risk to a large 
extent. Based on this, the Company believes 
that the investments in open ended target 
maturity funds meet the requirements of 
SPPI (solely payments of principal and 
interest) test as per the requirements of Ind 
AS 109.
	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI):
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured 
at fair value through other comprehensive 
income if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets and the contractual terms 
of the financial asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding. Further, in cases where 
the Company has made an irrevocable 
election based on its business model, for its 
investments which are classified as equity 
instruments, the subsequent changes in fair 
value are recognized in other comprehensive 
income.
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL):
	
A financial asset which is not classified in any 
of the above categories are subsequently fair 
valued through profit or loss.
	
The Company determines classification 
of financial assets and liabilities on initial 
recognition. After initial recognition, no 
reclassification is made for financial assets 
which are equity instruments and financial 
liabilities. For financial assets which are 
debt instruments, a reclassification is made 
only if there is a change in the business 
model for managing those assets. Changes 
to the business model are expected to be 
infrequent. The Group’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as 
a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Group’s operations. If 
the Group reclassifies financial assets, it 
applies the reclassification prospectively 
from the reclassification date following the 
change in business model. The Company 
does not restate any previously recognised 
equity interests issued by the Company in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition 
related costs are generally recognized in profit or 
loss as incurred.
	
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the 
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of 
the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. After 
initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
Intangible 
assets 
acquired 
in 
business 
combination are measured at fair value as of the 
date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
When the Company acquires a business, it 
assesses the financial assets and liabilities 
assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual 
terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date.
	
When the consideration transferred by the 
Company in a business combination includes 
assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
arrangement, the contingent consideration is 
measured at its acquisition date fair value and 
included as part of the consideration transferred 
in 
a 
business 
combination. 
Contingent 
consideration that is classified as an asset or 
liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates in accordance with Ind AS 109 Financial 
Instruments or Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets, with the 
corresponding gain or loss being recognised in 
profit or loss.
	
If the initial accounting for a business combination 
is incomplete by the end of the reporting period 
in which the combination occurs, the Company 
reports provisional amounts for the items for 
which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted through 
goodwill during the measurement period, or 
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to 
reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date 
that, if known, would have affected the amounts 
recognized at that date. These adjustments are 
called as measurement period adjustments. The 
measurement period does not exceed one year 
from the acquisition date.
	
f)	 Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
Goodwill and intangible assets that have 
an indefinite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation 
and 
are 
tested 
annually 
for 
impairment, or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that they 
might be impaired. Other assets are tested 
for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognized for the amount by which the 
asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. For the purpose of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash inflows which are largely independent of 
the cash inflows from other assets or group of 
assets (cash-generating units).
	
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that 
suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible 
reversal of the impairment at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
g)	 Cash and Cash Equivalents:
	
For the purposes of presentation in the statement 
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits 
with original maturities of three months or less 
that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and cash equivalents which are subject 
to insignificant risk of changes in value and net 
of outstanding bank overdraft. Cash and cash 
equivalents consist of balances with banks which 
are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
h)	 Investments and other financial assets 
and liabilities:
	
	
i.	
Classification:
	
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition

that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the 
hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss and 
reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), 
net within results from operating activities. If the 
hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognized in cash flow 
hedging reserve till the period the hedge was 
effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve 
until the forecasted transaction occurs.
The 
cumulative 
gain 
or 
loss 
previously 
recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is 
transferred to the statement of profit and loss 
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted 
transaction.
The Company enters into the contracts that 
are effective as hedges from an economic 
perspective but may not qualify for hedge 
accounting. The change in the fair value of such 
instrument is recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
k)	 Offsetting financial instruments:
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the 
net amount is reported in the balance sheet 
where there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognized amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis or realize the asset on 
a net basis or realize the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable 
right must not be contingent on future events 
and must be enforceable in the normal course of 
business and in the event of default, insolvency or 
bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
	
l)	
Property, plant and equipment:
	
	
i.	
Recognition and measurement:
	
Property, plant and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Cost includes 
expenditures directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. General and specific 
borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the construction of a qualifying asset are 
capitalized as part of the cost.
	
	
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost.
	
When parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, 
they are accounted for as separate items 
(major components) of property, plant 
and equipment. Subsequent expenditure 
relating to property, plant and equipment 
is capitalized only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with 
these will flow to the Company and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably.
	
The carrying amount of any component 
accounted for as a separate asset is 
derecognized when replaced.
	
All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
charged to profit and loss in the reporting 
period in which they occur.
	
An item of Property, Plant and Equipment 
is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. 
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an item of Property, Plant and 
Equipment are determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment 
not available for use before year end date are 
disclosed under capital work- in-progress, 
net of impairment losses, if any and are not 
depreciated.
	
An asset's carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if 
the carrying amount o the assets or cash 
generating unit (CGU) as applicable, is 
greater than its estimated recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
ii.	
Depreciation:
	
The Company depreciates property, plant 
and equipment on a straight-line basis as 
gains, losses (including impairment gains or 
losses) or interest.
iv.	 Impairment of financial assets (other than 
at fair value):
	
The Company assesses at each reporting 
date whether a financial asset or a group 
of financial assets and contract assets 
(unbilled revenue) is impaired. The Company 
recognises loss allowances, in accordance 
with IND AS 109, using the expected credit 
loss (ECL) model for the financial assets 
which are not fair valued through profit or 
loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and 
unbilled revenue with no significant financing 
component is measured at an amount equal 
to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, 
expected credit losses are measured at an 
amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless 
there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk from initial recognition in which 
case those are measured at lifetime ECL. The 
amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) 
that is required to adjust the loss allowance 
at the reporting date is recognized as an 
impairment gain or loss in the statement of 
profit or loss.
v.	
Investments in subsidiaries: The Company 
accounts for its investment in subsidiaries at 
cost, less impairment losses if any.
	
	
i)	
Interest and Dividend income:
	
Dividend income is recorded when the right 
to receive payment is established. Interest 
income is recognised using the effective 
interest method.
	
j)	
Derivatives and hedging activities:
The 
Company 
designates 
certain 
foreign 
exchange forward, currency options and futures 
contracts as hedge instruments in respect 
of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges/fair value 
hedges, as applicable.
The Company uses hedging instruments that 
are governed by the policies of the Company 
which are approved by Board of Directors. The 
policies provide written principles on the use 
of such financial derivatives consistent with 
the risk management strategy of the Company. 
The Company enters into derivative financial 
instruments where the counterparty is primarily 
a bank.
The hedge instruments are designated and 
documented as hedges at the inception of 
the contract. The Company determines the 
existence of an economic relationship between 
the hedging instrument and hedged item based 
on the currency, amount and timing of their 
respective cash flows. The effectiveness of 
hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated 
with the exposure being hedged is assessed 
and measured at inception and on an ongoing 
basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no 
longer expected to occur, then the amounts 
that have been accumulated in other equity are 
immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange 
gains/loss in the statement of profit and loss.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges 
are classified as:
-	
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure 
to changes in the fair value of a recognized 
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm 
commitment.
-	
Cash flow hedges when hedging the 
exposure to variability in cash flows that 
is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognized asset or liability 
or a highly probable forecast transaction or 
the foreign currency risk in an unrecognized 
firm commitment
- 	
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign 
operation
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative 
financial instruments are measured as described 
below:
	
	
Cash flow hedges:
Changes in the fair value of the derivative 
hedging instrument designated as a cash flow 
hedge are recognized in other comprehensive 
income and held in cash flow hedging reserve, 
net of taxes, a component of equity, to the extent

The Company uses significant judgement to 
disclose 
contingent 
liabilities. 
Contingent 
liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible 
obligation arising from past events, the existence 
of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of 
the Company or a present obligation that arises 
from past events where it is either not probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the 
amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are 
neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial 
statements.
	
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived by 
the Company from a contract are lower than 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract. Provisions for 
onerous contracts are measured at the present 
value of lower of the expected net cost of 
fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of 
terminating the contract.
	
o)	 Employee benefits:
	
	
i.	
Post-employment and pension plans:
	
The 
Company 
participates 
in 
various 
employee benefit plans. Pensions and other 
post-employment benefits are classified as 
either defined contribution plans or defined 
benefit plans. Under a defined contribution 
plan, the Company’s only obligation is to 
pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay 
further contributions if the fund does not 
hold sufficient assets to pay all employee 
benefits. The related actuarial and investment 
risks fall on the employee. The expenditure 
for defined contribution plans is recognized 
as an expense during the period when the 
employee provides service. Under a defined 
benefit plan, it is the Company’s obligation 
to provide agreed benefits to the employees. 
The related actuarial and investment risks fall 
on the Company. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligations is calculated by 
an independent actuary using the projected 
unit credit method.
	
The Company has the following employee 
benefit plans:

Employees 
receive 
benefits

a 
provident fund, which is a defined benefit 
plan. The employer and employees each 
make periodic contributions to the plan. 
Provident fund contributions are made to 
a trust administered by the Company. The 
contributions to the trust managed by the 
Company are accounted for as a defined 
benefit plan as the Company is liable for any 
shortfall, if any with respect to the rate of 
return based on the government specified 
minimum rates of return.
	
The 
Company’s 
liability 
is 
actuarially 
determined (using Projected Unit Credit 
method) at the end of the year. Actuarial 
losses/ gains are recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss in the year in which they 
arise. The contributions made to the trust 
are recognised as plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligation recognised in the balance 
sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation as reduced by the 
fair value of plan assets.
	
	
	
Defined contribution plans
	
The Company provides benefits such as 
superannuation, 
provident 
fund 
(other 
than Company managed fund) and foreign 
defined contribution plans to its employees 
which are treated as defined contribution 
plans.
	
Contributions to defined contribution plans 
are recognised as expense when employees 
have rendered services entitling them to 
such benefits.
	
	
	
Gratuity:
	
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined 
benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering 
eligible employees in accordance with the 
Scheme. The Gratuity plan provides for a 
lump sum payment to eligible employees, 
at retirement, death, incapacitation or 
termination of employment based on the last 
drawn salary and years of employment with 
the Company. The gratuity fund is managed 
by the Life Insurance Corporation of India 
(LIC). The Company’s obligation in respect 
per the estimated useful lives prescribed 
in Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013, 
except in respect of the following assets:
Class of asset
Useful 
life as per 
Schedule 
II
Useful life 
followed by 
Company 
based on 
technical 
evaluation

Data Processing 
Equipments)

Vehicles
8 years
5 years
Electrical 
Installations and 
Equipments

Assets 
acquired 
under 
leasehold 
improvements 
are 
amortized 
over 
the 
shorter of estimated useful life of the asset 
or the related lease term. 
	
The assets residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation are reviewed 
at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
m)	 Intangible Assets:
	
Intangible assets other than those acquired in a 
business combination are measured at cost at 
the date of acquisition.
	
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Internally generated intangible asset arising 
from development activity is recognized at cost 
on demonstration of its technical feasibility, the 
intention and ability of the Company to complete, 
use or sell it, only if, it is probable that the asset 
would generate future economic benefit and the 
expenditure attributable to the said assets during 
its development can be measured reliably.
	
An item of Intangible assets is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of Intangible assets are 
determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in the profit or loss.
	
	
Amortisation periods and methods for all 
Intangible Assets, including those arising from 
business combination:
	
Intangible assets are amortized on straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives which are 
as follows:
Class of Intangible 
Assets
Useful life followed 
by the Company
Softwares (acquired)
1-5 y ears
Softwares (internally 
generated)
3-5 years
Non-compete 
agreements
3-6 years
Customer relationship
4-10 years
Customer contracts
1 -3 y ears
Brand
3-5 years
	
The estimated useful life of amortizable intangible 
assets are reviewed and where appropriate are 
adjusted, annually.
	
n)	 Provisions and contingent liabilities:
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation.
	
When some or all of the economic benefits 
required to settle a provision are expected to 
be recovered from a third party, the receivable 
is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain 
that reimbursement will be received and the 
amount of the receivable can be measured 
reliably. The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the statement of profit and loss net 
of any reimbursement.
	
When a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, 
its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash flows (when the effect of the time value of 
money is material)

When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised 
is the expense had the terms had not been 
modified, if the original terms of the award 
are met. An additional expense is recognised 
for any modification that increases the 
total fair value of the share-based payment 
transaction or is otherwise beneficial to 
the employee as measured at the date of 
modification. Where an award is cancelled 
by the entity or by the counterparty, any 
remaining element of the fair value of the 
award is expensed immediately through 
profit or loss.
	
p)	 Contributed Equity:
	
	
Equity shares are classified as equity.
	
Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.
	
q)	 Dividends:
	
Dividend on share is recorded as liability on the 
date of approval by the shareholders in case of 
final dividend or by the board of directors in case 
of interim dividend. A corresponding amount is 
recognized directly in equity.
	
r)	 Fair value measurement
	
The Company measures financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance 
sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer 
the liability takes place either:
•	
In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
•	
In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or 
liability
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Company. The fair 
value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their economic 
best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability 
to generate economic benefits by using the 
asset in its highest and best use or by selling it 
to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value 
is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial 
instruments measured using quoted prices. This 
includes listed equity instruments and mutual 
funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all 
equity instruments (including bonds) which are 
traded in the stock exchange are valued using 
the closing price as at the reporting period.
	
Level 2: Fair value of financial instruments that 
are not traded in an active market (for example, 
traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) but 
is determined using valuation techniques which 
maximize the use of observable market data 
and rely as little as possible on entity-specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to 
fair value an instrument as observable, the 
instrument is included in level 2.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs 
is not based on observable data, the instrument 
is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted 
equity securities, contingent consideration and 
indemnification assets.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
of the gratuity plan, is provided for based on 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit 
credit method. The Company recognises 
actuarial gains and losses immediately in 
other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
	
The retirement benefit obligation recognized 
in the Balance Sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognized past service 
cost, and as reduced by the fair value of 
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the scheme.
	
	
ii.	
Short-term benefits:
	
Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
recorded as expense as the related services 
are provided. Liabilities for wages and 
salaries including the amount expected to be 
paid under short-term cash bonus or profit 
sharing plans, expected to be settled wholly 
within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related 
service are recognized if the Company has 
a present legal or constructive obligation to 
pay this amount as a result of past service 
provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
	
	
iii.	 Compensated absences:
	
The employees of the Company are entitled 
to compensated absences. The employees 
can carry forward a portion of the unutilized 
accumulating compensated absences and 
utilize it in future periods or receive cash at 
retirement or termination of employment. 
The Company records an obligation for 
compensated absences in the period in 
which the employee renders the services 
that increases this entitlement.
	
The 
Company’s 
liability 
is 
actuarially 
determined 
(using 
the 
Projected 
Unit 
Credit method) at the end of each year, 
as applicable. Actuarial losses/ gains are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss in the year in which they arise.
	
Accumulated compensated absences, which 
are expected to be availed or encashed 
within 12 months from the end of the year 
are classified under current liabilities and 
balance under non-current liabilities.
	
	
iv.	 Share-based payments:
	
Selected employees of the Company receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled 
instruments, for rendering services over a 
defined vesting period. The cost of equity-
settled transactions is determined by the 
fair value at the date when the grant is made 
using an appropriate valuation model.
	
The cost under employee benefits expense is 
recognised, together with a corresponding 
change in Share Based Payment Reserves 
under Other Equity, over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions 
are 
fulfilled. 
The 
cumulative 
expense 
recognised for equity-settled transactions 
at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. Service and non-market 
performance conditions are not taken into 
account when determining the grant date 
fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the 
conditions being met is assessed as part of 
the Company’s best estimate of the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest.
	
Market performance conditions are reflected 
within the grant date fair value. Any other 
conditions attached to an award, but without 
an associated service requirement, are 
considered to be non-vesting conditions. 
Non-vesting conditions are reflected in 
the fair value of an award and lead to an 
immediate expensing of an award unless 
there are also service and/or performance 
conditions.
	
No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have 
not been met. Where awards include a market 
or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the 
market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or 
service conditions are satisfied.

accounting estimates. The definition of a change 
in accounting estimates has been replaced with a 
definition of accounting estimates. Under the new 
definition, accounting estimates are “monetary 
amounts in financial statements that are subject 
to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop 
accounting estimates if accounting policies require 
items in financial statements to be measured in a way 
that involves measurement uncertainty.
	
Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes - This amendment has 
narrowed the scope of the initial recognition 
exemption so that it does not apply to transactions 
that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary 
differences.
	
The Company have evaluated these accounting 
pronouncements 
and 
does 
not 
expect 
the 
amendments to have significant impact on its 
financial statements.
3.	 Critical estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the financial statements requires 
management 
to 
make 
judgements, 
estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and 
the accompanying disclosures and including the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the reporting 
date. However, any change in these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes that require a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets 
or liabilities affected in future periods.
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods 
affected. In particular, information about significant 
areas 
of 
estimation, 
uncertainty 
and 
critical 
judgements in applying accounting policies that 
have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognized in the financial statements are included 
in the following notes:
	
The 
areas 
involving 
critical 
estimates 
and/or 
judgements are:
	
a	
Revenue recognition
	
A portion of the Company’s business relates to 
fixed price contracts which is accounted using 
percentage of completion method, recognizing 
revenue as the performance on the contract 
progresses. Use of the percentage-of-completion 
method requires the Company to estimate the 
efforts or costs expended to date ( input method) 
as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be 
expended. Efforts or costs expended have been 
used to measure progress towards completion 
as there is a direct relationship between input 
and productivity. Provisions for estimated losses, 
if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded 
in the period in which such losses become 
probable based on the expected contract 
estimates at the reporting date. This requires 
management to make judgement with respect to 
identifying contracts for which revenue need to 
be recognised over a period of time, depending 
upon when the customer consumes the benefit, 
when the control is passed to customer, and 
whether the Company has right to payment 
for performance completed till date, either 
contractually or legally.
	
b	
Income and Deferred taxes
	
Significant 
judgements 
are 
involved 
in 
determining the provision for income taxes, 
including judgment on whether tax positions are 
probable of being sustained in tax assessments. 
The management considers the probability 
of an unfavourable outcome while deciding 
on the need of accrual of tax with respect to 
ongoing tax assessments. A tax assessment 
can involve complex issues, which can only 
be resolved over extended time periods. Refer 
note 2(b) for Accounting policy in this regard. 
Deferred 
tax 
is 
recorded 
on 
temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date,  as explained under Note 
2 (b) (ii). The ultimate realisation of deferred 
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of 
future taxable profits during the periods in which 
those temporary differences and tax loss carry 
forwards become deductible. The Company 
considers the expected reversal of deferred tax 
liabilities and projected future taxable income 
in making this assessment. The amount of 
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, 
however, could be reduced in the near term if 
estimates of future taxable income during the 
carry-forward period are reduced.
	
The 
Management 
determines 
the 
policies 
and procedures for both recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments 
and unquoted financial assets measured at fair 
value, and for non-recurring measurement, such 
as assets held for sale in discontinued operations.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
s)	 Operating Segments
	
Information reported to the chief operating 
decision maker (CODM) for the purposes of 
resource allocation and assessment of segment 
performance focuses on the types of goods or 
services delivered or provided.
	
The Board of Directors examines the Company's 
performance based on the services, products 
and geographic perspective and has identified 
below mentioned reportable segments of its 
business as follows:
	
Digital and Application Services (DAS): Custom 
Applications Management Services that include 
Application 
Development, 
Maintenance, 
Support, Modernisation and Testing Services 
across a wide technology spectrum and Industry 
verticals.
	
Digital Foundation Services (DFS): Infrastructure 
management services includes Hybrid IT, Digital 
workplace, Dynamic Security and Unified IT 
provided under managed service platform using 
automation, autonomics and machine learning.
	
The Board of Directors monitors the operating 
results of its business units separately for the 
purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation 
and 
performance 
assessment. 
Segment performance is evaluated based on 
profit or loss and is measured consistently 
with profit or loss in the consolidated financial 
statements.
	
t)	 Government grants
	
Government grants are recognised where there 
is reasonable assurance that the grant will be 
received, and all attached conditions will be 
complied with. When the grant relates to an 
expense item, it is recognised as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods that the related 
costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are 
expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it 
is recognised as income in equal amounts over 
the expected useful life of the related asset.
	
u)	 Earnings per share:
	
The basic earnings per share is computed by 
dividing the net profit for the period attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. The number of shares used in computing 
diluted earnings per share comprises the 
weighted average shares considered for deriving 
basic earnings per share and also the weighted 
average number of equity shares which would 
have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive 
potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity 
shares are deemed converted as of the beginning 
of the period unless they have been issued at a 
later date.
2.1 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
MCA 
issued 
amendments 
to 
certain 
Indian 
Accounting Standards (called as “Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022”) 
which were applicable from 1 April 2022 and these 
amendments didn’t have a significant impact on the 
financial statements.
	
On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and 
issued rules called as Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 which are 
applicable from 1 April 2023. Key amendments are 
summarised below:
	
Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements
	
The amendments require companies to disclose 
their material accounting policies rather than their 
significant accounting policies. Accounting policy 
information, together with other information, is 
material when it can reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions of primary users of general 
purpose financial statements.
	
Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors
	
This amendment has introduced a definition of 
‘accounting estimates’ which will help entities 
to distinguish between accounting policies and

c	
Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a 
significant proportion of the asset base of the 
Company. The charge in respect of periodic 
depreciation is derived after determining an 
estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and 
the expected residual value at the end of its life. 
The useful lives and residual values of Company’s 
assets are determined by management at the 
time the asset is acquired and reviewed at the 
end of each reporting period. The lives are based 
on historical experience with similar assets as 
well as anticipation of future events, which may 
impact their life, such as changes in technology. 
The policy for the same has been explained 
under note 2(l).
	
d	
Impairment of Investments
	
The Company reviews its carrying value of 
investments in subsidiaries and other entities 
annually, or more frequently when there is 
indication for impairment. If the recoverable 
amount is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is accounted for.
	
e	
Business combinations
	
In 
accounting 
for 
business 
combinations, 
judgement is required in identifying whether an 
identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded 
separately 
from 
goodwill. 
Additionally, 
estimating the acquisition date fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and 
contingent consideration involves management 
judgement. These measurements are based on 
information available at the acquisition date and 
are based on expectations and assumptions that 
have been deemed reasonable by management. 
Changes in these judgements, estimates, and 
assumptions can materially affect the results of 
operations.
	
f	
Goodwill
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually once or 
when events occur or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit to which such goodwill pertains 
is less than its carrying value. The recoverable 
amount of cash generating units is higher of 
value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. The 
calculation involves use of significant estimates 
and assumptions which includes turnover and 
earnings multiples, growth rates and net margins 
used to calculate projected future cash flows, 
risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and 
market conditions.
	
g	
Defined benefit obligation
	
The cost of the defined benefit plans and the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation 
are based on actuarial valuation using the 
projected unit credit method. An actuarial 
valuation involves various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. 
Due to the complexities involved in the valuation 
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these 
assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting date. Also refer note 14.
	
h	
Employee stock options
	
The Company initially measures the cost of 
equity-settled 
transactions 
with 
employees 
using a Black Scholes Options Pricing model 
to determine the fair value of the liability 
incurred. Estimating fair value for share-based 
payment transactions requires determination of 
the most appropriate valuation model and the 
performance of the Company, which is dependent 
on the terms and conditions of the grant. 
This 
estimate 
also 
requires 
determination 
of 
the 
most 
appropriate 
inputs 
to 
the 
valuation model including the expected life 
of the share option, volatility and dividend 
yield and making assumptions about them. 
The assumptions and models used for estimating 
fair value for share-based payment transactions 
are disclosed in note 31.

(vii)	    Effective portion of Cash Flow Hedges:	
	
	
   The Company uses hedging instruments as part of its management of foreign currency risk associated with 
its highly probable forecast sales. For hedging foreign currency risk the Company uses forward contracts 
which are designated as cash flow hedges. To the extent this hedge is effective, the change in fair value of 
the hedging instrument is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve. Amounts recognised in the hedging 
reserve are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. 	
	
	
(viii)	    Exchange differences on translating the financial statements of a foreign operation:	 	
	
	
	 Exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive 
income as described in accounting policy and accumulated in a separate reserve within equity. The 
cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the net investment is disposed of.

Asset Volatility:  The Plan liabilities  are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields. If plan 
assets underperform, this yield will create a deficit. The plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with 
high grades. These are subject to interest rate risk.
	
Changes in bond yield: A decrease in bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset 
by an increase in the  value of the plans' bond holdings.
	
The company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) 
framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under 
the employee benefit plans. Within the framework, the company's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension 
obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as 
they fall due and in the appropriate currency.
	
The company actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the 
expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The company has not changed the process 
used to manage its risks from previous periods.
e	
The Company expects to contribute INR Nil (March 31, 2022  INR 126 Mn) to the defined benefit plan during the 
next annual reporting period.

(c)	 Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations	
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet 
to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when company expects to 
recognize these amounts as  revenue. Applying the practical expedients as given in INDAS 115, the company 
has not disclosed the remaining performance obligations related disclosures where the revenue recognized 
corresponds directly with the value to customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those 
contracts where invoicing is on the basis of time and material basis. Remaining performance obligation are 
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, 
periodic revalidations, adjustment of revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency.	
	
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations 
is INR 17 Mn [March 31, 2022: INR 59 Mn] out of which INR 17 Mn [March 31, 2022: INR 59 Mn] is expected to be 
recognised as revenue in the next year. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the 
amount mentioned above.

(b)	 Trade Receivables and Contract Balances		
	
The company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as 
unbilled revenue.	
	
	
A receivable is right to consideration that is unconditional upon passage of time. Revenue for time and material 
contracts are recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance  contracts 
is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as 
unbilled revenue and is classified as a financial asset for these cases as right to consideration is unconditional 
upon passage of time.	 	
	
Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion 
method. Invoicing to clients is based on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing 
of revenue recognition being different from the timing of billing the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed 
price development contracts is classified as non financial assets as the contractual right to consideration is 
dependent on completion of contractual milestones.	
	
	
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.	
	
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.

a)	 Market Risk:
	
i.	
Foreign currency risk:
	
The Company operates globally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and 
consequently the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United 
States, South Africa, United Kingdom and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign 
currencies. The exchange rate between the rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent 
years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Company’s operations are 
adversely affected as the rupee appreciates/ depreciates against these currencies. The Company evaluates 
exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign exchange forward contracts 
to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Company follows 
established risk management policies, to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency. The 
Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange 
exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.
	
Company’s exposure to unhedged foreign currency risk as at March 31, 2023 in INR Mn is as follows:

Figures in brackets are for previous year i.e. as at March 31, 2022
	
	
Sensitivity:
	
For the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, every percentage point appreciation/depreciation in 
the exchange rate would have affected the Company's operating margins respectively:
-  INR/USD by approximately 0.54% and 0.56%,
-  INR/GBP by approximately 0.26% and 0.21%
-  INR/ZAR by approximately 0.19% and 0.21%,
	
Sensitivity analysis is computed based on changes in income and expenses, due to every percentage point 
appreciation/depreciation in the exchange rates.
	
	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and Option contracts 
to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these 
contracts is generally a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices 
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the 
marketplace. The foreign exchange forward contracts mature within twelve months from Balance Sheet.

ii.	 Valuation technique used to determine fair value:
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 2 financial instruments 
included in the above tables:
	
Derivative instruments: The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with banks with investment 
grade credit ratings. These are valued using the forward pricing valuation technique, using present value 
calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign 
exchange spot and forward rates. As at March 31, 2023, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material 
effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships.
26.	
Financial risk management:
	
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Company’s primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize 
potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the company is foreign 
exchange risk. The company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk 
exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purpose and not as trading or speculative instruments. 
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer 
and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. The demographics of the customer including the 
default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates also has an influence on credit risk 
assessment

normal course of business. The Company uses expected credit loss model to assess impairment loss or gain. The 
Company uses a matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenue. 
The provision matrix takes into account available external and internal credit risk factors and Company's historical 
experience for customers.

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with banks and 
financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. 
Investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units.
c)	 Liquidity risk:
	
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or 
at a reasonable price. The Company’s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as 
well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior 
management. Management monitors the Company’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis 
of expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and 
financial institutions.

The Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges 
to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast sale transactions. The related 
hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedging reserve are expected to occur and reclassified to the 
statement of profit or loss within 12 months.
	
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective 
remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be 
rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so 
that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is 
calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

b)	 Credit risk
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to INR 7,208 Mn and 
INR 9,291 Mn as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively and unbilled revenues amounting to INR 1,040 
Mn and INR 879 Mn as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Trade receivables and unbilled revenue 
are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the United States, South 
Africa, United Kingdom and elsewhere. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits 
and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the

ESOP)
	
Under the 2002 ESOP and 2006 ESOP schemes, participants are granted options which vest equally over 
a period of 5 years from the date of grant. Participation in the plan is at the discretion of the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee (NRC) and no individual has a contractual right to participate in the plan or to 
receive any guaranteed benefits.
- 	
The exercise price is determined based on the market price, being the closing price of the share on the 
stock exchange with higher trading volume on the day preceding the day of the grant of options. The 
scheme allows the NRC to set the exercise price at a premium or discount not exceeding 20% on the 
market price.
-	
The options remain exercisable for 10 years from date of vesting and lapse if they remain unexercised 
during this period.
-	
Options granted carry no dividend or voting rights. When exercisable, each option is convertible into one 
equity share.

33.	Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment atleast on an annual basis. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to a Cash Generated Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies arising from 
the business combinations. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
Goodwill has been allocated to Digital and Application Services segment.
Goodwill and other Intangible Assets with respect to Digital and Application Services operating segment acquired 
through acquisitions is further allocated to identified CGU i.e. Retail Consumer Services.
The carrying amount was computed by allocating the net assets to CGU’s for the purpose of impairment testing. 
The recoverable amount is computed based on value-in-use method using a forecast period of 5 years. The value-
in-use of respective CGU is based on the future cash flows using a discount rate range of 13.0-16.3% and 1.50% 
annual revenue growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years.
Goodwill movement is given below:

In respect of above, no impairment was identified as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 as the recoverable 
value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the sensitivity to a change in the key parameters 
(combination of revenue without growth and moderate growth) did not identify any probable scenarios where the 
CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amounts.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (as described in Notes 2(a) and 3 (a) to the consolidated financial statements)
The Group engages into various contracts for software 
development, and maintenance of software/hardware 
and related services . The contracts with customer’s 
have defined delivery milestones with agreed scope of 
work and pricing for each milestone based on the nature 
of service. On the basis of scope of work and terms, 
the pricing arrangement of these contracts is time and 
material and/or fixed price.
Our audit procedures include the following:
1.	
Obtained the understanding of the processes, 
systems and the controls implemented by the 
Group for recording and computing revenue and the 
associated contract assets and unearned revenue; 
and assessed the appropriateness of accounting 
policy with Ind AS 115.
2.	 Tested the design and operating effectiveness of 
management’s key internal financial controls around 
revenue recognition;
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue from fixed price, where the performance 
obligation is satisfied over a period of time has been 
recognised 
using 
the 
percentage 
of 
completion 
computed as per the input method based on Group’s 
estimate of total contract costs. Use of percentage -of-
completion method requires the determination the 
actual efforts or costs expended to date as proportion of 
estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred.
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised 
basis the time spent by employee/vendors on a contract 
as approved by the project manager. Such services are 
recognised as and when the services are rendered and/
or approved by the customers.
We identified revenue recognition as a key audit matter since :
•	
There is an inherent and presumed fraud risk around 
the revenue recognition considering application 
of revenue recognition standard is complex and 
involves number of key judgements and estimates 
mainly in identifying performance obligations, 
related transaction price (including estimates of 
variable consideration) and estimating the future 
cost to completion of the fixed price contracts, which 
is used to determine the percentage of completion 
of the relevant performance obligation; and
•	
Time and material contracts are billed basis approval 
of effort estimate by project manager and also 
through customer acceptances in certain cases; and
•	
At year end, significant amount of unbilled revenue 
related to these contracts are recognised on the 
balance sheet.
3.	 Tested sample revenue contracts and performed the 
following procedures to assess whether revenue is 
appropriately recognised as per principles of Ind AS 115 :
	
•	
Evaluated management’s assessment with respect 
to identification of performance obligation;
	
•	
Agreed the transaction price to the underlying 
contracts;
	
•	
In case of time and material type contract, 
tested samples to verify whether revenue has 
been correctly recorded based on approved 
effort estimate by project manager and where 
applicable, is backed by customer acceptances 
wherever revenue is invoiced to the customer;
	
•	
In respect of fixed price type contracts, tested 
samples to verify whether management has 
appropriately accrued revenue as per milestones 
defined in the contract with necessary approvals 
and the estimated cost to complete the contract 
is appropriate;
	
•	
Assessed aging of unbilled revenue as on the 
balance sheet date and in case of aged items 
obtained reasons for delays if any and expected 
timelines for invoicing of the same.
	
•	
Performed analytical procedures on unbilled 
revenue and customer margin’s and obtained 
reasons for significant variations in customer 
margins as compared to contracted margin if any.
	
•	
Obtained and read the disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements.
Impairment assessment of Goodwill (as described in Notes 2(f) , 3(e ) and 30 to the consolidated financial statements)
As at March 31, 2023, the group has the goodwill 
of INR 7,454 million pertaining to various business 
combinations which took place in the past. The carrying 
value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
using discounted cash flow models of recoverable 
value compared to the carrying value of assets. A deficit 
between recoverable value and carrying value would 
result in impairment. Determination of recoverable 
amount is complex and typically requires a high level of 
judgment, taking into account different geographies in 
which the Group operates.
The key assumptions to the impairment testing 
model includes:
•	
Projected revenue growth, operating margins and 
operating cash flows during the forecasted period,
•	
Long-term growth rate beyond explicit forecast 
period and in perpetuity; and
•	
Discount rate used
Our audit procedures include the following:
1.	
Assessed Group’s evaluation of identification of cash-
generating unit’s (CGU) and allocation of goodwill to 
the respective CGUs.
2.	 Tested design and operating effectiveness of 
management’s key internal controls over the 
impairment assessment process.
3.	 Involved 
our 
specialists 
evaluated 
the 
appropriateness of the model used and assessed the 
key assumptions of the cash flow forecasts including 
discount rates, expected growth rates and terminal 
growth rates used; in consideration of current and 
estimated future economic conditions.
4.	 Compared previous forecasts to actual results for 
the past three financial years to assess the historical 
accuracy of the forecasting process.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these 
assumptions and because of the materiality of the 
balance to the Consolidated financial statements of the 
Group, the matter is considered a key audit matter.
5.	 Analyzed the consistency of cash flow forecasts 
with estimates presented to the Board as part of the 
Budgeting process.
6.	 Assessed recoverable value headroom by performing 
sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.
7.	
Tested the arithmetic accuracy of the models
8.	 Obtained and read the disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements.

and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which 
have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for assessing 
the ability of their respective companies to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of their respective 
companies.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company has adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the Group of which we 
are the independent auditors and whose financial 
information we have audited, to express an opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements 
of such entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent 
auditors. For the other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements for the financial year ended March 
31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
(a)	 The consolidated financial statements of the Holding 
Company for the year ended March 31, 2022, included 
in these consolidated financial statements, have been 
audited by the predecessor auditor who expressed 
an unmodified opinion on those statements on May 
10, 2022.

ANNEXURE TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN 
DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
ZENSAR TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Zensar Technologies Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”) as of and for the 
year ended March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary , 
which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company 
and its subsidiary, which are companies incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Holding Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding 
Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's 
internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial 
Controls 
With 
Reference 
to 
Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary, 
which are companies incorporated in India, have, 
maintained in all material respects, adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and such internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31,2023, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Holding Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates 
to this 1 subsidiary, which is a company incorporated 
in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the 
auditors of such subsidiary in India.

1.	 Corporate Information
Zensar Technologies Limited (“Company”) is a public 
limited company incorporated and domiciled in 
India and has registered office at Zensar Knowledge 
Park, Plot # 4, MIDC, Kharadi, Off Nagar road, Pune, 
Maharashtra, India. The Company is listed on BSE 
Limited and National Stock Exchange of India 
Limited. The Company along with its subsidiaries 
(together hereinafter referred to as “the Group”) are 
engaged in providing a complete range of IT Services 
and Solutions. The Group's industry expertise spans 
across 
Manufacturing, 
Retail, 
Media, 
Banking, 
Insurance, Healthcare and Utilities.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the year 
ended March 31, 2023 were approved by the Board 
of Directors and authorised for issue on May 11, 2023.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented 
in INR and all amounts disclosed in the financial 
statements have been rounded off to nearest Mn, 
unless otherwise stated.
	
Basis of preparation:
	
Compliance with Ind AS:
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Group (“financial statements”) comply in all material 
aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”), read together with Rule 3 of the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 as amended from time to time, presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Act as 
applicable to the consolidated financial statements 
and other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
i.	
Historical cost convention:
The financial statements have been prepared on 
a historical cost basis, except for the following:
- 	
certain 
financial 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) which are 
measured at fair value;
- 	
defined benefit plans - plan assets measured 
at fair value;
- 	
share- based payments and
- 	
assets and liabilities arising in a business 
combination
	
ii.	 Current versus Non-current classification:
All assets and liabilities have been classified 
as current or non-current as per the Group’s 
operating cycle and other criteria set out in the 
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based 
on the nature of products and services and their 
settlement in cash and cash equivalents, the 
Group has ascertained its operating cycle as 
12 months for the purpose of current and non-
current classification of assets and liabilities.
	
iii.	 Principles of consolidation:
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise 
the financial statements of Zensar Technologies 
Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company and 
its subsidiaries constitute “the Group”). The 
Company consolidates all entities which are 
controlled by it.
The Group establishes control when; it has 
power over the entity, is exposed or has rights 
to variable returns from its involvement with 
the entity and has ability to affect the entity’s 
returns by using its power over the entity. The 
results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during 
the year are consolidated from the effective date 
of acquisition and up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate.
The financial statements of the Group companies 
are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and 
intragroup balances, transactions including 
unrealized gain / loss from such transactions and 
cash flows are eliminated upon consolidation. 
These financial statements are prepared by 
applying uniform accounting policies in use 
at the Group. Non-controlling interests which 
represent part of the net profit or loss and net 
assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or 
indirectly, owned or controlled by the Group, are 
excluded.
The difference between the fair value of 
consideration 
received 
from 
disposal 
of 
investment in subsidiary and the carrying amount 
of its assets (including goodwill) less liabilities as 
on the date of disposal along with cost of sell 
is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss being the profit or loss on such 
disposal of investment in subsidiary. In addition, 
any amounts previously recognised in the other 
comprehensive income are re-classified to the 
statement of profit and loss.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries 
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions. The carrying amount 
of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted to reflect changes in 
their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any 
difference between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the 
fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognized directly in equity and attributed to 
owners of the Group.
	
iv.	 Presentation and Functional currency:
Items included in the financial statements of 
each of Group entities are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates ('the functional 
currency'). The functional currency of the 
Company and its Indian subsidiaries is Indian 
Rupee (INR) and these financial statements 
are prepared in INR which is the presentation 
currency.
2.	 Summary 
of 
significant 
accounting 
policies
	
a)	 Revenue Recognition:
The Group earns revenue primarily from software 
development, 
maintenance 
of 
software/
hardware and related services, and sale of 
software licenses.
The Group’s contracts with customers include 
promises to transfer multiple products and 
services to a customer. Revenues from customer 
contracts 
are 
considered 
for 
recognition 
and measurement when the contract has 
been approved, in writing, by the parties 
to the contract, the parties to the contract 
are committed to perform their respective 
obligations under the contract, and the contract 
is legally enforceable. At the inception of every 
contract, transaction price and performance 
obligations are determined. Transaction price 
reflect amount of consideration expected to be 
received in exchange for transferring goods and 
services plus estimate of variable consideration 
i.e. discounts, price concession, rebates etc. 
Transaction price is allocated to identifiable 
performance obligations in a manner that depicts 
exchange for transferring of promised goods 
and services. Volume discounts are recorded 
as a reduction of revenue. When the amount 
of discount varies with the levels of revenue, 
volume discount is recorded based on estimate 
of future revenue from the customer.
The Group applies judgement to determine 
whether each product or services promised to a 
customer are capable of being distinct, and are 
distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the 
promised product or services are combined and 
accounted as a single performance obligation. 
The Group allocates the transaction price to 
separately identifiable performance obligations 
based on their relative stand-alone selling 
price. In cases where the Group is unable to 
determine the stand-alone selling price the 
Group uses expected cost-plus margin approach 
in estimating the stand-alone selling price.
The billing schedules agreed with customers 
include periodic performance based payments 
and / or milestone based progress payments. 
Invoices are payable within contractually agreed 
credit period.
	
	
i.	
Time and material contracts:
	
Revenues and costs relating to time and 
materials contracts are recognized as the 
related services are rendered.
	
	
ii.	
Fixed- price contracts:
	
Revenue for fixed-price contracts where 
performance obligations are satisfied over 
time is recognised using percentage-of-
completion method. In respect of such fixed-
price contracts, revenue is recognised using 
percentage-of-completion method (‘POC 
method’) of accounting with contract costs/
efforts incurred (input) determining the 
degree of completion of the performance 
obligation.
	
	
iii.	 Sale of licenses:
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer 
obtains a “right to use "the licenses is 
recognized at the time the license is made

Notes accompanying the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
Notes accompanying the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
available to the customer. Revenue from 
licenses where the customer obtains a “right to 
access” is recognized over the access period.
	
Contract assets are recognised when there 
is excess of revenue earned over billings on 
contracts. Contract assets are classified as 
unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is 
pending) when there is unconditional right 
to receive cash, and only passage of time is 
required, as per contractual terms.
	
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract 
liability”) is recognised when there is billings 
in excess of revenues.
	
b)	 Income Tax:
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognized in statement of 
profit and loss, except when they relate to items 
that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the 
current and deferred tax are also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, respectively.
	
	
i.	
Current Income Tax:
	
Current income tax for the current and prior 
periods are measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities based on the taxable income for 
the period. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the current tax amount are those 
that are enacted or substantively enacted as 
at the reporting date and applicable for the 
period. The current income tax expense for 
overseas subsidiaries has been computed 
based on the tax laws applicable to each 
subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction in 
which it operates.
	
The Group offsets current tax assets and 
current tax liabilities, where it has a legally 
enforceable right to set off the recognized 
amounts and where it intends either to settle 
on a net basis, or to realize the asset and 
liability simultaneously.
	
	
ii.	
Deferred Tax:
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for deductible and taxable 
temporary differences arising between the 
tax base of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amount in financial statements, 
except when the deferred income tax arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profits or loss at the 
time of the transaction.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the 
extent it is probable that taxable profit will 
be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilized.
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences except in 
respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries and foreign branches where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period 
when the asset is realized or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date.
	
The Group offsets deferred tax assets and 
liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable 
right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity, or on different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to 
settle the current tax liabilities and assets on 
a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities 
will be realized simultaneously.
	
Deferred Tax includes MAT credit, if any and 
it is recognized as an asset only when and to 
the extent there is convincing evidence that 
the Group will pay income tax higher than 
that computed under MAT, during the period 
that MAT is permitted to be set off under the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 for a specified period. 
Credit on account of MAT is recognized as an 
asset based on the management’s estimate 
of its recoverability in the future.
	
c)	 Leases:
	
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. The Group assesses whether 
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a 
contract. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, 
the group assesses whether: (1) the contract 
involves the use of an identified asset (2) the 
group has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period 
of the lease and (3) the group has the right to 
direct the use of the asset. 
	
	
Group as a lessee:
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Group recognises a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except 
for leases with a term of twelve months or less 
(short-term leases) and low value leases. For 
these short-term and low value leases, the Group 
recognises the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. Certain lease arrangements include 
the options to extend or terminate the lease 
before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and 
lease liabilities includes these options when it is 
reasonably certain that they will be exercised. 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the 
lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement date 
of the lease plus any initial direct costs less 
any lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses.
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life 
of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are 
evaluated for recoverability whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost 
to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an 
individual asset basis unless the asset does not 
generate cashflows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets. In such cases, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not 
readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates in the country of domicile of 
the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with 
a corresponding adjustment to the related right 
of use asset if the Group changes its assessment 
of whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
	
Lease liability and ROU asset are separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments are classified as cash flows used in 
financing activities.
	
	
Group as a lessor:
	
At the inception of the lease the Group classifies 
each of its leases as either an operating lease 
or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease 
payments received under operating leases as 
income on a straight- line basis over the lease 
term. In case of a finance lease, finance income 
is recognised over the lease term based on a 
pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of 
return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. 
When the Group is an intermediate lessor it 
accounts for its interests in the head lease and 
the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease 
classification of a sub-lease with reference to the 
right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, 
not with reference to the underlying asset. If 
a head lease is a short term lease to which the 
Group applies the exemption described above, 
then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating 
lease.

Whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified 
as a finance lease.
	
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease 
components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to 
allocate the consideration in the contract.
	
d)	 Foreign Currency Translation:
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. Foreign currency denominated 
monetary assets and liabilities are restated at 
the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting 
date and exchange gains and losses arising on 
settlement and restatement are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in foreign currencies are not 
restated.
	
Assets and liabilities of entities with functional 
currency other than the functional currency 
of the Group have been translated using 
exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. 
Statement of profit and loss of such entities 
has been translated using weighted average 
exchange rates. Translation adjustments have 
been reported as Foreign Currency Translation 
Reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity 
through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). On 
disposal of a foreign operation, the component of 
OCI relating to that particular foreign operation 
is recognised in profit and loss.
	
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on 
initial recognition of the related asset, expense 
or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of 
a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability 
relating to advance consideration, the date of 
the transaction is the date on which the Group 
initially recognises the non-monetary asset or 
non-monetary liability arising from the advance 
consideration. If there are multiple payments or 
receipts in advance, the Group determines the 
transaction date for each payment or receipt of 
advance consideration.
	
Goodwill and fair value adjustments to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising 
on the acquisition of a foreign operation are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the reporting date.
	
e)	 Business Combinations:
	
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The consideration 
transferred 
in 
a 
business 
combination 
is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the 
sum of acquisition date fair values of the assets 
transferred by the Group, liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities assumed by the Group 
to the former owners of the acquiree and the 
equity interests issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related 
costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as 
incurred.
	
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the 
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of 
the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. After 
initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
Intangible 
assets 
acquired 
in 
business 
combination are measured at fair value as of the 
date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is 
initially measured either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share 
of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. The choice of measurement basis 
is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of 
those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent 
changes in equity of subsidiaries.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses 
the financial assets and liabilities assumed for 
appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date.
	
When the consideration transferred by the 
group in a business combination includes 
assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
arrangement, the contingent consideration is 
measured at its acquisition date fair value and 
included as part of the consideration transferred 
in 
a 
business 
combination. 
Contingent 
consideration that is classified as an asset or 
liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates in accordance with Ind AS 109 Financial 
Instruments or Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets, with the 
corresponding gain or loss being recognised in 
profit or loss.
	
If the initial accounting for a business combination 
is incomplete by the end of the reporting period 
in which the combination occurs, the Group 
reports provisional amounts for the items for 
which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted through 
goodwill during the measurement period, or 
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to 
reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date 
that, if known, would have affected the amounts 
recognized at that date. These adjustments are 
called as measurement period adjustments. The 
measurement period does not exceed one year 
from the acquisition date.
	
f)	 Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
Goodwill and intangible assets that have 
an indefinite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation 
and 
are 
tested 
annually 
for 
impairment, or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that they 
might be impaired. Other assets are tested 
for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognized for the amount by which the 
asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. For the purpose of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash inflows which are largely independent of 
the cash inflows from other assets or group of 
assets (cash-generating units).
	
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that 
suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible 
reversal of the impairment at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
g)	 Cash and Cash Equivalents:
	
For the purposes of presentation in the statement 
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits 
with original maturities of three months or less 
that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and cash equivalents which are subject 
to insignificant risk of changes in value and net 
of outstanding bank overdraft. Cash and cash 
equivalents consist of balances with banks which 
are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
	
h)	 Inventories:
	
Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net 
realizable value including necessary provision 
for obsolescence. Cost is determined using 
weighted average method. Cost of inventories 
comprises of all costs of purchase and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition.
i )	 Investments and other financial assets 
and liabilities:
	
	
i.	
Classification:
	
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or issue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (other than financial assets and 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss) are added to or deducted from the 
fair value measured on initial recognition of 
financial asset or financial liability.
	
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset 
only when the contractual rights to the 
cash flows from the asset expire, or when it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership

of the asset to another entity. The Group 
derecognises 
financial 
liabilities 
when, 
and only when, the Group’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or have expired.
	
	
ii.	
Initial recognition:
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets 
not recorded at fair value through profit or 
loss, transaction costs that are attributable to 
the acquisition of the financial asset.
	
The Group intends to hold its investment 
in open ended target maturity funds till 
maturity. It may be noted that these funds 
have a pre-determined maturity date. These 
funds follow a passive buy and hold strategy; 
in which the existing underlying investment 
bonds are expected to be held till maturity 
unless sold for meeting redemptions or 
rebalancing requirements as stated in the 
scheme document. In our view, such strategy 
mitigates intermittent price volatility in open 
ended target maturity funds’ underlying 
investments; and investors who remain 
invested until maturity are expected to 
mitigate the market/volatility risk to a large 
extent. Based on this, the Group believes 
that the investments in open ended target 
maturity funds meet the requirements of SPPI 
(solely payments of principal and interest) 
test as per the requirements of Ind AS 109.
	
	
iii.	 Measurement:
	
	
	
Financial assets carried at amortized cost:
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at 
amortized cost if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold the asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and 
the contractual terms of the financial asset 
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI):
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured 
at fair value through other comprehensive 
income if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets and the contractual terms 
of the financial asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal 
amount 
outstanding. 
Further, 
in 
cases 
where the Group has made an irrevocable 
election based on its business model, for its 
investments which are classified as equity 
instruments, the subsequent changes in fair 
value are recognized in other comprehensive 
income.
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL):
	
A financial asset which is not classified in any 
of the above categories are subsequently fair 
valued through profit or loss.
	
The Group determines classification of 
financial assets and liabilities on initial 
recognition. After initial recognition, no 
reclassification is made for financial assets 
which are equity instruments and financial 
liabilities. For financial assets which are 
debt instruments, a reclassification is made 
only if there is a change in the business 
model for managing those assets. Changes 
to the business model are expected to be 
infrequent. The Group’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as 
a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Group’s operations. 
If the Group reclassifies financial assets, it 
applies the reclassification prospectively 
from the reclassification date following the 
change in business model. The Group does 
not restate any previously recognised gains, 
losses (including impairment gains or losses) 
or interest.
iv.	 Impairment of financial assets (other than 
at fair value):
	
The Group assesses at each reporting date 
whether a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets and contract assets (unbilled 
revenue) is impaired. The Group recognises 
loss allowances, in accordance with IND AS 
109, using the expected credit loss (ECL) 
model for the financial assets which are 
not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss 
allowance for trade receivables and unbilled 
revenue 
with 
no 
significant 
financing 
component is measured at an amount equal 
to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, 
expected credit losses are measured at an 
amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless 
there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk from initial recognition in which 
case those are measured at lifetime ECL. The 
amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) 
that is required to adjust the loss allowance 
at the reporting date is recognized as an 
impairment gain or loss in the statement of 
profit or loss.
	
j)	
Interest and Dividend income:
	
Dividend income is recorded when the right to 
receive payment is established. Interest income 
is recognised using the effective interest method.
	
k)	 Derivatives and hedging activities:
The Group designates certain foreign exchange 
forward, currency options and futures contracts 
as hedge instruments in respect of foreign 
exchange risks. These hedges are accounted 
for as cash flow hedges/fair value hedges, as 
applicable.
The Group uses hedging instruments that are 
governed by the policies of the Group which are 
approved by their respective Board of Directors. 
The policies provide written principles on the 
use of such financial derivatives consistent with 
the risk management strategy of the Group and 
its subsidiaries. The Group enters into derivative 
financial instruments where the counterparty is 
primarily a bank.
The hedge instruments are designated and 
documented as hedges at the inception of the 
contract. The Group determines the existence 
of an economic relationship between the 
hedging instrument and hedged item based 
on the currency, amount and timing of their 
respective cash flows. The effectiveness of 
hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated 
with the exposure being hedged is assessed 
and measured at inception and on an ongoing 
basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no 
longer expected to occur, then the amounts 
that have been accumulated in other equity are 
immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange 
gains/loss in the statement of profit and loss.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges 
are classified as:
- 	
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure 
to changes in the fair value of a recognized 
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm 
commitment.
- 	
Cash flow hedges when hedging the 
exposure to variability in cash flows that 
is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognized asset or liability 
or a highly probable forecast transaction or 
the foreign currency risk in an unrecognized 
firm commitment
- 	
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign 
operation
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative 
financial instruments are measured as described 
below:
	
	
Cash flow hedges:
Changes in the fair value of the derivative 
hedging instrument designated as a cash flow 
hedge are recognized in other comprehensive 
income and held in cash flow hedging reserve, 
net of taxes, a component of equity, to the extent 
that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the 
hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss and 
reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), 
net within results from operating activities. If the 
hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognized in cash flow 
hedging reserve till the period the hedge was 
effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve 
until the forecasted transaction occurs.

The 
cumulative 
gain 
or 
loss 
previously 
recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is 
transferred to the statement of profit and loss 
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted 
transaction.
The Group enters into the contracts that 
are effective as hedges from an economic 
perspective but may not qualify for hedge 
accounting. The change in the fair value of such 
instrument is recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
l)	
Offsetting financial instruments:
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the 
net amount is reported in the balance sheet 
where there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognized amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis or realize the asset on 
a net basis or realize the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable 
right must not be contingent on future events 
and must be enforceable in the normal course of 
business and in the event of default, insolvency 
or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.
	
m)	 Property, plant and equipment:
	
	
i.	
Recognition and measurement:
	
Property, plant and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Cost includes 
expenditures directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. General and specific 
borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the construction of a qualifying asset are 
capitalized as part of the cost.
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost.
	
When parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, 
they are accounted for as separate items 
(major components) of property, plant 
and equipment. Subsequent expenditure 
relating to property, plant and equipment 
is capitalized only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with 
these will flow to the Group and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably.
	
The carrying amount of any component 
accounted for as a separate asset is 
derecognized when replaced.
	
All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
charged to profit and loss in the reporting 
period in which they occur.
	
An item of Property, Plant and Equipment 
is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. 
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an item of Property, Plant and 
Equipment are determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment 
not available for use before year end date are 
disclosed under capital work- in-progress, 
net of impairment losses, if any and are not 
depreciated.
	
An asset's carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if 
the carrying amount o the assets or cash 
generating unit (CGU) as applicable, is 
greater than its estimated recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
ii.	
Depreciation:
	
The Group depreciates property, plant and 
equipment on a straight-line basis as per the 
estimated useful lives. The estimated useful 
lives of property, plant and equipment are as 
follows:
Class of asset
Useful life
Buildings
30 years
Electrical Installations and 
equipments
5 years
Furniture and fixtures
3-10 years
Office Equipments
3-10 years
Data processing Equipments
3-5 years
Vehicles
5 years
	
Assets 
acquired 
under 
leasehold 
improvements 
are 
amortized 
over 
the 
shorter of estimated useful life of the asset 
or the related lease term.
	
The assets’ residual values, useful lives 
and methods of depreciation are reviewed 
at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
n)	 Intangible Assets:
	
Intangible assets other than those acquired in a 
business combination are measured at cost at 
the date of acquisition.
	
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
	
Internally generated intangible asset arising 
from development activity is recognized at cost 
on demonstration of its technical feasibility, the 
intention and ability of the Group to complete, 
use or sell it, only if, it is probable that the asset 
would generate future economic benefit and the 
expenditure attributable to the said assets during 
its development can be measured reliably.
	
An item of Intangible assets is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of Intangible assets are 
determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in the profit or loss.
	
	
Amortisation periods and methods for all 
Intangible Assets, including those arising from 
business combination:
	
Intangible assets are amortized on straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives which are 
as follows:
Class of Intangible 
Assets
Useful life followed 
by the Group
Softwares (acquired)
1-5 y ears
Softwares (internally 
generated)
3-5 years
Non-compete 
agreements
3-6 years
Customer relationship
4-10 years
Customer contracts
1 -3 y ears
Brand
3-5 years
	
The estimated useful life of amortizable intangible 
assets are reviewed and where appropriate are 
adjusted, annually.
	
o)	 Provisions and contingent liabilities:
	
Provisions are recognized when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation.
	
When some or all of the economic benefits 
required to settle a provision are expected to 
be recovered from a third party, the receivable 
is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain 
that reimbursement will be received and the 
amount of the receivable can be measured 
reliably. The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the statement of profit and loss net 
of any reimbursement.
	
When a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, 
its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash flows (when the effect of the time value of 
money is material)
	
The Group uses significant judgement to disclose 
contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are 
disclosed when there is a possible obligation 
arising from past events, the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of 
the Group or a present obligation that arises 
from past events where it is either not probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the 
amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are 
neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial 
statements.
	
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived 
by the Group from a contract are lower than 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract. Provisions for 
onerous contracts are measured at the present 
value of lower of the expected net cost of 
fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of 
terminating the contract.

p)	 Employee benefits:
	
	
i.	
Post-employment and pension plans:
	
The Group participates in various employee 
benefit plans. Pensions and other post-
employment benefits are classified as either 
defined contribution plans or defined benefit 
plans. Under a defined contribution plan, 
the Group’s only obligation is to pay a fixed 
amount with no obligation to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold 
sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. 
The related actuarial and investment risks 
fall on the employee. The expenditure for 
defined contribution plans is recognized 
as an expense during the period when the 
employee provides service. Under a defined 
benefit plan, it is the Group’s obligation to 
provide agreed benefits to the employees. 
The related actuarial and investment risks 
fall on the Group. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligations is calculated by 
an independent actuary using the projected 
unit credit method.
	
The Group has the following employee 
benefit plans:
	
	
	
Provident Fund:
	
Employees 
receive 
benefits 
from 
a 
provident fund, which is a defined benefit 
plan. The employer and employees each 
make periodic contributions to the plan. 
Provident fund contributions are made 
to a trust administered by the Group. The 
contributions to the trust managed by the 
Group are accounted for as a defined benefit 
plan as the Group is liable for any shortfall, if 
any with respect to the rate of return based 
on the government specified minimum rates 
of return.
	
The Group’s liability is actuarially determined 
(using the Projected Unit Credit method) 
at the end of the year. Actuarial losses/ 
gains are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year in which they 
arise. The contributions made to the trust 
are recognised as plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligation recognised in the balance 
sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation as reduced by the 
fair value of plan assets.
	
	
	
Defined contribution plans
	
The Group provides benefits such as 
superannuation, 
provident 
fund 
(other 
than Company managed fund) and foreign 
defined contribution plans (401K, National 
Insurance in UK, etc) to its employees which 
are treated as defined contribution plans.
	
Contributions to defined contribution plans 
are recognised as expense when employees 
have rendered services entitling them to 
such benefits.
	
	
	
Gratuity:
	
The Group provides for gratuity, a defined 
benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering 
eligible employees in accordance with the 
Scheme. The Gratuity plan provides for a 
lump sum payment to eligible employees, 
at retirement, death, incapacitation or 
termination of employment based on the last 
drawn salary and years of employment with 
the Group. The gratuity fund is managed 
by the Life Insurance Corporation of India 
(LIC). The Group’s obligation in respect 
of the gratuity plan, is provided for based 
on actuarial valuation using the projected 
unit credit method. The Group recognises 
actuarial gains and losses immediately in 
other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
	
The retirement benefit obligation recognized 
in the Balance Sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognized past service 
cost, and as reduced by the fair value of 
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the scheme.
	
	
ii.	
Short-term benefits:
	
Short-term employee benefit obligations 
are measured on an undiscounted basis 
and are recorded as expense as the related 
services are provided. Liabilities for wages 
and salaries including the amount expected 
to be paid under short-term cash bonus or 
profit sharing plans, expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the 
period in which the employees render the 
related service are recognized if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service 
provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
	
	
iii.	 Compensated absences:
	
The employees of the Group are entitled 
to compensated absences. The employees 
can carry forward a portion of the unutilized 
accumulating compensated absences and 
utilize it in future periods or receive cash at 
retirement or termination of employment. 
The 
Group 
records 
an 
obligation 
for 
compensated absences in the period in 
which the employee renders the services 
that increases this entitlement.
	
The Group’s liability is actuarially determined 
(using the Projected Unit Credit method) at 
the end of each year, as applicable. Actuarial 
losses/ gains are recognized in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss in the year in which they 
arise.
	
Accumulated compensated absences, which 
are expected to be availed or encashed 
within 12 months from the end of the year 
are classified under current liabilities and 
balance under non-current liabilities.
	
	
iv.	 Share-based payments:
	
Selected employees of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled 
instruments, for rendering services over a 
defined vesting period. The cost of equity-
settled transactions is determined by the 
fair value at the date when the grant is made 
using an appropriate valuation model.
	
The cost under employee benefits expense is 
recognised, together with a corresponding 
change in Share Based Payment Reserves 
under Other Equity, over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions 
are 
fulfilled. 
The 
cumulative 
expense 
recognised for equity-settled transactions 
at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Group’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. Service and non-market 
performance conditions are not taken into 
account when determining the grant date 
fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the 
conditions being met is assessed as part of 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
Market performance conditions are reflected 
within the grant date fair value. Any other 
conditions attached to an award, but without 
an associated service requirement, are 
considered to be non-vesting conditions. 
Non-vesting conditions are reflected in 
the fair value of an award and lead to an 
immediate expensing of an award unless 
there are also service and/or performance 
conditions.
	
No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have 
not been met. Where awards include a market 
or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the 
market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or 
service conditions are satisfied.
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised 
is the expense had the terms had not been 
modified, if the original terms of the award 
are met. An additional expense is recognised 
for any modification that increases the 
total fair value of the share-based payment 
transaction or is otherwise beneficial to 
the employee as measured at the date of 
modification. Where an award is cancelled 
by the entity or by the counterparty, any 
remaining element of the fair value of the 
award is expensed immediately through 
profit or loss.
	
q)	 Assets held for Sale
	
Non-current assets (or disposal group) are 
classified as held for sale if their carrying amount 
will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through containing use 
and a sale is considered highly probable. They 
are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less cost to sell, except 
for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets 
arising 
from 
employee 
benefits, 
financial 
assets and contractual rights under insurance

contracts, which are specifically exempt from 
this requirement.
	
An impairment loss is recognized for any initial 
or subsequent write –down of the asset (or 
disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A 
gain is recognized for any subsequent increase 
in fair value less costs sell of an asset (or disposal 
group), but not in excess of any cumulative 
impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or 
loss not previously recognized by the date of the 
sale of the non –current asset (or disposal group) 
is recognized at the date of de-recognition.
	
Non-current assets (including those that are part 
of a disposal group) comprising of assets and 
liabilities are classified as ‘held for sale’ when 
all the following criteria are met: (i) decision has 
been made to sell, (ii) the assets are available for 
immediate sale in its present condition, (iii) the 
assets are being actively marketed and (iv) sale 
has been agreed or is expected to be concluded 
within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
	
Non-current assets are not depreciated or 
amortised while they are classified as held for 
sale. Interest and other expenses attributable 
to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as 
held for sale continue to recognized.
	
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and 
the assets of a disposal group classified as held 
for sale are presented separately from the other 
assets in balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal 
group classified as held for sale are presented 
separately from other liabilities in balance sheet.
	
A discontinued operations is a component of the 
entity that has been disposed of or is classified 
as held for sale and that represents a separate 
major line of business or geographical area of 
operations, is part of a single coordinated plan 
to dispose of such a line of business or area of 
operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively 
with a view to resale. The results of discontinued 
operations are presented separately in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
r )	 Contributed Equity:
	
Equity shares are classified as equity.
	
Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.
	
s)	 Dividends:
	
Dividend on share is recorded as liability on the 
date of approval by the shareholders in case of 
final dividend; or by the board of directors in case 
of interim dividend. A corresponding amount is 
recognized directly in equity.
	
t)	 Fair value measurement
	
The Group measures financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance 
sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer 
the liability takes place either:
•	
In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
•	
In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or 
liability
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Group. The fair value 
of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best 
interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability 
to generate economic benefits by using the 
asset in its highest and best use or by selling it 
to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value 
is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial 
instruments measured using quoted prices. This 
includes listed equity instruments and mutual 
funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all 
equity instruments (including bonds) which are 
traded in the stock exchange are valued using 
the closing price as at the reporting period.
	
Level 2: Fair value of financial instruments that 
are not traded in an active market (for example, 
traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) but 
is determined using valuation techniques which 
maximize the use of observable market data 
and rely as little as possible on entity-specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to 
fair value an instrument as observable, the 
instrument is included in level 2.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs 
is not based on observable data, the instrument 
is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted 
equity securities, contingent consideration and 
indemnification assets.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
The 
Management 
determines 
the 
policies 
and procedures for both recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments 
and unquoted financial assets measured at fair 
value, and for non-recurring measurement, such 
as assets held for sale in discontinued operations.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Group has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
u )	 Operating Segments
	
Information reported to the chief operating 
decision maker (CODM) for the purposes of 
resource allocation and assessment of segment 
performance focuses on the types of goods or 
services delivered or provided.
	
The Board of Directors examines the Group's 
performance based on the services, products 
and geographic perspective and has identified 
below mentioned reportable segments of its 
business as follows:
	
Digital and Application Services (DAS): Custom 
Applications Management Services that include 
Application 
Development, 
Maintenance, 
Support, Modernisation and Testing Services 
across a wide technology spectrum and Industry 
verticals.
	
Digital Foundation Services (DFS): Infrastructure 
management services includes Hybrid IT, Digital 
workplace, Dynamic Security and Unified IT 
provided under managed service platform using 
automation, autonomics and machine learning.
	
The Board of Directors monitors the operating 
results of its business units separately for the 
purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation 
and 
performance 
assessment. 
Segment performance is evaluated based on 
profit or loss and is measured consistently 
with profit or loss in the consolidated financial 
statements.
	
v)	 Government grants
	
Government grants are recognised where there 
is reasonable assurance that the grant will be 
received, and all attached conditions will be 
complied with. When the grant relates to an 
expense item, it is recognised as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods that the related 
costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are 
expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it 
is recognised as income in equal amounts over 
the expected useful life of the related asset.
	
w )	Earnings per share:
	
The basic earnings per share is computed by 
dividing the net profit for the period attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. The number of shares used in computing 
diluted earnings per share comprises the 
weighted average shares considered for deriving 
basic earnings per share and also the weighted 
average number of equity shares which would 
have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive 
potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity 
shares are deemed converted as of the beginning 
of the period unless they have been issued at a 
later date.

2.1 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
MCA 
issued 
amendments 
to 
certain 
Indian 
Accounting Standards (called as “Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022”) 
which were applicable from 1 April 2022 and these 
amendments didn’t have a significant impact on the 
financial statements.
	
On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and 
issued rules called as Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 which are 
applicable from 1 April 2023. Key amendments are 
summarised below:
	
Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements
	
The amendments require companies to disclose 
their material accounting policies rather than their 
significant accounting policies. Accounting policy 
information, together with other information, is 
material when it can reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions of primary users of general 
purpose financial statements.
	
Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors
	
This amendment has introduced a definition of 
‘accounting estimates’ which will help entities 
to distinguish between accounting policies and 
accounting estimates. The definition of a change 
in accounting estimates has been replaced with a 
definition of accounting estimates. Under the new 
definition, accounting estimates are “monetary 
amounts in financial statements that are subject 
to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop 
accounting estimates if accounting policies require 
items in financial statements to be measured in a way 
that involves measurement uncertainty.
	
Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes - This amendment has 
narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exemption 
so that it does not apply to transactions that give rise 
to equal and offsetting temporary differences.
	
The 
Group 
have 
evaluated 
these 
accounting 
pronouncements and does not expect the amendments 
to have significant impact on its financial statements.
3.	 Critical estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the financial statements requires 
management 
to 
make 
judgements, 
estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and 
the accompanying disclosures and including the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the reporting 
date. However, any change in these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes that require a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets 
or liabilities affected in future periods.
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, 
information about significant areas of estimation, 
uncertainty and critical judgements in applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognized in the financial 
statements are included in the following notes:
	
The areas involving critical estimates and/or 
judgements are:	 	
	
	
	
a	
Revenue recognition	
	
	
	
	
A portion of the Group’s business relates to 
fixed price contracts which is accounted using 
percentage of completion method, recognizing 
revenue as the performance on the contract 
progresses. Use of the percentage-of-completion 
method requires the Group to estimate the 
efforts or costs expended to date ( input method) 
as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be 
expended. Efforts or costs expended have been 
used to measure progress towards completion 
as there is a direct relationship between input 
and productivity. Provisions for estimated losses, 
if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded 
in the period in which such losses become 
probable based on the expected contract 
estimates at the reporting date. This requires 
management to make judgement with respect to 
identifying contracts for which revenue need to 
be recognised over a period of time, depending 
upon when the customer consumes the benefit, 
when the control is passed to customer, and 
whether the Group has right to payment 
for performance completed till date, either 
contractually or legally.
	
b	
Income and Deferred taxes
	
	
Significant 
judgements 
are 
involved 
in 
determining the provision for income taxes, 
including judgment on whether tax positions are 
probable of being sustained in tax assessments. 
The management considers the probability of 
an unfavourable outcome while deciding on the 
need of accrual of tax with respect to ongoing 
tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve 
complex issues, which can only be resolved 
over extended time periods. Refer note 2(b) for 
Accounting policy in this regard.
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
is 
recorded 
on 
temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date,  as explained under Note 
2 (b) (ii). The ultimate realisation of deferred 
tax assets is dependent upon the generation 
of future taxable profits during the periods in 
which those temporary differences and tax loss 
carry forwards become deductible. The Group 
considers the expected reversal of deferred tax 
liabilities and projected future taxable income 
in making this assessment. The amount of 
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, 
however, could be reduced in the near term if 
estimates of future taxable income during the 
carry-forward period are reduced.
c	
Property, plant and equipment	 	
	
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a 
significant proportion of the asset base of 
the Group. The charge in respect of periodic 
depreciation is derived after determining an 
estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the 
expected residual value at the end of its life. The 
useful lives and residual values of Group’s assets 
are determined by management at the time the 
asset is acquired and reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period. The lives are based on historical 
experience with similar assets as well as anticipation 
of future events, which may impact their life, such 
as changes in technology. The policy for the same 
has been explained under note 2(m).
	
d	
Business combination	
	
	
	
	
	
In 
accounting 
for 
business 
combinations, 
judgement is required in identifying whether an 
identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded 
separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating 
the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent 
consideration involves management judgement. 
These measurements are based on information 
available at the acquisition date and are based 
on expectations and assumptions that have been 
deemed reasonable by management. Changes in 
these judgements, estimates, and assumptions 
can materially affect the results of operations.
	
e	
Goodwill	 	
	
	
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually once or 
when events occur or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit to which such goodwill pertains is 
less than its carrying value. The recoverable amount 
of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use and 
fair value less cost to sell. The calculation involves 
use of significant estimates and assumptions which 
includes turnover and earnings multiples, growth 
rates and net margins used to calculate projected 
future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future 
economic and market conditions.
	
f	
Defined benefit obligation	 	
	
	
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit plans and the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation 
are based on actuarial valuation using the 
projected unit credit method. An actuarial 
valuation involves various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. 
Due to the complexities involved in the valuation 
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these 
assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting date. Also refer note 14.
	
g	
Employee stock options		
	
	
	
	
The Group initially measures the cost of equity-
settled transactions with employees using a Black 
Scholes Options Pricing model to determine the 
fair value of the liability incurred. Estimating 
fair value for share-based payment transactions 
requires determination of the most appropriate 
valuation model and the performance of the 
Group, which is dependent on the terms and 
conditions of the grant.
	
	
This estimate also requires determination of 
the most appropriate inputs to the valuation 
model including the expected life of the share 
option, volatility and dividend yield and making 
assumptions about them.
	
	
The assumptions and models used for estimating 
fair value for share-based payment transactions 
are disclosed in note 38.

(vi)	General Reserve:
The general reserve is a free reserve which is 
used from time to time to transfer profits from 
retained earnings for appropriation purposes. 
As the general reserve is created by a transfer 
from one component of equity to another and 
is not an item of other comprehensive income, 
items included in the general reserve will not be 
reclassified subsequently to statement of profit 
and loss.
	
(vii)	Special economic zone re-investment reserve:
This Reserve had been created out of profit 
of eligible SEZ units in accordance with the 
provision of Section 10 AA(1)(ii) of the Income Tax 
Act,1961. The reserve can only be utilized by the 
Company for acquiring new plant and machinery 
for the purpose of its business in terms of the 
section 10AA(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
	
(viii) Effective portion of Cash Flow Hedges
The Group uses hedging instruments as part 
of its management of foreign currency risk 
associated with its highly probable forecast 
sales. For hedging foreign currency risk, the 
Group uses forward contracts which are 
designated as cash flow hedges. To the extent 
this hedge is effective, the change in fair value 
of the hedging instrument is recognised in the 
cash flow hedging reserve. Amounts recognised 
in the hedging reserve are reclassified to profit or 
loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
	
(ix)	Equity 
Instruments 
through 
Other 
Comprehensive Income
	
The Group has elected to recognise changes in 
the fair value of certain investments in equity 
securities in other comprehensive income. 
These changes are accumulated within the 
FVOCI equity instruments reserve within equity. 
The Group transfers amounts from this reserve 
to retained earnings when the underlying 
transaction is consummated.
	
(x)	 Exchange 
differences 
on 
translating 
the 
financial statements of a foreign operation
	
Exchange differences arising on translation 
of the foreign operations are recognised in 
other comprehensive income as described 
in accounting policy and accumulated in a 
separate reserve within equity. The cumulative 
amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the 
net investment is disposed of.

As at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, plan assets were primarily invested in insurer managed funds.	 	
d	
Through its defined benefit plans, the group is exposed to number of risks, the most significant of which are 
detailed below:
	
Asset Volatility: The Plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields. If plan 
assets underperform, this yield will create a deficit. The plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with 
high grades. These are subject to interest rate risk.
	
Changes in bond yield: A decrease in bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset 
by an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings.
	
The Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework 
that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee 
benefit plans. Within the framework, the group's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by 
investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and 
in the appropriate currency.
	
The Group actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the 
expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The group has not changed the process 
used to manage its risks from previous periods.	 	
	
	
e	
The Group expects to contribute INR 16 Mn (March 31, 2022 INR 138 Mn) to the defined benefit plan during the next 
annual reporting period.
	
Weighted average duration of the Projected Benefit Obligation is 5 Years (March 31, 2022 - 6 Years)

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Group’s benefit obligations as of 
March 31, 2023.
fa	 Sensitivity analysis - the increase  / (decrease) in present value of defined benefit obligation to changes in principal 
assumptions:

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions 
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

(b)	 Trade Receivables and Contract Balances		
	
The Group classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as unbilled 
revenue.	
	
	
	
A receivable is right to consideration that is unconditional upon passage of time. Revenue for time and material 
contracts are recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance  contracts 
is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as 
unbilled revenue and is classified as a financial asset for these cases as right to consideration is unconditional 
upon passage of time.	 	
	
	
Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion 
method. Invoicing to clients is based on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing 
of revenue recognition being different from the timing of billing the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed 
price development contracts is classified as non financial assets as the contractual right to consideration is 
dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
	
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.
	
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.	 	
	
	
	
(c)	 Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations	
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to 
be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when Group expects to recognize 
these amounts as revenue. Applying the practical expedients as given in INDAS 115, the Group has not disclosed 
the remaining performance obligations related disclosures where the revenue recognized corresponds 
directly with the value to customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts 
where invoicing is on the basis of time and material basis. Remaining performance obligation are subject 
to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, 
periodic revalidations, adjustment of revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency.
	
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations 
is INR 720 Mn [March 31, 2022: INR 3,020 Mn] out of which INR 683 Mn [March 31, 2022: INR 1,850 Mn] is 
expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from 
contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

Fair value hierarchy:
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial 
instruments that are
(a) recognised and measured at fair value, and
(b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements.
To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has 
classified its financial instruments into three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An explanation 
of each level follows underneath the table.

iii.	 Valuation technique used to determine fair value:
	
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 2 financial instruments 
included in the above tables:
	
	
Derivative instruments: The Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts with banks with investment 
grade credit ratings. These are valued using the forward pricing valuation technique, using present value 
calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign 
exchange spot and forward rates. As at March 31, 2023, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material 
effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships.
	
	
The main level 3 inputs for above mentioned cases used by the Group are derived and evaluated as follows:
	
	
1.	
Unquoted Equity instruments are valued based on expected cash flows discounted using weighted 
average cost of capital.

3.	 Contingent consideration: Fair value of contingent consideration is based on management's assessment 
of probable consideration payable discounted using weighted average cost of capital.
26.	
Financial risk management:
	
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential 
adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The 
Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. Derivatives 
are used exclusively for hedging purpose and not as trading or speculative instruments. The Group's exposure 
to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of 
risk from the top few customers. The demographics of the customer including the default risk of the industry 
and country in which the customer operates also has an influence on credit risk assessment.
	
a)	 Market Risk:
	
i.	
Foreign currency risk:
	
The Group operates globally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and 
consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United 
States, South Africa, United Kingdom and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign 
currencies. The exchange rate between the rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent 
years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations are 
adversely affected as the rupee appreciates/ depreciates against these currencies. The Group evaluates 
exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to 
mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group follows established 
risk management policies, to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency. The Group has 
designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of 
forecasted highly probable cash flows.
	
Group's exposure to unhedged foreign currency risk as at March 31, 2023 in INR Mn is as follows:

The Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to 
mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast sale transactions. The related 
hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedging reserve are expected to occur and reclassified to the 
statement of profit or loss within 12 months.
	
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective 
remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be 
rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so 
that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is 
calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.
	
	
Sensitivity:
	
For the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, every percentage point appreciation/depreciation in 
the exchange rate would have affected the Company's operating margins respectively:
- INR/USD by approximately 0.12% and 0.01%,
- INR/GBP by approximately 0.00% and 0.00%,
- INR/ZAR by approximately -0.01% and 0.01%,
- INR/EUR by approximately 0.10% and 0.02%,
	
Sensitivity analysis is computed based on changes in income and expenses, due to every percentage point 
appreciation/depreciation in the exchange rates.
	
	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and Option contracts to 
mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these 
contracts is generally a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices 
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the 
marketplace. The foreign exchange forward contracts mature within twelve months from Balance Sheet.

b)	 Credit risk
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The 
maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to 
INR 7,298 Mn and INR 7,967 Mn as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively and unbilled revenues 
amounting to INR 3,016 Mn and INR 3,255 Mn as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Trade 
receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers 
located in United States, Europe, South Africa, and elsewhere. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, 
establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Group 
grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Group uses expected credit loss model to assess 
impairment loss or gain. The Group uses a matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade 
receivables and unbilled revenue. The provision matrix takes into account available external and internal credit 
risk factors and Group's historical experience for customers.
	
The movement in allowance for life time expected credit loss on customer balances for the year ended March 
31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is given below:

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Group generally invests in deposits with banks and 
financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. 
Investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units.
	
c)	 Liquidity risk:
	
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at 
a reasonable price. The Group’s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well 
as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior 
management. Management monitors the Group’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis 
of expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks 
and financial institutions.
	
The table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of significant financial 
liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of

27.	Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as going concern while maximizing the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group is not subject to any

Income and expenditure in relation to segments is categorised based on items that are individually identifiable to 
the segment, marketing costs are allocated based on revenue and the remainder of the costs are allocated based on 
resources. Certain expenses like depreciation are not specifically allocable to a segment as the underlying assets are 
used interchangeably.
Finance income and costs, and fair value gains and losses on financial assets are not allocated to individual segments 
as the underlying instruments are managed at group basis. Also, Current tax, deferred taxes are not allocated to those 
segments as they are also managed on a group basis.
Assets and liabilities used in the Group’s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are 
used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable or meaningful 
to provide further segregation of assets and liabilities, geographical or otherwise.
Geographical information on revenue and business segment revenue information is collated based on individual 
customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognised.

30.	Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment atleast on an annual basis. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to a Cash Generated Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies arising from 
the business combinations. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
Goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segment:

The carrying amount was computed by allocating the net assets to CGU’s for the purpose of impairment testing. 
The recoverable amount is computed based on value-in-use method using a forecast period of 5 years. The value-
in-use of respective CGU is based on the future cash flows using a discount rate range of 13.0-16.3% and 1.50% 
annual revenue growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years.
Goodwill movement is given below:

In respect of above, no impairment was identified as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 as the recoverable 
value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the sensitivity to a change in the key parameters 
(combination of revenue without growth and moderate growth) did not identify any probable scenarios where the 
CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amounts.

i.	
M3bi India Private Limited (M3Bi India) and M3Bi LLC delivers high quality data engineering, analytics and AI/
ML and advanced engineering services which would enhance Zensar’s existing data engineering and digital 
engineering capabilities.
	
On 8 July 2021, Company had acquired 100% equity stake in M3Bi India for an upfront consideration of INR 178 Mn.
	
On 14 July 2021, Zensar Technologies Inc. (wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) had acquired 100% of 
voting interest in M3Bi LLC for an upfront consideration of USD 21.60 Mn adjusted for estimated net assets to 
INR 1,645 Mn (USD 22.13 Mn), further performance based deferred earnouts payable upto INR 520 Mn (USD 7 
Mn) over next 36 months.
	
The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value of assets including intangible assets acquired 
was attributed to goodwill. Adjustment to consideration on account of working capital was due to be finalized 
within 120 days from the respective closing dates, which has been extended further with mutual consent. 
Purchase Price Allocation was adjusted provisionally, further deliberation between the parties on settlement is 
in progress, any change thereon would be accounted once concluded.
	
During the current year ended 31 March 2023, provisional purchase price allocation was finalized and 
accounting was done as prescribed by IND AS 103 “Business combinations”, whereby contingent consideration 
was adjusted by USD 4.19 Mn, with related impacts on investment, goodwill and intangibles.

Certain statements in this Integrated Annual Report concerning our future prospects may be forward-looking statements which involve a number 
of underlying identofied/non-identified risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. This Report and other statements 
– written and oral – that we periodically make contain forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results based on the management’s 
plans and assumptions. However the same are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, our ability to manage growth; 
fluctuations in earnings/exchange rates;  intense competition in IT services, including factors affecting cost advantage; wage increases; ability 
to attract and retain highly skilled professionals; time and cost overruns on fixed price, fixed-time frame, or other contracts; client concentration; 
restrictions on immigration; our ability to manage international operations; reduced demand for technology in our service offerings; disruptions 
in telecommunication networks; our ability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions; liability for damages on our service contracts; 
withdrawal of governmental fiscal incentives; economic downturn in India, and/or around the world, political instability, legal restrictions on raising 
capital or acquiring companies; and unauthorized use of intellectual property and general economic conditions affecting the industry. 
In addition to the foregoing, global pandemic like COVID-19 may pose an unforeseen, unprecedented, unascertainable, and constantly evolving risk(s), 
inter-alia, to us, our clients, delivery models, vendors, partners, employees, general global operations, and may also impact the success of companies 
in which we have made strategic investments, demand for Company’s offerings, and the onshore-offshore-nearshore delivery model.   
The results of these assumptions made relying on available internal and external information are the basis for determining the carrying values of 
certain assets and liabilities. Since the factors underlying these assumptions are subject to change over time, the estimates on which they are based, 
are also subject to change accordingly. These forward-looking statements represent only the Company’s current intentions, beliefs, or expectations, 
and any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it was made. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any 
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
