Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets, 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
Dear Stakeholders,
	
As a responsible organisation in the cement industry, our Company is constantly analyzing and forecasting both global 
and national cement megatrends to stay ahead of the curve. We understand that the world is changing, and so is the 
demand for cement. In the global context, the slow but steady shift from developed to developing economies has resulted in 
increased demand for cement, especially in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and African regions. On the other hand, developed 
economies focus more on sustainable outcomes as the climate change concern takes global attention. This has led to a 
growth in the production of eco-friendly alternatives, which we at our Company have focused on.
	
On a national level, we recognise that our customers require innovation and high-quality products. We believe that cement 
production must consider ecological and social responsibilities alongside other crucial factors. As such, our focus is to 
manufacture products that meet the standards of both developed and developing economies. In this regard, we aim to 
optimise the use of alternative raw materials, limit energy consumption, streamline supply chain, focus on distribution and 
transportation, and invest in research & development. We are committed to meeting and exceeding the expectations of 
our customers and forging strong partnerships through excellent customer service, constant innovation, and embracing 
cement megatrends.
	
At our Company, we hold ourselves to rigorous standards of governance. We prioritise accountability and transparency, and 
we have implemented various measures to ensure our conduct aligns with industry best practices. This includes conducting 
an annual assessment of our governance framework and processes to ensure their effectiveness and efficiency. The 
Company has embarked on its ESG Journey during the financial year. As part of this journey we have initiated integrating 
ESG factors in decision making and business expansion.
	
Our organisation’s environment commitment enforces the use of environmentally responsible resources, ensures resource 
efficiency in operations and moderates the impact on climate change. We have enhanced the proportion of blended 
cement in our production to approximately 90%. We undertake continuous improvement in our energy efficiency and 
offset our carbon emissions through afforestation activities in and around its mines and plant operations. Further We have 
collaborated with a major petrochemical company for the usage of eco-friendly fuel- “Xtra Green”, which produces lesser 
emissions. For the reduction of logistical emissions our Company has made back haul arrangements for transportation 
of clinker from Lumshnong to Guwahati with fly ash. We have also enhanced our water positivity through optimisation of 
water consumption and securing water from alternative sources.
	
As part of the social commitment of our organisation, we prioritise on building trust and relationship with our stakeholders 
including employee, suppliers, customer, and community groups. The Company promotes eco-efficiency amongst 
stakeholders by organising several engagements; one such event is ‘Beat the Plastic Pollution’ initiative, to promote 
responsible disposal of plastic.
	
Our Company’s investment in creating an inclusive and safe workplace “has resulted in making Star Cement one of the great 
places to work. The ideation programme, “Star Sujhaav” fosters innovation within the organisation, leading to improved 
efficiency and delivering enhanced business value to our customers. Our customer centric approach is centered on 
developing digital solutions that enable stakeholders including dealers, engineers and distributors to collaborate effectively 
and enhance the customer experience. We are proud to offer a range of applications that promote 24*7 engagement, such

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Star Cement recognises the growing impact of climate change on its operations and believes it has a significant role 
in delivering the nations’ promise towards achieving net zero by 2070. Thus, as a climate steward, the Company takes 
proactive measures with the intention of cutting down on the energy used in the operations, which also reduces the GHG 
emissions. The following measures form an integral part of the Company’s low carbon strategy
	
Energy Efficient Initiatives
	
The Company invests in several energy conservation measures Initiatives that involve adopting new technologies and 
upgraded existing infrastructure to reduce its energy intensity (details of such measures are available as per the disclosure 
on section 134 (3) (m) of the Companies Act in this report)
	
Enhancing green energy
	
While the Company strives to improve upon its operational efficiency through identification and implementation of energy 
saving opportunities, it believes integrating green energy into operations to not only overcome challenges as a result of 
availability of fuel, but also build resilience against the rising fuel prices. Star Cement focusses at enhancing utilisation of 
green energy in the form of solar power and waste heat recovery to replace
	
coal-based power. In this endeavour, the Company is undertaking feasibility studies for installation of 20 MW solar power 
plant.
	
Clinker Factor Reduction
	
By gradually lowering the amount of clinker in cement products and using alternative raw materials like fly ash and slag, 
the Company is able to lower the carbon footprint associated with the calcination of limestone. Approximately 90% of the 
Company’s cement portfolio comprises of blended cement which is an integral part of our climate strategy.
