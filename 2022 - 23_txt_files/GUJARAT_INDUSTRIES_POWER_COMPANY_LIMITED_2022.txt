Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt
or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format
Sr. 
No. 
Material 
issue 
identified 
Indicate 
Whether 
risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O) 
Rationale for identifying 
the risk / opportunity 
In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate 
Financial 
implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity 
(Indicate 
Positive or 
negative 
implications) 
1. 
Increased 
temperature 
and heat 
waves 
Risk 
Increase 
in 
temperature 
and 
prolonged heat waves may create 
unsafe environment and cause health 
& safety risks for the workforce 
The risk is minimized as most of 
the 
mining 
operations 
are 
mechanized with minimal human 
tasks in the open environment. 
 
All 
equipment/machinery 
in
operations have air-conditioned 
cabins. 
 
In 
case 
of 
power 
generation 
operations, 
the 
Company 
maintains infrastructure to reduce 
impact of extreme heat. Adequate 
sheds are also installed to provide 
places for workers to rest and for 
protection from outside heat. 
Negative 
2. Water 
scarcity 
Risk 
Water scarcity & less rainfall/droughts 
might 
impact 
the 
production 
processes as water is one of the main 
resources consumed by the company
The 
Company 
has 
access to 
various water sources to enable 
diversification in case of water 
scarcity. It also maintains reservoir 
with upto 5 days worth of water 
requirements 
in 
case 
of 
emergency.  
 
Additionally, it also has supply 
from the ground water around 
Bodhan and Patan as a standy 
source of water.  
 
Due to all this, the risk of 
disruption due to water scarcity is 
minimal.

3. Disruptive 
weather 
events 
Risk 
Disruptive weather events like high 
or 
low 
wind 
speed, 
cyclones, 
hurricanes, floods, etc. impact and 
can cause disruption and risks to the 
company operations 
The company is transitioning to 
more solar power generation assets 
to 
mitigate 
any 
impact 
from 
abnormal wind speed, in particular 
low 
wind 
speed 
which 
is 
becoming more common across 
India. 
  
The company's solar and wind 
assets have defence mechanism 
(barriers, etc.) to prevent any 
impact from floods. 
Negative 
4. Net-zero 
transition 
Opportunity Demand for renewable energy is on 
the rise as a response to reduce GHG 
emissions and transition towards a 
low/no-carbon economy.  
 
This represents a massive opportunity 
for the company. Over the past few 
years, the company has increased its 
electricity generation mix to include 
more renewable assts like solar farms 
and wind farms.  
 
The 
company 
will 
continue 
to 
expand its renewable infrastructure 
portfolio to enable more electricity 
generation from renewable sources to 
enable India's transition to a net-zero 
economy 
Not applicable 
Positive 
5. Affordable 
electricity 
Opportunity Compared to industry peers, the 
Company produces electricity at a 
lower cost, in-turn benefitting the end 
customers and wider society and 
communities. Through adopting new 
technologies, innovation and industry 
best practices, it will continue to 
strive towards producing electricity at 
lower costs, thereby helping address 
energy poverty and contributing to 
UN SDG 7 - 'Affordable & Clean 
Energy'.
