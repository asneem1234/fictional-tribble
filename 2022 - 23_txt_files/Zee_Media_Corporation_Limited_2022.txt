to 
adverse 
financial

Code

Conduct,

2.
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Our reporters, cameramen 
etc. are exposed to health 
and safety risks present in 
the field during the process of 
news gathering.
We provide our employees with 
relevant safety guidelines as 
well as protective equipment 
(if required) to handle any 
contingency 
during 
field 
reporting.
Negative
3.
Data Privacy
Risk
Regulations 
have 
been 
implemented for businesses 
to handle personal data and 
for organisations that transmit 
user data to such companies, 
yet data leaks have been the 
headlines quite very often. 
Big data challenges can pose 
trouble when it comes to 
accumulating adequate user 
data, 
without 
which 
exact 
scrutiny cannot be carried 
out. Viewers are being more 
sensitive than ever, towards 
their data and are troubled 
on how their personal data is 
being used.
Data 
privacy 
policies 
are 
implemented throughout the 
organization 
with 
adequate 
internal control and quarterly 
audit and reporting in place.

4.
Copyright 
and Piracy 
issues
Risk
With the rise of digitisation, 
more big data problems have 
emerged such as sharing of 
account information through 
which multiple users can 
view content from the same 
account, using the password. 
It 
then 
becomes 
difficult 
for the production houses 
to categorize what genre of 
content is favorable to an adult 
and to a child. Pinpointing on 
the demographic details of an 
account user also becomes 
extremely 
difficult. 
Many 
people have started using the 
content available on online 
platforms for their own use; 
pirate and spoof this data to 
make it look like their own 
new creation and upload it to 
generate revenue.
Preventing 
unauthorized 
access to its content using 
content encryption and other 
security access devices.
Negative
5.
Business, 
Ethics, 
Governance 
and 
Transparency
Risk
Regulatory compliance and 
good corporate governance 
form the foundation of our 
business and non-compliance 
in any form can severally 
impact our business, brand 
name as well as credibility.
Further Building a culture of 
integrity and transparency 
is 
linked 
with 
fulfillment 
of mandates as well as 
strengthening 
relationships 
with stakeholder.
Our approach towards mitigating 
compliance 
and 
governance 
related risks consist of the 
following initiatives:
• Implementation of compliance 
monitoring system
• In-house professionals as 
well as consultation with 
experts
• Continuous 
monitoring 
of 
regulatory changes
• Periodic 
reviews 
of 
the 
compliances
