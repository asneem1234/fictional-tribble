Endurance’s strategy has always 
been to remain agile while building 
capabilities to continue being a 
technology leader in our chosen product 
verticals. Our business model and 
people strategy, together with sustained 
research and development efforts, fosters 
quick decision-making, and ignites 
a passion for learning with a shared 
vision. This enables us to anticipate the 
changing industry dynamics and trends to 
drive technological changes rather than 
just keep pace with the transformations. 
We have developed a customer-centric 
culture by anticipating changing business 
expectations, responding swiftly, and 
exceeding customer requirements by 
proactively delivering the desired results.
BEING INNOVATIVELY 
AGILE HAS HELPED US 
IN EXECUTING OUR 
STRATEGIC PLANS AND 
SCALING NEW LEVELS 
OF GROWTH, AND 
HAS THUS EMERGED 
AS THE CENTRAL PILLAR 
OF OUR LONG-TERM 
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH 
STRATEGY, AND WE 
ARE COMMITTED TO 
REINFORCING IT.
Insights from our MD
Dear Shareholders
Recent years have witnessed an increasing demand for 
vehicles that are not only comfortable and safe but also 
equipped with contemporary aesthetics and sustainable 
technologies. In addition, the consumers’ growing 
preference for vehicles that offer value for money has come 
sharply to the fore. In line with this consumer trend, OEMs 
have also enhanced their focus on improving the quality, 
design and cost-effectiveness of their products, along with 
on-time delivery. There is, among OEMs, a growing thrust on 
developing vehicles that have unique features, giving them 
a distinctive edge in the market. At the same time, the rise 
in demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) to support the growing 
need for sustainable vehicles has triggered an increase in 
the number of OEM players in the market. This has led to 
new opportunities for the ancillary companies. These factors 
have cumulatively led to a significant change in the priorities 
of both, the OEMs and the companies engaged in the 
manufacturing of auto components.
Acknowledging this reality, we further sharpened our 
focus, during FY 2022-23, on supporting the OEMs with 
technology, products and solutions that match the demands 
of the new-age consumers. Our agility in meeting the OEM’s 
product and development needs, strengthened our position 
of being a most trusted partner to OEMs. We invested 
more actively in the emerging and critical areas driving 
business growth, such as EVs, value engineering including 
light-weighting, and technology upgradation.
To keep pace with the industry changes and market trends, 
we further scaled up the enhancement of products and 
processes, and focussed on higher value creation and 
profitability, as well as organic and inorganic growth. 
We believe these are the areas requiring the maximum 
organisational efforts.
Being agile to the external environment
The Indian automobile industry is currently the fifth largest 
in the world and is expected to become the third largest 
by 2030. According to the Society of Indian Automobile 
Manufacturers (SIAM), the industry grew an impressive 
11.8% in FY 2022-23, with passenger vehicle volumes 
rising to 4.5 million units from 3.6 million units a year ago 
and 2W volumes rising to 19.51 million units from 18.01 
million units. The industry combatted the challenges of 
semi-conductor chip shortage and soaring metal costs that 
continued to prevail during the year.
THE FOCUS IS ON MORE 
EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE 
EV PRODUCTS. OUR FOCUS 
ON ORDERS FOR EV 
COMPONENTS AND OUR 
INVESTMENTS IN THE EV 
SEGMENT ARE IN LINE 
WITH THIS TREND.
THE INDIAN AUTOMOBILE 
INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY 
THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE 
WORLD AND IS EXPECTED 
TO BECOME THE THIRD 
LARGEST BY 2030.
India’s economic resilience, favourable government policies, 
increasing EV penetration and technological advancements 
are among the key drivers of the continued positivity in the 
automobile sector. The Indian government has reinforced 
its commitment to the industry’s growth by increasing the 
budget allocation of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing 
of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) II by 78% in the 
Union Budget 2023. Several industry players believe that 
the long-term success of Indian EV industry will be based 
on innovation and efficiency rather than on government 
subsidy. In any case, new EV vehicle launches have led 
to the emergence of opportunities for the growth of the 
industry in India.
At Endurance, our deep-rooted strengths and agility 
have equipped us with the ability to quickly harness the 
emerging opportunities to steer our growth and expansion. 
Our strong innovation capabilities, robust financials, and 
presence across multiple products have also led to our 
growth as a trusted and reliable partner for an increasing 
number of domestic and global OEMs, while strengthening 
our dominance in the aftermarket.  Our sustainable 
product proposition and strategic investments in the areas 
of future growth have enabled us to stay consistently 
ahead of the market.
Innovating to improve efficiencies across the 
value chain
We have, over the years, developed a strong innovation 
agility that has enabled us to deliver highly advanced and 
affordable products and solutions to our expanding customer 
base. It has helped us create a more value-added and 
profitable product mix. It has also enabled us to expand 
our presence in the value chain through our backward 
integration initiatives. We have strategically focussed on 
products showing higher demand potential, and have 
made investments in technologies that will drive greater 
growth going forward. Our focus is on pioneering products, 
solutions and processes that are designed for enhanced 
efficiencies and can effectively meet the future needs 
of our consumers.
In line with this focus, and as a matter of norm, we take 
extra precautions – more than what is mandated by the 
law in India, in the development of products from the 
design stage itself. In fact, many of our existing products, 
by default, comply with the new norms announced by the 
Indian government, which include AIS-156. While some 
minor adjustments will be required in the light of AIS-156, 
our technology edge will allow us to comply with ease to the 
new norms, without requiring a full redesign. Since we were 
selling in international markets, including Europe and the 
US, we were already designing as per the global standards.
We believe these initiatives will prepare us even more 
intensely to capture the future opportunities of growth across 
our business operations. As a part of our future-ready 
strategy, we decided to set-up in-house facilities for hoses 
and valves manufacturing for our ABS product segment, 
and for manufacturing aluminium forged axle clamps and 
PA housings for our inverted front forks and rear monoshock 
absorbers respectively. Going forward, we shall continue 
to augment our innovation thrust to meet the evolving needs 
of the customers in both, the domestic and the international 
markets. Enhancing business sustenance, and proactive 
upgrade in product reliability to delight our customers as 
the first choice with environmental responsibility, motivates 
us to continue with our focussed approach on war 
against weight, SME structure development, inculcation of 
innovation DNA, go-green thought-map and best-fit new 
generation technologies.
Investing aggressively in EVs
The importance being accorded to sustainability by the 
government, the automobile industry and vehicle users 
has given a strong impetus to the growth of the Electric 
Vehicles segment globally. The focus is on more efficient 
and affordable EV products. Our focus on orders for EV 
components and our investments in the EV segment are in

line with this trend. During FY 2022-23, we completed the 
acquisition of 51% equity in Maxwell Energy Systems Private 
Limited and the remaining equity shall be acquired in a 
phased manner by 2027.
This acquisition marks a major leap forward in expanding 
our presence in advanced electronics, particularly in the 
Battery Management Systems (BMS) for EVs and stationary 
storage battery packs. It will equip us to harness the growing 
EV opportunity, as we leverage Maxwell’s deep technical 
expertise and its BMS deployment experience in India and 
Europe. A major ` 700 million BMS order received by 
Maxwell during FY 2022-23 endorses the success of this 
strategy. Deliveries on this order will begin in the first half 
of FY 2023-24. We are also focussing on bicycles business 
for our Indian OEMs as well as exports. Endurance has won 
EV orders in aluminium castings, suspension and brakes, 
which will largely be serviced by our available capacities. 
Also, wherever required, we are adding capacities to meet 
the needs of our customers.
All our available products except clutches, are EV-agnostic 
products. This will ensure the continuing strength of our 
business, irrespective of the pace of EV adoption.
Sustaining performance positivity and 
financial strength
I am pleased to share that all these future-driven innovations 
and agile initiatives helped us deliver sustained growth 
on our key financial metrics during FY 2022-23. 
Endurance registered EBITDA margins in double digits for 
the year even amid the challenges of the continuing energy 
crisis, high metal prices, shortage of semi-conductors, and 
deferment of the launch of electric 2Ws.
During FY 2022-23, our consolidated Total Income grew by 
a significant 16.6% over FY 2021-22, mainly on account 
of the industry growth, order intake, capacity creation, and 
higher metal prices. Consolidated EBITDA grew by 7.6%, 
while consolidated EBITDA margin was at 12.2%. Our net 
profit grew by 4.1%. Indian operations accounted for 77% 
of our consolidated Total Income, and the remainder was 
from overseas operations. The standalone Total Income for 
the period grew by 18.8%.
Our financial strength has been validated by CRISIL and 
ICRA, both of which reaffirmed our AA+ (stable) long-term 
credit rating and the highest short-term credit rating of 
A1+ in FY 2022-23, on the back of our prudent financial 
policies and cost control measures. The reaffirmation 
reflects the leadership position of Endurance in aluminium 
die-casting components and proprietary products, its healthy 
relationships with major customers and its well-diversified 
revenue streams. There was no net debt and ` 4,193 million 
of positive cash was available, as on 31st March, 2023.
Diversifying and growing strategically
Our diversification strategy is an important pillar of our 
business model. It helps us cushion the impact of global 
macro events, such as, government policy, geopolitical 
turbulence, commodity prices, etc. We have recently 
embarked upon de-risking our European business, where 
we have additionally focussed on growing the 2-wheeler 
Aftermarket business while continuing to consolidate our 
presence in the 4-wheeler OEM category. The acquisitions 
of Adler and Grimeca in 2020, and Frenotecnica and New 
Fren in FY 2022-23, were aimed at pursuing our ambition to 
create a pool of 2W Aftermarket brands in Europe.
In India, the focus on diversification has led us to develop 
and supply a wide range of products to multiple OEMs 
and to the Aftermarket. The recent additions of several new 
products, such as BMS, driveshaft and aluminium forgings, 
are aligned to this approach. Besides de-risking the 
Company from product concentration, such diversification 
will help us further expand our customer base.
Harnessing future growth effectively
Our robust innovation capabilities enable us to deliver 
high-end products to our customers, and give Endurance 
a strong competitive edge in the market. We believe our 
focus on premium products and upgradation of products 
will continue to drive our growth in the coming years. 
Coupled with our healthy product mix, technology edge 
and cost controls, it will enable Endurance to continue 
outperforming the industry.
While EVs will continue to be a big focus area for us, we 
are also looking at scaling our growth in the conventional 
markets of India and Europe. Our aim is to continually 
improve our R&D capabilities to give an impetus to 
advanced technology and high value-added products, 
including products for higher cc bikes. We will also 
continue to deploy multi-pronged cost reduction strategies in 
manufacturing and sourcing.
Being conscious of our ESG responsibility
We are fully aware of our responsibility towards the society 
and the planet on which we live. We have identified 
certain key goals to steer our Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) responsibility, and our target is to ensure 
that 50% of the total energy consumed in our manufacturing 
processes is renewable by 2030. We are striving to 
continuously lower our thermal energy consumption while 
aiming to achieve 50% carbon neutrality in the next 
three to four years.
Operational safety is another area of our focus and we 
have in place a centralised Environment, Health, Safety 
(EHS) monitoring system to ensure higher levels of safety in 
the organisation.
We are also continuously augmenting our community 
outreach efforts, as part of our Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) focus. During FY 2022-23, we further 
expanded the ambit of our community outreach, with a 
focus on delivering lasting impact on the communities we 
transform and the individuals we empower. In the education 
space, our initiatives included renovation of school premises 
and training of teachers, among others. Our healthcare 
and sanitation programmes reached out to marginalised 
populations across villages. Deepening of canals, de-silting 
of ponds and development of forests were among our key 
initiatives in the area of environment. We also focussed 
actively on training and livelihood generation activities 
during the year.
Looking ahead with optimism
Our long-term strategic plans revolve around growing 
through technological upgrades, mergers and acquisitions, 
greenfield and brownfield projects, and hiring the right 
resources to develop in-house technology.  To steer our 
performance, we shall continue to work towards the 
development of technologies with focus on light-weighting, 
and cost-efficiencies and making high-end components more 
affordable for lower segment vehicles. Value engineering 
will remain a key strategic thrust area for Endurance, along 
with technology upgradation, quality improvement, cost 
efficiencies, and EHS.
We remain committed to enhancing customer satisfaction 
and engagement, augmenting our capacities, improving 
our financial ratios through higher asset utilisation, and 
controlling the capex while increasing sales. We consider 
our employees as our greatest asset and will continue to 
focus on building a competent team that is aligned with 
Endurance’s vision. We shall further invest in employee 
competency enhancement in the light of new product 
development and innovations.
Before I conclude, I would like, on behalf of the 
Management and the Board, to thank all our customers, 
shareholders and investors, supply chain partners, as well 
as technology partners for their continued cooperation and 
trust in Endurance. I would like to take this opportunity to 
also thank our employees, whose commitment and hard 
work are helping us strengthen our innovative agility to drive 
sustainable, long-term growth.
We look forward to your sustained support in successfully 
steering our future growth plans and enabling the realisation 
of our future plans and goals.

Harnessing Innovation across 
Product Value Chain
Our core strengths equip us to harness the power 
of innovation across the business ecosystem. 
They enable us to leverage our manufacturing 
prowess, quality consciousness and backward 
integration capabilities. This, in turn, helps us in 
the development of ground-breaking products and 
solutions aligned to our customers’ preferences.
Our value chain extends from design to delivery 
and aftermarket sales for the Automotive industry 
in India and the European markets.
Expanding manufacturing capacities
	 Our expanded plant facility at Chakan, 
Pune, became operational and started 
supplies of alloy wheels in July 2022. 
It has increased our alloy wheel supplies 
from 240,000 to 380,000 alloy wheels a 
month to service new orders. 
	 Our second brakes plant at Waluj, 
Aurangabad, is now operational and 
is catering to the increase in volumes 
in the brake assembly business 
in view of newly won orders.
Our focus is on a more value-added 
and profitable product mix in our future 
business. Our new products, for our 
existing as well as our new customers, 
are in line with this strategy.
Our robust vendor relations give us the 
sourcing strength needed to fulfil the 
customer needs across their business 
spectrum. We choose our vendor partners 
on the basis of their financial stability 
and their capability to ensure sustainable 
sourcing for Endurance. During the year, 
we resumed our 2-day annual vendor meet 
to engage with our business partners. 
Showing agility through backward 
integration
Our business agility across the value chain is manifest 
in our backward integration initiatives, which cover 
high-end products like wire steel braided hoses and 
valves for ABS and aluminium forgings for inverted

Harnessing Innovation across Product Value Chain
Sustenance through 
light-weighting
The automotive industry has been reinventing itself 
to become more and more sustainable, starting with 
automotive light-weighting: the replacement of metal 
parts with lighter materials that can be recycled or 
reused at the end of the use cycle.
Light-weighting has far-reaching implications for 
a wide variety of industries. In the automotive, 
e-mobility, transportation, and aerospace fields, 
lowering overall assembly weight increases 
fuel or energy efficiency and lowers the total 
environmental footprint.
At Endurance, we are taking significant actions in 
light-weighting of components by:
1 	 Approaching customers to convert parts 
in aluminium considering design flexibility 
(from Fabrication, Sand Casting to LPDC or 
HPDC process) without affecting the desired 
mechanical requirements
2 	 Adding VAVE to reduce part weight and improve 
functional quality
3 	 Adopting an innovative approach to produce 
lightweight casting (thin wall parts)
4 	 Innovating to improve the casting process 
(production, handling, painting, machining and 
despatch, etc.) 
The India Scenario
The Indian automotive industry, which is gradually 
adopting the advantages of aluminium, is poised to 
become the 3rd largest automotive market in terms of 
volume by 2030 (as per Invest India). This growth is 
being propelled by electric vehicles, heavy vehicles 
and passenger vehicles. Prior to the pandemic, 
India’s auto component industry imports stood at 
USD 15.40 billion, offering significant potential for 
substitution. This translates into immense opportunity 
for Indian automotive industry to leverage domestic 
capabilities and reduce its import dependence through 
light-weighting. 
Innovating to Maximise 
EV Opportunity
The Electronic Vehicle (EV) market continues to offer 
a significant opportunity for growth for the auto 
component industry. At Endurance, we are fast 
building a robust portfolio of products for 2W and 
3W EVs. Many of our existing products, such as 
castings, suspensions and brakes, are EV-agnostic, 
giving us a strong edge in this area. 
The acquisition of Maxwell has given us a powerful 
edge in the EV-embedded electronics space. We are 
supplying the Battery Management System (BMS)  
for 2-wheeler EVs and battery pack makers. In  
FY 2022-23, Maxwell launched an integrated IBP 
BMS and ancillary PDU for 2- and 3-wheelers. 
We are also developing products for the e-bicycles 
business, especially for suspension, battery 
management system and brakes, both for Indian 
OEMs and exports. In addition, we are supplying 
products for brake assemblies, suspensions and 
aluminium castings for electric scooters and 3Ws. 
We are in the process of adding capacity for EV 
scooter castings. 
Winning in the EV space
During FY 2022-23, we won the following new business for EVs. We see this EV business in India, reaching 
peak volumes by the end of FY 2023-24 and in Europe by FY 2026-27.

Excelling in Aftermarket 
Strategies
Aftermarket is a strategic priority for Endurance. 
We have conducted detailed market analysis, 
understood the requirements of distributors in every 
district, built internal product, process and people 
capabilities, and developed a holistic district level 
strategy to achieve our strategic growth goals for our 
domestic business. For exports, we have analysed 
country-wise vehicle parts, product life cycle, product 
pricing, market dynamics and the ratio of genuine 
parts for each country, and then developed a 
country-wise strategy with market-specific campaigns 
targeting market share expansions. 
Our strategy focusses on developing our distributors 
by engaging with them and understanding their 
requirements to increase the frequency of billing 
cycles and the quantum of order sizes. We are 
also developing new products to cater to the new 
markets we are entering. We have also focussed on 
implementing our digitisation strategy for our domestic 
and exports business.
Value-added and 
Outsourced products 
Our strategy is to focus on value-added and 
technologically-focussed products with a 
synergy to existing products. We forayed 
into outsourced manufacturing of tyres 
and tubes for 2Ws, 3Ws and e-rickshaws 
in FY 2020-21. We develop the designs 
and tread compounds for these tyres, 
which are currently being sold in eight 
countries in addition to the domestic market. 
We have launched engine oils and horns in 
FY 2022-23. Our product range, compatible 
to our network and product categories, is 
continually expanding, enabling us to meet 
our strategic growth goals. Currently, 11%+ 
of our turnover from aftermarket is from 
value-added products and we intend to 
increase it to 18% going forward.

Expanding our aftermarket reach
As part of our expansion efforts, we are focussing 
on the high-potential markets of Rajasthan, 
Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu 
and Karnataka in India. On the exports front, 
we are entering new countries every year, in 
line with the OEMs, by growing our distribution/
dealer presence.
Strengthening our aftermarket brand
During FY 2022-23, we acquired two Italian 
companies, Frenotecnica Srl and New Fren Srl, to 
further strengthen our aftermarket business agility
  Frenotecnica
manufactures friction materials and braking 
system components, such as brake pads for 
two-wheelers. They have a renowned brand 
name, Brenta, in the aftermarket and replacement 
business. This acquisition provides Endurance 
Group with aftermarket growth opportunities, as 
well as access to in-depth know-how or process 
technologies of friction materials, particularly for 
brake applications.
  New Fren 
is engaged in the business of brake discs, 
centrifugal clutches, pads and brake shoes for 
2W vehicles. Their primary business activity 
comprises sale of products, under the trademark 
“NewFren”, through the aftermarket channels.
These acquisitions, coupled with the acquisitions 
of Adler and Grimeca in 2020, will enable us 
to create a Centre of Excellence in Italy for the 
business of premium components in the 2-wheeler 
segment. This will translate into more profitable 
growth opportunities to the Endurance Group.

Nurturing People Innovation
Our people are a major driver of our business agility, and we continue to invest in nurturing their well-being and 
welfare, besides promoting their career progression.
Building the next line of leaders from within is a strategic priority at Endurance. We believe in identifying the true 
potential of employees, and enabling them to achieve it by capitalising on their strengths and challenging them 
to overcome their weaknesses through focussed initiatives.
OUR 
4C
HUMAN RESOURCE (HR) 
STRATEGY IS STRUCTURED 
AROUND THE FOUR 
PILLARS OF
CULTURE
COMPETENCE
CAREER
CONNECT 
	 High potential talent pools at junior, middle 
management, and senior levels have been identified 
as part of Endurance’s succession planning initiative. 
The aim of the initiative is to help high potential 
individuals redefine their limits and potential, while 
enabling them to develop their managerial and 
leadership skills in order to take on larger roles.
	 Holistic assessment and development centres are 
conducted, and detailed career plans are developed 
for individuals under the mentorship of senior leaders 
for this purpose.
	 Through intervention from external faculties and 
internal guidance, our human resource team facilitates 
various programmes, such as Speed Mentoring, Peer 
Coaching Learning Labs, Case-based Group Learnings 
and Leader as a Coach. Speed mentoring aims to 
leverage the wisdom and tacit knowledge of strategic 
leaders, and involve them in building our leadership 
pipeline. Peer Coaching Learning Labs enable our 
high potentials across departments and geographies 
to brainstorm solutions to meet the challenges they 
face and to share best practices. Case-based group 
learnings widen the horizon of leaders to look and 
learn beyond Endurance and apply the learnings 
in their roles. Leader as a Coach uses experiential 
learning and enables high potentials to become better 
coaches to their team members.
Nurturing Diversity
At Endurance, we believe in developing sustainable 
competitive advantage through a diverse workplace. 
By driving a diverse and collaborative culture, we 
are able to continuously challenge ourselves and 
foster innovation, which is one of our core values. 
We are committed to valuing and integrating diverse 
and unique perspectives in our decision-making. 
We have launched various programmes and plans to 
augment gender diversity.  The SHE Endurance hiring 
programme ensures gender diversity in the recruitment 
process. We have initiated training programmes to 
raise awareness about conscious DEI (Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion) and unconscious bias. 
Our preliminary target is to aim gender 
diversity with 10% of our workforce 
consisting women
Employee well-being, work-life balance and 
family engagement
We aim to develop a culture that embraces balance, 
and prioritises the well-being of all Endurians: 
	 Periodic leave is essential for individuals to 
promote good mental and physical health. 
The purpose of the work-life balance initiative is 
to encourage all Endurians to take time out for 
themselves and spend time with their families 
	 Family engagement initiative has been started, 
where family members of Endurians can visit 
our plants/facilities, understand the role of their 
family members, while also interacting with 
colleagues and receiving safety trainings
	 1to1 help hotline is available for all employees 
to help Endurians navigate and thrive as 
they meet challenges in their personal and 
professional lives 
At Endurance, we believe building and 
sustaining a high performance culture is one 
of the few sustainable competitive advantages 
that we can leverage consistently. We feel 
that company culture shapes the experience 
of each employee. At Endurance, our culture 
emerges from our CITTI values (Customer 
Centricity, Integrity, Transparency, Teamwork, 
and Innovation). These five pillars help us in 
fostering our performance culture as they are 
the principles which guide our decisions and 
actions. We believe demonstrating these values 
in our actions consistently has made us a 
globally trusted brand. 
	 Endurance Youth Leadership Programme (EYLP) is a 
focussed initiative where employees from different 
departments and locations come together to work on 
challenging strategic projects as teams. It enables 
the employees to gain exposure to new areas 
and experiences. This equips them with necessary 
capabilities to handle larger responsibilities. In the 
process, the team members are able to identify 
their potential, and discover and pursue their newly 
discovered passions. Under the mentorship of senior 
management, the teams become catalysts for driving 
culture change, set new benchmarks, and create a 
sustainable impact.
	 We are focussing on application of training for 
all Endurians by sharing objectives and assigning 
Action Learning Projects (ALPs) at the start of the 
training. This helps us measure how all Endurians 
are implementing initiatives aligned to the training, 
whether it is by delegating tasks and establishing a 
strong review mechanism post a result orientation 
training, or implementing initiatives with financial 
savings after Lean and Shainin trainings
	 Mindfulness and yoga sessions are conducted 
regularly across locations
	 WAH Calendar drives engagement 
among Endurians
These initiatives help employees achieve their full potential 
and enrich them to become future leaders at Endurance.

Nurturing People Innovation
Investing in Responsible Agility
As a responsible corporate, and in line with the global trends, we have imbued Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) ethos into the organisation.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)
We are building a EHS and sustainability-first culture 
at Endurance, consistently prioritising human lives, 
environment, health, safety and sustainability in our 
decisions. The management of change initiative 
ensures that all material changes, layout changes, 
expansions, and greenfield/brownfield projects 
require certification from EHS team. We focus on 
developing contractors on hazard identification 
and management, risk assessment, competency 
mapping, training for their employees, and 
emergency preparedness and response, as part 
of our contractor safety management initiatives. 
At Endurance, our safety-first culture drives zero 
tolerance for unsafe acts and compliance is facilitated 
by our consequence management policy. We have 
developed a mechanism to benchmark, and share 
learnings and best practices across locations for 
continuous improvement. 
Endurance is also developing a culture of result 
orientation. Initiatives including driving internal 
customer centricity, proactive risk assessment and 
mitigation, ensuring effective and robust review 
mechanisms, and driving end-to-end accountability 
have helped us shape Endurance’s culture. 
We believe in celebrating success, even the small 
victories. Instant recognition aims to foster a 
result-oriented culture by recognising initiatives that 
drive performance and innovation. 
Every year, we implement sustainable actions based 
on voice of employees from annual engagement 
survey, and track if the NPS is increasing, driving 
employee engagement and loyalty. 
Nurturing Sustainability
Sustainability is a strategic priority and a 
corporative objective for us at Endurance. 
We have been driving initiatives to achieve 
carbon neutrality in all our plants. We are also 
working with our vendor partners to achieve 
carbon neutrality and this is mandatory for our 
vendor partners with whom we want to grow. 
Monthly monitoring reviews are held to ensure 
that plants meet sustainability targets and 
corrective measures are identified wherever 
they are under threat of falling below targets. 
We have invested in solar power plants 
across regions and continue to invest in 
new ones. We have been driving the use 
of natural gas and LPG. We have stopped 
the use of furnace oil completely and are 
reducing our dependence on non-renewable 
resources. We are creating carbon sinks 
through focussed drives of tree plantation 
around our manufacturing facilities and 
creating dense forests. We are aiming to have 
zero leakages, whether air, water or liquids 
such as coolants. We have driven strategic 
initiatives for water savings, including shifting 
from painting to powder coating in several 
plants. Sensor-based overhead tanks, water 
guns instead of water hoses, and water saving 
push-type taps are used to reduce water 
consumption. Our focus is to achieve 80% 
water recycling. 
In addition to driving carbon neutrality, we 
are focussing on reducing hazardous waste 
generation by changing processes and driving 
actions such as using oil skimmer in tanks to 
recover and reuse oil. We also co-process 
hazardous waste by partnering with cement 
and paint industries to use our waste as raw 
material. Zero waste to landfill is another key 
metric we are tracking and we have been 
driving initiatives to achieve our targets.

Health & Sanitation
Health is a basic human right for every individual. 
We are driving health and hygiene initiatives in 
villages around Aurangabad. These initiatives include 
installing RO plants to ensure access to clean drinking 
water. We are also renovating government hospitals 
to increase access for communities, impacting 38,000 
people across 51 villages, building toilets (> 2,000), 
organising health check-ups (>5,200) and cataract 
surgeries (137), providing rehab to 181 alcoholics, 
and conducting 600+ yoga camps. In FY 2022-23, 
we implemented cleanliness drives in 11 villages, 
benefiting 4,700 villagers. We are focussed on 
improving women’s health (especially in stigmatised 
areas such as menstrual health and family planning), 
which has a positive ripple effect, transforming 
families and communities.
Livelihoods
We are committed to empowering individuals, 
especially women, to fulfil their dreams. We work 
with women in villages to understand their interests, 
develop their skills, provide them with loans to 
start their businesses, and guide them through their 
journey. During the year, we empowered 1,857 
women to start their own businesses, supported 
93 farmers in drip irrigation and 26 farmers in 
hydro-phonics, trained 160 farmers, and employed 
47 women for cleanliness drives and sanitary 
napkin manufacturing.
ECOVE, our vocational training centre, works with 
individuals from remand homes, orphans and others 
who do not value themselves. It provides them with 
skills to become financially independent and start 
understanding and capitalising on their special 
abilities. Over 1,500 individuals have graduated 
from our centre with degrees in tailoring, computer 
science, machine maintenance, die-casting, electrical 
and retail, and they collectively earn over `  340 
million annually.
Environment
In order to ensure development and sustainability of 
communities, protecting our environment is crucial. 
We believe in investing in renewable sources of 
energy, mainly sunlight and rain. In this endeavour, 
we have installed solar power generation units and 
solar street lights in over 20 villages, and initiated 
several rainwater harvesting projects. We have 
de-silted ponds, deepened waterways and created 
reservoirs. Additionally, we have laid pipelines to 
provide drinking water to villagers. We believe in 
sustainable farming and continue to train farmers in 
hydro-phonics and drip irrigation. We also provide 
mangers to farmers for their cattle, thus saving over 
40% fodder. We have undertaken afforestation  
that has helped to create dense forests around our 
manufacturing locations, thereby creating carbon 
sinks to combat the climate crisis.
At Endurance, we have prioritised CSR as a 
major enabler of our sustainable growth journey. 
We believe in reducing inequity with every community 
we transform, every child we inspire, and every 
individual we empower. In doing so, we are able 
to support individuals and communities to become 
independent and to achieve their full potential. 
Our holistic approach of working with communities 
to address complex issues by driving initiatives 
across education, health & sanitation, livelihood 
generation, and environment focus areas enables us 
to deliver a lasting impact. We understand the needs 
of the community, prioritise the initiatives based on 
the needs of the community, and get support from 
the stakeholders to ensure that the initiatives are 
sustained when we start focussing our efforts in other 
communities. We are determined to act as catalysts 
to equip individuals with the right skills, tools and 
resources in an environment where they can thrive 
and create a sustainable change in their communities 
for future generations.
Education
Every child deserves to reach her or his full potential. 
However, gender inequalities in their communities 
hinder this reality. We envision a society where all 
children are encouraged to be aspirational and 
not made to feel guilty for going after their dreams. 
From enabling access to schools by providing bicycles 
(178), supporting learning by building libraries 
and computer labs (34), and initiating e-learning to 
enhance effectiveness by training teachers (75), to 
inspiring children with interactive workshops on life 
skills and child rights (1,150), and ensuring 100% 
attendance (3,800+), we enable children to achieve 
their potential.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
World Economic Overview
In the world economy, post robust GDP growth of 6.3% in 
2021, it decelerated to 3.4% in 2022. This was mainly on 
account of the COVID-19 resurgence in China, the continued 
geopolitical tension, supply chain bottlenecks, and mounting 
inflationary pressure. On the bright side, however, growing 
private consumption and investment, and fiscal support from 
various governments provided some support to economic 
growth, especially in the United States (US), the Euro 
region, as well as major emerging markets and developing 
economies (EMDEs).
Inflationary pressure gradually easing out
Though global headline inflation has been coming down 
since mid-2022, it is well above the range witnessed in 
the preceding decade. Reduction in inflation in late 2022 
was owing to a decline in energy and commodity prices. 
To control inflation, most central banks globally have 
resorted to hiking interest rates. Tight monetary action has 
also helped contain inflationary pressure despite low wage 
growth. However, post pandemic, a slow recovery is seen in 
labour markets.
Challenges continue in the Euro zone
The continued geopolitical conflict led to several economic 
sanctions which progressively reduced supplies of oil and 
gas and other raw materials from Russia. This resulted in a 
surge in prices due to difficulties in quickly re-defining and 
nurturing alternative sources of supply and apprehensions 
of not achieving adequate levels of storage. The run-up in 
commodity prices re-ignited inflationary pressures prompting 
central banks to raise interest rates, thus abandoning the 
monetary stimulus measures applied with the policy of zero 
or negative interest rates in some countries. These events 
impacted economic trends in European countries, marring 
the recovery path embarked upon after the post-pandemic 
re-openings. Despite the difficult economic scenario, the 
European GDP grew 3.5% in 2022 mainly due to the 
positive performance in the first part of the year. Growth is 
expected to decelerate sharply in 2023, both the advanced 
economies and EMDEs.
Future Outlook
In 2023, world growth is expected to be 2.8%, with growth 
in advanced economies likely to decelerate to 1.3% from 
2.7% in 2022. Growth in EMDEs is expected to maintain 
pace at 3.9% in 2023 versus 4% in 2022. Led by measures

2021. The growth is a reflection of high consumer demand 
and a controlled semiconductor chip situation.
Source: Indian auto industry posts highest ever annual sales in 2022: 
Details explained - Times of India (indiatimes.com); Invest in Indian 
Automobile Industry, Auto Sector Growth Trends (investindia.gov.in)
In FY 2022-23, the overall automobile domestic sales volumes 
witnessed growth of 20.4%. The growth was led by healthy 
demand in the urban areas, increasing replacement demand, 
growing demand for utility vehicles in the PV segment 
and higher infrastructure spending. Total sales of domestic 
automobiles in FY 2022-23 was up 20% and stood at 21.2 
million units, up from 17.6 million units in FY 2021-22. 
SIAM data suggests that the total production of automobiles 
saw robust increase of 12.6% in FY 2022-23, to 25.9 million 
units, from 23.0 million units produced in FY 2021-22.
In the domestic market, all categories saw high double-digit 
growth, with PVs, CVs and 2Ws clocking 26.7%, 34.3% 
and 16.9% growth respectively, despite certain persistent 
supply chain issues. The three-wheelers (3W) segment 
witnessed a remarkable 87.3% growth, albeit on a low 
base. Exports declined in all categories, except PVs, due to 
ongoing global headwinds. Overall, exports saw a sharp 
decline of 15.2%, to 4.8 million units from 5.6 million 
units in FY 2021-22.
2W segment
The domestic 2W sales grew 16.9% YoY in FY 2022-23, 
after witnessing de-growth in the previous three consecutive 
fiscals. The demand from rural India continues to remain 
moderate in the face of the inflationary and high interest 
rate environment. Owing to changes in consumer demand 
trends, new regulatory norms and the high cost of vehicle 
ownership, sales of entry-level vehicle category are expected 
to remain moderate in the near term. While scooter domestic 
sales grew 26.2%., motorcycles domestic sales grew 13.9% 
during FY 2022-23.
3W segment
3Ws posted 87% growth, to 488,768 units in 
FY 2022-23, driven by higher off-take of passenger carriers. 
The availability of finance, along with the availability of 
alternative fuels and state subsidies, have contributed to 
the growth of this segment. Passenger carrier volumes more 
than doubled to 361,094 units, while goods carrier sales 
increased 28% to 97,540 units during the year.
4W segment
The PV segment posted highest-ever domestic sales, 
growing at 26.7% to 3,890,114 units sold in FY 2022-23. 
Such growth was primarily driven by pent-up demand, a 
series of new model launches, and better product availability 
due to the relative easing of the semiconductor chips’ supply. 
There was high demand for higher-end variants and premium 
SUVs. The entry-level variant continues to be under some 
pressure, as customers in this category are still impacted 
by high-interest rates and an inflationary environment. 
Passenger car sales grew 19.1%, and utility vehicles (UV) 
posted a strong 34.5% growth in sales during FY 2022-23.
The commercial vehicle sales grew 34.3%, the second 
highest domestic sales ever, with the medium and heavy 
commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment growing 49.2% and 
the light commercial vehicle (LCV) segment clocking 26.8% 
growth in sales. The demand in the CV space was led by 
increased infra spending by the Central Government, 
improved freight movement across the country, an impending 
Onboard Diagnostic Device (OBD) Stage 2A price hike, 
and discount offers from OEMs. The demand for heavy 
trucks was strong given the massive infrastructure push by 
the government, besides increased activity in e-commerce, 
construction, and mining segments.

EV segment
Total EV sales surpassed the 1 million mark, with 1,152,021 
units sold, in FY 2022-23, according to the Society of 
Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV). Amongst the total 
EV sales, E2W captured the largest pie at 62%. The E3W 
sales stood at 401,841 units, accounting for 34% of the 
total EV sales. E4W sales accounted for 4% of the total sales 
at 47,217 units, whereas the sales of electric buses stood 
at 1,904 units. The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing 
of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) India scheme 
commenced on 1st April, 2019, for a period of three years, 
which was further extended for a period of two years 
up to 31st March, 2024. The revised FAME II has had a 
strong positive impact on adoption of E2Ws as it led to 
~35% decrease in prices. This, in turn, started attracting 
the component supply chain that had earlier stayed away 
because of extremely low volumes.
The demand from rural India 
continues to remain moderate in the 
light of the inflationary and high 
interest rate environment.
taken by central banks inflation has declined and food 
and energy prices have begun to cool off. However, price 
pressures sustain with labour markets remaining tight in 
several economies.

Indian Economic Overview
During FY 2022-23, the Indian economy witnessed 
sustainable growth despite the headwinds of the pandemic 
and geopolitical conflicts. There was an improvement in the 
current account deficit, with good growth seen in the banking 
sector. Led by strong monetary action by the Reserve Bank 
of India (RBI), coupled with the easing of international 
commodity prices and prompt government action, inflation 
was under control.
According to the National Statistics Office, the GDP 
growth in FY 2022-23 is estimated at 7% versus 9.1% in 
FY 2021-22, with the nation continuing to remain one 
of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. 
This is on account of the various government interventions 
and initiatives, as announced in Budget 2023-24, which laid 
strong emphasis on economic growth. The budget adopted 
seven priorities, namely inclusive development, green 
growth, reaching the last mile, infrastructure and investment, 
unleashing the potential, youth power, and a focus on the 
financial sector.
Future Outlook
The Economic Survey 2022-23 and the RBI have projected 
Indian economic growth at 6.5% in FY 2023-24 despite 
global uncertainties. Moderation in inflationary pressures, 
huge allocation to capital expenditure and increased 
public capital expenditure are expected to boost domestic 
economic growth. According to India’s Chief Economic 
Advisor, the economy has the potential to become a 
USD 5 trillion economy by FY 2025-26 and USD 7 trillion by 
FY 2030 depending on exchange rate fluctuation.

INDUSTRY SECTION
Global market
In 2022, the global automotive industry grappled with 
challenges posed by high-interest rates, supply chain 
problems, and recessionary fears, among others. 
Going forward, moderation in automobile demand will result 
in supply chain blockages becoming less acute. However, the 
semiconductor shortage is likely to be addressed in 2024 
with new semiconductor capacities coming into operation.
In 2022, according to ACEA (European Automobile 
Manufacturers’ Association), new vehicle registrations 
worldwide were unchanged at 66.2 million vehicles similar to 
that in 2021. Registrations were down 4.6% in the European 
Union at 9.255 million as compared to 9.7 million in 2021. 
Global auto production increased 7.9% with 7.1% growth in 
the European Union, 11.7% growth in the US, 11.7% growth 
in China and 21.6% growth in India. According to EIU, 
global new car sales are expected to rise by 0.9% in 2023, 
led by lower consumer spending, high commodity prices, 
and probable production shutdowns resulting from supply 
chain disruptions. Overall, following a decline in 2022, new 
vehicle sales will rise in 2023 to 79 million led by growth in 
Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.
EV sales are expected to witness 25% growth, to ~11 million 
units, during 2023, led by strong government support across 
the globe. Innovative EV incentive policies have been rolled 
out in several countries to encourage clean vehicle sales. 
The EU continues to focus on producing more electric vehicles, 
installing more charging infrastructure, and giving a boost 
to circular economy for End-of-Life vehicles and batteries. 
European automakers are rapidly adapting to the tougher 
legislations and are making cutting-edge technological strides 
to aid the process. All these developments are expected to 
give a boost to EV sales in the coming months.

Indian Automobile industry
The Indian automotive industry is worth more than USD 222 
billion, contributing 8% to total export, 7.1% to GDP and 
49% to manufacturing GDP. As per government estimates, 
the Indian automobile sector is set to become the third largest 
in the world by 2030. India is the fourth largest producer of 
automobiles in the world, with an average annual production 
of 25+ million motor vehicles. Two-wheelers (2W) and 
passenger cars dominate the market, with 76% and 17.4% 
market share respectively.
India is a strong player in the global heavy vehicles 
industry and is the largest tractor manufacturer, the second 
largest bus manufacturer, and the third largest heavy trucks 
manufacturer. Low-cost production is possible due to ready 
availability of cheap labour and low cost of raw materials. 
India is set to become the manufacturing hub of automobiles 
further supported by a weak currency.
The geopolitical tensions and COVID-19 third wave failed 
to dampen the Indian automobile sector, which clocked its 
highest ever annual domestic PV sales in 2022. A total of 
3.8 million units were sold in 2022, 23% higher than in 
The EU continues to focus on producing 
more electric vehicles, installing more 
charging infrastructure, and giving a 
boost to circular economy for End-of-Life

localisation of advanced automotive technologies, is not just 
going to deliver growth for the local EV market but is also 
going to boost exports of such advanced components from 
India. Indian exports have received a fillip in FY 2022-23, 
as the ‘China plus one’ strategy worked in favour of the 
Indian auto component industry. The growth in exports 
is attributable to the Indian component manufacturers’ 
endeavours to localise technology in India and offer 
high-quality components at competitive prices.
The overall Indian auto components industry, which accounts 
for 2.3% of India’s GDP, could benefit from the quick 
transition of European and American countries to electric 
engines from internal combustion engines (ICEs). This could 
lead to a shift in demand to Indian manufacturers, offering 
the industry some short-to-medium-term opportunities. 
The domestic market continues to register robust growth, 
be it PV, tractor, or commercial vehicle segments, with 
the latter in particular witnessing good growth in the 
M&HCV category owing to the government push on 
infrastructure development.

Historically, Endurance has taken several initiatives to 
offer complete solutions to its customers. The forward and 
backward integration projects like ABS modulators, wire 
braided hoses for ABS, aluminium forgings for inverted front 
forks, bottom-case for front-forks, and paper for clutches are 
examples of our initiative to bring in technology of high 
end products, start in-house manufacturing and substitute 
imports. The wire steel braided hoses are mainly used for 
ABS applications for mid and high-end bikes. For aluminium 
forging axle clamps required for inverted front forks, 
Endurance has entered into a technical collaboration. 
Supplies commenced from the Company’s Waluj, 
Aurangabad plant to fulfil existing requirements for supply 
of inverted front forks within and outside India, even as 
third-party orders were received for stem assembly and under 
bracket aluminium forgings. In addition, the Company is 
engaged with several OEMs for supply of aluminium forgings 
other than for inverted front forks. Both these projects are 
value-accretive.

Government policies
To facelift the transportation system, the Indian government 
is continuously striving to create an integrated EV mobility 
ecosystem. The government’s strategy and policies are 
intended to promote greater adoption of electric vehicles 
in response to the growing customer demand for cleaner 
transportation options.
The Indian government has an ambitious commitment 
to reducing the emissions to net zero by 2070. For this, 
transitioning towards electric vehicles is one of the key focus 
areas. To achieve its ambitious target of cutting its carbon 
emission to 30% by 2030, the government has taken 
multiple steps over the last few years. The government is also 
working to curb emissions through its Voluntary Vehicle Fleet 
Modernisation Programme (V-VMP), which offers tax benefits 
and discounts on replacing old vehicles with new ones; and 
Bharat Stage VI norms.
During the year, the government amended the National 
Policy on Biofuels – 2018, to fast forward the target of 20% 
blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% blending of biodiesel in 
diesel to FY 2025-26 from FY 2029-30.
In the Union Budget 2023, the government announced 
a slew of measures to give an impetus to the automobile 
industry, including reduction in basic custom duty rate from 
21% to 13%, increase in rebate on personal income tax 
from ` 5 lakh per annum to ` 7 lakh per annum, focus on 
greener mobility, and help of central government to scrap old 
vehicles. At the same time, with a focus on local production, 
the government raised the customs duty on fully imported 
luxury cars and EVs from 60% to 70%.

Overall industry outlook
The industry’s growth accelerated in 2022 and is 
predicted to continue in 2023. The anticipated easing of 
the semiconductor shortage will contribute to this growth. 
Clean technology will continue to remain the main focus area. 
In 2023, the pace of adoption of EVs, already witnessed in 
2022, will see further acceleration, especially in the 3W and 
scooter segment. According to FADA, the order book in the 
PV segment continues to be strong for several models, and 
this trend is expected to continue in the early part of 2023.
The continued global economic challenges are keeping the 
automobile industry in cautious mode. Additionally, interest 
rates are expected to rise, and companies are expected 
to pass on cost increases due to new safety norms and 
guidelines and reductions in subsidies. This may lead to 
a sharp increase in vehicle prices, dampening PV sales to 
some extent. The PV industry adopted the second phase of 
fuel efficiency regulations in April 2022, and is gearing 
up to meet the stringent second phase of BS-VI emission 
norms from April 2023. However, the increase in price for 
transitioning to new norms is expected to be less steep as 
compared to the BS-IV to BS-VI transition. The reduction in 
basic customs duty on goods (other than agriculture and 
textiles), from 21% to 13% may help offset some impact of 
increase in vehicle prices.
To keep the sales momentum buzzing, OEMs may look 
to launch new models and introduce product upgrades. 
As production normalises, the waiting period for several 
models may also stabilise. ICRA expects auto demand to 
remain steady, with 6-9% volume growth likely in FY 2023-24.
Indian auto components industry
After two successive years of de-growth (11.7% and 3% 
respectively in FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21), the Indian 
auto component sector clocked 23% revenue growth in 
FY 2021-22, and another 34.8% growth in H1 of 
FY 2022-23. During this half year, the industry size was 
estimated at ` 2.65 lakh crore. The full year FY 2022-23 
numbers are also expected to mirror a healthy growth. 
The increase was driven by the replacement market, 
domestic OEMs, export volumes, and pass-through of 
commodity prices. The growing presence of global 
automobile OEMs in the Indian auto components industry 
has significantly increased the localisation of their 
components in the country.
H1 FY 2022-23 data reveals that auto component exports 
and imports were fairly balanced at USD 10.1 billion. 
Further growth in imports is likely on account of the new 
norms applicable from 1st April, 2023. A lot of components, 
like the fabric for airbags and certain electronic components, 
will need to be imported to address these changes.
On the other hand, the component industry body is bullish 
about rising investments in the electrification space, with 
suppliers intensifying capex towards localisation of EV 
products, as well as developing the entire EV ecosystem.

Management Discussion and Analysis
INNOVATIVELY AGILE!
The Company is also looking to increase its anti-lock 
braking systems (ABS) business for 125cc plus motorcycles 
in collaboration with its technology partner. Supplies have 
already commenced to some key customers and Endurance 
is actively engaged with other OEMs for acquiring 
new ABS business.
The Company had recently commenced production of 
aluminium forgings, primarily for captive consumption, with 
technical inputs from an Italian counterpart. The Company is 
increasing its production capacity at its Waluj, Aurangabad 
plant from 280,000 parts per annum to 600,000 parts 
per annum with an incremental value of ` 750 million. 
The additional capacity is expected to come on stream in 
FY 2023-24 and reach a peak in FY 2024-25. The additional 
volumes will serve internal needs for higher volumes of 
inverted front forks and also certain third party business.
The Company is increasing its business of the 200cc 
motorcycle inverted front forks and adjustable rear mono 
shock absorbers with the help of its collaboration partner. It is 
boosting its supplies for on-road motorcycles, and is looking 
to start with the off-road motorcycles for inverted front forks 
and rear shock absorbers. Endurance is also focussing on 
fully finished machined aluminium castings, as compared to 
raw casting and semi-finished casting for 2Ws, 3Ws, and 
4Ws as well as for non-automotive casting.
Owing to the strong brand equity, customers recognise 
Endurance as a trusted and a capable partner in their value 
chain in terms of both technical and financial strengths. 
Today, Endurance is net debt free and has a net worth of 
over ` 40 billion.
Endurance has a very positive outlook for profitable 
business growth, based on new large business wins in the 
last three years, including those for electric vehicles, both in 
India and Europe.
In terms of financial performance, during FY  2022-23, 
76.8% of Endurance’s consolidated total income, including 
other income, came from Indian operations, 0.2% from 
Maxwell and the balance 23% from Europe. In FY 2022-23, 
the export sales of the India standalone business declined 
by 5.5% from ` 2,264.80 million to ` 2,139.76 million. 
The major impact was due to lower aftermarket exports 
to countries in Africa, South America as well as India’s 
neighbouring countries.
In India, ` 9,350 million of new business was won from 
OEMs other than the largest customer. These wins include 
` 7,800 million of new business and ` 1,550 million of 
replacement business. The total business win for EVs till date 
stood at ` 6,004 million of which ` 3,765 million worth 
new orders were bagged in FY 2022-23. The Company 
has received ` 25,668 million worth of requests for 
quotes from OEMs.
In Europe, in FY 2022-23, the Company won € 83.87 
million of new business. Cumulatively, in the last 
2 years, approximately € 158 million of new business 
was won in Europe.
The aforesaid orders secured in both regions have been 
won despite adverse macro-economic factors. The quantum 
of these orders, and sizeable EV/Hybrid related business 
therein, are very significant for the future growth 
of the Company.

manner. Maxwell is in the business of advanced electronics, 
particularly in the battery management space (BMS) for 
automobile EVs and stationary storage. Endurance plans to 
The Company promotes a culture of safety which goes 
beyond the workplace and beyond the workforce. In terms 
of implementing safety measures, the Company has achieved 
some significant milestones. It has consistently achieved an 
accident frequency rate (LTFR) of less than 1.5 and a severity 
rate (LTSR) of less than 200. Its rigorous Environmental Health 
and Safety (EHS) procedures and practices, implemented 
across India, resulted in fewer accidents. Employees are 
well aware of the EHS requirements and the importance 
of incorporating an EHS culture into the manufacturing 
process at Endurance.

During FY 2022-23, ESpA reported a 14.7% increase in 
total income to € 155.5 million, as compared to € 135.5 
million in FY 2021-22. The growth is partially due to higher 
sales prices on account of pass-through of material price 
increases. The profit after tax increased by 8% to € 4.0 
million as compared to € 3.7 million in the previous year. 
PAT margin at 2.6% was significantly lower compared 
to the earlier years, primarily due to rise in the price of 
energy, owing to the turmoil in the energy market in Europe. 
There was unprecedented increase in electricity prices 
by 250% in FY 2021-22 and 63% in FY 2022-23, while 
gas prices increased by 300% in FY 2021-22 and 70% in 
FY 2022-23. Certain corrective measures were taken by 
the Company to contain the negative effects of these energy 
price increases in the year.
The effective tax rate for ESpA was lower than the marginal 
rate, as it benefited from higher allowable depreciation 
related to technologically-advanced machines bought in 
previous years. Nevertheless, considering the significant 
carrying benefit anticipated for the next three years, no 
additional tax assets were recorded. A further benefit 
in terms of energy consumption savings is expected in 
FY 2023-24, as solar panels are under installation. During the 
year, the Company won new orders from OEMs, particularly 
powertrain components in BEV, Hybrid and ICE vehicles, 
for about € 50 million of annual turnover with start of 
production in FY 2023-24.

in the German market. During the year, EGmbH reported 
2.1% increase in total income to € 50.4 million as compared 
to € 49.3 million in the previous year. The growth is partially 
due to the higher sales prices on account of pass-through of 
material price increases. Profit after tax was € 1.4 million as 
against the previous year’s profit of € 1.1 million.
During the year, the Company won new orders from German 
OEMs, for about € 25 million of peak expected annual 
turnover, with start of production in FY 2024-25 to BEV, 
Hybrid and ICE applications.

total income to € 41.5 million, from both intra-group and 
third party customers, as compared to € 35.5 million in the 
previous year. As aluminium die-casting is an energy-intensive 
company, ECSpA suffered energy cost increases which were 
offset by its customers. Profit after tax increased to € 2.7 
million as compared to € 1.4 million in the previous year. 
Net profit was also marginally higher on account of lower 
taxes, which in turn was due higher allowable depreciation 
related to the technologically-advanced machines bought in 
previous years. ECSpA won new orders in FY 2022-23 from 
third party customers for about € 4.1 million of peak annual

billion of Aftermarket revenues from India, and posted 
a 12.5% CAGR of such revenues from FY 2016-17 to 
FY 2022-23, by establishing a strong distribution presence in 
India and abroad.
While the Company will continue to focus on its in-house 
suspension, braking systems, and transmission products, it will 
also enhance its focus on traded or outsourced value-added 
products including tyres, which are manufactured through 
outsourcing, but are based on our registered tread 
designs and brand.
The key growth strategies for domestic Aftermarkets include 
a focus on increasing market share in each product segment 
and each State, with penetration in smaller districts. We have 
started a governing council for our strategic distributors to 
build strong relationships with them. We have also added 
warehouses in key strategic locations to reduce turnaround 
time and improve our service.
On the Channel relationship front, to move away from 
transactional relationships to participative management 
relationships, a 15-member distributor governing council 
meets twice a year for a discussion and implementation of 
profitable growth strategies in the domestic market.
Larger dealers dealing with all product categories of 
Endurance are better for the long-term interest of the business. 
Therefore, an Endurance special club of dealers called 
ECC, having a minimum ` 10 million business relation with 
Endurance is promoted with additional benefits over regular 
dealers. This brings consistency and market share gains from 
the competition.
To expand the export business, there is a constant effort 
to enter new countries every year in line with domestic 
OEMs. Besides this, new product lines based on non-Indian 
vehicles are being developed to enter some high-potential 
countries where Indian vehicle potential is not sufficient. 
For our global market, we have been increasing our share in 
South Africa, Asia and Latin American countries. Our focus 
continues to increase our market share in each product 
segment while expanding our range of products. Plans are 
on the anvil to increase the distribution network in all the 
countries having Indian 2W/3W vehicle exports.

Management Discussion and Analysis
INNOVATIVELY AGILE!
Human capital is crucial to 
business growth and continuity. 
Any disputes or high attrition may 
impact profitability.
Mitigation strategy: Well-structured HR policies ensure that the personal growth of 
employees is aligned with the business growth of the organisation. Focus on training 
and development, job satisfaction, motivated work culture, and timely rewards and 
recognition, enable the Company to keep the retention rate high. The Company fosters a 
safe, productive and healthy work environment.
Human capital risk
Supply chain is integral to 
the smooth functioning of 
any business. This has direct 
bearing on business operations 
and profitability.
Mitigation strategy: Timely payments, business-friendly approach coupled with 
long-lasting vendor relationships helps the Company ensure uninterrupted supply. 
The policy of paying advances, as deemed fit, strengthens the bond with suppliers further. 
Endurance also shares close relationships with its own OEM customers, who supported 
it during escalation of commodity prices triggered by the external geopolitical situation. 
Indigenous sourcing of certain materials, meticulous material planning, and long-term 
fixed price contracts are other measures which help mitigate supply chain risks.
Supply chain risk
Increased dependence on any 
customer for revenue leads to 
risk to profits in the event of 
negative performance by that 
client’s business.
Mitigation strategy: The Company has a wide client base. Some amount of client 
concentration is only with strong industry leaders. It is the constant endeavour of the 
Company to expand its geographical footprint and client base to reduce risk from 
customer concentration.
Customer concentration
Given the lucrative growth 
prospects of the industry it 
operates, the Company faces 
competitive pressure from local 
and/or international players.
Mitigation strategy: Superior product quality, competitive pricing, focus on 
innovation, long-standing leadership position, deep-rooted client relations, and vast 
product portfolio give an edge to the Company over the competition. Its stronghold in the 
market is effective in countering the impact of competition on business.
Competitive risk
The ongoing geopolitical conflict 
poses a threat to energy price 
stability, global-level supply 
chains, and economic growth in 
many regions, which in turn may 
impact business growth.
Mitigation strategy: The Company has expanded its vendor base and focussed on 
strategic sourcing, cost optimisation and value addition. This has enabled it to effectively 
manage such turmoil. In case of certain key commodities, price changes are borne by 
the OEMs. The Company has ramped up its domestic supplier capacities to reduce 
dependence on China and the international supply chain. Indigenisation and value chain 
integration are also measures undertaken to mitigate such risks. In Europe, the Company 
manages energy price fluctuations by customer pass-through, government support and 
increasing use of sustainable energy. The latter is also true for Indian operations.
Global turmoil
Fluctuation in prices of key raw 
materials like aluminium and steel 
directly impacts profitability.
Mitigation strategy: The Company insulates itself from fluctuation in commodity prices, 
as price changes are effectively passed through to the OEM customers, in terms of the 
contracts entered into with them. This makes it unnecessary to undertake any commodity 
hedging. However, despite maintaining the same margins in absolute terms, higher metal 
prices lead to an arithmetical adverse impact on percentage margins, and vice versa.
Raw material price volatility
RISK MANAGEMENT
Profitability of the Company gets 
negatively impacted in case 
of any unfavourable global or 
local event that affects the auto 
segment or economic growth.
Mitigation strategy: The Company has diversified its geographical presence as well 
as its product offerings in the auto component segment. The Company supplies its products 
to multiple OEMs and also to the Aftermarket. Its strong brand equity, long-standing 
customer relationships, excellent trade relations with vendors and superior quality control 
enable it to stay ahead of the industry curve.
Macro-economic slowdown
Veicoli reported a total income of € 0.9 million and a profit 
after tax of € 0.1 million (not comparable to the previous 
year, where the company’s results were consolidated for only 
part of the year). Efforts are on-going to grow the business by 
expanding the offering and adding new customers.
Frenotecnica Srl: Frenotecnica Srl (“Frenotecnica”), is 
the new step-down operating subsidiary in Italy acquired 
in June 2022. Frenotecnica is primarily engaged in 
manufacturing the operation of brake pads for 2Ws in the 
after-market and replacement business. In January 2023, 
Frenotecnica changed its reporting period to 31st March 
from 31st December, to align uniformly with other group 
companies and hence the corresponding previous year 
financial numbers are not comparable. Post-acquisition, the 
Company contributed a total income of € 3.1 million and a 
profit after tax of € 0.1 million.
New Fren Srl: New Fren Srl (“New Fren”), is the 
new step-down operating subsidiary in Italy acquired in 
November 2022. New Fren is primarily engaged in the 
manufacturing operation of brake discs, centrifugal clutches, 
clutch discs, pads and brake shoes for 2Ws for sale in the 
after-market and replacement business. In January 2023, 
New Fren changed its reporting period to 31st March from 
31st December, to align uniformly with the other group 
companies in Europe and hence the corresponding previous 
year financial numbers are not comparable. Post-acquisition, 
the Company recorded a total income for € 2.2 million and a 
net loss of € 0.2 million.
QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY FOCUS
The Company considers quality as a key driver of its growth 
strategy. Adherence to the stringent QCDDM parameters has 
enabled it to establish sustained market leadership, business 
sustainability, and long-lasting customer relationships 
globally. All its outsourcing business partners and vendors 
have to comply with QCDDM parameters, quintessential 
for a seamless supply chain. To ensure value creation for 
all stakeholders, the Company lays strong emphasis on 
strong production capabilities, internal process control and 
corporate governance.
Total Productivity Management (TPM) remains integral to 
ensuring proactive and preventive equipment maintenance 
to maximise operational efficiency and to empower 
operators. TPM helps in increasing uptime, reducing cycle 
times and eliminating defects, thereby leading to less 
unplanned maintenance, reduced equipment downtime, 
cost optimisation, space savings, higher levels of workplace 
safety, and defect-free manufacturing on assembly lines. 
It also enables improvement in material handling processes 
through real-time quality checks and lower human intervention 
on critical operations. TPM has proved to be an effective tool 
for productivity enhancement.

Debtors Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Current Ratio and 
Operating Profit Margin.
During the year under review, Interest Coverage Ratio 
decreased to 133 times from 302 times in the previous year, 
primarily on account of increase in borrowings and increase 
in interest rates.
MANAGEMENT OUTLOOK
Endurance is strategically focussed on harnessing the 
opportunities in the automobile sector to grow through 
either M&A, greenfield projects or brownfield expansion. 
It continues to invest in new technologies that are designed 
to aid light-weighting and enhance cost efficiencies. 
Backward integration and value engineering remain critical 
to the Company’s growth plans, which are centred around 
tapping with agility, into the potential created by the 
emerging trends in the industry. With customer satisfaction 
integral to its strategic approach, Endurance also remains 
focussed on the innovation of quality products that are safer, 
more affordable and deliver greater efficiencies.
Given the importance of a team in steering a Company’s 
business plans, the Company has prioritised the development 
and progress of its people, along with their welfare and 
well-being. Strong vendor relationships are another key 
driver of its growth journey. The Company takes several 
initiatives aimed at making its operations and products 
more sustainable. Tight fiscal discipline is another area that 
the Company remains proactively focussed on nurturing, 
as part of its efforts to build a more agile, lean and 
future-fit organisation.

I have conducted the Secretarial Audit of the compliance 
of applicable statutory provisions and the adherence to 
good corporate practices by Endurance Technologies Ltd.

conducted in a manner that provided me a reasonable basis 
for evaluating the corporate conduct / statutory compliances

Auditor’s Responsibility:
My responsibility is to express an opinion on the compliance 
of the applicable laws and maintenance of records based

requires that the Auditor shall comply with statutory and

planned and performed in accordance with the Standards.
Unmodified opinion:

maintained by the Company and also the information 
provided by the Company, its officers, agents and authorised 
representatives during the conduct of secretarial audit, I 
hereby report that in my opinion, the Company has, during the 
audit period covering the financial year ended on 31 March, 
2023, complied with the statutory provisions listed hereunder 
and also that the Company has proper Board-processes and 
compliance-mechanism in place to the extent, in the manner 
and subject to the reporting made hereinafter.
I have examined the books, papers, minute books, forms and 
returns filed and other records maintained by the Company 
for the financial year ended on 31 March, 2023 according 
to the provisions of:

Risk
•	 Raw materials are the most important 
input in the production of goods. Cost 
of raw materials forms a significantly 
higher proportion in the total cost to the 
Company as compared to other costs. 
Availability of raw materials is subject 
to market volatility, resulting from 
supply chain disruptions, increased 
demand with significant increase in the 
price.
•	 Moreover, the Company relies on 
third parties to source raw materials, 
parts and components used in 
the manufacture of the products. 
Disruptions to supply chains and 
shortages of essential raw materials, 
parts and components may adversely 
affect the production volume, results of 
operations, revenue and profitability of 
the Company.
•	 In addition to it, ongoing geopolitical 
conflicts pose a great threat to 
commodity price stability, including 
energy price stability and global 
supply chains.
•	 Devised and implemented 
sourcing strategy targeted at 
diversifying sourcing, driving 
localisation of procuring 
critical components for 
production, robust vendor 
selection process and 
conducting regular vendor 
audit.
•	 Developing strong brand 
equity, long-standing 
relationships with vendors, 
excellent trade relations and 
ensuring superior quality 
control.
•	 Indigenisation and value 
chain integration
•	 Pass-through of changes in 
raw material prices to the 
OEMs as per the contracts 
signed.
Negative impact on 
profitability and business 
growth

Customer 
concentration
Risk and 
Opportunity
Customer concentration can lead to 
an adverse impact on the Company’s 
business, should such a customer  reduce 
purchase / off-take from the Company.
•	 Significant steps have been 
taken to mitigate the risk:
	
–	 Diversification of 
customer base.
	
–	 Client concentration 
only with strong industry 
leaders.
	
–	 Expansion of 
geographical footprint.
Positive and Negative,

Product 
innovation
Opportunity
•	 In order to remain competitive in this 
dynamic and challenging automotive 
market, it becomes imperative for the 
Company to offer innovative products 
to customers while maintaining product 
quality standards.
•	 Company has dedicated Research and 
Development facilities for all its product 
segments. Company’s strong focus 
on continuous and intensive research

The Company believes, that as a corporate citizen, we carry the responsibility to 
reciprocate for the betterment of the society and environment for a sustainable future. 
We are committed to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(UNSDGs). We frame our polices and initiatives in line with the UNSDGs, NGRBC 
principles and national regulatory requirements.
We have envisioned sustainability targets for FY 2023-24 for driving carbon neutrality. 
Further, initiatives have been undertaken for reducing energy consumption with a 
focused approach towards procuring renewable energy, water recovery, reducing 
and recycling hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The Company is in the process 
of implementing 6R’s of sustainability in manufacturing viz. Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle, and Repair. We are consistently working towards enhancing the 
use of cleaner fuels, harnessing solar energy, implementing zero liquid discharge 
and effective waste disposal system in plants to avoid landfill, and take steps for 
afforestation by planting of trees around our manufacturing facilities.
It is our constant endeavor to bring positive impact to economically weaker strata of 
society through village development programmes where we improve sanitation, ensure 
availability of better educational infrastructure, facilitate medical care and health 
check-ups. We believe that education is an empowering tool for a better future and are 
working towards making education available and accessible to children residing in 
remote areas, in the vicinity of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. The Company also promotes 
vocational training, undertakes digital literacy drives, amongst other initiatives.
We understand that in order to achieve sustainability, we have to join hands with 
stakeholders in the value chain. We assist and guide our suppliers and vendors to 
implement environment friendly operations in their facilities in a sustainable manner. 
Further, as part of ‘contract management system’ implemented in our plants, trainings 
and awareness sessions are conducted on various safety measures.
We shall continue to assess, review and monitor our operations and processes to 
accelerate our efforts to achieve sustainability across the value chain.

Manufacturing operations generate various types of wastes such as plastic waste, e-waste, paper waste, wood waste, used 
oil, etc. The Company follows a structured approach for reclaiming products. Detailed procedure for safely reclaiming 
products in each category has been described below:
	
(a)	 Plastic Waste – Plastic waste is generated in packaging of the products of the Company. Plastic waste is given to 
agencies authorised by Pollution Control Board (“PCB”) for recycle and refabrication.
	
(b)	 E-waste – Our product portfolio comprises production of auto components and other allied products. However, as a 
mechanism to ensure proper disposal of e-waste generated within the Company’s premises, such waste is disposed/ 
discarded safely after their useful life by giving to authorised agencies as per ‘E-waste Management and 
Handling’ rules.
	
(c)	 Hazardous waste – It is ensured that hazardous waste generated is safely disposed as specified in consent to 
operate, through Government authorised treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Hazardous waste like used oil, 
spent xyline, empty cans, empty barrels are recycled in compliance with respective PCB guidelines.
	
(d)	 Other wastes – Other wastes such as scrap metal, wooden packing, cardboards are sent for recycling. 
	
Reclaiming of products is not applicable.

Yes. The Company has a Vigil Mechanism-cum-Whistle Blower Policy which provides, amongst other matters, a 
mechanism for directors and employees to report unethical behavior, suspected or actual fraud. The policy protects a 
whistle blower from any kind of discrimination, harassment, victimisation or any other unfair employment practice. The 
policy is available at https://www.endurancegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Whistle-Blower-policy.pdf
In addition to this, employees and workers may register their grievances to their immediate supervisor, responsible 
to resolve the issue within defined timeframe. If the employee does not receive a satisfactory resolution of issue, then 
the aggrieved party may present the grievance to the ‘Grievance Committee’ (‘GC’) in writing through the respective 
plant HR Head. The GC is chaired by the Plant /Operations Head and comprises following members:
Plant HR Head and one official not less than the grade of Senior Officer and two other members representing 
workmen.
At a few plants whenever the aggrieved person is a workman who is a union member, then the respective Plant HR 
head is responsible to ensure that the union committee is also given an option to nominate two of their representatives 
on the GC. The plant HR is responsible to organise a meeting at the plant level GC for a minimum 30 minutes in their 
respective plants (irrespective of whether grievances are registered or not) every first Friday of the month in the Pune 
Region and every first Monday of the month in Aurangabad and the rest of India. The Group ER Regional in-charge 
facilitates the meetings of the ‘GC’, i.e., the Group ER Regional in-charge or his/her representative are present for the 
‘GC’ meetings as a ‘Process Facilitator’.

the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter 
below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter 
is provided in that context.
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial 
statements section of our report, including in relation to these 
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements. The results of our audit procedures, including 
the procedures performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying 
standalone financial statements.
Other Information
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Corporate Governance report 
(but does not include the standalone financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon) which we obtained prior to the 
date of this auditor’s report, and the Board’s Report, Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), Management 
Discussion and Analysis and Corporate Overview, which is 
expected to be made available to us after that date.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above and, in doing so, consider whether such 
other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on 
the work we have performed on the other information that we 
obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.
When we read the Board’s Report, Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR), Management Discussion 
and Analysis and Corporate Overview, if we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these standalone financial statements that 
give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, cash 
flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management 
is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate 
the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment assessment for investment in Maxwell Energy Systems Private Limited (as described in Note 2.03 
a(iii) of the standalone financial statements)
The Company has investment of ` 1,356.18 million in equity 
shares of its subsidiary Maxwell Energy Systems Private Limited 
(“Maxwell”) as at March 31, 2023.
As required by Ind AS 36 “Impairment of assets”, at each 
reporting period end, management assesses the existence of 
impairment indicators for investments in subsidiaries. In case of 
existence of impairment indicators, the investment balances are 
subjected to impairment test.
The recoverable amount of investment in subsidiary is 
determined based on the discounted cash flow model which 
has sensitivity around key assumptions such as operating 
margins, discount rate, terminal growth, etc. and involves 
significant judgements and estimates.
This is considered as a key audit matter as the amount 
of investment in Maxwell is material to the standalone 
financial statements of the Company and the determination 
of recoverable value for impairment assessment involves 
significant management judgements and estimates.
Our audit procedures included the following:
•	 We obtained understating of the Company’s process on 
assessment of impairment of investments and tested the design 
and operating effectiveness of the relevant controls over 
impairment assessment.
•	 We evaluated the Company’s valuation methodology applied 
in determining the recoverable amount. We also assessed the 
objectivity and independence of Company’s external specialist 
involved in the process.
•	 We involved valuation specialist, where necessary, to assist in 
assessing the appropriateness of the valuation model including 
the independent assessment of the underlying key assumptions 
relating to operating margins, discount rate and terminal growth.
•	 We also assessed the recoverable value headroom by performing 
sensitivity testing of key assumptions used.
•	 We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
•	 We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements

•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Re: Endurance Technologies Limited (“the Company”)
In terms of the information and explanations sought by us and 
given by the Company and the books of account and records 
examined by us in the normal course of audit and to the best 
of our knowledge and belief, we state that:
(i)	
(a)	 (A)	 The

maintained 
proper 
records showing full particulars, including 
quantitative details and situation of Property, 
Plant and Equipment.
	
	
(B)	 The Company has maintained proper records 
showing full particulars of Intangible Assets.
	
(b)	 All Property, Plant and Equipment were physically 
verified by the management in the previous year in 
accordance with a planned programme of verifying 
them once in three years which, in our opinion, 
is reasonable having regard to the size of the 
Company and the nature of its assets. No material 
discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
	
(c)	
The title deeds of all the immovable properties 
(other than properties where the Company is the 
lessee and the lease agreements are duly executed 
in favour of the lessee) are held in the name 
of the Company.

(ii)	 (a)	 The inventory has been physically verified by 
the management during the year except for 
inventories lying with third parties. In our opinion, 
the frequency of verification by the management 
is reasonable and the coverage and procedure 
for such verification is appropriate. Discrepancies 
of 10% or more in aggregate for each class 
of inventory were not noticed in respect of such 
physical verification. Inventories lying with third 
parties have been confirmed by them as at 
March 31, 2023 and discrepancies of 10% or 
more in aggregate for each class of inventory were 
not noticed in respect of such confirmations.

have fallen due during the year, that have been

applicable to the Company.
(xvii)	The Company has not incurred cash losses in the current 
financial year and immediately preceding financial year.
(xviii)	There has been no resignation of the statutory auditors 
during the year and accordingly requirement to report 
on Clause 3(xviii) of the Order is not applicable 
to the Company.
(xix)	On the basis of the financial ratios disclosed in note 42 
to the financial statements, ageing and expected dates of 
realization of financial assets and payment of financial 
liabilities, other information accompanying the financial 
statements, our knowledge of the Board of Directors and 
management plans and based on our examination of 
the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has 
come to our attention, which causes us to believe that 
any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the 
audit report that Company is not capable of meeting its 
liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and 
when they fall due within a period of one year from the 
balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not 
an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. 
We further state that our reporting is based on the facts 
up to the date of the audit report and we neither give 
any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities 
falling due within a period of one year from the balance 
sheet date, will get discharged by the Company as and 
when they fall due.
(xx)	 (a)	 In respect of other than ongoing projects, there 
are no unspent amounts which are required to be 
transferred to a fund specified in Schedule VII of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (the Act), in compliance with 
second proviso to sub section 5 of section 135 of 
the Act. This matter has been disclosed in note 37 
to the financial statements.
	
(b)	 There are no unspent amounts in respect of ongoing 
projects, that are required to be transferred to a 
special account in compliance of provision of 
sub section (6) of section 135 of Companies Act. 
This matter has been disclosed in note 37 to the 
financial statements.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements of Endurance Technologies 
Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction 
with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, as 
specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both 
issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to these standalone financial statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to these standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to these Standalone Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls With Reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial control with reference to standalone 
financial statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

The financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 
2023 were approved for issue in accordance with the 
resolution of the Board of Directors on 17th May, 2023.

Significant Accounting Policies
2.01	Statement of Compliance
	
The financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) notified under the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
(as amended from time to time) and the presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS Compliant Schedule 
III), as applicable.
2.02	Basis of preparation and presentation
	
These financial statements have been prepared on 
a historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments which have been measured at fair value 
at the end of each reporting period, as explained 
under accounting policy 2.16. The financial statements 
are presented in INR and all values are rounded off 
to the nearest million (INR 000,000), except as 
stated otherwise.
	
The Company has prepared the financial statements 
on the basis that it will continue to operate as 
a going concern.
2.03	Use of estimates and assumptions
	
The preparation of these financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates 
could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities 
affected in future periods.
a. 	
Estimates
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and future periods are affected.
	
Key sources of estimation of uncertainty at the date of 
the financial statements, which have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are in respect of useful lives of property, plant and 
equipment, defined benefit plan and impairment of non 
current investments.
	
(i)	
Useful lives of Property, plant and equipment
	
	
The Company reviews the useful life of property, 
plant and equipment at the end of each reporting 
period. This reassessment may result in change in 
depreciation expense in future periods.
	
(ii)	 Defined benefit plan
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and 
other post-employment benefits and the present 
value of the gratuity obligation are determined 
using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation 
involves making various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount 
rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. 
Due to the complexities involved in the valuation 
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these 
assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting date.
	
	
The parameter most subject to change is the 
discount rate. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate for plans operated in India, the 
management considers the interest rates of 
government bonds where remaining maturity of 
such bond correspond to expected term of defined 
benefit obligation.
	
	
The mortality rate is based on publicly available 
mortality tables for India. Those mortality tables 
tend to change only at interval in response to 
demographic changes. Future salary increases 
and gratuity increases are based on expected

Contract liabilities
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods 
to a customer for which the Company has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Company transfers goods or services to 
the customer, a contract liability is recognized when 
the payment is received. Contract liabilities are 
recognized as revenue when the Company performs 
under the contract.
	
Refund liabilities
	
A refund liability is the obligation to refund some or 
all the consideration received (or receivable) from the 
customer and is measured at the amount the Company 
ultimately expects it will have to return to the customer. 
The Company updates its estimates of refund liabilities 
(and the corresponding change in the transaction price) 
at the end of each reporting period.
2.05	Leases
	
The determination of whether an arrangement is 
(or contains) a lease is based on the substance 
of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. 
The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of 
the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific 
asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to 
use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly 
specified in an arrangement.
	
Company as a lessee
	
The Company applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. 
The Company recognizes lease liabilities to make lease 
payments and right-of-use assets representing the right 
to use the underlying assets.
	
Right-of-use assets
	
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets 
are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, 
initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made 
at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term 
and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the 
Company at the end of the lease term or the cost 
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation 
is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. 
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to note 2.14.2 Impairment of non-financial assets.
	
Lease Liabilities
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company 
recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed payments less 
any lease incentives receivable.
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest rate 
implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced 
for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying 
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in 
the lease payments or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset.
	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and 
equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 
12 months or less from the commencement date and 
do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the 
lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to 
leases of office equipment that are considered to be low 
value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.06	Foreign Currency and derivatives
	
The 
functional 
currency 
of 
the 
Company 
is 
the Indian Rupee.
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the 
balance sheet date; and exchange gains and losses 
arising on settlement or translation are recognized in 
the statement of profit and loss.
future inflation rates for the respective countries. 
Further details about gratuity obligations are 
given in Note 29.
	
(iii) 	 Impairment of non-current investments (other than 
financial assets)
	
	
Impairment exists when the carrying value of 
an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair 
value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 
The fair value less costs of disposal calculation 
is based on available data from binding sales 
transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar 
assets or observable market prices less incremental 
costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use 
calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash 
flows are derived from the budget approved 
by the senior management and do not include 
restructuring activities that the Company is not yet 
committed to or significant future investments that 
will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU 
being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive 
to the discount rate used for the DCF model as well 
as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth 
rate used for extrapolation purposes.
2.04	Revenue from contract with customer
	
Revenue is recognized when control of goods and 
services have been transferred to the customer; at 
an amount that reflects the consideration which the 
Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services. The timing of when the Company 
transfers the goods or provide services may differ from 
the timing of the customer’s payment. Amounts disclosed 
as revenue are net of goods and service tax (GST).
	
The Company has generally concluded that it is 
the principal in its revenue arrangements, because 
it typically controls the goods or services before 
transferring them to the customer.
	
The disclosures of significant accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from 
contracts with customers are provided below.
	
Sale of Goods
	
The Company based on the underlying agreements has 
determined that the transfer of control to the customer 
and therefore revenue recognition, in regard to the 
domestic sales and export sales, generally corresponds 
to the date when the goods are dispatched from their 
point of sale, or when the goods are made available 
to the customer, or when the goods are released to 
the carrier responsible for transporting them to the 
customer. Export sales are recorded at the relevant 
exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date.
	
Generally, the normal credit period is 30 to 60 days 
upon delivery for customers in India and 30 to 120 days 
for overseas customers. The nature of contracts of the 
Company are such that no material part performance 
obligations would remain unfulfilled at the end of any 
accounting period.
	
Variable consideration
	
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable 
amount (like volume rebates/incentives, discounts etc.), 
the Company estimates the amount of consideration to 
which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the 
goods to the customer. The variable consideration is 
estimated at contract inception and constrained until it 
is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in 
the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not 
occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable 
consideration is subsequently resolved. The estimate 
of variable consideration for expected future volume 
rebates/incentives, cash discounts etc. are made on the 
most likely amount method. Revenue is disclosed net 
of such amounts.
	
Warranty obligations
	
The Company provides warranties for general repairs 
of defects as per terms of the contract with customers. 
These warranties are considered as assurance type 
warranties and are accounted for under Ind AS 37- 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
	
Revenue from job work
	
The Company provides job work services to its 
customers. Such services are sold separately and are 
not bundled together with the sale of Company’s goods. 
Revenue from job work is accounted as and when such 
services are rendered.
	
Contract balances
	
Trade receivables
	
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an 
amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., 
only the passage of time is required before payment 
of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policy 
no. 2.16 Financial instruments – Financial assets at 
amortized cost.

2. 	
Defined benefit plan:
	
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit 
method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the 
end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, 
comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of 
the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the 
return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected 
immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or 
credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized 
in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately 
in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service cost 
is recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan 
amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the 
discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net 
defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs 
are categorized as follows:
	
•	
service cost (including current service cost, past 
service cost, as well as gains and losses on 
curtailments and settlements);
	
• 	
net interest expense or income; and
	
• 	
remeasurement.
	
Gratuity: The Company has an obligation towards 
gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering 
eligible employees. The plan provides for a lump sum 
payment to vested employees at retirement, death while 
in employment or on termination of employment of an 
amount equivalent to 15/26 days salary payable for 
each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon 
completion of five years of service. For the employees 
of specified grades, who have completed 10 years of 
service, an amount equal to 30 days salary is payable 
for each completed year of service. The Company 
accounts for the liability for gratuity benefits payable 
in future based on an independent actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method at the reporting 
date. The Company has taken a Company Gratuity 
cum Life Assurance Scheme with LIC of India for future 
payment of gratuity to the eligible employees.
3. 	
Compensated absences:
	
The Company provides for the encashment of 
compensated absences with pay subject to certain rules. 
The employees are entitled to accumulate compensated 
absences subject to certain limits, for future encashment. 
Such benefits are provided based on the number of days 
of unutilized compensated absence on the basis of an 
independent actuarial valuation using the projected unit 
credit method at the reporting date. Actuarial gains/
losses are immediately taken to profit or loss and are 
not deferred. The Company has taken a policy with LIC 
of India for future payment of compensated absences 
encashment to its employees.
2.10	Taxes
	
Income tax expense comprises of current tax expense 
and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability 
during the year. Current and deferred taxes are 
recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate 
to items that are recognized in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the 
current and deferred tax are also recognized in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax 
and deferred tax.
	
Current income tax
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
tax authorities.
	
The Company’s current tax is measured using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
end of the reporting period.
	
Current income tax relating to items recognized 
outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income or in equity). 
Current tax items are recognized in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and considers whether it is probable that the taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment.
	
The Company shall reflect the effect of uncertainty for 
each uncertain tax treatment by using either most likely 
method or expected value method depending on which 
method predicts better resolution of the treatment.
	
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes 
are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting 
advance tax paid and income tax provision arising 
in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant 
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the 
gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair value gain 
or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or loss are also 
recognized in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
	
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial 
recognition of the related asset, expense or income 
(or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance 
consideration, the date of the transaction is the 
date on which the Company initially recognizes the 
non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising 
from the advance consideration. If there are multiple 
payments or receipts in advance, the Company 
determines the transaction date for each payment or 
receipt of advance consideration.
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as foreign currency forward contracts and fixed 
currency swaps, to hedge its foreign currency risks. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as 
financial assets when the fair value is positive and as 
financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or 
loss. The foreign exchange forward contracts are not 
designated as cash flow hedges and are entered into 
for periods consistent with foreign currency exposure of 
the underlying transactions.
2.07	Borrowing Costs
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get 
ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as 
part of the cost of assets, until such time as the assets 
are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
	
Interest income earned on the temporary investment 
of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on 
qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalization.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit 
or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to 
the borrowing costs.
2.08	Government grants and export incentives
1. 	
Government grants
	
Government grants are recognized at their fair value 
where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant 
will be received and all attached conditions will be 
complied with. Government grants relating to income 
are deferred and recognized in the profit or loss over 
the periods necessary to match them with the costs that 
they are intended to compensate and are presented 
within other operating revenues.
2. 	
Export benefits
	
Export benefits are accrued in the year of exports 
based on eligibility and when there is no uncertainty in 
receiving the same.
	
Export benefits in the nature of Remission of Duties and 
Taxes on Export Product (RODTEP) scheme and Duty 
Drawback are recognized on accrual basis in the 
year of export.
3. 	
Government grant in respect of loan
	
The benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate 
of interest is treated as a government grant, measured 
as the difference between proceeds received and 
the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market 
interest rates.
2.09	Employee benefits
1. 	
Defined contribution plan:
	
Provident fund: The eligible employees of the Company 
are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund, 
a defined contribution plan, in which both employees 
and the Company make monthly contributions at a 
specified percentage of the covered employee’s salary. 
The contributions as specified under the law are paid to 
the Central Government Provident Fund and the Family 
Pension Fund and the same is charged to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss in the year when the contributions

life and amortization method are reviewed at the end 
of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes 
in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
i) 	
Technical knowhow is amortized over a period 
ranging from six to ten years;
	
ii) 	 Software is amortized over a period of three years.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are 
acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Internally generated intangible 
assets, excluding capitalized development cost, are not 
capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected in 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which the 
expenditure is incurred.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., 
at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss. 
when the asset is derecognised.
2.13	Non-current assets held for sale
	
The Company classifies non-current assets as held for sale 
if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally 
through a sale rather than through continuing use. 
Management must be committed to the sale expected 
within one year from the date of classification.
	
Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and the fair value 
less costs to sell.
	
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded 
met only when the assets are available for immediate 
sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that 
are usual and customary for sales of such assets, its 
sale is highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold, 
not abandoned. Actions required to complete the sale 
should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will 
be withdrawn. The Company treats sale of the asset to 
be highly probable when:
	
•	
The appropriate level of management is committed 
to a plan to sell the asset,
	
•	
An active programme to locate a buyer and 
complete the plan has been initiated,
	
•	
The asset is being actively marketed for sale 
at a price that is reasonable in relation to its 
current fair value,
	
•	
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification, and
	
•	
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that 
it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan 
will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or 
amortized. All other notes to the financial statements 
mainly include amounts for continuing operations, 
unless otherwise mentioned.
2.14	Impairment of financial and non financial 
assets
1. 	
Financial assets
	
The impairment methodology applied depends on 
whether there has been a significant increase in credit 
risk and if so, assess the need to provide for the same in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition 
of 
impairment 
loss 
allowance 
on 
trade receivables.
	
The application of simplified approach does not require 
the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it 
recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime 
expected credit losses (ECL) at each reporting date, 
right from its initial recognition.
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Company determines 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has 
not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk 
has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in 
a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the 
entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance 
based on 12-month ECL.
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected life 
of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion 
tax paying units intend to settle the asset and liability 
on a net basis.
	
Deferred taxes
	
Deferred tax is recognized using liability method. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for 
deductible and taxable temporary differences arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amount, except when the deferred tax 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
	
Deferred tax asset are recognized to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences and the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.
	
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at 
each reporting date and are recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits 
will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered .
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to 
taxable income in the years in which the temporary 
differences are expected to be received or settled.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the relevant entity intends and has ability 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.11	Property, plant and equipment
	
Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated impairment loss, if any. Property, plant 
and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or 
construction where cost includes amount added/
deducted on revaluation less accumulated depreciation 
/ amortization and impairment losses, if any. All costs 
directly relating to the acquisition and installation 
of assets are capitalized and include borrowing 
costs relating to funds attributable to construction or 
acquisition of qualifying assets, up to the date the asset 
/ plant is ready for intended use. The cost of replacing 
a part of an item of property, plant and equipment 
is recognized in the carrying amount of the item of 
property, plant and equipment, if it is probable that 
the future economic benefits embodies within the part 
will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured 
reliably with the carrying amount of the replaced part 
getting derecognized. The cost for day-to-day servicing 
of property, plant and equipment are recognized in 
Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred.
	
Depreciation on Property, plant and equipment has 
been provided on a straight-line basis as per the useful 
life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013 except in respect of the following categories of 
assets, in whose case the life of the assets has been 
assessed as under based on technical advice, taking 
into account the nature of the asset, the estimated 
usage of the asset, the operating conditions of 
the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated 
technological changes, manufacturers warranties and 
maintenance support, etc.:
	
i) 	
Plant & equipment - 7.5 years/10 years
	
ii) 	 Vehicles – 5 years/7 years
	
iii) 	 Dies and moulds are depreciated over their 
estimated economic life determined on the basis of 
their usage or on straight line basis in the manner 
specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013, whichever is higher.
	
iv) 	 Renewable energy equipments - 22 Years
	
The residual values, useful life and methods of 
depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end 
and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. An item 
of property, plant and equipment and any significant 
part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal 
or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit 
and loss when the asset is derecognized.
2.12	Intangible Assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately:
	
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired 
separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful

2.16	Financial instruments
	
Financial assets
	
a)	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, 
as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income (OCI), 
and fair value through profit or loss.
	
	
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and the 
Company’s business model for managing them. 
With the exception of trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component or 
for which the Company has applied the practical 
expedient, the Company initially measures a 
financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of 
a financial asset not at fair value through profit or 
loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component or 
for which the Company has applied the practical 
expedient are measured at the transaction price 
determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the 
accounting policies in section (2.04) Revenue from 
contracts with customers.
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through 
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 
‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on 
the principal amount outstanding. This assessment 
is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed 
at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash 
flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured 
at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of 
the business model.
	
	
The Company’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages its financial 
assets in order to generate cash flows. The business 
model determines whether cash flows will result 
from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the 
financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified 
and measured at amortised cost are held within a 
business model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows 
while financial assets classified and measured at 
fair value through OCI are held within a business 
model with the objective of both holding to collect 
contractual cash flows and selling.
	
	
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established 
by regulation or convention in the marketplace 
(regular way trades) are recognised on the trade 
date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to 
purchase or sell the asset.
	
b)	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in four categories:
	
	
- 	
Financial 
assets 
at 
amortised 
cost 
(debt instruments)
	
	
- 	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive 
income 
(FVTOCI) 
with 
recycling of cumulative gains and losses 
(debt instruments)
	
	
- 	
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI with no recycling of cumulative 
gains 
and 
losses 
upon 
derecognition 
(equity instruments)
	
	
- 	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
	
(i)	 Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
	
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised 
cost if both the following conditions are met:
	
	
	
a)	
The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for 
collecting contractual cash flows, and
	
	
	
b)	
Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI) on the principal 
amount outstanding.
	
	
	
This category is the most relevant to the 
Company. After initial measurement, such 
financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by 
taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation 
is included in finance income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
of the lifetime ECL which results from default events that 
are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows 
that are due to the Company in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects 
to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at the 
original effective interest rate (EIR). When estimating 
the cash flows, an entity is required to consider all 
contractual terms of the financial instrument over the 
expected life of the financial instrument.
	
The Company estimates the following provision matrix 
at the reporting date:
Not 
due
Within 
365 days*
More than 
365 days*
Default Rate
0%
0%
100%
	
* Provision is made for receivables where recovery is 
considered doubtful irrespective of due date. Where 
an amount is outstanding for more than 365 days the 
Company usually provides for the same unless there is clear 
visibility of recovery.
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized 
during the period is recognized as income/ expense in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected 
under the head ‘other expenses’ in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. The balance sheet presentation for 
various financial instruments is described below:
	
Financial assets measured at amortized cost, revenue 
receivables and lease receivables: ECL is presented 
as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the 
measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. 
The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. 
Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company 
does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment 
loss, the Company combines financial instruments 
based on shared credit risk characteristics with the 
objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to 
enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified 
on a timely basis.
2. 	
Non-financial assets
	
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is any indication that the carrying amount of non 
financial asset may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing 
for an asset is required, the recoverable amount, (i.e. 
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-
use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless 
the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the cash 
generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized 
in the statement of profit or loss. The Company 
bases its impairment calculation on budgets and 
forecast calculations.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, an 
appropriate valuation model is used.
2.15	Inventories
	
Inventories 
of 
raw 
materials 
and 
components, 
work-in-progress, stock-in-trade, stores & spares, 
packing materials and loose tools & instruments are 
valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. 
Cost is ascertained on a weighted average basis. 
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for as follows:
	
a. 	 Raw materials, stores & spares and tools & 
instruments: cost includes cost of purchase and 
other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition.
	
b. 	 Finished goods and work in progress: cost 
includes cost of direct materials and labour and 
a proportion of manufacturing overheads based 
on the normal operating capacity, but excluding 
borrowing costs.
	
c. 	
Traded goods: cost includes cost of purchase and 
other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition.
	
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs

income, subsequent changes in the fair value. 
The Company makes such election on an instrument 
by instrument basis. The classification is done on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides 
to classify an equity instruments as at FVOCI then all fair 
value changes on the instrument excluding dividends 
are recognized in OCI. There is no recycling from OCI 
to profit or loss even on sale of instrument. However, the 
Company may transfer the cumulative gain/loss within 
equity. Equity instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. removed from the 
Company’s balance sheet) when:
	
a.	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
	
b.	
The Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the 
Company has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into 
a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, 
nor transferred control of the asset, the Company 
continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent 
of the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, 
the Company also recognizes an associated liability. 
The transferred asset and the associated liability 
are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Company has retained.
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at 
the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset 
and the maximum amount of consideration that the 
Company could be required to repay.
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by 
another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
Reclassification of financial assets and financial 
liabilities
	
The Company determines classification of financial 
assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial 
recognition, no reclassification is made for financial 
assets which are equity instruments and financial 
liabilities. For financial assets which are debt 
instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is 
a change in the business model for managing those 
assets. Changes to the business model are expected 
to be infrequent. The Company’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as a result 
of external or internal changes which are significant to 
the Company’s operations. Such changes are evident to 
external parties. A change in the business model occurs 
when a company either begins or ceases to perform 
an activity that is significant to its operations. If the 
Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the 
reclassification prospectively from the reclassification 
date which is the first day of the immediately next 
reporting period following the change in business 
model. The Company does not restate any previously 
recognized gains, losses (including impairment gains 
and losses) or interest.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognized amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
2.17	Earnings Per Share (EPS)
	
The Company reports basic and diluted earnings 
per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 - Earnings 
per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by 
dividing the net profit or loss after tax for the period 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per 
share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss for 
recognised in the profit or loss. The Company’s 
financial assets at amortised cost includes 
trade receivables, and loan to an associate 
and loan to a director included under 
other non-current financial assets. For more 
information on receivables, refer to Note 8.
	
	
(ii)	 Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
(FVTOCI) (debt instruments)
	
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI 
if both of the following criteria are met:
	
	
	
a)	
The objective of the business model 
is 
achieved 
both 
by 
collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling the 
financial assets, and
	
	
	
b)	
The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
	
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI 
category are measured initially as well as at 
each reporting date at fair value. For debt 
instruments, at fair value through OCI, interest 
income, 
foreign 
exchange 
revaluation 
and impairment losses or reversals are 
recognised in the profit or loss and computed 
in the same manner as for financial assets 
measured at amortised cost. The remaining 
fair value changes are recognised in OCI. 
Upon derecognition, the cumulative fair value 
changes recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to profit or loss.
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI (equity instruments)
	
	
	
Upon initial recognition, the Company 
can elect to classify irrevocably its equity 
investments as equity instruments designated 
at fair value through OCI when they meet the 
definition of equity under Ind AS 32 Financial 
Instruments: Presentation and are not held 
for trading. The classification is determined 
on 
an 
instrument-by-instrument 
basis. 
Equity instruments which are held for trading 
and contingent consideration recognised by 
an acquirer in a business combination to which 
Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the statement 
of profit and loss when the right of payment 
has been established, except when the 
Company benefits from such proceeds as a 
recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded 
in OCI. Equity instruments designated at 
fair value through OCI are not subject to 
impairment assessment.
	
	
(iv)	 Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss are carried in the balance sheet at 
fair value with net changes in fair value 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
This category includes derivative instruments 
and equity investments which the Company 
had not irrevocably elected to classify at 
fair value through OCI. Dividends on equity 
investments are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss when the right of payment has 
been established.
	
Investment in subsidiaries
	
Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost as per 
Ind AS 27 - Separate Financial Statements.
	
Financial liabilities
	
Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss, loans and borrowings, payables or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized 
initially at fair value and in case of loans and borrowings 
and payables, net of directly attributable transaction 
costs. The Company’s financial liabilities include 
trade and other payables, loans and borrowings, and 
derivative financial instruments. Trade, other payables 
and derivative financial instruments are measured 
subsequently at FVTPL. Loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortized costs using EIR 
method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
	
Equity instruments
	
All equity instruments in scope of Ind AS 109, other 
than investments in subsidiaries, are measured at fair 
value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are 
classified as at fair value through profit and loss. For all 
other equity instruments the Company may make an 
irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive

The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes 
into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant 
that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair value, maximizing 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing 
the use of unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
	
- 	
Level 1 – Quoted (Unadjusted) Market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
- 	
Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
- 	
Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
Other disclosures
	
1)	
There are no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 
of the fair value hierarchy during the period.
	
2)	
The valuation techniques used above are consistent 
with all periods presented.
	
Valuation Techniques used to determine fair value.
	
1)	
Investments in Mutual Funds/ equity shares - are 
valued at net asset value declared by Association 
of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) at the reporting 
date/ share market price.
	
2)	
Derivatives (recurring fair value measurement) - 
at values determined by counter parties / banks 
using market observable data.
2.22	Cash and cash equivalents
	
The Company considers all highly liquid financial 
instruments, which are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk 
of change in value and having original maturities of 
three months or less, to be cash equivalents. Cash and 
cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which 
are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
2.23	Share Capital
	
Ordinary Shares
	
Ordinary 
shares 
are 
classified 
as 
equity. 
Incremental costs, if any, directly attributable to the 
issue of ordinary shares are recognized as a deduction 
from equity, net of any tax effects.
2.24	Dividend
	
Dividend on share is recorded as liability on the date of 
approval by the shareholders. A corresponding amount 
is recognized directly in equity.
2.25	Segment reporting
	
Information reported to the chief operating decision 
maker (CODM) for the purposes of resource allocation 
and assessment of segment performance focuses on 
the types of goods or services delivered or provided. 
The Company is in the business of manufacture and 
sale automobile components, which in the context of 
Indian Accounting Standard 108 ‘Segment Information’ 
represents 
single 
reportable 
business 
segment. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments 
are the same as the accounting policies disclosed in 
Note 2. The revenues, total expenses and net profit 
as per the Statement of profit and loss represent the 
revenue, total expenses and the net profit of the sole 
reportable segment.
2.26	Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
A provision is recognized when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, in 
respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. 
The expense relating to a provision is presented in the 
statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a 
finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each balance 
the period by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period as adjusted for 
the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares except 
where the results are anti-dilutive.
2.18	Research and development expenses
	
Research 
costs 
are 
expensed 
as 
incurred. 
Development expenditures on an individual project are 
recognised as an intangible asset when the Company 
can demonstrate:
	
- 	
The technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that the asset will be available 
for use or sale
	
- 	
Its intention to complete and its ability and intention 
to use or sell the asset
	
- 	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits
	
- 	
The availability of resources to complete the asset
	
- 	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development
	
Following initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins 
when development is complete, and the asset is 
available for use. It is amortised over the period 
of expected future benefit. Amortisation expense is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset. During the period of development, the 
asset is tested for impairment annually.
2.19	Cash flow statement
	
The Cash flow statement is prepared by the indirect 
method set out in Ind AS 7 - Cash Flow Statements 
and presents cash flows by operating, investing and 
financing activities of the Company.
2.20	Current versus Non-Current Classification
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in 
the balance sheet based on current/non-current 
classification. An asset is classified as current when it is
	
- 	
expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
	
- 	
held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
- 	
expected to be realized within 12 months after the 
date of reporting period, or
	
- 	
Cash and cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least 12 months after the reporting period.
	
Current assets include the current portion of non-current 
financial assets.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
A liability is current when it is
	
- 	
expected to be settled in its normal operating cycle
	
- 	
held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
- 	
due to be settled within 12 months after the 
reporting period, or
	
- 	
does not have any unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the reporting period.
	
Current liabilities include the current portion of long 
term financial liabilities. The Company classifies all 
other liabilities as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets and their realization in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Company has identified 12 months as 
its operating cycle.
2.21	Fair Value Measurement
	
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received from 
the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell an 
asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
	
- 	
In the principal market for the asset or liability
	
- 	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.

estimates. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in 
the financial statements.
	
Product warranty expenses:
	
The estimated liability for product warranties is accounted 
when products are sold. These estimates are established 
using historical information on the nature, frequency 
and average cost of warranty claims and management 
estimates regarding possible future incidence based on 
corrective actions on product failures.
	
The initial estimate of warranty related cost is revised at 
each balance sheet date.
2.27	Other income
	
Dividends
	
Dividend income from investments is recognized when 
the right to receive payment has been established 
(provided that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Company and the amount of income can 
be measured reliably).
	
Interest income
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognized 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow 
to the Company and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at 
the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to that

The management assessed that the fair values of short term financial assets and liabilities significantly approximate their 
carrying amounts largely due to the short - term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and 
liabilities is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction among willing parties, other 
than in a forced or liquidation sale.
	
The Company determines fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities by discounting the contractual cash inflows/
outflows using prevailing interest rates of financials instruments with similar terms. The initial measurement of financial assets 
and financial liabilities is at fair value. The fair value of investment is determined using quoted net assets value from the 
fund/share market prices. Further, the subsequent measurement of all financial assets and liabilities (other than investment 
in mutual funds, equity shares and foreign currency derivatives) is at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
	
Discount rates used in determining fair value
	
The interest rate used to discount estimated future cash flows, where applicable, are based on the incremental borrowing 
rate of the borrower which in case of financial liabilities is the weighted average cost of borrowing of the Company and 
in case of financial assets is the average market rate of similar credit rated instrument.
	
The Company maintains policies and procedures to value financial assets or financial liabilities using the best and most 
relevant data available. In addition, the Company internally reviews valuation, including independent price validation for 
certain instruments.
	
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly 
observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value:
	
(a) 	 Fair value of short term financial assets and liabilities significantly approximate their carrying amounts largely due to 
the short term maturities of these instruments.
	
(b) 	 Fair value of quoted mutual funds is based on the net assets value at the reporting date. The fair value of other 
financial liabilities as well as other non current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flow using 
rate currently applicable for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
	
(c) 	 The fair value of the Company’s interest bearing borrowing received are determined using discount rate that reflects 
the entity’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non performance risk as at the end of 
reporting period was assessed to be insignificant.
	
Fair value hierarchy
	
All financial instruments for which fair value is recognized or disclosed are categorized within the fair value hierarchy 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) price is active market for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2: Valuation technique for which the lowest level input that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement are 
observed , either directly or indirectly
	
Level 3: Valuation technique for which the lowest level input has a significant effect on the fair value measurement is not 
based on observable market data
	
The following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on recurring basis at 31st March, 2023 and 
31st March, 2022.

I. 	
Capital Management
	
The Company’s capital management objectives are:
	
The Board policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and 
to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital employed on a 
quarterly basis.
	
The Company manages capital risk by maintaining sound/optimal capital structure through monitoring of financial ratios, 
such as debt-to-equity ratio and net borrowings-to-equity ratio on a quarterly basis and implements capital structure 
improvement plan when necessary.
	
The Company uses net debt to equity ratio as a capital management index and calculates the ratio as net debt divided by 
total equity. Net debt and total equity are based on the amounts stated in the financial statements.

II. 	 Financial Risk Management Framework
	
The Company is exposed primarily to market risk (fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate), 
credit risk, liquidity risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Company assesses the 
unpredictability of the financial environment and seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance 
of the Company.
i)	
Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to contractual 
terms. Credit risk encompasses, the risk of default, the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness of the counterparty as well 
as concentration of risks.
	
Financial instruments that are subject to exposure to credit risk consist of trade receivables, investments and other 
financial assets.
	
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from operating activities, primarily from trade receivables.
	
Trade receivables
	
Trade receivables consist of receivables arising primarily due to sale of goods. These receivables are unsecured and 
mature at the end of a specified credit period depending upon the terms of contract of each customer, which ranges from 
30-60 days for customers in India and 30-120 days for overseas customers. The Company’s customers primarily consist of 
Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) for its primary products and Dealers for spare parts.
	
The Company assesses the credit risk of its customers and dealers at the time of acceptance of the customer as well as on 
an ongoing basis. Before accepting any new customer, the Company uses an external/internal credit scoring system to 
assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. The credit limit of these customers and 
dealers is continuously monitored and recalibrated based on the credit risk assessment. Most of the OEM’s have high credit 
ratings which helps the Company mitigate credit risk.
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether a trade receivable or a group of trade receivables is impaired. 
The Company recognizes lifetime expected credit losses for all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing 
transaction and which are due for more than six months. The expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal 
to 12 month expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the 
financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. The Company uses a practical expedient by computing 
the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix.

Company’s exposure to customers is diversified and some customers contribute more than 10% of outstanding accounts 
receivable which forms 60% of total receivables as of 31st March, 2023 (70% as at Previous year), however there was 
no default on account of those customers in the past.
The Company considers the trade receivables to have low risk of defaults since the customers have strong capacity to fulfil 
their obligations and even if there are adverse changes in economic and business conditions, the Company is of the view 
that it will not adversely affect the ability of the customers to fulfil their obligations.
The Company considers write-off of receivables on case to case basis, depending upon the circumstances of each delayed 
receivable, and when the Company is of the view that recovery seems unlikely after reasonable efforts.

Investments and other financial assets
Investments consist mainly of investments in equity of subsidiaries and other companies, investments in mutual funds and 
fixed deposits. Other financial assets consist of Government incentive receivables, export incentive receivables and security 
deposits for business purposes.
Investments in mutual funds are primarily those instruments which have been approved by the Board and are in low-risk 
category and are continuously monitored by the investment committee of the Board. The Company considers credit risk in 
investments as well as in other financial assets to be very low.
ii) 	 Liquidity Risk
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be in a position to meet its financial liabilities. The objective of liquidity 
risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and to ensure availability of adequate funds for business. The Company

iii) 	 Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk like 
commodity prices risk.
1) 	 Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Company’s debt obligations which have floating rate indebtedness. The Company also maintain deposits of cash and cash 
equivalents with banks which are subject to periodic resets.
	
Interest rate sensitivity

2) 	 Foreign Currency exchange rate risk
	
Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates. At a standalone level the Company is exposed to currency risk of changes 
in EURO, USD, CHF, CNY, GBP, SGD and JPY. However, the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the statement 
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is not material. The Company has an exposure to changes in foreign 
exchange (primarily EURO) on account of its investments in its subsidiaries.
	
Wherever, transactions are undertaken in foreign currency, the Company hedges the risk of foreign exchange fluctuation 
by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies. The investment in subsidiaries being 
long term in nature is unhedged. The information on derivative instruments and the unhedged foreign currency exposures 
are as follows:
(a)	 Derivative financial instruments
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts and fixed currency swaps, 
to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as 
financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss. The foreign 
exchange forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges and are entered into for periods consistent with 
foreign currency exposure of the underlying transactions, generally from 1 to 48 months.

To
the Members of
Endurance Technologies Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Endurance Technologies Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred 
to as “the Group”) comprising of the consolidated Balance 
sheet as at March 31, 2023, the consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income, the 
consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, 
and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based on 
the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate 
financial statements and on the other financial information 
of the subsidiaries, the aforesaid consolidated financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies 
Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated 
state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2023, their 
consolidated profit including other comprehensive income, 
their consolidated cash flows and the consolidated statement 
of changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each 
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the 
matter is provided in that context.
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements section of our report, including in relation to these 
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements. The results of audit procedures performed by 
us and by other auditors of components not audited by 
us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished 
to us by the management, including those procedures 
performed to address the matters below, provide the basis 
for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements.

Other Information
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Corporate Governance report 
(but does not include the consolidated financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon) which we obtained prior 
to the date of this auditor’s report, and the Board’s Report, 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), 
Management Discussion and Analysis and Corporate 
Overview, which is expected to be made available to us 
after that date.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above and, in doing so, consider whether such other 
information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based 
on the work we have performed on the other information 
that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
When we read the Board’s Report, Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR), Management Discussion 
and Analysis and Corporate Overview, if we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and 
consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as 
amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their 
respective company(ies) and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of 
their respective companies to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of their respective companies.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•

of the consolidated financial statements, whether due

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for acquisition of Maxwell Energy Systems Private Limited (as described in Note 26c of the consolidated 
financial statements)
During the year, Endurance Technologies Limited (‘ETL’) entered 
into the Share Subscription and Purchase Agreement dated 
May 18, 2022 (“SSPA”) and the Shareholders’ Agreement 
dated May 18, 2022 (‘SHA’) to acquire 100% equity stake 
in Maxwell Energy Systems Private Limited (“Maxwell”) in six 
different tranches.
On July 1, 2022 the Company acquired 51% stake in the equity 
share capital of Maxwell through a combination of primary 
issuance and secondary purchase and paid a consideration 
of ` 1,350 million. As a result, Maxwell became a subsidiary 
of the Company with effect from July 1, 2022. Further, the 
remaining stake will be acquired in five tranches over a period 
of five years for a consideration which is linked to achievement 
of certain performance parameters.
Accounting for business combinations is complex and requires 
involvement of the Group’s senior management in identification, 
valuation and recognition of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed and also involves determining Goodwill.
The accounting for the above business combination including 
the valuation criteria and judgements and estimates made have 
a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023 and for future years. 
Accordingly, the same is determined to be a key audit matter in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit procedures included the following:
•	 We read the SSPA and the SHA to obtain an understanding of 
the transaction and the key terms and conditions and assessed 
the accounting treatment by the management in line with the 
requirements of Ind AS 103 ‘Business Combinations’.
•	 Obtained and read the report of Group’s external specialist and 
also assessed the objectivity and independence of the specialist 
involved in the process.
•	 We involved valuation specialist to assess the appropriateness of 
the methodology and assumptions applied by the management 
to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
•	 We reviewed the computation for liability towards acquisition of 
remaining stake and discussed the reasonableness of cash flows 
considered and the probability of achieving the performance 
parameters under the SSPA by Maxwell.
•	 We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models/computations.
•	 We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements.
Impairment testing of Goodwill pertaining to acquisition of Maxwell (as described in Note 25(a) of the consolidated 
financial statements)
The Group’s balance sheet includes ` 1,617.06 million of 
goodwill pertaining to Maxwell.
The Group tested the above goodwill for impairment as at 
year end using discounted cash flow model wherein the CGU’s 
recoverable amount was compared to the carrying value of the 
CGU’s net assets (including such goodwill).
The impairment testing model includes sensitivity testing of 
key assumptions, including operating margins, discount rate, 
terminal growth, etc.
The impairment testing for goodwill involved significant 
judgements and estimates because the assumptions on which 
the tests are based are highly judgmental and are affected by 
future market and economic conditions which are inherently 
uncertain in the case of Maxwell. Accordingly, the same 
is determined to be a key audit matter in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements.
Our audit procedures included the following:
•	 We obtained understating of the Group’s process on assessment 
of impairment of goodwill and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the relevant controls over impairment assessment.
•	 We evaluated the Group’s valuation methodology applied in 
determining the recoverable amount. We also assessed the 
objectivity and independence of Group’s external specialist 
involved in the process.
•	 We involved valuation specialist, where necessary, to assist in 
assessing the appropriateness of the valuation model including 
the independent assessment of the underlying key assumptions 
relating to operating margins, discount rate and terminal growth.
•	 We compared the cash flow forecasts used in impairment testing 
to approved budgets.
•	 We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
•	 We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements.

subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) 
of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the 
aforesaid subsidiaries is based solely on the reports of 
such other auditors.
	
These subsidiaries are located outside India whose 
financial statements and other financial information 
have been prepared in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in their respective 
countries and which have been audited by other 
auditors under generally accepted auditing standards 
applicable in their respective countries. The Holding 
Company’s management has converted the financial 
statements of such subsidiaries located outside India 
from accounting principles generally accepted in their 
respective countries to accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. We have audited these conversion 
adjustments 
made 
by 
the 
Holding 
Company’s 
management. Our opinion in so far as it relates to the 
balances and affairs of such subsidiaries located outside 
India is based on the report of other auditors and the 
conversion adjustments prepared by the management 
of the Holding Company and audited by us.
	
Our opinion above on the consolidated financial 
statements, and our report on Other Legal and 
Regulatory Requirements below, is not modified in 
respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance 
on the work done and the reports of the other auditors.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements
1.	
As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 
2020 (“the Order”), issued by the Central Government 
of India in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 
of the Act, based on our audit, there are no matters 
which require reporting as specified in paragraph 3 
(xxi) of the Order.
2. 	 As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on 
our audit and on the consideration of report of the 
other auditors on separate financial statements and the 
other financial information of subsidiaries, as noted in 
the ‘other matter’ paragraph we report, to the extent 
applicable, that:
	
(a)	 We/the other auditors whose report we have 
relied upon have sought and obtained all the 
information and explanations which to the best of 
our knowledge and belief were necessary for the 
purposes of our audit of the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements;
	
(b)	 In our opinion, proper books of account as 
required by law relating to preparation of the 
aforesaid consolidation of the financial statements 
have been kept so far as it appears from our 
examination of those books and reports of the 
other auditors;
	
(c)	
The Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss including the Statement 
of Other Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement and Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity dealt with by this Report are 
in agreement with the books of account maintained 
for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements;
	
(d)	 In our opinion, the aforesaid consolidated financial 
statements comply with the Accounting Standards 
specified under Section 133 of the Act, read with 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015, as amended;
	
(e)	 On the basis of the written representations received 
from the directors of the Holding Company as on 
March 31, 2023 taken on record by the Board of 
Directors of the Holding Company and the report 
of the statutory auditors who are appointed under 
Section 139 of the Act of its subsidiary, none of the 
directors of the Group’s companies incorporated 
in India, is disqualified as on March 31, 2023 
from being appointed as a director in terms of 
Section 164 (2) of the Act;
	
(f)	
With respect to the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary company incorporated in India, 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls, 
refer to our separate Report in “Annexure 1” 
to this report;
	
(g)	 In our opinion, the managerial remuneration for 
the year ended March 31, 2023 has been paid 
/ provided by the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary incorporated in India where applicable 
to their directors in accordance with the provisions 
of section 197 read with Schedule V to the Act;
Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.)
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Holding Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group of which we are the 
independent auditors and whose financial information 
we have audited, to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
audit of the financial statements of such entities included 
in the consolidated financial statements of which we are 
the independent auditors. For the other entities included 
in the consolidated financial statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audits carried out by them. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of

Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Endurance Technologies Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”) as of and for the 
year ended March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred to 
as “the Group”) which is a company incorporated in India, 
as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group, which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Holding Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the 
Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
With Reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls With Reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
Annexure 1 (Contd.)
To the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Endurance 
Technologies Limted
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Group has maintained in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements and such internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements were operating effectively as at March 31,2023, 
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Holding Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
issued by the ICAI.

and domiciled in India. The address of its registered 
office is E-92, M.I.D.C. Industrial Area, Waluj, 
Aurangabad – 431136 (Maharashtra), India.”
	
The financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 
2023 were approved for issue in accordance with the 
resolution of the Board of Directors on 17th May, 2023.

Significant Accounting Policies
2.01	Statement of Compliance
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have 
been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) notified under the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
(as amended from time to time) and the presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS Compliant Schedule III), 
as applicable to the consolidated financial statements.
2.02	Basis of preparation and presentation
	
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain 
financial instruments which are measured at fair values 
at the end of each reporting period, as explained in 
the accounting policy 2.26. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in INR and all values are 
rounded off to the nearest million (INR 000,000), 
except as stated otherwise.
	
The Group has prepared the consolidated financial 
statements on the basis that it will continue to operate 
as a going concern.
2.03	Basis of consolidation
	
The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
as at 31 March 2023. Control is achieved when the 
Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only 
if the Group has:
	
•	
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give 
it the current ability to direct the relevant activities 
of the investee)
	
•	
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
	
•	
The ability to use its power over the investee to 
affect its returns
	
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting 
rights result in control. To support this presumption and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting 
or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it 
has power over an investee, including:
	
•	
The contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee
	
•	
Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
	
•	
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
	
•	
The size of the group’s holding of voting rights 
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings 
of the other voting rights holders
	
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements of 
control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when 
the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. 
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary.
	
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and 
other events in similar circumstances. If a member of 
the Group uses accounting policies other than those 
adopted in the consolidated financial statements for 
like transactions and events in similar circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that Group 
member’s financial statements in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity 
with the Group’s accounting policies.
	
The financial statements of all entities used for the 
purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same 
reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e., year 
ended on 31 March. When the end of the reporting 
period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, 
the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes,

additional financial information as of the same date 
as the financial statements of the parent to enable the 
parent to consolidate the financial information of the 
subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
	
Consolidation procedure:
	
a. 	 Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with 
those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income 
and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the 
amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised 
in the consolidated financial statements at the 
acquisition date.
	
b. 	 Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the 
parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. 
Business combinations policy explains how to 
account for any related goodwill.
	
c. 	 Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating 
to transactions between entities of the group (profits 
or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that 
are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed 
assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may 
indicate an impairment that requires recognition in 
the consolidated financial statements. Ind AS 12 
Income Taxes applies to temporary differences 
that arise from the elimination of profits and losses 
resulting from intragroup transactions.
	
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having 
a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments 
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries 
to bring their accounting policies into line with the 
Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows 
relating to transactions between members of the Group 
are eliminated in full on consolidation.
	
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, 
without a loss of control, is accounted for as an 
equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a 
subsidiary, it:
	
•	
Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and 
liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts 
at the date when control is lost
	
•	
Derecognises 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
any 
non-controlling interests
	
•	
Derecognises the cumulative translation differences 
recorded in equity
	
•	
Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
	
•	
Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
	
•	
Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
	
•	
Recognise that distribution of shares of subsidiary 
to Group in Group’s capacity as owners
	
•	
Reclassifies the parent’s share of components 
previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss 
or transferred directly to retained earnings, if 
required by other Ind ASs as would be required 
if the Group had directly disposed of the related 
assets or liabilities

2.04	Business combinations and goodwill
	
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree. For each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in 
the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of 
the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred.
	
The Group determines that it has acquired a business 
when the acquired set of activities and assets include 
an input and a substantive process that together 
significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. 
The acquired process is considered substantive if it is 
critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and 
the inputs acquired include an organised workforce 
with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to 
perform that process or it significantly contributes to the 
ability to continue producing outputs and is considered 
unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without 
significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue 
producing outputs.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they are measured 
at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact 
that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
is not probable. However, the following assets and 
liabilities acquired in a business combination are 
measured at the basis indicated below:
	
•	
Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the liabilities 
or assets related to employee benefit arrangements 
are recognised and measured in accordance with 
Ind AS 12 Income Tax and Ind AS 19 Employee 
Benefits respectively.
	
•	
Potential tax effects of temporary differences and 
carry forwards of an acquiree that exist at the 
acquisition date or arise as a result of the acquisition 
are accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12.
	
•	
Liabilities or equity instruments related to share 
based payment arrangements of the acquiree 
or share – based payments arrangements of the 
Group entered into to replace share-based payment 
arrangements of the acquiree are measured 
in accordance with Ind AS 102 Share-based 
Payments at the acquisition date.
	
•	
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 Non-current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
are measured in accordance with that Standard.
	
•	
Reacquired rights are measured at a value 
determined on the basis of the remaining contractual 
term of the related contract. Such valuation does not 
consider potential renewal of the reacquired right.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts 
by the acquiree.
	
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in profit or loss or OCI, as appropriate.
	
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset 
or liability that is a financial instrument and within the 
scope of Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, is measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in 
profit or loss in accordance with Ind AS 109. If the 
contingent consideration is not within the scope of 
Ind AS 109, it is measured in accordance with the 
appropriate Ind AS and shall be recognised in profit or 
loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity 
is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and 
subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity.
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and 
the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, 
and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value 
of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses 
whether it has correctly identified all of the assets 
acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews 
the procedures used to measure the amounts to be 
recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment 
still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets 
acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, 
then the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in 
equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear 
evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises

the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without 
routing the same through OCI.
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective 
of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are 
assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata 
based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit 
or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in subsequent periods.
	
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating 
unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation 
when determining the gain or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured 
based on the relative values of the disposed operation 
and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
	
If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional 
amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
through goodwill during the measurement period, 
or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to 
reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if 
known, would have affected the amounts recognized at 
that date. These adjustments are called as measurement 
period adjustments. The measurement period does not 
exceed one year from the acquisition date.
2.05	Use of estimates and assumptions
	
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, 
and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure 
of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these 
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that 
require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of 
assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
	
a. 	 Judgements
	
	
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies, management has made the following 
judgements, which have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements:
	
	
Business combination:
	
	
In accounting for business combinations, judgement 
is required in identifying whether an identifiable 
intangible asset is to be recorded separately from 
goodwill. Additionally, estimating the acquisition 
date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired 
(including useful life estimates), liabilities assumed, 
and contingent consideration assumed involves 
management judgment. These measurements are 
based on information available at the acquisition 
date and are based on expectations and 
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable 
by management. Changes in these judgments, 
estimates, and assumptions can materially affect 
the results of operations. Refer para 26(c).
	
b. 	 Estimates
	
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are described below. The Group based its 
assumptions and estimates on parameters available 
when the consolidated financial statements were 
prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions 
about future developments, however, may change 
due to market changes or circumstances arising that 
are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes 
are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
	
	
Impairment of Goodwill:
	
	
The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered 
any impairment at least on an annual basis 
irrespective of whether there is any indication of 
impairment. The recoverable amount of a cash 
generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill balance 
is allocated is determined based on value‑in‑use 
calculations which require the use of assumptions. 
The calculations use cash flow projections based 
on financial budgets approved by management 
covering a period from 5 to 7 years and considering 
current economic conditions. Cash flows beyond 
that period are extrapolated using the estimated 
growth, 
consistent 
with 
industry 
forecasts. 
The growth rates are consistent with forecasts 
included in industry reports specific to the industry 
in which each CGU operates. The key assumptions 
used to determine the recoverable amounts for 
the CGUs which have Goodwill amounts which 
are significant in comparison to the total carrying 
amount of goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, 
are disclosed and further explained in note 25.
	
	
Defined benefit plan:
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and 
other post-employment benefits and the present 
value of the gratuity obligation are determined 
using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation 
involves making various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount 
rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. 
Due to the complexities involved in the valuation 
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these 
assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each 
reporting date.
	
	
The parameter most subject to change is the discount 
rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate 
for plans operated in India, the management 
considers the interest rates of government bonds 
where remaining maturity of such bond correspond 
to expected term of defined benefit obligation. 
For plans operated outside India, the management 
considers the interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of 
the post-employment benefit obligation with at least 
an ‘AA’ rating or above, as set by an internationally 
acknowledged rating agency, and extrapolated as 
needed along the yield curve to correspond with 
the expected term of the defined benefit obligation. 
The underlying bonds are further reviewed for 
quality. Those having excessive credit spreads are 
excluded from the analysis of bonds on which the 
discount rate is based, on the basis that they do not 
represent high quality corporate bonds.
	
	
The mortality rate is based on publicly available 
mortality 
tables 
for 
the 
specific 
countries. 
Those mortality tables tend to change only at 
interval in response to demographic changes. 
Future salary increases and gratuity increases are 
based on expected future inflation rates for the 
respective countries. Further details about gratuity 
obligations are given in Note 30.
	
	
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
	
	
The Group reviews the useful life of property, 
plant and equipment at the end of each reporting 
period. This reassessment may result in change in 
depreciation expense in future periods.
2.06	Revenue from contract with customer
	
Revenue is recognised when control of goods and 
services have been transferred to the customer; at an 
amount that reflects the consideration which the Group 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or 
services. The timing of when the Group transfers the 
goods or provide services may differ from the timing of 
the customer’s payment. Amounts disclosed as revenue 
are net of goods and service tax (GST).
	
The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal 
in its revenue arrangements, because it typically 
controls the goods or services before transferring them 
to the customer.
	
The disclosures of significant accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from 
contracts with customers are provided below.
	
Sale of Goods
	
The Group based on the underlying agreements has 
determined that the transfer of control to the customer 
and therefore revenue recognition, in regard to the 
domestic sales and export sales, generally corresponds 
to the date when the goods are dispatched from their 
point of sale, or when the goods are made available 
to the customer, or when the goods are released to the 
carrier responsible for transporting them to the customer.
	
Export sales are recorded at the relevant exchange 
rates prevailing on the transaction date.
	
Generally, the normal credit period is 30 to 60 days 
upon delivery for customers in India and 30 to 120 
days for overseas customers. The nature of contracts of 
the Group are such that no material part performance 
obligations would remain unfulfilled at the end of any 
accounting period.
	
Variable consideration
	
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable 
amount (like volume rebates/incentives, discounts etc.), 
the Group estimates the amount of consideration to 
which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring

the goods to the customer. The variable consideration 
is estimated at contract inception and constrained until 
it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal 
in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not 
occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable 
consideration is subsequently resolved. The estimate 
of variable consideration for expected future volume 
rebates/incentives, cash discounts etc. are made on the 
most likely amount method. Revenue is disclosed net 
of such amounts.
	
Warranty obligations
	
The Group provides warranties for general repairs of 
defects as per terms of the contract with customers. 
These warranties are considered as assurance type 
warranties and are accounted for under Ind AS 37- 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
	
Revenue from job work
	
The Group provides job work services to its customers. 
Such services are sold separately and are not bundled 
together with the sale of goods. Revenue from job work 
is accounted as and when such services are rendered.
	
Revenue from sale of services
	
The 
Group 
provides 
product 
development 
and 
engineering 
sevices 
to 
its 
customers. 
Revenue from such services is accounted as and when 
such services are rendered.
	
Revenue from sale of licences
	
Revenue from sale of licences is recognised based on the 
terms of the contract with customer. Revenue from one 
time licence fees is recognised over the period of licence.
	
Contract balances
	
Trade receivables
	
A receivable represents the Group’s right to an 
amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., 
only the passage of time is required before payment 
of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policy 
no. 2.18 Financial instruments – Financial assets at 
amortised cost.
	
Contract liabilities
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods 
to a customer for which the Group has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Group transfers goods or services to the 
customer, a contract liability is recognised when the 
payment is received. Contract liabilities are recognised 
as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.
	
Refund liabilities
	
A refund liability is the obligation to refund some or 
all the consideration received (or receivable) from the 
customer and is measured at the amount the Group 
ultimately expects it will have to return to the customer. 
The Group updates its estimates of refund liabilities 
(and the corresponding change in the transaction price) 
at the end of each reporting period.
2.07	Leases
	
The determination of whether an arrangement is 
(or contains) a lease is based on the substance 
of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. 
The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of 
the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific 
asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to 
use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly 
specified in an arrangement.
	
Group as a lessee
	
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
	
Right-of-use assets
	
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets 
are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, 
initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made 
at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term 
and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at 
the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of 
a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets 
are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting 
policy 2.16 (ii) for Impairment of non-financial assets.
	
Lease Liabilities
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed payments less 
any lease incentives receivable.
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit 
in the lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced 
for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying 
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in 
the lease payments or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset.
	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and 
equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 
12 months or less from the commencement date and 
do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the 
lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to 
leases of office equipment that are considered to be 
low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.08	Foreign Currency and derivatives
	
The Group is exposed to certain risks relating to its 
ongoing business operations. The primary risks managed 
using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk, 
commodity price risk, and interest rate risk.
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the 
balance sheet date and exchange gains and losses 
arising on settlement or translation are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the 
gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair value gain 
or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also 
recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
	
For the purpose of presenting these consolidated 
financial statements, the assets and liabilities of Group’s 
foreign operations are translated to Indian Rupees at 
exchange rate at the end of each reporting period.
	
Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency 
other than presentation currency have been translated 
to the presentation currency using exchange rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of 
profit and loss have been translated using average 
exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been 
reported as foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) 
in the statement of changes in equity. When a foreign 
operation is disposed off, the relevant amount in the 
FCTR is reclassified to statement of profit and loss.
	
The functional currency and presentation currency 
of the Company and Indian subsidiary is the Indian 
Rupee whereas the functional currency of foreign 
subsidiaries is the Euro.
	
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial 
recognition of the related asset, expense or income 
(or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance 
consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on 
which the Group initially recognises the non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance 
consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts 
in advance, the Group determines the transaction date 
for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.
	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as 
foreign currency forward contracts and fixed currency 
swaps, to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when 
the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when 
the fair value is negative.
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or 
loss. The foreign exchange forward contracts are not 
designated as cash flow hedges and are entered into 
for periods consistent with foreign currency exposure of 
the underlying transactions.
2.09	Borrowing Costs
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which 
are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are 
capitalised as part of the cost of assets, until such

time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use or sale.
	
Interest income earned on the temporary investment 
of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on 
qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalisation.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit 
or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to 
the borrowing costs.
2.10	Government grants and export incentives
	
(i)	 Government grants
	
	
Government grants are recognised at their fair 
value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 
grant will be received and all attached conditions 
will be complied with. Government grants relating 
to income are deferred and recognised in the profit 
or loss over the periods necessary to match them 
with the costs that they are intended to compensate 
and presented within other operating revenues.
	
(ii) 	 Export benefits
	
	
Export benefits are accrued in the year of exports 
based on eligibility and when there is no uncertainty 
in receiving the same.
	
	
Export benefits in the nature of Remission of Duties 
and Taxes on Export Product (RODTEP) scheme and 
Duty Drawback are recognized on accrual basis in 
the year of export.
	
(iii) 	Government Grant in respect of Loan
	
	
The benefit of a government loan at a below-market 
rate of interest is treated as a government grant, 
measured as the difference between proceeds 
received and the fair value of the loan based on 
prevailing market interest rates.
2.11	Employee benefits
	
1. 	 Defined Contribution Plan:
	
	
Provident Fund: The eligible employees of the 
Company are entitled to receive benefits under 
the provident fund, a defined contribution plan, 
in which both employees and the Company make 
monthly contributions at a specified percentage of 
the covered employee’s salary. The contributions 
as specified under the law are paid to the Central 
Government Provident Fund and the Family Pension 
Fund and the same is charged to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss of the year when the 
contributions to the respective funds are due and 
when services are rendered by the employees.
	
2.	 Defined Benefit Plan:
	
	
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of 
providing benefits is determined using the projected 
unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at the end of each annual reporting 
period. Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial 
gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset 
ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets 
(excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the 
balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reflected immediately in 
retained earnings and will not be reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service 
cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of 
a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by 
applying the discount rate at the beginning of the 
period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
	
	
•	
service cost (including current service cost, 
past service cost, as well as gains and losses 
on curtailments and settlements);
	
	
•	
net interest expense or income; and
	
	
•	
remeasurement.
	
	
(i)	
Gratuity: The Company has an obligation 
towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement 
plan covering eligible employees. The plan 
provides for a lump sum payment to vested 
employees at retirement, death while in 
employment or on termination of employment 
of an amount equivalent to 15/26 days salary 
payable for each completed year of service. 
Vesting occurs upon completion of five years 
of service. For the employees of specified 
grades, 30 days salary is payable for each 
completed year of service, upon completion 
of 10 years of service. The Company accounts 
for the liability for gratuity benefits payable 
in future based on an independent actuarial 
valuation. The Company has taken a Group 
Gratuity cum Life Assurance Scheme with LIC 
of India for future payment of gratuity to the 
eligible employees.
	
	
(ii)	 Employees severance indemnity: Foreign 
subsidiaries 
give 
their 
employees 
post 
employment benefits. Such benefits fall 
within the defined benefit plans, of certain 
existence and amount, but with uncertain 
manifestation. The liability is determined as 
current value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the balance sheet date, in accordance with 
current regulations, adjusted to take account 
of actuarial gains / losses. The amount of 
the defined benefit obligation has been 
calculated by an external actuary according 
to the “Projected Unit Credit method”.
	
3.	 Compensated Absences:
	
	
The Company provides for the encashment of 
compensated absences with pay subject to certain 
rules. The employees are entitled to accumulate 
compensated absences subject to certain limits, for 
future encashment. Such benefits are provided based 
on the number of days of unutilised compensated 
absence on the basis of an independent actuarial 
valuation using the projected unit credit method 
at the reporting date. Actuarial gains/losses are 
immediately taken to profit or loss and are not 
deferred. The Company has taken a policy with 
LIC of India for future payment of compensated 
absences encashment to its employees.
2.12	Taxes
	
Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and 
the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during 
the year. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in 
profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity, in which case, the current tax and deferred 
tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, respectively. Income tax expense 
represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
	
Current income tax:
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
tax authorities.
	
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount 
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date in the countries where the Group 
operates and generates taxable income.
	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income or in equity). 
Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and considers whether it is probable that the taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment.
	
The Group shall reflect the effect of uncertainty for 
each uncertain tax treatment by using either most likely 
method or expected value method depending on which 
method predicts better resolution of the treatment.
	
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes 
are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting 
advance tax paid and income tax provision arising 
in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant 
tax paying units intends to settle the asset and liability 
on a net basis.
	
Deferred taxes:
	
Deferred tax is recognised using liability method. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
deductible and taxable temporary differences arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amount, except when the deferred tax 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences and the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences except in respect of taxable 
temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary difference can be controlled and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
substantively enacted tax rates in the countries where 
the group operates expected to apply to taxable 
income in the years in which the temporary differences 
are expected to be received or settled.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the relevant entity intends and has ability 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
	
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at 
each reporting date and are recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits 
will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
2.13	Property, plant and equipment
	
Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated impairment loss, if any. Property, plant 
and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or 
construction where cost includes amount added/
deducted on revaluation less accumulated depreciation 
/ amortization and impairment losses, if any. All costs 
directly relating to the acquisition and installation 
of assets are capitalized and include borrowing 
costs relating to funds attributable to construction or 
acquisition of qualifying assets, up to the date the asset 
/ plant is ready for intended use. The cost of replacing 
a part of an item of property, plant and equipment 
is recognized in the carrying amount of the item of 
property, plant and equipment, if it is probable that 
the future economic benefits embodies within the part 
will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured 
reliably with the carrying amount of the replaced part 
getting derecognized. The cost for day-to-day servicing 
of property, plant and equipment are recognized in 
Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred.
	
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is 
provided at the rates determined on a straight line basis 
over the useful life estimated by the Management or 
on the basis of depreciation rates prescribed under 
respective domestic laws, whichever is higher.
	
The useful lives and method of depreciation of the 
Property, plant & equipment are reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognised is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement 
of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.
2.14	Intangible Assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately:
	
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired 
separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortization is recognised on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life 
and amortization method are reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
i)	
Technical knowhow is amortised over a period of 
five to ten years;
	
ii)	 Software is amortised over a period of three years.
	
iii)	 Patents, Trade Marks and Brands are amortised 
over a period of five to ten years.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are 
acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Internally generated intangible 
assets, excluding capitalized development cost, are not 
capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected in 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which the 
expenditure is incurred.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., 
at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss. 
when the asset is derecognised.
2.15	Non-current assets held for sale
	
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale 
if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally 
through a sale rather than through continuing use. 
Management must be committed to the sale expected 
within one year from the date of classification.
	
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded 
met only when the assets are available for immediate 
sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that 
are usual and customary for sales of such assets, its 
sale is highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold, 
not abandoned. Actions required to complete the sale 
should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will 
be withdrawn. The Group treats sale of the asset to be 
highly probable when:
	
•	
The appropriate level of management is committed 
to a plan to sell the asset,
	
•	
An active programme to locate a buyer and 
complete the plan has been initiated,
	
•	
The asset is being actively marketed for sale 
at a price that is reasonable in relation to its 
current fair value,
	
•	
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification, and
	
•	
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that 
it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will 
be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
	
Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and the fair value 
less costs to sell.
	
Property, 
plant 
and 
equipment 
and 
intangible 
assets once classified as held for sale are not 
depreciated or amortised.
	
Additional disclosures are provided in Note 3.
2.16	Impairment of financial and non financial 
assets
	
(i)	 Financial assets
	
	
The impairment methodology applied depends on 
whether there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk and if so, assess the need to provide for 
the same in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on 
trade receivables.
	
	
The application of simplified approach does not 
require the Group to track changes in credit risk. 
Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) at 
each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Group determines 
whether there has been a significant increase in 
the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk 
has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is 
used to provide for impairment loss. However, if 
credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL 
is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of 
the instrument improves such that there is no longer 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising 
impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected 
life of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a 
portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default 
events that are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date.
	
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash 
flows that are due to the Group in accordance 
with the contract and all the cash flows that the 
entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), 
discounted at the original effective interest rate 
(EIR). When estimating the cash flows, an entity 
is required to consider all contractual terms of the 
financial instrument over the expected life of the 
financial instrument.
	
	
The Group estimates the following provision matrix 
at the reporting date:
Not 
due
Within 
365 days*
More than 
365 days*
Default Rate
0%
0%
100%
	
	
* Provision is made for receivables where recovery is 
considered doubtful irrespective of due date. Where 
an amount is outstanding for more than 365 days the 
Group usually provides for the same unless there is 
clear visibility of recovery.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized as 
income/ expense in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. This amount is reflected under the head 
‘other expenses’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The balance sheet presentation for various financial 
instruments is described below:
	
	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost, 
revenue receivables and lease receivables: ECL is 
presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part 
of the measurement of those assets in the balance 
sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the 
Group does not reduce impairment allowance from 
the gross carrying amount.
	
	
For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment 
loss, the Group combines financial instruments 
based on shared credit risk characteristics with the

objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed 
to enable significant increases in credit risk to be 
identified on a timely basis.
	
(ii) 	 Non-financial assets
	
	
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is any indication that the carrying amount of 
non financial asset may not be recoverable. If any 
such indication exists, or when annual impairment 
testing for an asset is required, the recoverable 
amount, (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell 
and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual 
asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount 
is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
	
	
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. 
The Group bases its impairment calculation on 
budgets and forecast calculations.
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, an appropriate 
valuation model is used.
	
(iii) 	Goodwill
	
	
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated 
are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is indication for impairment. 
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its 
carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the CGU unit and then to the other 
assets of the CGU unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the CGU unit.
2.17	Inventories
	
Inventories of raw materials and components, work-in-
progress, stock-in-trade, stores & spares, packing 
materials and loose tools & instruments are valued 
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is 
ascertained on a weighted average basis.
	
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for as follows:
a.	
Raw materials, stores & spares and tools & instruments: 
cost includes cost of purchase and other costs 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition.
b.	
Finished goods and work in progress: cost includes 
cost of direct materials, labour and a proportion 
of manufacturing overheads based on the normal 
operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
c.	
Traded goods: cost includes cost of purchase and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.
2.18	Financial Instruments
(i) 	
Financial assets
	
a)	 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, 
as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income (OCI), 
and fair value through profit or loss.
	
	
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s 
business model for managing them. With the 
exception of trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component or for which the 
Group has applied the practical expedient, the 
Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair 
value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at 
fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. 
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component or for which the Group has 
applied the practical expedient are measured at 
the transaction price determined under Ind AS 
115. Refer to the accounting policies in section 
(2.06) Revenue from contracts with customers.
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through 
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 
‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on 
the principal amount outstanding. This assessment 
is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at 
an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows 
that are not SPPI are classified and measured at 
fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the 
business model.
	
	
The Group’s business model for managing financial 
assets refers to how it manages its financial assets 
in order to generate cash flows. The business 
model determines whether cash flows will result 
from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the 
financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified 
and measured at amortised cost are held within a 
business model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows 
while financial assets classified and measured at 
fair value through OCI are held within a business 
model with the objective of both holding to collect 
contractual cash flows and selling.
	
	
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established 
by regulation or convention in the marketplace 
(regular way trades) are recognised on the trade 
date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to 
purchase or sell the asset.
	
b)	 Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in four categories:
	
	
•	
Financial 
assets 
at 
amortised 
cost 
(debt instruments)
	
	
•	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive 
income 
(FVTOCI) 
with 
recycling of cumulative gains and losses 
(debt instruments)
	
	
•	
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI with no recycling of cumulative 
gains 
and 
losses 
upon 
derecognition 
(equity instruments)
	
	
•	
Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
(i)	
Financial 
assets 
at 
amortised 
cost 
(debt instruments)
	
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised 
cost if both the following conditions are met:
	
	
	
a)	
The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for 
collecting contractual cash flows, and
	
	
	
b)	
Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI) on the principal 
amount outstanding.
	
	
	
This category is the most relevant to the 
Group. After initial measurement, such 
financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by 
taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation 
is included in finance income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the profit or loss. The Group’s 
financial assets at amortised cost includes 
trade receivables, and loan to an associate 
and loan to a director included under 
other non-current financial assets. For more 
information on receivables, refer to Note 8.
	
	
(ii)	 Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
(FVTOCI) (debt instruments)
	
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI 
if both of the following criteria are met:
	
	
	
a)	
The objective of the business model 
is 
achieved 
both 
by 
collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling the 
financial assets, and
	
	
	
b)	
The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
	
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI 
category are measured initially as well as at 
each reporting date at fair value. For debt 
instruments, at fair value through OCI, interest 
income, 
foreign 
exchange 
revaluation 
and impairment losses or reversals are 
recognised in the profit or loss and computed 
in the same manner as for financial assets 
measured at amortised cost. The remaining 
fair value changes are recognised in OCI. 
Upon derecognition, the cumulative fair value 
changes recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to profit or loss.
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI (equity instruments)
	
	
	
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect 
to classify irrevocably its equity investments 
as equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI when they meet the definition 
of equity under Ind AS 32 Financial 
Instruments: Presentation and are not held

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements
for trading. The classification is determined 
on 
an 
instrument-by-instrument 
basis. 
Equity instruments which are held for trading 
and contingent consideration recognised by 
an acquirer in a business combination to which 
Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the statement 
of profit and loss when the right of payment 
has been established, except when the 
Group benefits from such proceeds as a 
recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded 
in OCI. Equity instruments designated at 
fair value through OCI are not subject to 
impairment assessment.
	
	
(iv)	 Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss are carried in the balance sheet at 
fair value with net changes in fair value 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
This category includes derivative instruments 
and equity investments which the Group 
had not irrevocably elected to classify at 
fair value through OCI. Dividends on equity 
investments are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss when the right of payment has 
been established.
	
Financial liabilities
	
Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss, loans and borrowings, payables or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective 
hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at fair value and in case of loans and 
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include 
trade and other payables, loans and borrowings, and 
derivative financial instruments. Trade, other payables 
and derivative financial instruments are measured 
subsequently at FVTPL. Loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised costs using EIR 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
	
Equity instruments
	
All equity instruments in scope of Ind AS 109, other 
than investments in subsidiaries, are measured at 
fair value. Equity instruments which are held for 
trading are classified as at fair value through profit 
and loss. For all other equity instruments the Group 
may make an irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive income, subsequent changes in the fair 
value. The Group makes such election on an instrument 
by instrument basis. The classification is done on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable. If the Group decides to 
classify an equity instruments as at FVOCI then all fair 
value changes on the instrument excluding dividends 
are recognised in OCI. There is no recycling from OCI 
to profit or loss even on sale of instrument. However, the 
Group may transfer the cumulative gain/loss within 
equity. Equity instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
Group’s balance sheet) when:
	
a.	 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
	
b.	 The Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the 
Group has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of 
the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises 
an associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects 
the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and 
the maximum amount of consideration that the Group 
could be required to repay.
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by 
another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
Reclassification of financial assets and financial 
liabilities
	
The Group determines classification of financial 
assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial 
recognition, no reclassification is made for financial 
assets which are equity instruments and financial 
liabilities. For financial assets which are debt 
instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is 
a change in the business model for managing those 
assets. Changes to the business model are expected 
to be infrequent. The Group’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as a result 
of external or internal changes which are significant to 
the Group’s operations. Such changes are evident to 
external parties. A change in the business model occurs 
when a company either begins or ceases to perform an 
activity that is significant to its operations. If the Group 
reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification 
prospectively from the reclassification date which is 
the first day of the immediately next reporting period 
following the change in business model. The Group 
does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses 
(including impairment gains and losses) or interest.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if 
there is currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
	
Hedge accounting
	
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge variability 
in its cash flows from interest payments arising from 
floating rate liabilities i.e., when interests are paid 
according to benchmark market interest rates.
	
The Group also uses commodity swaps to hedge 
variability in its cash flows from changes in commodity 
prices, primarily electricity and fuel. Changes in the 
price of these commodities could have a significant 
effect on the Group’s results by affecting costs and 
thereby, product margins.
	
Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as 
financial assets when the fair value is positive and 
as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified 
as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining 
maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve months; 
it is classified as a current asset or liability when the 
remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than or 
equal to twelve months.
	
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group 
formally designates and documents the economic 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged item, including whether changes in the cash 
flows of the hedging instrument are expected to offset 
changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Group 
documents its risk management objective and how the 
Group will assess whether the hedging relationship 
meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including 
the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and 
how the hedge ratio is determined). Hedges that meet 
the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted 
for as cash flow hedges.
	
Changes in the fair value (net of tax) of the derivative 
contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of 
future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge 
reserve within Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and 
any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
Amounts so recognised in OCI are later reclassified to 
profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss 
or are treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast 
transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a 
non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Amounts accumulated in Other Equity through OCI are 
reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions 
affect profit or loss.
	
For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in Other Equity is 
retained there until the forecast transaction occurs. If the 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Other Equity 
is immediately reclassified to profit or loss for the year 
as a reclassification adjustment.
2.19	Earning per share (EPS)
	
Basic and diluted earnings per share is reported in 
accordance with Ind AS 33 - Earnings per Share. 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing 
the net profit or loss attributable to equity holders 
after deducting attributable taxes for the period 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per 
share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss for 
the period by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period as adjusted for 
the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares except 
where the results are anti-dilutive.
2.20	Research and development expenses
	
Research 
costs 
are 
expensed 
as 
incurred. 
Development expenditures on an individual project 
are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group 
can demonstrate:
	
•	
The 
technical 
feasibility 
of 
completing 
the 
intangible asset so that the asset will be available 
for use or sale
	
•	
Its intention to complete and its ability and intention 
to use or sell the asset
	
•	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits
	
•	
The availability of resources to complete the asset
	
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development
	
Following initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins 
when development is complete, and the asset is 
available for use. It is amortised over the period 
of expected future benefit. Amortisation expense is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset. During the period of development, the 
asset is tested for impairment annually.
2.21	Segment reporting
	
Information reported to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (CODM) for the purposes of resource allocation 
and assessment of segment performance focuses on 
the types of goods or services delivered or provided. 
The Group is in the business of manufacture and sale 
of automobile components, which in the context of 
Indian Accounting Standard 108 ‘Segment Information’ 
represents 
single 
reportable 
business 
segment. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments 
are the same as the accounting policies disclosed in 
Note 2. The revenues, total expenses and net profit 
as per the Statement of profit and loss represents the 
revenue, total expenses and the net profit of the sole 
reportable segment.
2.22	Cash flow statement
	
The Cash Flow Statement is prepared by the indirect 
method set out in Ind AS 7 - Cash Flow Statements 
and presents cash flows by operating, investing and 
financing activities of the Group.
2.23	Current versus Non-Current Classification
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance 
sheet based on current/ non-current classification. 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
	
•	
expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
	
•	
held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
•	
expected to be realized within 12 months after the 
date of reporting period, or
	
•	
Cash and cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least 12 months after reporting period.
	
Current assets include the current portion of non-current 
financial assets.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
A liability is current when it is:
	
•	
expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
	
•	
held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
•	
due to be settled within 12 months after the 
reporting period, or
	
•	
does not have any unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after 
the reporting period.
	
Current liabilities include the current portion of long 
term financial liabilities. The Group classifies all other 
liabilities as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets and their realization in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identified 12 months as its 
operating cycle.
2.24	Cash and cash equivalents
	
The Group considers all highly liquid financial 
instruments, which are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk 
of change in value and having original maturities of 
three months or less, to be cash equivalents. Cash and 
cash equivalents include balances with banks which are 
unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
2.25	Share Capital
	
Ordinary Shares
	
Ordinary 
shares 
are 
classified 
as 
equity. 
Incremental costs, if any, directly attributable to the 
issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction 
from equity, net of any tax effects.
2.26	Fair Value Measurement
	
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received from 
the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell an 
asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
	
•	
In the principal market for the asset or liability
	
•	
In the absence of principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.
	
The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes 
into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant 
that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
	
•	
Level 1 – Quoted (Unadjusted) Market prices in 
active markets for incidental assets or liabilities
	
•	
Level 2 –Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
•	
Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers that have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
Other disclosures
	
1)	 There are no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 
of the fair value hierarchy during the period.
	
2)	 The valuation techniques used above are consistent 
with all periods presented.
	
Valuation Techniques used to determine fair value
	
1)	 Investments in Mutual Funds - are valued at net asset 
value declared by Association of Mutual Funds in 
India (AMFI) at the reporting date.

market observable data.
	
3)	 Investments in bonds and other funds - are valued 
at value declared by Asset management company 
at the reporting date.
2.27	Dividend
	
Dividend on share is recorded as liability on the date of 
approval by the shareholders. A corresponding amount 
is recognized directly in equity.
2.28	Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a 
reliable estimate can be made. The expense relating to a 
provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss 
net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value 
of money is material, provisions are discounted using 
a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognised as a finance cost. Provisions are 
reviewed at each balance sheet date adjusted to reflect 
the current best estimates. Contingent liabilities are not 
recognised in the financial statements.
	
Product warranty expenses
	
The estimated liability for product warranties is 
accounted when products are sold. These estimates 
are established using historical information on the 
nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
and management estimates regarding possible future 
incidence based on corrective actions on product failures.
The initial estimate of warranty related cost is revised at 
each balance sheet date.
2.29	Other income
	
Dividend
	
Dividend income from investments is recognised when 
the right to receive payment has been established 
(provided that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Company and the amount of income can 
be measured reliably).
	
Interest income
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow 
to the Company and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at 
the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
Others
	
The Company recognizes income on accrual basis. 
However, where the ultimate collection of the same lacks 
reasonable certainty, income recognition is postponed 
to the extent income is reasonably certain and can be 
reliably measured.
2.30 	Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
	
New and amended standards
	
Several amendments and interpretations apply for the first 
time in March 2023, but do not have a material impact 
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) have notified 
certain amendements to the existing standards and 
certain interpretations are applicable for the first 
time from 1st April, 2023. These amendements/
interpretations will not have any material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group.

The management assessed that the fair values of short term financial assets and liabilities significantly approximate their 
carrying amounts largely due to the short - term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and 
liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing 
parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
	
The Group determines fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities by discounting the contractual cash inflows/
outflows using prevailing interest rates of financials instruments with similar terms. The initial measurement of financial assets 
and financial liabilities is at fair value. The fair value of investment is determined using quoted net assets value from the 
fund/share market prices. Further, the subsequent measurement of all financial assets and liabilities (other than investment 
in mutual funds, equity shares and foreign currency derivatives) is at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
	
Discount rates used in determining fair value
	
The interest rate used to discount estimated future cash flows, where applicable, are based on the incremental borrowing 
rate of the borrower which in case of financial liabilities is the weighted average cost of borrowing of the Group and in 
case of financial assets is the average market rate of similar credit rated instrument.
	
The Group maintains policies and procedures to value financial assets or financial liabilities using the best and most 
relevant data available. In addition, the Group internally reviews valuation, including independent price validation for 
certain instruments.
	
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly 
observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value:
	
(a) 	 Fair value of short term financial assets and liabilities significantly approximate their carrying amounts largely due to 
the short term maturities of these instruments.
	
(b) 	 Fair value of quoted mutual funds is based on the net assets value at the reporting date. The fair value of other 
financial liabilities as well as other non current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flow using 
rate currently applicable for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
	
(c) 	 The fair value of the Group’s interest bearing borrowing received are determined using discount rate that reflects the 
entity’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non performance risk as at the reporting was 
assessed to be insignificant.
	
Fair Value Hierarchy
	
All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) price is active market for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2: Valuation technique for which the lowest level input that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement are 
observed, either directly or indirectly
	
Level 3: Valuation technique for which the lowest level input has a significant effect on the fair value measurement is not 
based on observable market data
	
The following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on recurring basis at

32	 Financial Instruments and Risk Review
I) 	
Capital Management
	
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
	
The Board policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and 
to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital employed on a 
quarterly basis.
	
The Group manages capital risk by maintaining sound/optimal capital structure through monitoring of financial ratios, such 
as debt-to-equity ratio and net borrowings-to-equity ratio on a quarterly basis and implements capital structure improvement 
plan when necessary.
	
The Group uses debt ratio as a capital management index and calculates the ratio as net debt divided by total equity. 
Net debt and total equity are based on the amounts stated in the consolidated financial statements.
	
Debt-to-equity ratio is as follows:
` in million

 (0.12)
	
* Net debt includes non current borrowings, current borrowings, current maturities of non current borrowings and right-of-use lease 
obligation net off current investments and cash and cash equivalents.
II) 	 Financial Risk Management Framework
	
The Group is exposed primarily to market risk (fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate), credit risk, 
liquidity risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group assesses the unpredictability 
of the financial environment and seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.
i) 	
Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to contractual 
terms. Credit risk encompasses, the risk of default, the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness of the counterparty as well 
as concentration of risks.
	
Financial instruments that are subject to exposure to credit risk consist of trade receivables, investments and other 
financial assets.
	
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from operating activities, primarily from trade receivables.
	
Trade receivables
	
Trade receivables consist of receivables arising primarily due to sale of goods. These receivables are unsecured and are 
payable at the end of a specified credit period depending upon the terms of contract of each customer, which ranges from 
30-60 days for customers in India and 30-120 days for overseas customers. The Group’s customers primarily consist of 
Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) for its primary products and Dealers for spare parts.
	
The Group assesses the credit risk of its customers and dealers at the time of acceptance of the customer as well as on an 
ongoing basis. Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external/internal credit scoring system to assess 
the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. The credit limit of these customers and dealers 
is continuously monitored and recalibrated based on the credit risk assessment. Most of the OEM’s have high credit ratings 
which helps the Group mitigate credit risk.
	
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a trade receivable or a group of trade receivables is impaired. 
The Group recognises lifetime expected credit losses for all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction 
and which are due for more than six months. The expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to 12 months 
expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset 
has increased significantly since initial recognition. The Group uses a practical expedient by computing the expected credit 
loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix.

The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and some customers contribute more than 10% of outstanding accounts 
receivable which forms 44% of total receivables as of 31st March, 2023 (59% as at previous year), however there was 
no default on account of those customers in the past.
	
The Group considers the trade receivables to have low risk of defaults since the customers have strong capacity to fulfil 
their obligations and even if there are adverse changes in economic and business conditions, the Group is of the view that 
it will not adversely affect the ability of the customers to fulfil their obligations.
	
The Group considers write-off of receivables on case to case basis, depending upon the circumstances of each delayed 
receivable, and when the Group is of the view that recovery seems unlikely after reasonable efforts.

Investments and other financial assets
Investments consist mainly of investments in mutual funds, insurance premium and short term funds. Other financial assets 
consist of Government incentives receivable, export incentives and security deposits for business purposes.
Investments in mutual funds are primarily those instruments which have been approved by the Board and are in low-risk 
category and are continuously monitored by the investment committee of the Board. The Group considers credit risk in 
investments as well as in other financial assets to be very low.
ii) 	 Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be in a position to meet its financial liabilities. The objective of liquidity 
risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and to ensure availability of adequate funds for business. The Group 
generates sufficient internal accruals and generally the purpose of borrowings is to meet temporary fund flow mismatches

iii) 	 Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk like 
commodity prices risk.
1) 	 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
debt obligations which have floating rate indebtedness. The Group also maintain deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
with banks and other financial institutions which are subject to periodic resets.
	
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates on the debt 
obligations of the Group and on the cash and cash equivalents.

2) 	 Foreign Currency exchange rate risk
	
Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to currency risk of changes in EUR, USD, CHF, CNY, 
GBP, SGD and JPY. However, the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income is not material.
	
Wherever, transactions are undertaken in foreign currency, the Group hedges the risk of foreign exchange fluctuation 
by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies. The information on foreign currency 
derivatives are given in sub note 4. The information on unhedged foreign currency exposures are as follows:

3) 	 Commodity Price Risk
	
The Group is exposed to risks in fluctuation of prices of certain raw materials, which are used as key inputs in the 
production process, especially ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Historically, as a practice, and as per our understanding 
with customers, the Group has passed on an increase in the cost of metals, especially aluminium and steel to its customers 
and does not foresee a significant risk to its statement of profit and loss on account of fluctuations in the prices of materials.
	
The Group is further exposed to risks in fluctuation of certain costs of production. It hedges a part of these risks by using 
commodities swap instruments in line with its risk management policies. Refer sub note 4 below.
4) 	 Derivative financial instruments:
	
The Group has entered into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage its 
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price risk. The counterparty is generally a 
bank. These financial exposures are managed in accordance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures. 
The information on derivative instruments is as follows:
