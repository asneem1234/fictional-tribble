against the specific 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
As the director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I'm proud to share our progress on addressing ESG (Environmental, 
Social, Governance) issues. This year, we completed our inaugural BRSR, an important step that involved conducting a materiality assessment, 
identifying key stakeholders, and calculating our GHG emissions, water, and energy footprint. 
Addressing challenges such as privacy and data security, corporate governance, business ethics, and compliance, we've made significant 
strides. Our opportunities lie in areas, like supply chain management, community development, sustainable packaging, and customer 
satisfaction, and we're making consistent efforts in these directions. 
To reduce our environmental impact, we've set tangible targets. We've partnered with the Edge Group to install solar panels with Smart 
switches across our offices and retail outlets, significantly contributing to our renewable energy usage. We're also actively working towards 
reducing water consumption and single-use plastics. This is demonstrated by our initiative to install Reverse Osmosis systems in outlets to 
decrease reliance on bottled water. 
Furthermore, we're committed to offsetting our carbon footprint by developing a green belt initiative, which will not only beautify our 
surroundings but also mitigate GHG emissions. 
Our achievements in this journey are noteworthy. We've established an ESG committee to oversee and strategise our sustainability initiatives. 
We've successfully installed solar power plants at several outlets, reinforcing. 
In conclusion, these accomplishments are stepping stones in our commitment to ESG targets, but we understand the road ahead is long and 
we remain dedicated to making a positive impact.

We have an Occupational Health and Safety Management System in place at all our company-owned offices and retail outlets. 
To maintain the effectiveness of this system, we have an internal audit team that conducts regular assessments. These assessments, 
performed throughout the year, focus on fire safety and evaluating the working conditions at all our locations. This continuous evaluation 
helps us maintain a safe and healthy environment across all our premises. 
We are committed to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. We carry out a systematic approach that encompasses routine 
and non-routine assessments to identify potential hazards and assess associated risks. Our safety team conducts regular safety inspections 
throughout our workspaces, which include warehouses, administrative offices, and retail outlets. These inspections aim to proactively 
identify any potential hazards that could lead to work-related injuries or illnesses. One of the essential components of our risk management 
strategy is our proactive fire safety measures. We regularly conduct fire drills at our stores to ensure our employees are well-trained and 
prepared in case of fire emergencies. Our stores also undergo periodic inspections by the local fire department to ensure compliance with 
all fire safety regulations. 
All identified hazards, potential risks, and subsequent mitigation strategies are duly reported to our Risk Management Committee. This 
allows for consistent oversight and effective decision-making on risk mitigation strategies.

Indeed, we are actively engaged in a project to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A key part of our initiative involves 
substituting traditional, energy-intensive lighting systems with more efficient LED lights. This transition has successfully curbed our 
energy usage, which in turn has decreased our carbon footprint by lessening emissions. Our commitment to energy conservation is a 
testament to our concerted efforts to mitigate our environmental impact and lower GHG emissions. 
To further curb our reliance on non-renewable energy, we've installed solar panels with a capacity of 18 KW at our outlets. This has 
not only reduced the fuel consumption of our diesel generators, but also reinforced our commitment to renewable energy. Additionally, 
we have implemented smart meters to gain a comprehensive understanding of our electricity consumption, thereby enabling more 
effective energy management. 
We've also forged a partnership with the Edge group, with the goal of increasing our use of renewable energy even more by fitting 
additional solar panels at our outlets. This is another significant stride in our ongoing efforts to embrace green energy and reduce our 
overall environmental impact.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
At our establishment, we have implemented effective waste management practices. We ensure that the waste generated at our offices 
and shops is appropriately segregated and collected. This process enables us to separate different types of waste such as recyclables, 
organic waste, and non-recyclables. Once segregated, the waste is then sent to certified vendors and municipal authorities, who are 
responsible for disposing of it in an environmentally friendly manner. By adhering to these waste management procedures, we actively 
contribute to reducing the environmental impact associated with waste disposal and promote responsible waste management practices.
