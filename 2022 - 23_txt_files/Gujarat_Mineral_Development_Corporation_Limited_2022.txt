Dear Stakeholders,
We are glad to publish our ﬁrst BRSR report for FY 2022-23, which represents our performance on sustainability. We are committed to 
integrate Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) factors in our ways of working which is central to improving the quality of life of the 
communities we serve. GMDC acknowledge the signiﬁcant challenges presented by the ever-changing global landscape. We are 
acutely aware of the environmental issues, social inequalities, and governance concerns that surround us. Climate change, resource 
depletion and ethical governance are complex issues that demand our immediate attention and collective eﬀorts. At GMDC, we 
recognise that addressing these challenges is not only our ethical duty but also crucial for long-term sustainability and resilience. We 
have embraced these challenges as opportunities to drive positive change, strengthen stakeholder trust, and create shared value. Up-
holding strong corporate governance practices is a fundamental pillar of our business. Our aim is to maintain the highest standards of 
governance and accountability throughout our organisation. We have strengthened our corporate governance framework by 
appointing independent directors and establishing board committees to oversee key aspects of risk management, compliance, and 
ethics. Our commitment to transparency is evident in our regular reporting and disclosure practices, which have received recognition 
from industry peers.

Committee of State Legislature.
Internally, we also maintain a dedicated audit department that conducts regular pre audit checks. These 
audits serve as an independent and objective assessment of our processes, ensuring compliance with 
internal policies and procedures. They also help identify areas of improvement and strengthen our 
internal controls.

Leadership Indicators
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or 
if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
 
In our organisation, we recognise the importance of stakeholder engagement and consultation on economic, environmental, and 
social topics. Firstly, we actively engage with stakeholders through various channels such as surveys, focus groups, public 
meetings, and one-on-one interactions. These engagements allow us to gather diverse perspectives, concerns, and suggestions 
from stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, and advocacy groups. In cases where 
consultation is delegated to speciﬁc departments or individuals, a structured framework is in place to capture feedback from these 
consultations. This includes periodic reporting mechanisms that summarise the outcomes, key insights, and recommendations 
from stakeholder consultations. The summarised information is then shared with the management, ensuring that they are informed 
about the perspectives and concerns raised by stakeholders. By fostering meaningful consultation and feedback mechanisms, we 
aim to ensure that stakeholder perspectives are considered in our decision-making processes. This approach enables us to 
address economic, environmental, and social topics more eﬀectively, promoting transparency, accountability, and sustainable 
practices throughout our operations.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental, and social topics 
(Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated 
into policies and activities of the entity.

Clearance from the Government. At this platform, the areas surrounding respective mining or other projects are provided an

and Collector of the District where the Project is located. The concerns raised by the stakeholders are noted and appropriate 
actions are taken by the company to comply with the concerns and a detailed report is submitted with the competent regulatory 
authority on regular intervals.
• Long-Term Projects like "Project Samarthya Skill Development Program" is formulated and is under development in order to 
comply with the need of required skill sets for employment in Rural Sector.

generated from the power plants is also being utilised in backﬁlling of mined out areas.
 
Hazardous waste disposal–
(1) Waste oil/Used oil: Used oil is disposed of through registered/authorised recyclers/ MSTC  
(2) Bio-medical Waste: Disposed of through authorised agencies 
(3) E-waste: Centrally collected for disposal to authorised vendors
(4) Battery Waste Disposal:  Used batteries are disposed of through buyback mechanism
