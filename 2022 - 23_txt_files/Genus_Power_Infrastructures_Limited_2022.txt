Statement by director responsible for 
the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
The vision and objective of Genus Power Infrastructures Limited is to “Enable Utility Providers to 
efficiently serve the society with world class Metering Products, Solutions and Services”.  The values 
of Genus Power revolve around Trust & Respect, Integrity, Customer Focus, Inclusive Growth and 
Innovation that is reflected in our products. The similar focused values are reflected into the company’s 
ESG and sustainability practices. With sustainability factoring to be a crucial aspect for every person 
and every nation, we look ahead to expand more in our scope towards ESG, starting from our products, 
operations and to all our stakeholders
The ESG aspects are an integral part of the company’s core principles. The world today is witnessing 
a shift towards digitization and smart devices, with added focus on optimization and sustainability. 
Aligning with the shifts and changes, where our products are generally categorized as “smart”, we 
also strive to embed “sustainable” aspects into our products. Initiatives towards optimal resource 
utilization in our operations and digitalization of our manufacturing processes are some of the key 
focus areas with respect to environment parameters. We also focus on social value creation through 
engagement with our employees by providing a better working environment and providing equal 
opportunities to all irrespective of caste, gender, etc. Our CSR (Corporate Social Responsibilities) 
activities governed by the idea of “Serving Society through Industry” are committed towards people and 
society at large for bringing positive changes to the lives of mankind. The Company’s initiatives were 
focused on providing education and employment enhancing vocational skills especially for economic 
empowerment of women, farmers, rural and tribal youth. Our robust governance looks into the aspects 
beyond compliance so that we strive to achieve better performance and explore new avenues in the 
markets we serve. In the smart meter industry cybersecurity is a major concern and our monitoring of 
cybersecurity risks and threats is backed by our robust governance.
As a sector serving the smart meter industry where the technology domain today witnesses rapid 
changes and overwhelming obsolescence primarily due to better optimization and better cyber 
protection, we explore new innovations and technologies, keeping the ESG aspects in conjunction with 
our products. We strive to produce a positive environmental and social impact through our values of 
Trust & Respect, Integrity, Customer Focus, Inclusive Growth and Innovation towards evolving smart 
industry and ESG media, thereby realizing our goal of “Making Smart Cities & Smart Grids possible”
