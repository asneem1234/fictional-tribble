In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications
of the risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or
negative implications)
Employee Health, 
Safety and Well 
being
Risk
Employees are the assets of the Company, 
failure to ensure the Company’s workforce’s 
health, safety, and well-being can have an 
impact on reputation and productivity of 
an organisation which may consequently 
affect the business operations and customer 
satisfaction.
Hazards and Risks are periodically identified basis which 
mitigation plans are made and adapted. we strive to create 
a healthy safe working environment and ensure zero harm. 
Safety trainings/ tool box talks for on ground workers are 
being provided for their holistic well being.
Negative
Waste 
Management and 
circular economy
Risk
The environment and human health are 
being impacted by the global problem 
of waste management. Not abiding to 
the practices prescribed by the central 
authorities may lead to legal penalties and 
impact on the brand image.
The Company has well defined processes for managing 
waste. We are using recyclable material like copper cables 
and once metal is declared as scrap business follows 
regulations to dispose the wastes generated through 
registered recyclers.
Negative
Information 
Protection
Risk
The Company relies on its technology 
infrastructure for its data and information 
protection. Today every information is filed 
online and majority of the transaction being 
also made online which ultimately increases 
the risk information security risk.
Organisation have a strong cyber risk management system 
which is closely monitored by the information technology 
team of the Company. The Company has intensified its 
efforts by educating employees, customers, and other 
stakeholders about cybercrime, data privacy, and other 
issues.
Negative
Human Rights
Risk
Failure to address human rights issues 
can result in diminished brand value and 
reputation, as well as a growing danger of 
legal action and non-compliance with the 
area’s developing body of regulations.
Our organisation adheres to laws and is complied 
with regulations. HR department of our organisation is 
responsible to ensure that any issue related to human 
rights comes up are addressed in the defined manner 
within the stipulated timeline.
Negative
Governance and 
Accountability
Risk
This material issue has a direct impact on 
an organisation since weak organisational 
governance may result in a loss of customer 
confidence and trust. A company with 
good governance and accountability has 
structures in place to create long-term, 
sustainable business operations.
We have robust governance structure in place with defined 
roles and responsibilities. We are proactively working on 
enhancing our governance structure. 
Negative
Customer 
relationship 
management
Opportunity
Being service provider company CRM 
plays an important role. It helps us to better 
understand our customers and improve 
customer satisfaction and retention rate. 
We have a complaint management system (Call centers 
and complaint centers) for customers with less turnaround 
time that enables us to manage positive customer 
relationships. Also, we have E-support available for day to 
day operations.
Positive
Responsible Supply 
Chain
Opportunity
Investors, customers, and regulators have 
raised pressure on businesses to reduce 
environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) risk exposures in their supply chains.
At GTPL we see it as opportunity as considering ESG 
aspect in our supply chain can effectively reduce the 
overall risk.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
We believe stakeholder engagement is important it helps to build and maintain trust, ensure accountability, and foster collaboration. 
Our stakeholders include customers, employees, regulators, suppliers, shareholders, and the community. Effective communication 
and engagement with these groups helps us to understand their needs and expectations, identify potential risks and opportunities, 
and make informed decisions that benefit all parties. This can lead to improved customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, 
operational efficiency, and overall business success.
Essential Indicators

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity:
	
Understanding stakeholders’ expectations, needs, and concerns is important because they are crucial to realising the 
Company’s vision. The Company has taken a methodical approach to identifying stakeholders- the people, organisations, 
and groups that are interested in or have an impact on the business’ operations and decisions. This becomes foundational to 
our sustainable value creation journey. For us, identifying internal stakeholders like employees, owners, and management is 
the first step in this process. The emphasis then shifts to external stakeholders, such as clients, vendors, the government, and 
the community. We identify the stakeholders, determine their level of interest and influence over the organisation, and then 
rank their needs and issues. The stakeholder engagement approach is developed using the information gathered in order to 
manage relationships with each stakeholder group and communicate effectively with them. The objective is to make sure that 
all stakeholders are successfully involved and satisfied and that the organisation’s decision-making process takes their needs 
and interests into account.

Waste Management
STBs (Set top boxes) that are not functioning 
properly are taken back from the customers 
via the LCOs and supplied to vendors where 
they are cleaned and repacked to be re-used 
by the customers. 
This reduces the use & dependency of 
virgin/ new STBs by the customers. This 
helps to reduce the manufacturing of new 
STBs and further reduce the generation of 
waste.
