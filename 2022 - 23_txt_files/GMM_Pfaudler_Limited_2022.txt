1
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Governance structure is a critical component of any 
organization which strive for excellence. A responsive 
and 
inclusive 
Governance 
structure 
helps 
the 
organization to be resilient and adapt to unforeseen 
situations. 
The 
oversight 
of 
the 
Governance 
committees on ESG factors helps an organization to 
be aligned and driven in right direction of sustainability.
GMM Pfaudler’s Governance Principles and the 
charters of the Board’s standing committees establish 
a framework for the governance of the Board and 
oversight of the Company. Each Committee plays a 
crucial role in reinforcing our commitment to conduct 
our business with the highest corporate standards.
Positive

Product 
Quality and 
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
A value for money and high quality product which 
is supported by seamless pre & post sales service 
provides an organization with an opportunity to 
retain satisfied customers who in turn are a source of 
recurring revenues.
We strive to align our business objectives with our 
vision of becoming the most sought-after provider 
of top-quality engineered products and services to 
our clients. Our pursuit of ethical and transparent 
business practices is aimed at building trust among 
our stakeholders, strengthening our brand image, and

Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity Reducing the product's environmental and social 
impact throughout its production process without 
sacrificing quality can lessen the organization's overall 
environmental impact and increase sales.
GMM Pfaudler continues to develop new products, 
monitor the functionality of machinery on the job site, 
and enhance design and feature sets for increased 
dependability, safety, minimal environmental impact, 
and user-friendliness.
Positive
4
Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk
A sustainable supply chain is one that ensures socially 
responsible business practices. Our inability to identify 
and collaborate strategically with suppliers / partners 
who provide key products and services can lead to 
contractual, legal and business-continuity risks.
Suppliers details are scrutinized through 
various screening tools and checklists to 
assess social risks.   
GMM Pfaudler’s supplier’s Code of Conduct 
expects its supply chain partners to 
completely abide by all applicable laws 
and standards for corporate governance, 
social responsibility, and the environment.
Negative
5
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Our 
people’s 
capabilities, 
competence 
and 
commitment are the force behind our continued 
business success and the stakeholder trust we enjoy.
Providing a safe and healthy workplace environment for 
our workers is critical to the success of our operations.
Our focus is to create a workplace free of 
injuries, fatalities and illness by leveraging 
technology 
and 
through 
trainings, 
appropriate personal protective equipment, 
incident tracking and reporting.
All of GMM Pfaudler’s manufacturing 
facilities adhere to ISO 45001 standards, 
have 
a 
comprehensive 
Emergency 
Response Plan and have strict health & 
safety in place. We monitor continuous 
progress through our behaviour based 
safety programs in all our plants.

Climate 
Change
Risk
Extreme weather events due to climate change pose a 
physical risk of disruption to the Company’s operations, 
and the safety & wellbeing of its employees.
An environmentally sustainable approach 
is adopted by creating green policies, 
processes, frameworks and infrastructure
-Focusing on energy conservation and 
use of renewable energy to reduce carbon 
footprint, adoption of newer technologies 
and methods to manage waste in line with 
circular economy principles
- Operational and engineering controls to 
minimize freshwater consumption, Water 
management through sewage treatment, 
recycling of treated water and rainwater 
harvesting.
- Waste management through recycling, 
reusing, reducing waste generation.
-Supply 
Chain 
sustainability 
through 
responsible sourcing.

Community 
Development
Opportunity The business must be rooted in community and be 
aligned with the community’s larger interests. Any 
adversarial relationship can hurt the Company’s ability 
to create longer term value.
GMM Pfaudler has a tripartite approach for community 
outreach.
1. Healthcare: 
Fostering 
local 
communities 
by 
developing preventive Healthcare programs & 
supporting hospitals.
2.  Education: Enhancing vocational skills & improving 
quality of education by partnering & providing 
necessary resources to ITI's.

Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
Opportunity Energy is crucial for economic growth and life prosperity. 
Availability and reliability of energy has always been a 
concern not only for an organization but also for the 
world at large.
All production facilities adhere to ISO 50001 standards. 
The Company has a renewable energy portfolio of 2.8 
MW (Wind + Solar). The renewable energy  generated 
contributes to 7% of total electricity needs and helps 
organization in avoiding 1456 tCO₂e in FY 2022-23.
Additionally, our Company regularly implements a 
variety of energy-saving strategies to cut down on 
energy use and emissions footprints. 
Positive
9
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Being a limited resource, water needs to be planned 
for, distributed, and managed in a way that makes the 
best use of it. Water availability and utilization have an 
effect on the environment and society.
The operations regions of GMM Pfaudler 
completely adhere to the pollution control 
board’s guidelines and are not located in 
water stress zones. The manufacturing 
plants treat and recycle the wastewater 
produced during the production process, 
minimizing the impact on freshwater 
requirements for domestic and agricultural 
use.
Both
10
Waste 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity 
In order to save resources, waste should be minimized 
and reused. Recycled materials should be used 
whenever possible. Waste must be separated, collected, 
and disposed of by using effective procedures. Waste 
management regulations are essential because they 
would assure correct reuse, recycling, and disposal in 
light of the expanding landfills and dumpsites that 
further harm air, soil, and water.
GMM Pfaudler implemented strategies 
to 
minimize 
waste 
production 
and 
waste generation at every level of the 
manufacturing cycle. To ensure compliance 
with all legal requirements and no negative 
effects on the environment, the trash 
created is delivered to Transport, Storage 
and Disposal Facility (TSDF) for disposal. 
Additionally, we forbid the use of single-use, 
nonbiodegradable plastics on our property.

Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
It is a responsibility of an organization to adhere to 
the highest standard of integrity and ethics while 
operating the business.
Also non – compliances and penalties may result in a 
direct impact on the operations of the Company and 
cause financial stress.
GMM 
Pfaudler 
firmly 
upholds 
its 
commitment to ethical conduct and 
compliance excellence. With a robust 
Code of Conduct, the Company instills 
core values of integrity, transparency, and 
respect among its employees at all levels. 
The Code serves as a comprehensive 
framework, emphasizing adherence to 
laws, prevention of conflicts of interest, 
protection 
of 
Company 
assets, 
and 
the promotion of a safe and inclusive 
workplace. Backed by a well-governed 
compliance structure, GMM Pfaudler’s 
diligent 
governance 
and 
oversight 
ensure that its compliance framework 
and 
controls 
remain 
effective 
and 
adaptable to evolving regulations and 
risks. Regular training programs and open 
communication channels further foster 
a culture of compliance, empowering 
employees 
to 
uphold 
the 
highest 
ethical standards and report concerns 
confidentially. 
Negative
12
R&D and 
Innovation
Opportunity To create better products with increased efficiencies 
and lower environmental impact, R&D and innovation 
are essential.
The primary goal of GMM Pfaudler’s dedicated R&D 
team is to create products with increased efficiencies, 
reduce environmental footprint through sustainable 
practices to create a long-term positive impact on our 
environment commitments and business partners.
