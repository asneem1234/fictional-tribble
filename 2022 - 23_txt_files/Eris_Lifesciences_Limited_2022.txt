or opportunity 
(R/O) 
Rationale for 
identifying the risk / 
opportunity 
In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or mitigate 
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications) 
1.
ESG and  
Regulatory  
Compliances 
Risk 
The risk of financial 
and reputational 
damage that 
arises from non-
compliance with 
environmental, social, 
and governance 
(ESG) standards and 
regulations. 
1.	Identify potential ESG 
Risks
2.	Implement the ESG 
compliance program 
and monitor the 
ESG compliance 
performance.

with investors;
•	 Better ability to attract 
capital
•	 Operations become 
more sustainable
•	 Reduced risk of fines 
and penalties 
•	 Improved reputation 
2.

issues could have 
serious patient safety 
issues along with 
product liability 
and regulatory 
ramifications.

leading to product 
withdrawals, recalls, 
decreased sales, and 
reputational damage.

quality control 
procedures. 
2.	Use robust data

management 
Risk 
The entire product 
life cycle relies heavily 
on the supply chain, 
necessitating a robust 
contingency plan to 
address unforeseen 
circumstances that 
could potentially 
disrupt the supply 
chain. Moreover, the 
Company extends its 
responsible business 
principles throughout 
the value chain, 
expecting suppliers 
to comply with these 
principles.  
1.	 Create a strong 
evaluation system to 
analyse the effects 
of unprecedented 
disruptions on the 
supply chain and 
formulate a thorough 
contingency strategy 
to minimize significant 
consequences on the 
business. 
2.	 Conduct a supplier 
evaluation following 
standard practices and 
requirements as guided 
by sector-specific 
responsible supply 
chain initiatives.

of responsible supply 
chain practices, the

detrimental effect on its 
operations, leading to 
hindered product supply 
and increased costs.

the Organisational 
philosophy of

and retention.
1.	Continuous

turnover.
•	 Increased reputation 
Negative: 
•	 Operational 
disruptions

Technology 
and 
digitalisation 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Risk: 
The risks associated 
with technology have 
a direct impact on the 
security and integrity 
of the entire business 
operations. It is 
crucial to periodically 
assess the criticality 
of technology and 
cyber security 
to prevent data 
privacy breaches, 
safeguarding 
the confidential 
information of the 
Company and its 
stakeholders. 
 Opportunity: 
By establishing robust 
governance practices 
regarding data 
integrity, technology, 
digitalization, 
and innovation, 
the Company can 
create a secure 
and impenetrable 
network. This allows 
for the smooth

preventive health 
screenings the 
company improves 
its perception in the 
community that it 
operates in.
NA
Positive:

pharmaceutical offerings 
of the company w.r.t. 
their effectiveness in 
curing the patients.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements 
We believe that concerns for Society and Environment 
along with the business existence and its expansion 
are the core values of any organisation. This belief 
has always kept us thoughtful to align our business 
practices with the ESG related guidelines. We strive 
to adopt best environmental practices and protocols 
within the paradigm of our operations and create value 
for all stakeholders whilst growing responsibly and 
sustainably. 
During the year, a host of initiatives were undertaken 
at the manufacturing plant to step up our game on 
the ESG front. We always prioritize contributing to 
Environment Health and Safety issues. In line with 
the said view, we have set-up an effluent treatment 
plant with Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) treatment 
process, designed for the removal of liquid waste 
from the system. The emphasis of the process is to 
manage wastewater economically and produce clean 
water. We have installed Electricity Meters and VFDs 
(Variable Frequency Devices) at all energy-intensive 
points in the facility to monitor and reduce specific 
energy consumption. We have set and implemented 
specific targets for use of recycled water in areas such 
as gardening, cooling tower, boiler and washrooms. 
We endeavour to maintain healthy relationship and 
engagement with local communities and work with 
them as partners. In that spirit, we have initiated and 
adopted social and community welfare undertakings 
which include a wide spectrum of development 
activities.
