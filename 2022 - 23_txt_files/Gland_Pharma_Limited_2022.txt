Statement by Director, responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
 Gland Pharma is firmly committed to sustainability and recognizes its responsibility to the environment, society, and future 
generations. In response to community concerns regarding environmental, health, and safety (EHS) matters, the company 
has proactively implemented a range of measures to address these issues within its operations.
To effectively manage Bio-Medical Waste, Gland Pharma has devised and implemented robust strategies for the treatment 
and recycling of wastewater. The company regularly screens and upgrades its effluent and sewage treatment plants at their 
manufacturing facilities, ensuring proper and responsible wastewater management.
Demonstrating a strong dedication to sustainable water usage, the Company has undertaken significant improvements 
to its raw water underground storage tank, resulting in a notable reduction in overall water consumption. By continually 
enhancing the water quality sampling process, Gland Pharma has achieved even more significant reductions in water 
usage.
Aligned with their unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability, the Company has successfully transitioned to 
cleaner fuels at their manufacturing facilities. By replacing furnace oil with piped natural gas (PNG) as boiler fuel, Gland 
Pharma has significantly reduced stack emissions and lowered CO2 output. Furthermore, the Company has plans to extend 
this transition to other facilities, solidifying their position as responsible stewards of the environment.
These proactive measures exemplify Gland Pharma’s approach to addressing community concerns and their persistent 
dedication to environmental stewardship. By prioritizing EHS measures and embracing sustainable practices, the company 
aims to make a positive and lasting contribution to the well-being of the communities in which it operates while minimizing 
its ecological impact.

4.	
Has the Company implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 	
	
implementation. 
	
The Company has implemented a comprehensive wastewater management system that includes multiple treatment 
processes. After the chlorination stage, the water undergoes treatment in Reverse Osmosis Plants (RO-I & II). Any rejects 
generated from RO-I & II are further treated in RO-III, followed by the Final Reverse Osmosis (RO-IV) system. The final rejects 
from the RO treatment are then sent to the Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP).
	
In addition to the RO systems, the Company operates a highly effective Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) that utilizes a Moving 
Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) system. The treatment process includes several stages, starting with a collection tank, followed by 
an anoxic tank and an aeration tank. The wastewater then undergoes treatment in a Tube Deck system before being directed 
to a clarified tank. The process continues with sand and carbon filtration, concluding with Ultra Filtration that incorporates 
UV disinfection.
	
By incorporating these advanced treatment processes, the Company ensures efficient and environmentally responsible 
wastewater management, aligning with its commitment to sustainability and responsible industrial practices.
