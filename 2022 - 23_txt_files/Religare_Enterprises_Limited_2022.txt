# Shares means equity shares
* Though, the Company holds 100% equity share capital in Religare Capital Markets Limited (“RCML”), however 
in the present scenario controlling through voting rights of RCML is not there with the Company. Beside this, the 
tripartite agreement entered into, in financial year 2011-12, between REL, RCML and RHC Holding Private Limited 
(“RHCHPL”), an erstwhile promoter group company for providing financial support to RCML by RHCHPL (by 
subscribing Preference Shares of RCML) severe long term restrictions and significant restrictive covenants on major 
decision making at RCML were imposed by the holder of preference shares. Accordingly in view of the above, the 
financial statements of RCML and its subsidiaries have been excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
of the Company w.e.f. October 01, 2011, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company has 
already provided fully for the entire investment made by it into RCML in previous years.

The top priorities in corporate

manner.

code, laws, rules & regulations.

System 
upgradation 
& Technology 
initiatives
Risk
Increasing 
digitization 
and 
the way companies operate 
bring with it associated risks, 
especially concerning data 
security and privacy. 
A lack of adequate and 
transparent 
data 
security 
and privacy systems can 
lead to direct economic and 
reputational losses for the 
Company 
and 
customer 
confidence.
Failure to upgrade the system 
can impede the process of 
capturing 
data 
from 
both 
internal and external sources.
 Implemented sound information 
security systems and policies to 
manage sensitive customer data
 Training 
employess 
on 
the

security procedures regarding 
appropriate access use and 
disclosure of personal data

environmental,

Risk 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Effective 
risk 
and 
crisis 
management 
is 
vital 
for 
Company’s long-term financial 
health and is an enabler 
for 
meeting 
its 
business 
objectives 
and 
delivering 
long-term value for all its 
stakeholders.
 Being 
a 
Core 
investment 
company, management functions 
include oversight of risk function 
prevalent for the company and its 
key operating subsidiaries.
 REL has comprehensive risk 
management 
framework 
and 
overarching risk management 
policy, which is adopted by each 
of its key operating subsidiaries 
while formulating their policy.
 The 
policy 
is 
aimed 
at 
identification, 
assessment, 
mitigation, 
monitoring 
and 
reporting of identifiable risks and 
recording of each identified risk 
alongwith their mitigation plan.
 Adequate availability and testing 
of 
internal 
financial 
controls 
including policies, procedures 
and risk control matrices at PLC 
and ELC level and reporting to 
board level committee
Neagtive
 The presence of gaps 
in the company’s risk 
management 
practises 
can result in the failure 
to identify and address 
all risks, including those 
related to environmental, 
social, and governance 
(ESG) factors that are 
pertinent to the company. 
These gaps have the 
potential 
to 
adversely 
affect 
the 
company’s 
overall 
business 
operations.
