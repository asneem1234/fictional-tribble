Carbon 
Emission - Risk 
& Opportunity
Given the growing emphasis on 
sustainability 
and 
the 
transition 
towards cleaner energy sources, 
Petro 
products 
companies 
face 
potential challenges including stricter 
regulations, carbon pricing mechanism 
and a consumer shift to low carbon 
alternatives. If not addressed, these 
factors pose as a risk to company’s 
operations, market competitiveness 
and long-term viability. As a result, 
TPL 
needs 
to 
address 
Carbon 
emissions as a risk and explore 
ways to reduce their carbon footprint, 
invest in renewable energy sources 
and adapt to the evolving energy 
landscape.  While carbon emissions 
present 
challenges 
to 
petroleum 
products companies, it can also 
be viewed as an Opportunity for

Increasingly

Toxic 
Emissions-Risk
Addressing toxic emissions in a 
petrochemical 
products 
company 
requires 
implementing 
rigorous 
environmental regulations, emission 
control 
mechanisms 
and 
regular 
monitoring 
to 
minimize 
harmful 
impacts on the environment and public 
health. Possibility of leak from the 
system while handling, loading and 
unloading pose critical threat to the 
environment.
Various 
steps 
are 
taken 
to handle Toxic Emissions 
Release of toxic emissions 
to environment is practically 
Nil, as any draining is only 
through 
closed 
piping 
to 
Recovery drum, from where 
it is recycled to system. Any 
venting is also only through 
closed 
header 
for 
safe 
disposal through Flare. HC & 
Gas Detectors are installed 
in various areas of the plants, 
to alert any leaks and to take 
immediate corrective action. 
LDAR (Leak detection and 
Repair) surveys are done at 
periodic intervals to detect 
fugitive emissions & to rectify. 
SOP is available and PPEs 
are provided to the concerned 
employees and also relevant 
safety trainings are imparted 
to the employees.

Hazardous 
Waste and 
Wastewater 
management-
Risk
The 
hazardous 
waste 
generated 
should be stored safely inside the 
through approved disposal facilities 
to avoid/ reduce the impact on 
environment.
The risk of spillage or leakage 
should be understood and addressed 
and mitigation plan.
The 
wastewater 
discharge 
from 
chemical industry operations poses a 
potential contamination and harmful 
impacts on ecosystem, hence it’s 
important to prudently treat the waste 
water generated.
The 
hazardous 
waste 
generated 
through 
the 
process 
are 
maintained 
in a secured area. Valid 
documentation for authorising 
generation and storage and 
disposal is maintained. Also, 
a contract with the disposal 
agency is in practice. The 
Hazardous 
waste 
annual 
return is submitted as part of 
the regulatory requirement. 
The absence of proper 
hazardous 
waste 
management 
within 
the company can result 
consequences. These 
include 
potential 
for 
non-compliance 
with 
regulations, 
increased liability for 
any harm caused due 
to 
improper 
waste 
disposal, 
increased 
operational expenses 
associated 
with

causing 
loss

Opportunities 
in Clean 
Technology-
Opportunity
By adopting clean technology 
opportunities, 
petrochemical 
companies 
can 
contribute 
to 
environmental 
protection 
and 
also position themselves as a 
sustainable 
and 
responsible 
player. At TPL we are actively 
trying 
to 
reduce 
our 
carbon 
footprint 
by 
exploring 
more 
environment friendly resources like 
renewable energy and alternate 
energy viz., replacing fuel oil DG 
Sets with Gas based Engines for 
conservation of resources.
Investing 
and 
adopting 
renewable energy sources 
provides 
the 
company 
with 
greater

practices. 
Additionally, 
we utilise the hydrogen 
generated in our facilities 
as 
fuel 
to 
meet 
the 
operational 
requirements 
of certain processes. 
Embracing 
clean 
technology 
provides 
the 
company 
with

for

enhancement, access

Chemical 
Safety-Risk
As a chemical manufacturing company, 
chemical safety is of utmost priority 
for us. Risks of Leakage, explosion, 
hazardous dust, odour, mishandling 
of chemicals and reactive nature of 
chemicals is an eventuality we face 
on a daily basis. Therefore, Hazard 
and mitigation plan is critical to the 
business.
The Company has several 
multi-level 
safety 
features 
incorporated in plant design,

mechanical protection devices

before the design parameters 
of the equipment. Detailed SOP 
is available for all major work 
activities to adhere & a Permit to

done with required precautions. 
through a review & approval 
process, 
which 
includes 
assessment. MSDS (Material 
Safety Data Sheets) for the 
chemicals are available to act in 
accordance while handling them 
in the plant. Routine surveillance 
and reporting of adverse events 
is in practice for investigation 
and corrective actions are taken.
TPL ensures that all chemical 
containers 
are 
properly 
labelled with hazard symbols 
and relevant warnings and the 
employees are appropriately 
trained to ensure safe storage,
Ensuring 
robust 
chemical 
safety 
practices is not only 
a moral imperative 
but also a crucial 
for the operations 
of a company. The
