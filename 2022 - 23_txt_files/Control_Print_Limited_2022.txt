Health and

measures can have 
adverse implications 
for the company. 
Such implications 
may involve

legal expenses, a 
decline in workforce

reduced employee 
motivation, and 
in extreme cases, 
it may even put 
the company's

Health and Safety system at 
its Guwahati and Nalagarth 
plant. The Company has
