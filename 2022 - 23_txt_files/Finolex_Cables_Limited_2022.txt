1.
Climate 
Change
Risk and 
opportunity
FCL is committed to 
utilise technology which 
empowers customers and 
combatting global climate 
change by promoting 
energy efficient machinery 
and products.
Extreme weather 
conditions can lead to 
disruptions in the supply 
chain.
Our innovative range 
of renewable energy 
products will play a crucial 
role in ensuring the long-
term sustainability of our 
business. This transition 
enables us to position 
ourselves as a customer-
focused provider of solar 
solutions, aligning seamlessly 
with our commitment to 
environmental consciousness 
and green initiatives.
Positive: Being conscious 
of the effects of climate 
change will help the 
Company to be better 
prepared and control the 
losses that would have 
otherwise materialised.  
Negative: Inability of 
the Company to create 
alternative operational 
capabilities could jeopardise 
the order fulfilment and 
affect the bottom-lines.
2.
Human 
Capital
Risk and 
Opportunity
Opportunity: Consistent 
investment in the growth 
& development of our 
people can make our 
human resources a 
key source of strength 
and a key competitive 
advantage.
Risk: Retaining key talent 
and higher turnover could 
lead to increased rehiring 
costs and decreasing 
morale among existing 
workforce.
Finolex Cables asserts 
that allocating resources 
to enhance the skills 
and knowledge of their 
workforce not only serves 
as an incentive, but also 
empowers the Company to 
cultivate a highly capable, 
efficient, and effective staff. 
A variety of training sessions 
are organized to foster the 
skill enhancement of our 
staff. These encompass 
areas like Soft Skills, New 
Employee Induction, 
Negotiation Techniques, 
ISO Training, Quality Tools 
for Problem Solving, Human 
Rights Considerations, 
Work Ethics, Environmental 
Awareness, Fire Drills and 
Safety Protocols, Plastic 
Waste Management, and 
an array of awareness 
programs spanning work 
ethics, regulatory adherence, 
governance, Prevention of 
Sexual Harassment (POSH),
Positive: Retention of key 
talent leads to increased 
productivity in the long run.
Negative: Higher attrition 
increases rehiring costs.

HR protocols, operational

We are focused on creating 
a diverse workforce, 
providing employees with 
an engagement framework, 
and addressing any concerns 
they may have through a 
reliable grievance redressal 
mechanism. Our ultimate 
goal is to create a more agile 
and engaged workforce 
that is better equipped to 
help us achieve our business 
objectives.
3.
Labour 
Rights and 
Practices
Risk
The company’s 
management of labour 
practices and supply 
chain can potentially 
create social risks, such 
as labour rights violations 
and substandard working 
conditions.
By implementing equitable 
labour practices, the 
company can enhance its 
standing and reputation, 
promote greater employee 
loyalty, and ultimately 
improve productivity while 
reducing employee turnover.
The Company has a 
dedicated Compliance 
Tool to ensure complete 
compliance with all the 
applicable labour rules and 
regulations.
Positive: FCL also has an 
equal opportunity policy’ 
which ensures that all the 
employees have the right 
to work in an environment 
that respects the dignity, 
self-worth, and basic human 
rights of every individual.
4.
Community 
Relations
Opportunity Building strong community 
relations can improve the 
company’s reputation in 
the eyes of stakeholders, 
customers, employees, 
and investors. A positive 
reputation can lead to 
increased brand loyalty 
and trust.
Engaging with the local 
community and supporting 
social causes can foster 
a sense of loyalty among 
customers who appreciate a 
company’s commitment to 
making a difference.
Building positive 
relationships with the 
community can act as a 
buffer during challenging 
times, helping to mitigate 
reputational and operational 
risks.
Positive: Community 
relations can create 
opportunities for 
partnerships, joint ventures, 
and collaborations with 
local organizations or 
businesses.
Companies with strong 
community relations 
are more likely to have a 
sustainable and enduring 
presence, as they are deeply 
integrated into the local 
fabric
