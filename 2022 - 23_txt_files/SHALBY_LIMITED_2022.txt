is provided with an update on the status of their grievance. This online system ensures transparency and 
accountability in the grievance redressal process and helps to maintain a positive work environment.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy

Ans: Hospitals generate biomedical waste, as a by-product of healthcare services that can potentially pose serious health and 
environmental impacts if not handled correctly. At Shalby, we take this topic very seriously by putting in place an effective 
management system of healthcare waste which addresses the basic elements of waste minimization, segregation and identification 
by sorting into categories including medical, general, recycled and food waste. The company has achieved the reduction in 
generation of waste, raw material and other resources through various initiatives like environment awareness campaigns, training 
and monthly monitoring of hazardous & nonhazardous waste. We are not producing carbon but and at the same time, we have 
policy in place to dispose of bio medical waste in accordance with the guideline of the government and to ensure minimum 
generation of radiation within the hospital.
