opportunity
In case of risk, approach

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Climate 
change
Risk
The adverse effects 
of climate change 
have potential to
disrupt businesses 
and we are 
observing this in 
our global
supply chains. 
While the company is less 
emission-intensive, we
are contributing to 
climate change mitigation 
through our sustainable 
forest management and 
plantation activities.
The uncertainty due to 
climate change in seasonal 
cashflows with increased 
severity and frequency of 
extreme weather events 
such as cyclones, floods, 
and wildfires. Additional-
ly, increased insurance 
premiums and potential 
for reduced availability 
of insurance on assets in 
“high-risk” locations. 
2
Energy and 
Emissions
Risk and 
Opportunity
Energy 
conservation and 
emission reduction 
is critical to 
reduce our carbon 
footprint and to 
reduce our cost of 
operations.
•	
Reduction in energy 
consumption 
through technology 
interventions and plant 
optimizations
•	
Installation of 
renewable energy 
sources to increase 
the share of RE based 
electricity.
•	
In our operations, dust 
emissions throughout 
the process includes 
activities like log 
handling, log and 
recycled material 
chipping, chip 
screening, veneer 
trimming and laying 
out the particulate 
matter to be pressed. 
•	
Under Emissions, 
we also track GHG 
emissions from our
     operations.
Failure to reduce energy 
use and related GHG 
emissions & adopting 
renewable sources of 
energy will increase 
operating costs and may 
cause penalties for the 
companies.  .

3
Sustainable 
Forest 
Management
Opportunity
Sourcing of raw 
materials is an 
environmental 
opportunity for 
wood-based 
industries as it leads 
to deforestation & 
habitat destruction. 
This will help 
to reduce GHG 
emissions which in 
turn can improve 
ESG performance
GIL has taken up 
sustainable forest 
management and 
plantation activities across 
its operations.
Company sources all its 
timber requirements 
through Agroforestry. 
There is no deforestation 
in our operations.
Our plantation activities 
help us not only in creating 
a sustainable source of 
raw material (Timber) but 
also in building strong 
community relationships.
4
Water
Risk
Judicious use of 
natural resources 
such as water 
is necessary to 
ensure there is no 
over-extraction 
of water in local 
& water-stressed 
regions. GIL 
being a plywood 
manufacturing 
entity, requires it
to manage and 
regulate its water 
consumption and 
disposal.
•	
Reduction in water 
consumption 
through technology 
interventions and plant 
optimizations across its 
operations.
•	
The wastewater from 
the RO system is 
channelled into our 
reservoirs that provide 
water for sprinklers 
helping replenish the 
ground water table, 
through which we have 
enhanced the water 
tables near our plant’s 
surroundings.
•	
Our operations in water-
stressed areas add to 
the cost of procurement 
of water (from tankers 
or municipality).
5
Waste 
management
Opportunity
Waste from 
different parts of 
operations may 
result in pollution 
and contamination 
of earth, water and 
air. We are focused 
on proper waste 
management.
•	
Reuse of wood waste 
as fuel to reduce our 
operational waste or 
through other process 
modifications.
•	
Well defined waste 
management 
processes 
•	
Appropriate disposal 
of wastes (hazardous 
waste etc.) as per 
regulatory norms to 
authorized vendors. 
•	
Reusing opportunities 
helps in cost savings.
•	
Reduction of waste 
results in an improved 
environmental footprint 
and prevents any cost 
in the form of fines and 
penalties.

6
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Occupational 
health and safety 
is at the core of 
our strategy. Few 
of the key reasons 
of this priority are 
appearing below:
•	
Work-related 
injuries pose a 
challenge to the 
safety of our staff. 
•	
A focus on 
employee 
wellbeing results 
in a productive 
workforce.
•	
For GIL, proper 
OHS management 
system, training, and 
knowledge about OHS 
across all stakeholders 
is important for 
mitigation of the 
health hazards due to 
occupational demands 
across the entire 
operations.
•	
Strong Safety 
Management System 
working towards goal 
of bringing number of 
workplace incidents to 
absolute minimum.
•	
Increased focus on 
occupation health and 
safety can help build 
brand image while 
promoting worker 
morale, which may lead 
to increased productivity, 
reduced worker turnover, 
& enhanced community 
relations.
•	
In a safe working 
environment, there are 
extremely few accidents. 
This saves compensation 
expenses for employees 
by reducing downtime 
for safety inquiries.
7
Local 
Community
Opportunity
This is essential 
for wood-based 
industry as it brings 
about measurable 
& positive change 
within communities 
in which the 
company operates & 
performs business. 
Community engagement 
by means of vivid 
development programme, 
engagement exercises 
and regular assessment.
of the impacts are 
necessary for GIL. 
This will help to create a 
proper work environment 
for the company 
established by the trust 
of the surrounding local 
communities leading 
to smooth operational 
benefits.
8
Training and 
education
Opportunity
This has become 
important to adopt 
practices for skilful 
development of 
their employees, 
and to foster a 
healthy working 
environment.
GIL put efforts into 
upgrading the employees 
and management with 
the know-how of the 
latest technologies, and 
best practices within the 
sector.
This addresses the 
company’s ability to 
develop, motivate, and 
retain talent which is critical 
to business success in 
the competitive industry 
landscape.
9
Diversity and 
inclusion
Opportunity
Ensuring good 
diversity mix 
and equal 
opportunities for 
all is a right step for 
fostering healthy 
human capital 
development. This 
also ensures the 
engagement of 
local communities 
into the 
manufacturing 
operations.
GIL believes in equal 
opportunities for all, also 
visible in the initiatives 
taken by us to have 
women carpenter artisans 
and architects. Ensuring 
Diversity and Inclusion is
essential to build a holistic 
culture and talent pool 
within the organization. 
This factor also addresses 
the discriminatory
practices based on race, 
caste, gender, sexual 
orientation, and others.
Diverse workplace leads to 
better retention of talent 
and improving customer 
orientation, employee 
satisfaction, and decision 
making, leading to a 
virtuous cycle of increasing 
returns.

7. 	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
As India's one of the largest plywood and wood-based manufacturing Company, we recognize the pressing need for bold 
corporate actions and transformative measures in response to the climate crisis. Throughout the year, we have made 
significant progress in integrating sustainability into our core business practices. Our first sustainability report, "Growing 
Together," served as a valuable tool to assess our non-financial performance and identify areas for improvement. Also, 
last year we had initiated ‘ESG360’ – an initiative that will formalize our sustainability endeavours and help us track and 
report our progress in the same. ESG360 will provide a roadmap till FY 2025, integrating sustainability into our business 
operations covering aspects of environment, social and governance. We acknowledge that there is immense potential 
to prioritize and embed sustainability throughout our entire value chain, starting from the strategy stage.

Sustainability principles and practices have been an integral part of our business right from the start and the idea of 
sustainability is not new to GIL, our business relies on natural resource as key raw material, and we understand that it 
is an imperative that we replenish what we take from the natural ecosystem. Our fundamental values as a business 
unit have ensured that we foster the well-being of the communities in which we operate. At GIL, we recognize the 
importance of preserving nature and giving back more than we take. All our manufactured products are sourced from 
plantation timber, and through our plantation activities, we actively collaborate with local communities to support 
livelihoods.

9.	
Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
As Greenply targets to be a zero-waste company, here waste generated from operations is monitored very closely. We 
focus on both hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated for its proper reuse as well as disposal. Our hazardous 
waste mainly comes from the formaldehyde-based resin, which is used as adhesive in plywood manufacturing. This 
manufacturing process is monitored continuously through quality checks to ensure structural integrity of the end 
product. Wood chips formed during the plywood manufacturing process are used for energy generation, thus no wood 
waste is generated. The Company consumes waste products (side cutting, dust etc.) as fuel in the boilers.
	
The water exiting the production system is cleaned and recirculated for boiling water strains. Another use of this water 
is to maintain the humidity of the production area where small sprinklers are provided at each operation site. We have 
waste management system in place to comply with the requirements of Pollution Control Board’s standards in air 
and water quality. All hazardous waste is disposed through registered waste management services. All waste data is 
reviewed monthly by the department head to create action points on the gaps identified.
