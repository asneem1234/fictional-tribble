Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
We at TIL firmly believes in co-existence of mankind and nature for a sustainable future. We firmly 
believe to operate as a responsible corporate citizen and integrate sustainability in all aspects of 
decision-making procedures; and accordingly consider our impacts on the environment and society 
at large. At TIL we have initiated our journey of transition and placing efforts in value creation for better 
sustainability performance. 
Our stakeholders are of high importance to our business operations, and we endeavour to enhance 
their confidence in our business. Thus, to understand and capture the concerns of the stakeholders we 
have formulated a stakeholder engagement committee and taken appropriate measures to identify 
our key stakeholder groups comprising of internal & external stakeholders, followed by identification 
of material KPI’s through Double materiality assessment framework and appropriate stakeholder 
engagement and consultation process. Simultaneously, we have established strategies to mitigate the 
concerns identified by the stakeholders.
To combat climate change and align with domestic and international goals on climate change at TIL, 
we have initiated certain measures to transit to a low carbon future. One of such steps was introduction 
of renewable energy to reduce our indirect carbon emission footprint, through the initiative of solar 
fencing. We appreciate the fact that use of fossil fuel in our operations is one of the major sources 
of direct emission, hence, we have been implemented processes to transit to cleaner fuels and have 
accordingly, adopted low carbon-intensive methods such as dual fired boiler, fuel switch to achieve 
higher energy output inclusive of reduced emissions. 
Post pandemic, the world as we know have changed; and as a responsible corporate citizen, we 
have initiated multiple efforts to uplift the society & local communities though our CSR initiatives. We 
endeavour to create a sustainable future where humanity thrives in correlation to nature.

Tega Industries Limited 
Annual Report 2022-23
Yes, at TIL, appropriate processes and procedures have been established to receive and redress grievances from employees (permanent 
& non-permanent) and workers (permanent & non-permanent). Currently at TIL the mechanism to capture grievances of the employees 
comprises of whistle-blower mechanism and the POSH, both of which have board approved policies and procedures implemented. 
The mechanism of whistle-blower comprises of lodging of complains by the employee within 30 days after becoming aware of 
the incident, which is then investigated by the vigilance officer followed by submission of the same to the vigilance committee. 
The committee then conducts an internal audit, wherein if unethical & improper act is concluded by the committee, then the audit 
committee enforces disciplinary or corrective action. 
The mechanism of POSH comprises of lodging of detailed complain along with documentary evidence, if available. Post receipt of 
the complaint and prior to  initiating the inquiry, the committee take steps to conciliate the complaint between the complainant and 
the respondent. During inquiry all the proceedings are documented, and the committee interviews the respondent separately and 
impartially. Committee states exactly what the allegation is and who has made the allegation. The respondent is given full opportunity 
to respond and provide any evidence, etc. Detailed notes of the meetings are prepared which may be shared with the respondent and 
complainant upon request. Any witnesses produced by the respondent are also interviewed & statements are taken. Post the inquiry 
the committee submits its report containing the findings and recommendations to the employer, within 10 days of completion of the 
inquiry. Appropriate steps are taken depending on whether the complaint is unsubstantiated or substantiated.
To receive and redress the grievances of workers currently there are two mechanisms – the first mechanism comprises of the workers 
registering complaints directly with the plant HR or departmental supervisor or the plant head, which is then subsequently investigated 
and addressed. The second mechanism comprises of suggestion boxes which are available at all the manufacturing facilities. Each 
month the suggestions submitted in the boxes are reviewed by the internal committee of the plants and appropriate measures are 
taken to address the concerns/suggestions submitted by the workers.

•	
Development and circulation of appropriate questionnaires amongst key stakeholder groups identified, to identify issues/concerns 
and expectations that are material to the business as well as to the stakeholders from stakeholder’s perspective.
•	
The concerns and expectations are then assessed through a SMAF process. The SMAF process defines a risk/opportunity rating 
process. The concerns and expectations that are identified as of high significance, i.e. important and material are marked as material 
matters. The objectives of such material matters are then identified. Accordingly, such material matters are converted into material 
Key Performance Indicators. For each of the material KPIs, a baseline and an achievable target is set, for the defined time-period.

and procedures outlined and implemented. The details of the same have been highlighted below –
(a)	 Whistle Blower Policy 
Procedure: All the Protected Disclosures are to be reported in writing by the Complainant as soon as possible, not later than 30 days after 
the whistle blower becomes aware of the same. All Protected Disclosure under this Policy will be recorded and thoroughly investigated.
Investigation: The Vigilance Officer will carry out an investigation either himself/herself or by involving any other officer of the Company at 
the advice of the Vigilance Committee or through an outside agency before presenting report on the matter to the Vigilance Committee.
Decision and Recording: If an investigation leads to a conclusion that an improper or unethical act has been committed, the chairperson 
of the Audit Committee shall recommend to the Board to take such disciplinary or corrective action as it may deem. Any disciplinary or 
corrective action initiated against the subject as a result of the findings of an investigation pursuant to this Policy, shall adhere to the 
applicable personnel or staff’s conduct and disciplinary procedures. The Company may also opt to reward the Whistle Blower, based on 
merits of the case.
(b)	 POSH Policy
Lodging a Complaint: The complainant is required to submit a detailed complaint, along with any documentary evidence available or 
names of witnesses, to any of the committee members at the workplace.
Tega Industries Limited 
Annual Report 2022-23
Resolution: Once the complaint is received, before initiating the inquiry the committee may take steps to conciliate the complaint 
between the complainant and the respondent. This is only if requested by the aggrieved woman.
Conducting Inquiry: The committee initiates inquiry in the following cases:
•	
No conciliation is requested by aggrieved woman.
•	
Conciliation has not resulted in any settlement.
•	
Complainant informs the committee that any term or condition of the settlement arrived through conciliation, has not been 
complied with by respondent.
All proceedings of the inquiry are documented. The Committee interviews the respondent separately and impartially. Committee states 
exactly what the allegation is and who has made the allegation. The respondent is given full opportunity to respond and provide any 
evidence etc. Detailed notes of the meetings are prepared which may be shared with the respondent and complainant upon request. 
Any witnesses produced by the respondent are also interviewed & statements are taken. Post the inquiry, the committee submits its 
report containing the findings and recommendations to the employer, within 10 days of completion of the inquiry. Appropriate steps 
are taken depending on whether the complaint is unsubstantiated or substantiated.
(c)	 SA 8000
To protect the rights of the workers and prevent their exploitation at the workplace, TIL has implemented SA 8000. This involve ensuring 
a good working condition, giving appropriate wages, ensuring higher levels of health and safety protections, and prevention of 
discrimination and that there is no room for forced labour or any other form of modern slavery, apart from no existence of dangerous 
working conditions and coercion for co-existence.
We at TIL have implemented SA 8000, which encompasses the designated four fundamental rights at work, as laid down in Article 2 of 
the ILO Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 1998. We ensure the following in our workplace:
1.	
Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining,
2.	
The elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour,
3.	
The effective abolition of child labour,
4.	
The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
We have put in place external & internal communication mechanism to include concerns and expectations raised by external & internal 
stakeholders as a part of SA-8000.
(d)	 Prevention of Environmental Damage
We at TIL believe that every stakeholder has the right to a healthy environment, good health, food, and water. While we strictly adhere 
to national environmental regulations, we have also taken measures to prevent environmental damage. We have initiated the process 
of positive water balance by trying to recharge the water wherever it is practically possible both inside the plant, as well as exploring 
other areas where there is a scarcity of water for facilitating water recharge, which would eventually result in water-food-livelihood-
social security. We have considered low carbon intensive business activities in our plant operations that results in reduction of effect on 
climate change. All such initiatives have been taken in view that if such measures are not taken, then these could otherwise negatively 
impact human rights of the local and global community. Overall, we have implemented ISO 14001, Environmental Management System 
(EMS) in all the manufacturing facilities in India that ensures that human rights of any individual are not violated/impacted to the extent 
possible and practicable through any form of acceptable damage if caused to the environment by us. We have put in place external & 
internal communication mechanism to include concerns and expectations raised by external & internal stakeholders as a part of EMS.
(e)	 No Forceful Acquisition of Land for Business Activities
We at TIL, in principle believe that for individuals and communities, access to land and natural resources are necessary for their livelihood 
and survival. Hence, their rights to property, housing, food, and water can be abused, if their land is taken away from them. We therefore 
strictly to abide by the laws of the land. In case of land that is to be acquired by us for the purpose of business activities, we make 
appropriate rehabilitation and settlement provisions for the impacted community/individuals.
(f)	 Ensuring appropriate Occupational, Health and Safety measures
We at TIL believe in the provision of appropriate health and safety situations to our entire workforce, inclusive of our vendors, to protect 
their right for a safe working environment. In view of the same, we have implemented ISO 45001, Occupational Health, and Safety 
Management System (OHSMS) in the manufacturing facilities of TIL, in India that ensures that the human rights of individuals are not 
impacted to the extent practicable, on account of any form of incidents caused inside/outside the plant premises. We have put in place

of OHSMS.
(g)	 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) measures
We believe that we should make a focussed approach to operate in ways that enhance our society and the environment. We believe 
taking CSR initiatives that will not only help in improving the causes of various marginalised and disadvantaged section of the society 
apart from protecting the environment, it will also give a boost to the positive brand image of our company.
In this respect, we have developed and implemented a CSR Policy that identifies the need and concerns of the disadvantaged and 
marginalised section of the society, followed by identifying appropriate measures to address their needs. The CSR programs that are 
taken in alignment with the needs of the community and environment are monitored periodically by the board members.
