Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG - related 
challenges, targets, and achievements 
	
In an era of increasing focus on sustainability, responsible business practices, and stakeholder engagement, 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) governance has emerged as a crucial aspect of corporate 
management. ESG governance encompasses the systems and processes through which organizations 
integrate environmental, social, and governance considerations into their decision-making, operations, and risk 
management frameworks. For us at FIL, sustainability has been our very essence over the years. Anything we do, 
has to be done well. Every action takes into account the larger picture, at present, and into the future. Like the 
farmers we work for have taught us, the seeds of big ideas we plant today, will only bear fruit in the future. And 
we have the patience and the will to wait. Whether it is our products, processes, profits, plants, or our parivaar – 
our family of employees, farmers, dealers, homeowners, plumbers, and the communities we work with or the 
environment, our every step keeps them all in mind. We invest in them, in their future, and in our collective future.
	
We have embarked on our ESG journey to grow holistically as an organization and create value for all our 
stakeholders. We took our first step in this direction in FY 2021-22 by gaining the ‘Responsible Care’ accreditation 
from the Indian Chemical Council. Through this, we strive to drive continuous improvement in safe chemicals 
management and achieve excellence in environmental, health, safety, and security performance. It is our 
constant endeavor to deliver products and services of the highest quality to our customers while ensuring 
minimal harm to the environment and society.
	
In FY 2021-22, we started our ESG journey, and set specific ESG goals on all the three pillars of the ESG i.e. 
Environment, Social and Governance. These goals include reduction of Carbon footprint, benchmarking by 
assessment of Biodiversity, tree plantation, adoption of policies on ESG and code of conduct and also on IT 
security.
	
As a result, in FY 2022-23, we have replaced 33% of diesel driven forklifts, through various energy conservation 
drives, were able to reduce more than 8500 tCO2e, recycled more than 2,60,000 m3 of treated effluent back to 
process, commissioned 1 MW solar power plant at one facility situated at Masar, Gujarat and adopted our ESG 
policy.
	
Over these last 41 years, we feel we are just getting started, and the hardest work still lies ahead of us, and 
that is what fills us with purpose and excitement for the future. The legacy we have built so far has brought 
together a large, thriving family. It is a legacy that unites. It is a legacy that makes the future bright and filled 
with possibilities.
	
We all know that the climate change is the biggest business challenge in coming years since we are experiencing 
an unprecedented scale of the extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, cyclones. To ensure the 
positive environmental footprint, we are focusing on enhanced use of renewable energy resources as well as the 
reduction of specific energy consumption. It is our collective responsibility to take care of the mother earth and 
use natural resources efficiently at each of our manufacturing facilities.

a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system?
	
Yes. The Company strives to ensure that it provides a safe and efficient workplace, well-being and safety 
by providing the highest safety standards. The Company has in place Safety Health and Environment 
(SHE) policy to ensure a safe and healthy working environment across all plants and offices with required 
safety protocols.  
	
As part of Company’s Integrated Management system, FIL is certified with ISO 9001 - Quality, ISO 14001 - 
Environment and ISO 45001 - Occupational Health and Safety. FIL is involved in different activities to ensure 
the safety of employees from hazards, work-related injuries, recordable work­ related injuries, and ill health. 
Several initiatives have been taken up like organizing national safety week, national fire services week, 
workplace inspections and audits, first aid training, and mock drills to improve the overall working and 
operation of the Company. All the employees and other non-executive staff actively participate. 
	
The Company successfully implemented Process Safety management System (PSM). FIL’s PSM system 
consists of 11 elements and 27 procedures. PSM elements guides on risk assessment and hazard control, 
standardized way of operation and maintenance (SOP/SMP), mechanical integrity and reliability of 
equipment and system. Safe work practices cover material handling, road transportation of material, lifting 
of equipment and standardization of PPE. All incidents including near misses are reported, investigated, 
and analysed for corrective actions.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
The Company has in place process such as Hazard Identification And Risk Assessment (HIRA) to identify 
all work related hazards and then for identified hazards, control measures are established to mitigate the 
potential risk.
	
For all routine and non-routine activities Permit To Work (PTW) system is followed to ensure all potential 
hazards are addressed prior to commencement of work. For non-routine activities, in addition to PTW, Job 
Safety Analysis (JSA) is followed to identify potential hazards and then PTW system is followed before the 
commencement of work.
	
For effective implementation of control measures Tool Box Talks (TBT) is conducted before commencement 
of work to communicate available control measures to the workforce which ensures that all safety protocols 
are followed.
	
After any shutdown or any major modifications Pre-start up Safety Review (PSSR) is followed prior to start 
up to ensure that all safety systems are in place.
	
Considering complexity of process and known hazards, the Company follows below methodologies to 
address the risks:
	
1	
Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study - Hazard & Operability study (HAZOP) is a systematic way 
to identify possible SHE hazards in the system and suggest recommendations. It is a process of 
examining Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&IDs) by applying guide words and parameters to 
all pipes and vessels in the process. This explicitly identifies the hazards, the potential failures, and the 
potential causes of failure and the recommended actions to address the issues.
	
2	
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - FMEA study is conducted for critical equipment and 
processes. The Company uses it to design a process, review and improve a process which further 
acts as an efficient process control. Its' step-by-step approach identifies each failure mode, with the 
analysis, then estimating the effects of failure and devising ways of controlling the process so that 
failure can be prevented.
	
3	
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) - This analysis method is mainly used in Safety engineering and reliability 
engineering to understand how systems can fail and to identify the best ways to reduce the risk or 
to determine event rates of an accident or a particular system failure. This helps the Company in 
highlighting the critical components related to system failure and to prioritize the action items in 
order to solve the problems.
24
Annual Report 2022-23
Finolex Industries Limited
	
4	
What-if method - It is done for critical equipment where failure is possible by different modes and 
failure can cause a hazardous situation.
	
5	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA)/ Task Risk analysis - JSA is conducted for any jobs involving high risk & 
critical job.
	
6	
Reporting of unsafe condition - Any worker / employee from any department can report the unsafe 
condition from the work premises related to safe operation of the process.
	
7	
Other Measures such as Safety Walk, Safety Audit and Safety Report are carried to identify work-related 
hazards and assess risks.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes. The Company ensures that it continuously reviews and improves health and safety performances. All 
activities relating to monitoring, emergency handling, and team review are supervised and directed by 
the Director-Technical cum Occupier. The safety committee consists of members from both executive 
and workers category addresses the safety concerns to ensure highest safety at office and plant locations. 
Self-spot audit reporting system has been developed to assess the work at plant & reporting unsafe act 
and conditions by workers. To further improve awareness on HSE, the Company had organized various 
programmes such as National Safety Week, Fire Service Week and World Environment Week. These 
programmes covered imparting training on work place safety, fire prevention and control, conducting quiz 
and poster competitions and safeguarding health of the workers by taking safety & environment oath.
