a serious adverse impact on the 
margins of the auto component

Customer 
dissatisfaction on price, quality, 
delivery performance, and design 
could lead to loss of market share.
 In contrary to above, Shift of the 
un-organized 
market to brand-
based 
product 
offerings 
and 
developing new components turn 
the competition into opportunity. 
The Company continues to strive to 
improve its operational performance, 
strict quality controls and develop 
new 
components, 
which 
are 
technologically superior and have 
an edge over its competitors.
The Company also ensures close 
cooperation with its key customers 
on 
product 
development 
and 
remains ahead on technology front 
on light weighting the products to 
offer best in class products to its 
customer.

Risk
SSWL’s 
assumptions 
while 
estimating social cost like gratuity 
funding are subject to capital market

Manufacturing sectors are generally

processes. 
Growing environmental concerns 
have made the Companies to focus

on the environment. 
SSWL is working on alternate 
source of energy, water recycling 
and enhanced use of returnable
