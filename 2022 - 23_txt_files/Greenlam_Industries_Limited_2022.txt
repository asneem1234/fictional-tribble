Corporate overview
Statutory report
Financial section
In 2018, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) updated 
National Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs) on Social, 
Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of 
Business 2011’ (NVGs) to National Guidelines for 
Responsible Business Conduct’ (NGRBCs) to align with 
various national and international development such 
as Paris Climate Agreement, United Nation Guiding 
Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights and 
Sustainable Development Goals. In 2021 Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated) 
disclosure of Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) of listed entities from FY2022-23 onwards in a 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting 
(BRSR) format. The framework is intended to increase 
the transparency of corporate disclosures and assist 
market participants in analyzing sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities. BRSR requirements are robust 
in nature, and it covers a broader spectrum than 
other ESG reporting frameworks. This format seeks 
disclosure on the performance against the nine 
principles of National Guidelines on Responsible 
Business Conduct (NGRBC).
Reporting under the BRSR framework was voluntary 
for the top-1000 listed companies in India by market 
capitalization in financial year 2021-22. However, 
compliance with BRSR requirements is mandatory 
for the top-1000 listed companies beginning in 
fiscal year 2022-23 and voluntary for other listed 
companies, including those that have listed specified 
securities on the Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SME) exchange. Greenlam disclosed its sustainability 
performance in the new BRSR format for FY 2021-22. 
The intention for this early adoption and disclosure 
is to assess company’s current practices, identify area 
of improvements and adopt practices that not only 
meet but go beyond the requirements set out by 
the framework. We are committed to continuously 
improve our disclosure on ESG parameters. During 
the year 2021-22, we concluded materiality 
assessment exercise and identified 14 material topics. 
Going forward, we will implement the defined action 
plan and shall evaluate setting up organization wide 
targets and commitments. The information presented 
in this report is based on the current practices at the 
company and meets the requirements set out by 
NGRBC and BRSR.

highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity

At 
Greenlam, 
environment-social-governance 
(ESG) 
is 
particularly critical as the end product needs to be built with 
natural resource and any deviation from the mean or perceived 
irresponsibility can affect respect and market position. The 
environment component at our company ensures that our 
business consumes environmentally responsible resources, 
consumes only as much as is moderately needed, recycles 
water, responsible waste management, consumes moderate 
fossil fuels and builds resistance to climate change. The social 
component addresses the need to invest in employees, 
vendors, customers and community engagement, a framework 
of relationships that protects the company from unexpected 
supply or demand or production shocks. At Greenlam, ESG 
provides a platform for doing the right things the right way at 
the right time, the basis of its long-term sustainability.
