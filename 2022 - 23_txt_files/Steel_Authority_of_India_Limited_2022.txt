Letter to 
Shareholders.....
Dear Shareholders,
It is my honour to present the Annual Report of your 
Company for the Financial Year 2022-23. I hope you and your 
families are in good health and safe.
As I write my fi rst annual shareholder letter as Chairman, 
to share about the performance for the year that was and 
what to look forward to in the future, I am very confi dent 
and bullish about the Company. In a cyclical industry such 
as Steel, our inherent strength and our endeavour to work 
on our core areas in the recent past are what give me the 
optimism and belief that we can aspire to be Number One- 
as an organisation which can be benchmarked by our peers. 
Our aspiration to be a leader in our chosen areas is 
borne out of the collective will of all stakeholders, 
including the employees.
We had made a decision a few years back to work on two 
focus areas: to maximise capacity utilisation and to provide 
the best value to our Customers in order to safeguard against 
the vagaries of market cycles. This necessitated strategic 
interventions in ramping up of production, securing 
raw materials, improving the quality of inputs, reducing 
business risks over the long term in resource mobilization, 
and providing a better customer experience while focusing 
on Decarbonisation and Sustainability. There were diverse 
and simultaneous challenges in areas like raw material 
prices, logistics, market volatility, and mining operations, 
but with cohesive teamwork and leadership, we were able 
to overcome the challenges to attain certain performance 
indicators which seemed diffi  cult some time back. We 
achieved this by critically working on the focus areas with a 
fresh perspective. I can assure you that we will continue to 
engage with stakeholders, improve our asset utilization, and 
proactively be ahead of the curve. 
The global business scenario, including that of the steel 
industry, was dominated by geopolitical factors and economic 
uncertainties during 2022-23. Business activities were 
adversely impacted by several macro-economic challenges 
like a global energy crisis, infl ationary pressures, supply chain 
disruptions, interest rate hikes by central banks, and strict 
pandemic-related restrictions in China. The consequential 
outcomes of these adverse events had a signifi cant impact on 
the steel industry by way of a contraction of steel prices and 
volatility in raw material prices, almost throughout the year. 
However, the steel industry in India was able to meet these 
challenges by focusing on domestic consumption which was 
backed by Government expenditure on infrastructure and 
manufacturing. Besides being the second-largest producer 
of steel in the world, India’s domestic consumption has 
reached a level of 120 Million Tonnes, the second-highest in 
the World. 
With per capita steel production and consumption 
growing, the Indian steel industry is poised for 
growth envisaged in the National Steel Policy. We, at 
SAIL, are also planning to add capacity accordingly.
At this point, I would like to apprise you of the achievements 
of your Company for the Financial Year 2022-23. The 
pressures of several headwinds like logistic constraints, 
input raw material prices and availability, dull demand, and 
the imposition of export duty were countered by improved 
capacity utilization and optimization of resource utilization. 
Further, focusing on the improvement of operating practices 
and realigning customer demand to optimize the product 
mix helped mitigate risks arising from volatility in the market. 
All the Integrated Steel Plants achieved their best-ever 
production, leading to the best ever Crude Steel capacity 
utilization of about 94%.
On the production front, your Company achieved a 
record annual production performance by producing 
19.4 million tonnes (MT), 18.3 MT, and 17.2 MT of Hot 
Metal, Crude Steel, and Saleable Steel respectively 
during FY’23, registering growth of 4%, 5%, and 2% 
respectively over the previous best. 
In addition to this, your Company also achieved its yearly 
best performance in terms of Techno-economic parameters 
like Coke Rate, CDI Rate, and BF Productivity owing to better 
2022-23

capacity utilisation and optimisation of BF operations. The 
record production performance reflects the potential of the 
Company in the future.
To cater to the demand of the dynamic market, several 
new initiatives were undertaken across all the Plants with 
regard to process improvements, product development & 
commercialization, energy conservation, and automation. 
During the Financial Year 2022-23, new Steel Products that 
were developed are expected to strengthen the Country in 
strategic areas such as railway, infrastructure & construction, 
and defence. Some of the significant among them include 
High Strength Steel Plates for underwater applications; High 
Carbon Wire Rod in HC82B for railway sleepers and concrete 
electric poles; IS 2830C25HMn MAV55 grade semis for use in 
solar panels; High Strength, higher Coating Galvanized Coil 
IS 277 GP 350 + 450 GSM grade for Grain Silos; SAIL SeQR 
Fe550D TMT in 8mm to 20mm for the Retail segment; NPB 
600 in E410 BR grade for Defence; and HRC IS 11587 for 
Containers / Wagons. 
With the development of these grades, your 
Company’s journey for improving value-added 
products in the portfolio continues.
During the Financial Year 2022-23, your Company achieved 
Saleable Steel Sales Volume of around 16.21 million tonnes, 
registering a marginal growth over the previous year. The 
geopolitical conflict in Europe and its repercussions on global 
steel trade disrupted both supply and demand. This led to 
pressure on global prices and opportunities for dumping. 
Despite these unforeseen developments, SAIL was able 
to sustain the saleable steel Sales Volume achieved in the 
previous year. Further, continuing its efforts to explore new 
international markets, the company achieved its highest-ever 
export of 1.44 Lakh tonnes of various products to Europe. 
While your Company adopted a focused approach 
by improving its sales in domestic markets, entering 
new market segments for exports in efforts to 
improve price realization is an initiative expected to 
benefit us in the future.
The popularity of your Company’s branded products like “SAIL 
SeQR” for TMT bars has been continuously growing over the 
period. With sales of 5.6 lakh tonnes of “SAIL SeQR” TMT bars 
during FY’23 compared to 3.8 lakh tonnes in the previous 
year, a growth of about 47% was registered. In addition, 
the brand ‘NEX’ for Structural is also being promoted. With 
a view to facilitating the procurement of TMT bars for retail 
customers, an online portal “SAIL SURAKSHA” was launched 
with a tagline ‘’Ab Nishchint ho Jayein’’.
Your Company is continuously pursuing ways to reach 
the end consumer, while actively promoting steel usage 
in the Country. SAIL has a 2-Tier network for retail sales of 
construction steel and a 1-Tier network primarily for B2B 
sales to enhance its reach. To boost sales through the Retail 
Channel, the Company has established a strong network of 
more than 4,800 distributors and dealers across the Country 
as of 31st March, 2023.
To encourage the MSME segment in steel procurement, 
SAIL, under the "Mission Poorvodaya" programme of the 
Government of India, has launched an incentivization 
scheme, "Ispati Illakon ka Vikas – SAIL ke Saath," for MSMEs 
based in districts where its Integrated Steel Plants are located. 
Over 90,000 tonnes of various steel products were 
sold to these plant-based MSMEs during FY’23, 
marking a significant growth from the previous year.
Continuing its commitment to contribute to nation-building 
by catering to infrastructure projects and projects of national 
importance, SAIL supplied the entirety of DMR grade 
specialty steel for India's first indigenously built Aircraft 
Carrier, INS Vikrant. Commissioning this carrier signifies 
the country's confidence and self-reliance. Additionally, 
substantial quantities of steel were also supplied to notable 
projects such as the Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project 
(SLHEP) on the Assam-Arunachal border, the Crude Oil 
Import Terminal (COIT) at Paradip, and several key 
infrastructure developments across the Country.
Regarding raw materials, the total requirement of 
Iron Ore was met by your Company's captive mines, 
producing approximately 33.78 million tonnes (MT). 
While other inputs like coal and fluxes were partially sourced 
from captive sources amounting to 0.94 MT and 1.81 MT 
respectively, the shortfall in Coking Coal, due to the Country's 
low production in comparison to demand, necessitated 
imports.
For FY 2022-23, your Company surpassed a turnover 
of ` 1 lakh crore for the second consecutive year. 
With a turnover of ` 1.04 lakh crore during FY’23, which was 
1% higher than the previous year, the Company decided 
to reward its investors by declaring an interim dividend of 
10% of the face value during the year. Moreover, the Board 
of Directors has recommended an additional 5% for the final 
dividend.
Focusing on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) objectives 
as stipulated in the Companies Act, 2013, as well as DPE 
Guidelines, your Company prioritized areas of national 
importance such as Education, Health, Skills Development, 
and Women Empowerment. During FY’23, SAIL supported 
the entire Indian contingent of Special Olympics Bharat’s 
athletes at the Special Olympics World Summer Games, 
Berlin, 2023. 
Further, a focused effort was made to support 
Persons with Disabilities, by way of supplying 
wheel chairs and other assisted devices. In all, 
your Company has incurred an expenditure of over 
` 162 crore on CSR activities.
8
SAIL's contributions as a responsible corporate citizen have 
been acknowledged in various forums, earning accolades 
and awards. Among these, SAIL emerged as the topmost CPSE 
buyer on GeM for FY’22, and the Environment Management 
Division was honored with the Greentech Environment 
Award 2022.
Being environmentally conscious, all the Plants and Mines 
of your Company operate in harmony with the ecological 
balance, adhering to the Corporate Environmental Policy. This 
policy emphasizes compliance with environmental standards 
and encourages eff orts to exceed them. SAIL operates within 
established environmental parameters concerning air 
emissions, water discharge, and noise pollution. 
During 2022-23, more than 2.8 lakh saplings were 
planted, with over 21.82 million saplings planted 
across SAIL Plants and Mines to date.
Recognizing the importance of rehabilitating degraded 
ecosystems, an MOU was signed with the Institute of Forest 
Productivity, Ranchi, for eco-restoration of mined-out areas 
and waste dumps at Meghahatuburu Iron Ore Mines. This 
project will span over fi ve years, concluding in 2025-26, 
and to date, around 30,000 seedlings have been raised and 
maintained at a newly established nursery.
Your Company is transitioning to energy-effi  cient and 
durable LED lighting in line with the Government of India's 
"Unnat Jyoti by Aff ordable LEDs for All (UJALA) Scheme." 
Approximately 6.98 lakh LED lights have been installed 
across Company’s Plants and Units, and all future projects 
will exclusively use LED lighting systems.
Your Company is steadfastly committed to the highest 
standards of Corporate Governance, as underscored in 
its vision and credos. In this context, your Company's 
philosophy aims to ensure transparency, disclosures, and 
reporting that not only adhere to laws, regulations, and 
guidelines—including the Companies Act, 2013, SEBI (LODR) 
Regulations, 2015, and DPE guidelines—but also strive to 
exceed them. SAIL champions ethical conduct throughout 
the Organization, aiming primarily to enhance shareholders' 
value. This commitment is evident in the Company's policies, 
which emphasize transparency, accountability, disclosures, 
and reporting. Various forums have recognized your 
Company's diligent eff orts as a responsible corporate citizen 
and a partner in Nation Building, awarding it numerous 
accolades.
Your Company has undertaken numerous Digital 
Initiatives, ramping up its digital transformation and 
Industry 4.0 eff orts to bolster business performance 
and enhance the customer experience. 
To this end, we have launched an AI-based Chatbot named 
‘SAIL Sarathi’ to elevate customer engagement and service. 
This bot stands out as one of the most advanced in the steel 
industry.
Our eff orts have been consistently directed towards 
enhancing value for our stakeholders, ensuring we maintain 
our competitive edge in the steel industry. Looking ahead, 
we have pinpointed key areas of focus: Expansion of Capacity, 
Intensifying Digitisation, Enhancing Raw Material Quality and 
Securitisation, Decarbonisation, and Capacity Building of our 
employees. As we outline our growth trajectory and anticipate 
increased capacities in the forthcoming decade, we remain 
cognizant of the signifi cant shifts poised to redefi ne the steel 
industry, particularly in the realms of decarbonisation eff orts 
and green fuel adoption. Our initiatives to safeguard our raw 
material resources and elevate the quality of these materials 
will be pivotal as we augment our capacity. The push for 
digitisation will be crucial in enhancing the effi  ciency of 
our processes and services, positioning us at the forefront 
of our customers' considerations. We pride ourselves on 
our workforce, considering them a signifi cant asset, and are 
committed to equipping them for the future transformations 
within the steel industry.
In closing, I seize this moment to extend my heartfelt 
gratitude to all our Shareholders for their unwavering trust 
and support. I appreciate our esteemed Customers, reliable 
Suppliers, and the Governments at both the central and 
state levels. Special acknowledgment goes to our dedicated 
employees and contractual workers for their relentless 
commitment and enduring eff orts in moulding a robust and 
accountable organization. I extend particular thanks to the 
Ministry of Steel for their continuous guidance and support. 
To all our stakeholders who have played an instrumental role 
in fortifying this Company's foundation, making it resilient 
and sustainable, I express my sincere gratitude. I earnestly 
anticipate and value your continued support and best wishes.

Your Company achieved the best Sales Turnover of `1,03,768 
crore during the Financial Year (FY) 2022-23, which is higher 
by 1% as compared to corresponding period of last year 
(CPLY) mainly due to increase in Net Sales Realisation (NSR) 
of Saleable Steel of 5 Integrated Steel Plants and marginal 
increase in Sales Volume (2%). During the FY 2022-23, the 
decline in the profitability as compared to CPLY is on account 
of higher input cost perpetuated mainly by imported coal 
prices, increase in stores and spares consumption, repairs & 
maintenance expenses, increase in purchased power rates, 
conversion charges, security expenses, higher usage of raw 
materials like Iron ore, Limestone and other ferro-alloys, 
higher interest charges and depreciation and loss on account 
of foreign exchange fluctuation, etc. 
The decline in the profitability was offset partially by increase 
in production volume, improved NSR, lower salaries & wages, 
better techno-economic parameters viz. improvement in BF 
productivity and Coke Rate, lower imported coal in blend, 
etc., decrease in Royalty expenses, higher stock valuation 
rate, higher dividend income, etc.    
Your Company continued its thrust on judicious fund 
management with timely action for fund raising and 
repayment of loans including interest to meet its growth 
objectives. The Company had borrowings of ` 30,773 
crore as on 31st March, 2023 vis-a-vis ` 17,284 crore as on 
31st March, 2022 (INDAS). The debt equity ratio of the 
Company as on 31st March, 2023 has increased to 0.59:1 
from 0.33:1 as on 31st March, 2022 primarily due to increase 
in borrowings during the FY 2022-23. The net worth of the 
Company increased to ` 52,139 crore as on 31st March, 2023 
from ` 52,017 crore as on 31st March, 2022.
Interim Dividend of 10% i.e. ` 1.00 per equity share was 
paid during the FY 2022-23. The Board of Directors of your 
Company has further recommended a Final Dividend of 
` 0.50 per equity share, subject to approval of Members in 
the ensuing Annual General Meeting of the Company, i.e. 
total dividend for FY 2022-23 being 15% on equity share 
capital of the Company. No amount has been transferred to 
general reserve during the year under review.

B.  OPERATIONS REVIEW
Safety
Your Company is committed to the safety of its employees 
and the people associated with it, including those living 
in the neighborhood of its Plants, Mines and Units. SAIL 
Safety Organization (SSO) centrally monitors and guides 
the Safety Promotional and Fire prevention activities 
undertaken at different Steel Plants/Units/Mines/Stockyards. 
SSO formulates and prepares appropriate Safety Policies, 
Procedures, Systems, Action Plans, Guidelines, etc. and 
follows up for their implementation, and thereby, helps in 
providing Accident-free Work Environment. Plants are ISO-
45001 certified, which is an advanced Safety Management 
System and as a compliance to this, Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment (HIRA) has been conducted for most of 
operation & maintenance activities and appropriate control 
measures have been formulated and implemented to either 
eliminate the risk or bring it to acceptable limits.
BOARD’S REPORT
28
Safety aspects have been incorporated in Standard 
Operating & Maintenance Procedures (SOPs & SMPs) which 
helps in integrating safety with operations and maintaining 
necessary technological discipline. System of conducting 
safety audits and inspections is in vogue and observations, 
if any, are complied with at the earliest. As a new initiative, 
theme based Safety Audits are being conducted with the 
help of Industry experts. Prioritising safety foremost, the 
Company has engaged Safety Management Consultant for 
Safety Culture Transformation, at its Plants in Bhilai, Bokaro, 
Rourkela and Durgapur and Burnpur. Relentless eff orts 
are also being made by Plants and SSO for competence 
building in the area of Safety Management through regular 
HRD interventions, LEO workshops, webinars, etc., in-house 
as well as through external experts, on areas of concern 
covering Heads of Shops, Line Managers, Safety Personnel 
and Trade Union leaders. System of imparting safety training 
at induction and on-the-job trainings to contract workers 
prior to start of jobs, exists in all the Plants and Units. 
SSO has recently launched many new initiatives to reach 
the lowest strata of the Company. A new initiative called 
‘Suraksha Manthan’ for achieving Zero Fatality, with the 
participation of Heads of Safety of all Plants/Units, where 
learnings from incidents/ Near Miss cases, good safety 
practices across Plants/Units are discussed and followed up 
for its implementation. A safety interaction module named 
‘Sampark’ has been launched for sensitizing diff erent working 
levels of Plants i.e. HODs, Shift in-charges and Departmental 
Safety Offi  cers. In the beginning of every training programme 
at Management Training Institute (MTI), the participants are 
sensitized on the importance of safety through a customized 
module titled ‘Sparsh’.
Benefi ts of technology are leveraged by extensive utilization 
of IT in the area of Safety Management, by way of web portals 
for sharing important information, safety suggestions, etc. 
Good Safety Practices prevailing in the Plants & Units and 
other industries are captured and circulated among all for 
horizontal deployment, knowledge sharing and bringing 
improvement. A multi-disciplinary Safety Engineering 
Department exists in each of the Steel Plants and Mines to 
look into their safety needs. The emphasis is on Systematic 
Approach to Safety Management. SSO is also managing 
the secretariat of the Joint Committee on Safety, Health & 
Environment in the Steel Industry (JCSSI), a bipartite forum 
which addresses Safety, Health & Environment issues of the 
Steel Plants with active involvement of Management and 
Central & Plant level trade unions and provides guidelines to 
the member organizations. Acknowledging the importance 
of Safety, the activities and measures undertaken are 
reviewed at the highest level by the Board Sub Committee 
on Health, Safety & Environment.
Operations
The FY 2022-23 has been largely a year of mixed sentiments 
and performances for the domestic steel industry. The impact 
of the Russia-Ukraine confl ict was felt across the global steel 
industry. The infl ationary pressures due to supply chain 
bottlenecks in the post Covid world resulted in shooting 
up of fuel prices. Coal prices and raw materials cost put 
extreme pressure on margins. Also during second quarter, 
the reduced availability of rakes at ports severely hampered 
supply of coking coal to the Steel Plants of SAIL.

Power
Your Company has always strived to maximize its captive 
power usage in view of reliability of power supply as well as 
availability of power at lower cost vis-a-vis the grid power. 
During the FY 2022-23, about 63% of the total requirement 
of 1393 MW was met from the Captive Power Plants. This is 
signifi cant in view of the coal shortages faced by captive 
power plants from April to October, 2022 due to national 
priority being accorded to Independent Power Producers 
over Captive Power Producers and other logistics issues. 
With an objective to optimize the cost, SAIL has been 
actively procuring power through open access route since 
such opportunity was introduced in Electricity Act, 2003. 
Continuing the legacy, this year too, SAIL Plants procured 
about 321 Million Units (MUs) of power through Open Access 
route which also included Green (renewable) power procured 
through Short Term Open Access. A major contributor to 
Green Open Access Power was 55.10 MUs of bagasse-based 
power from Rajshree Sugar Mills, Coimbatore through 
Power Exchange for Salem Steel Plant during the sugarcane 
crushing season. Your company was able to save about Rs.44 
crore in the FY 2022-23 by procuring cheaper power through 
Open Access route as compared to Grid Utility power.

With the objective of enhancing the share of captive power 
and ensuring supply of reliable power at optimum cost, the 
new captive power facility of 250 MW at Rourkela Steel Plant 
had been commissioned in March, 2022. Further, the fi rst 20 
MW Unit of New Captive Power facility of (2x20) MW capacity 
at Durgapur Steel Plant by NTPC-SAIL Power Company Limited 
(NSPCL), a Joint Venture Company of SAIL & NTPC Ltd., was 
commissioned on 30th September, 2022. In this regard, the 
second 20 MW Unit is expected to be commissioned by H1 
of the FY 2023-24. While, the New Power & Blowing Stations 
(PBSs) at Integrated Steel Plants at Bhilai, Rourkela and 
Burnpur are cogeneration Plants that run entirely on process 
gases (Blast Furnace & Coke Ovens gases), generating 8.43% 
of total power requirement of your Company, the old Captive 
Power Plants / Power Blowing Stations at Bhilai, Rourkela, 
and Durgapur also utilize the process gases to the maximum, 
using minimal amounts of coal. In addition to this, process 
gases are also provided to NSPCL and Bokaro Power Supply 
Co. Ltd. (a JV of SAIL and DVC) for substituting coal as a fuel 
to the optimum level feasible vis-à-vis operational effi  ciency.
Your Company has always been focussed on its approach 
towards achieving better performance parameters with 
respect to usage of power purchased from utilities and 
capitalizing to maximize the rebates and incentives available 
in the power tariff  for achieving higher load factor, power 
factor, etc. During the FY 2022-23, ` 170 crore was received 
as incentives and rebate in the power tariff  from grid utilities. 
It may be mentioned here that most of the grid utilities raised 
their power tariff  during the year. Further, import of coal 
as per Government guidelines by DVC (grid utility for SAIL 
Plants / Mines in West Bengal and Jharkhand) and NSPCL (for 
Power Plant-3, Bhilai) also led to increase in power tariff .
Besides above, optimization of electricity consumption in 
various steel making processes is a major thrust areas of 
SAIL Plants for lowering the power consumption per tonne 
of production of saleable steel. As a responsible corporate 
house, your Company has given adequate emphasis on 
development and usage of renewable power sources with 
focussed approach on Roof Top Solar (RTS) Power Plants. A 
capacity of 6.342 MWp of Roof Top Solar power plants has 
already been installed across SAIL Plants and Units. Further, 
installation of 4 MWp fl oating solar plant at ISP and 7.11 
MWp capacity rooftop solar plants at various Plants/ Units of 
the Company across the Country is in progress. Besides this, 
installation of 60 MWp capacity fl oating solar plants over 
cooling ponds is envisaged at Plants of the Company. This 
along with renewable bagasse-based power being procured 
for Salem Steel Plant and the proposed 10 MW Small Hydro 
Electric Plant over Mandira Dam, Rourkela in Joint venture 
with Green Energy Development Corporation of Odisha 
Ltd. (GEDCOL) are progressively enhancing your Company’s 
green footprint.
Raw Materials
During the FY 2022-23, total requirement of iron ore was 
met from the captive sources. Your Company’s captive 
mines produced about 33.78 million tonnes (MT) of iron ore. 
However, in case of clean coking coal, out of total requirement, 
about 2.3 MT was met from indigenous sources (Coal India 
Limited & captive sources) and for the balance requirement 
of coking coal (14.02 MT), the Company had to depend on 
imports due to constraint in availability of required quality, 
within the Country. In the FY 2022-23, production from the 
captive collieries of the Company was about 0.94 MT, out 
of which 0.37 MT was raw coking coal and balance 0.57 
32
MT was non-coking coal. In case of fl uxes, around 1.36 MT 
of limestone and 0.45 MT of dolomite were produced from 
captive sources. For thermal coal, your Company depends 
entirely on purchases from Coal India Limited except for 
small quantity produced from the captive mines.
Selling of Iron Ore from Captive Mines in Open Market
About 0.58 MT of iron ore was made available in the open 
market from the Mines in the States of Odisha. Further, 
approval from Jharkhand State Government for selling of 
iron ore in the open market is still awaited.

Sales & Marketing
During the Financial Year (FY) 2022-23, your Company 
achieved Saleable Steel sales volume of around 16.21 
million tonnes (MT), registering a growth of about 0.4% over 
previous year. With Home Sales of 15.04 MT for Mild Steel, 
there has been a growth of about 8.3% over FY 2021-22. While 
the overall exports declined over FY 2021-22, the Company 
was able to achieve highest ever exports of about 1.44 lakh 
tonnes of various products to Europe during FY 2022-23.
During the FY 2022-23, the Global Steel business scenario 
has been under pressure from the impact of the Russia-
Ukraine confl ict and its multi-fold repercussions (from raw 
material supply to logistics to insecurities in trade and the 
impact of sanctions) as also, the signifi cant rise in Covid-19 
cases in China during FY 2022-23, which went on to impact 
both supply and demand.
The domestic steel business witnessed rising cost of 
production during the beginning of FY 2022-23, resulting in 
increase in steel prices. Higher International price level for 
various steel products during initial months of Q1 helped 
in boosting domestic price sentiments. However, Global 
Steel prices remained mostly south-bound thereafter. 
Lower Exports and lower international prices resulted in 
higher domestic availability, which in turn kept domestic 
prices under pressure during major part of the year. The 
Company adopted focused approach for improving its sales 
in domestic markets by entering new market segments, 
optimizing inventory levels and making eff orts to improve 
price realization in a highly competitive scenario.
Your Company has been fulfi lling the entire demand of steel 
tracks from Indian Railways for decades. A total of 11.70 
lakh tonnes of Rails were supplied to Indian Railways in 
FY 2022-23, the 260m long-rail welded-panel component in 
the total Rail supply being about 80%, which is highest ever 
and registered a growth of 35% over the previous year. It 
may be mentioned that 100% of the 60 kg Rail supplied to 
Railways during FY 2022-23 comprised the newly developed 
R-260 grade in 60E-1 profi le. In addition to this, various 
technological developments, including installation of new 
fl ash butt welding machine at Rail & Structural Mill, Bhilai 
Steel Plant have been carried out to improve the supply 
component of Long Rail panels, as per demand from Indian 
Railways.  Production of End forged Asymmetrical Rails and

Townships developed by SAIL have the best of medical, 
education and civic facilities and are like an oasis for 
the local Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other 
population who share the benefits of prosperity and 
development along with SAIL employees.
	•
Recruitment of non-executive employees, around 83% of 
the total employees, is carried out mainly on regional level 
and hence, a large number of SCs/STs and other weaker 
section of the society get the benefit of employment in 
SAIL.
	•
Over the years, a large group of ancillary industries have 
also developed in the vicinity of Steel Plants. This has 
created opportunities for local unemployed persons for 
jobs and development of entrepreneurship.
	•
For jobs of temporary & intermittent nature, generally 
contractors are engaged for executing job contracts 
wherein they deploy workmen from the local areas, 
which again provides an opportunity for employment of 
local candidates from economically weaker section.
	•
ur Company has undertaken several initiatives for the 
socio-economic development of SCs/STs and other 
weaker sections of the society which are mainly as under:
	•
 Special Schools have been started exclusively for poor, 
underprivileged children at five Integrated Steel Plant 
locations. The facilities provided include free education, 
mid-day meals, uniforms including shoes, text books, 
stationery items, school bags, water bottles and 
transportation in some cases.
	•
No tuition fee is charged from SC/ST students studying 
in the Company run schools, whether they are SAIL 
employees’ wards or non-employees’ wards.
	•
Free medical health centres have been set up at Bhilai, 
Durgapur, Rourkela, Bokaro and Burnpur (Gutgutpara) 
providing free medical consultation, medicines, etc. to 
the peripheral population mainly comprising of SC/ST 
and weaker sections of society.
	•
SAIL Plants have adopted tribal children. They are being 
provided free education, uniforms, text books, stationery, 
meals, boarding, lodging and medical facilities for their 
overall growth at residential hostels, Saranda Suvan 
Chhatravas, Gyanodaya Hostel and an exclusive Gyan 
Jyoti Yojana for the nearly extinct Birhor Tribe.
38
For Skill Development and better employability, tribal school 
pass-outs have been sponsored for coaching in premier 
institutes for IIT/JEE entrance examinations and for trainings 
along with monthly stipend, accommodation, transportation 
and food facility at various ITIs, Nursing and other vocational 
training institutes.

Plantation
Your Company realizes the role of plantation in overall 
environmental management initiatives. It is a well-known 
fact that plants play an important role in balancing the 
ecosystem and function as a carbon sink. Such plantations 
are established to foster native species and promote forest 
regeneration on degraded lands as a tool of environmental 
restoration. The greenery developed by afforestation adds to 
the aesthetic environment, which becomes dust and noise 
barriers and also a natural sink/absorber of CO2. Keeping the 
enormous contribution of the plants in mind, SAIL has long 
been adopting extensive afforestation program religiously 
in its Plants and Mines since its nascent stage. Giving special 
thrust for plantation, more than 2.8 lakhs of saplings have been 
planted during 2022-23. More than 21.82 million saplings have 
been planted across SAIL Plants and Mines till date.
F.  STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF THE COMPANY
Your Company has adopted a multi-pronged approach that 
includes organic growth, brown-field projects, technology 
leadership through strategic alliances, ensuring raw material 
security by developing new mines, diversifying in allied areas, 
etc. In line with the above approach, SAIL has formed Joint 
Venture Companies in different areas viz. power generation, 
rail wagon manufacturing, slag cement production, securing 
coking coal supplies from new overseas sources, etc.
Disinvestment of SAIL Plants
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its 
meeting held on 27th October, 2016 had accorded ‘in principle’ 
approval for strategic disinvestment of three units of Steel 
Authority of India Limited (SAIL) viz. Visveswaraya Iron & 
Steel Plant (VISP), Bhadravati, Karnataka, Salem Steel Plant 
(SSP), Tamil Nadu and Alloy Steels Plant (ASP), Durgapur, 
West Bengal.
Expression of Interest (EOI) of ASP, SSP and VISP was issued on 
4th July, 2019. EOI bids were opened on 10th September, 2020 
and the eligible bidders  of VISP and SSP were shortlisted. In 
case of ASP, no EOI was received. The Confidential Information 
Memorandum (CIM), Request for Proposal (RFP) and Business 
Transfer Agreement (BTA) were issued to the shortlisted 
bidders of SSP and VISP. 
After two unsuccessful attempts of disinvestment of ASP 
through EOI,  DIPAM has requested Ministry of Steel to 
examine the  issue.
Meanwhile, SAIL is preparing viable options for upgradation/
modernization of ASP.
DIPAM has informed SAIL that it has been decided that the 
existing EOI of VISP be annulled and the process for closure 
of VISP be initiated. SAIL Board has in-principle approved the 
closure of VISP, in its meeting held on 16th January, 2023. 
In case of SSP, as per the revised timelines, non-financial 
bid and financial bid are to be submitted physically to the 
Transaction Advisor by 21st November, 2023.

Most of SAIL Plants/Units are certified to ISO 9000, ISO 14000, 
ISO 45000, SA 8000, ISO 50000 and ISO 27000 Management 
Systems. Empanelment of Certification Agencies has led to 
various benefits, significant among them being Reduction 
in Audit Man-Days, Single Certification Agency for all 
Management Systems of a Plant/Unit, Ease of Operation 
in engaging Certification Agencies, Improved Quality of 
Audits, and Reduced administrative hassles. For new cycle

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a strategic business 
discipline that supports the organization’s objectives by 
addressing its risks and managing the impact of these 
risks. It is the practice of planning, coordinating, executing 
and handling the activities of an organization in order to 
minimize the impact of risk on investment, earnings and also 
strategic, financial and operational risks.
The Enterprise Risk Management Policy of your Company 
was approved by the Board much before the same became 
a statutory requirement and since then, risk management 
in SAIL has grown and developed in line with internal 
and external business and economic changes. The Policy 
provides guidance for the management towards business 
risks across the Organisation. It focuses on ensuring that the 
risks are identified, evaluated and mitigated within a given 
time frame on a regular basis.
Currently, the architecture of Enterprise Risk Management in 
SAIL comprises a well-designed multi-layered organization 
structure, with each Plant/Unit having its own perceived 
Risks which are under constant monitoring by the Risk 
Owners / Risk Champions who frame and implement the 
mitigation strategy and take it to its logical conclusion. Risk 
Management Committee of the Plant/Unit Chaired by the 
Head of the Plant /Unit periodically reviews the risks and its 
mitigation status and reports the same to Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO) of SAIL. SAIL Risk Management Committee (SRMC) 
oversees the Risk Management function in the Company 
by addressing issues pertaining to the policy formulation 
as well as evaluation of risk management function to 
assess its continuing effectiveness. Risks identified by 
the Risk Champion/Risk Officer are deliberated in the 
Risk Management Committee and strategy for mitigating 
such risks is formulated. Roles and responsibility of Board, 
Audit Committee, SAIL Risk Management Committee, Risk 
Management Steering Committee, CRO, Risk Officer/Risk 
Champion related to risk management are defined under 
the Policy and duly approved by the Board. The Enterprise 
Risk Management Policy of your Company is uploaded on its 
website https://sail.co.in/company/company-policies.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
In terms of the Regulation 34(2)(e) of SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, 
the Management of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) 
presents its Analysis Report covering the performance and 
outlook of the Company.
A. INDUSTRY STRUCTURE & DEVELOPMENTS
World Economic Environment
The Financial Year (FY) 2022-23 has been a challenging year. 
During the start of the FY 2022-23, restrictions related to 
the Omicron variant were beginning to ease in Europe and 
elsewhere. However, the start of  Russia-Ukraine conflict in 
February, 2022 exacerbated the global economic situation, 
especially in Europe. A  surge in energy prices, linked to 
Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, drove inflation to 
record highs. US economy was also affected by high inflation, 
with inflation climbing to a 40-year-high in US and UK. In 
the meantime, more central banks around the world raised 
interest rates to combat inflation, with  US Fed successively 
increased the interest rates, which stood at 5 – 5.25% by the 
end of July, 2023.
Chinese economy saw the industrial output and consumer 
spending getting affected by the surge in Covid cases and 
Chinese Government’s Zero Covid policy. China’s GDP in Q2 of 
FY 2022-23 grew by just 0.4% (y-o-y), due to Covid lockdowns. 
The economy of China was also affected by the slump in its 
real estate industry, a key economic contributor with banks 
having exposure in the real estate of about US$ 9 trn. Further, 
real estate prices and sales in China slumped for many months 
in a row, as consumer confidence weakened.
The economy of China showed signs of recovery after Beijing 
rolled out economic stimulus measures and economic packages 
to revive the real estate sector. After a wave of protests, Chinese 
Government abruptly ended its Zero Covid lockdown policy at 
the end of Calendar Year (CY) 2022, which gave a major impetus 
to industrial production and consumer spending. 
In fact, during H1 of FY’22-23, all three of the world’s major 
economic engines- the US, Europe and China struggled. While 
China struggled controlling its unsustainable Zero-Covid-19 
policy, property market slump and host of internal financial 
imbalances, high inflation battered US and Europe. There were 
major worries that Euro Zone economies may slip into recession.
However, all the major economic power centres avoided 
recession in CY 2022. US economy grew by moderate 2.1% in 
2022, though it had contracted in 2 out of 4 quarters. Europe 
managed to register a good show by registering a 3.5% 
growth in 2022. China’s economy expanded by 3.0% in 2022, 
as compared to 8.4% in the preceding year.
In Q2’23 (April to June), US economy defied expectations and 
surprisingly accelerated to a 2.4% annual growth rate, while 
economists had been warning of a potential slowdown. The 
Euro Area economy is also growing again. GDP across the 20 
countries that share the Euro currency rose by 0.3% in the 
Q2’23 over the previous three months. China’s GDP grew by 
weaker than expected rate of 6.3% y-o-y in Q2, hit by sluggish 
consumption, crisis in real estate and worries over deflation. 
As per IMF’s latest report of July’23, global growth is projected 
to fall from an estimated 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0%, in both 2023 
and 2024. The rise in central bank policy rates to counter 
inflation continues to weigh on economic activity. The recent 
resolution of the US debt ceiling standoff and earlier this year, 
strong action by authorities to contain turbulence in US and 
Swiss banking, reduced the immediate risks of financial sector 
turmoil. This has moderated adverse risks to the outlook. 
However, the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted 
to the downside. Inflation could remain high and even rise if 
further shocks occur, including those from an intensification 
of the conflict in Ukraine and extreme weather-related events, 
triggering more restrictive monetary policy.
The fight against inflation continues. Inflation is easing in 
most countries but remains high, with divergences across 
economies and counter measures. Following the build-up of 
gas inventories in Europe and weaker-than-expected demand 
in China, energy and food prices have dropped substantially 
from their 2022 peaks, although food prices remain elevated. 
Together with the normalization of supply chains, these 
developments have contributed to a rapid decline in headline 
inflation in most countries. In response to the persistence of 
core inflation, major central banks have communicated that 
they may need to tighten monetary policy further. While 
the Federal Reserve paused rate hikes at its June meeting 
but signalled further ones ahead, and the Reserve Bank of 
Australia, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and European 
Central Bank have continued to raise rates. In China, where 
inflation is well below target, the central bank recently cut 
policy interest rates to support the stressed economy. The 
Bank of Japan has kept interest rates near zero under the 
quantitative and qualitative monetary easing.
US Dollar saw a major surge against major global currencies 
during the FY 2022-23, hitting levels not seen in the last 
two decades. Tired of a too-strong and newly weaponized 
US Dollar, some of the world’s biggest economies explored 
ways to circumvent the US currency, which may result in 
the eventual weakening of US Dollar. Overview of World

ANNUAL REPORT

Indian Economic Environment
India’s GDP grew by 7.2% in FY’22-23 as against 9.1% 
expansion (over Covid-19 affected base of FY 2020-21) in the 
previous fiscal. Despite the rate of GDP growth coming at 
a slightly lower rate than the previous year, India remained 
one of the fastest growing economies among major global 
countries. The GDP growth for FY’22-23 at 7.2% was higher 
than the 7% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey as well 
as the Govt. forecast made three months ago. RBI successively 
raised Repo rates from a level of 4.0% in April, 2022 to 6.5% in 
April, 2023 to contain the shooting inflation rate (CPI), which 
had reached eight year high of 7.8% in April, 2022. However, 
the same came down subsequently to 4.8% in June, 2023.
GDP Growth % at Constant Prices
Growth in Index of Industrial Production in the FY 2022-23 was 
5.1% as compared to 11.4% in the previous year. Growth in 
Manufacturing, Capital Goods and Consumer Durables sectors 
in FY 2022-23 was 4.5%, 12.9% and 0.5% respectively, as 
compared to 11.8%, 16.9% and 12.5%  in the preceding year.  
Growth in Industrial Sector
India’s merchandise exports faced tough conditions in FY 
2022-23, due to strong global headwinds and slowdown in 
major advanced economies. The merchandise exports in FY 
2022-23 rose to US$ 447.46 bn., up by just 6.0% over last year. 
Merchandise trade deficit during the year was US$ 266.78 bn. 
due to rising imports, especially of coal, oil and gas. However,

due to good performance of Services sector, overall trade 
deficit during FY 2022-23 was US$ 122 bn. 
Indian Rupee plunged to a new lifetime low of ` 83.0/US$ 
on 19th October, 2022, on account of US Fed rate hikes and 
India’s widening trade deficit. However, it later recovered to 
an extent. Indian Rupee is now going Global as 18 countries 
have agreed to trade in Indian Rupee. 
Government of India assessing the challenging global 
economic environment has been providing strong impetus 
on infrastructure development and has increased the outlay 
for capital investment in the Union Budget for FY 2023-24 by 
whopping 33% to ` 10 lakh crore, which would be around 
3.3% of GDP. 
Industry leaders have expressed confidence in the resilience 
of  Indian economy. Amidst all the gloom enveloping the 
advanced economies, India has emerged as an island of hope 
for global investors, as its strong domestic demand rebounds 
after a pandemic-induced slowdown.  
The automobile sector is considered to be a strong indicator 
of the prevailing economic scenario. India’s total automobile 
sales in the FY 2022-23, as per Federation of Automobile 
Dealers Associations (FADA), witnessed a double-digit growth 
of 21%, at 2.21 crore nos. (approx.), wherein, all categories, 
except tractors saw a double-digit growth. Tractors sales, 
meanwhile, grew by only 8%.
Impact of Ukraine War on Indian Economy
Disruptions to major trade routes, Russia and Ukraine, along 
with subsequent sanctions imposed on Russia by different 
economies, the FY 2022-23 had a major impact on global 
supply chains. As a result, oil prices surged to record highs, 
which in turn pushed inflation. In fact, global inflation was 
surging since 2021. The war only accelerated the crisis. The 
spillover effect fell upon India as well. 
In April, 2022, two months after the war started, India’s retail 
inflation jumped to 8 year high of 7.79%. With inflation soaring 
to record highs, RBI moved in line with US Fed Reserve and 
started raising key lending rates, thereby, affecting people 
already suffering under high inflation.  However, imports 
of crude oil from Russia increased due to discounts offered 
by Russia, which helped in curbing inflation.  With Europe 
suffering the most from impacts of Ukraine war and being 
one of the key export markets, India’s exports suffered. India’s 
merchandise exports in April-July, 2023 were US$ 136.22 bn., 
down by 14.5% over same period last year. 
As the central banks globally hiked interest rates, foreign 
investors pulled out from Indian equity and debt market. High 
crude oil prices also affected the Indian Rupee. As a result, 
Indian Rupee decelerated more sharply and depreciated to 
` 83/US$ in August, 2023 from ` 75/US$ at the beginning 
of war. 
World Steel 
Global Crude Steel production during CY 2022 stood at 
1878.5 MT, down by 4.2%, over CY 2021. China’s Crude Steel 
production was lower by 2.1% to 1,013 MT due to Covid 
related lockdowns. India and Iran were the only two major 
steel producing countries which showed positive growth in 
steel production in 2022. China produced 53.9% of world 
Crude Steel in 2022.
Annual Crude Steel Production (MT) 
In CY 2022, Finished Steel demand at 1781.5 MT was down 
by 3.2% over the previous year. As per WSA, recovery 
momentum after the pandemic shock was hampered by high 
inflation and increasing interest rates, Russia-Ukraine War and 
lockdowns in China. As a result, steel-using sectors’ activities 
went down in the last quarter of 2022. This, combined with 
the effect of stock adjustments, led to worse than expected 
contraction in steel demand.
Following the initial frenzy over Russia-Ukraine war which 
started in February, 2022, world steel prices started coming 
down from March, 2022, on low demand, high stocks, 
worsening inflation, worsening property crisis in China and 
sufficient steel supplies.  
US and European steel producers resorted to idling of steel 
mills due to steady fall in steel prices, increasing levels of 
imports and increasing energy prices. However, worldwide 
prices started rising from December, 2022, but started 
coming down again from March, 2023 due to poor demand, 
rising steel supplies and falling raw material prices. China’s 
domestic steel prices are affected by wobbly economic 
recovery and poor real estate demand. Several Chinese 
steel mills have received instructions from the Government 
of China to cap this year’s output at the same level as 2022, 
which has supported prices. 
China’s rising steel exports are a cause of worry, which were 
8.35 MT in May, 2023. These exports are supported by weaker 
Yuan and poor domestic demand.

Japanese and Korean steel companies are planning to set up 
EAF based steel production facilities to reduce CO2 emissions. 
China also plans to raise the proportion of EAF steel to 20% 
by 2030 from 11% in 2021.  Further, many European steel 
2022-23

producers  have started to set up Green Hydrogen based DRI 
production facilities, to be used in EAF to produce steel and 
various European Governments are providing financial aid 
for setting up of  such facilities. In USA, few companies have 
been successful in using innovative methods to produce 
iron from iron ore using electricity. EU plans to set up an 
EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 
1st October, 2023, to fight climate change and prevent carbon 
leakage. Under this framework, taxes would be imposed from 
the year 2026 on embedded carbon imports from six sectors, 
including steel.
Outlook for Steel Industry
The recovery momentum of world economy after the 
pandemic has been affected mainly by China’s economic 
deceleration, persisting inflation, monetary tightening by US 
and continued supply disruptions due to on-going Russia-
Ukraine war. The World Steel Association (WSA) has forecast 
2.3% growth in steel demand reaching to 1,822.3 MT in 2023 
and shall see a further demand growth of 1.7% in 2024 to 
reach a level of 1,854.0 MT. Manufacturing is expected to lead 
the recovery, but high interest rates will continue to weigh 
on steel demand. In 2024, growth is expected to accelerate 
in most regions, but deceleration is expected in China due 
to its anticipated 0% growth, overshadowing the improved 
demand in the rest of the world. However, persistent inflation 
and high-interest rates in most economies will limit the 
recovery of steel demand in 2023, despite positive factors 
like China’s reopening, Europe’s resilience in the face of the 
energy crisis and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. 
As China’s population declines and moves to consumption-
driven growth, its contribution to global steel demand 
growth will lessen. Future global steel demand growth will 
rely on reduced drivers, primarily concentrated in Asia. 
Investments in decarbonisation and dynamic emerging 
economies will increasingly drive positive momentum for 
global steel demand, even as China’s contribution to global 
growth diminishes.
Indian Steel Scenario
As per World Steel Association’s April, 2023 Short Range 
Outlook, after growth of 8.2% in 2022, India’s Finished Steel 
Consumption is expected to show healthy growth of 7.3% 
and 6.2% in 2023 and 2024 respectively. India remained 
a bright spot in the Global Steel Industry in 2022. Having 
managed inflation well, the Indian economy is on a healthy 
growth track, with a rising share of investment in GDP, 
supplemented thanks to strong Government spending 
on infrastructure. The Real Estate sector is also expected 
to grow, backed by affordable housing projects and urban 
demand. Private investment is improving on the back of the 
Production Linked Investment (PLI) Schemes. 
Following the initial spurt in domestic steel prices, due to 
onset of Ukraine war in February, 2022, prices started coming 
down from April, 2022 onwards, to mirror falling international 
steel prices and weakening raw material prices. Imposition 
of Export Duties on Finished Steel by the Government of 
India in May, 2022, further accelerated the price decline. 
Consequently, in November, 2022, India’s Finished Steel 
Exports were only 0.34 MT, down by 53.1% over the previous 
year.  As a result, many Indian mills opted for maintenance 
shutdowns due to non-remunerative steel prices. Such 
curtailed exports and falling steel prices, lead to the 
domestic steel majors recording huge financial losses in Q3 
of FY 2022-23. However, domestic steel prices started rising 
from December onwards, supported by rising international 
steel prices and better performance by domestic end-user 
industries. 
While Indian Finished Steel Exports during the Financial 
Year 2022-23 were 6.71 MT, down by 50.2% as compared to 
previous financial year, Imports were up by 29.0% to 6.02 
MT. India’s Finished Steel Consumption during the year was 
119.17 MT, up by 12.7% as compared to CPLY. Meanwhile 
domestic steel producers stayed on course to expand their 
production capacities. 
To promote production of Specialty Steel in India, the 
Ministry of Steel signed 57 MoUs with 27 companies under 
the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which is 
expected to generate an investment of about ` 30,000 crore 
and create additional capacity of about 25 MT of specialty 
steel in next five years.
In view of the rising concerns worldwide over the technology 
in use, Government of India has also started promoting 
Green Steel.  The Centre plans to support Green Hydrogen 
based DRI projects as well as push primary steel producers to 
increase use of scrap in steel production.
B.  RISKS AND CONCERNS
	•
Impact of MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 on Non- 
operational Mining Leases
The Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment 
Act (The Act) which came into force on 28th March, 2021, 
inter-alia, that provides in case the holder of a mining lease 
fails to undertake production and dispatch within a period of 
two years after the execution of mining lease or discontinues 
the production and dispatch for a period of two years, the 
lease shall lapse on the expiry of the period of two years from 
the date of execution of mining lease or discontinuance of 
the production and dispatch, as the case may be. On account 
of likely impact of the Act on non-operational mining leases 
of SAIL and its subsidiary company, the matter was taken up 
with the Ministry of Steel for expediting early executions of 
the mining leases of the Company on or before March, 2022. 
On intervention of the Ministry of Steel, required applications 
were submitted for each non-operational mining lease with 
the respective State Governments in March/April, 2022. 
During FY 2022-23, 6.9 Sq Mile of Bolani Mines was made 
operational on 16th March, 2023 with the commencement 
of Manganese mining operations. The lease period of the 
two non-operational iron ore mining leases of Kalta Iron Ore 
Mines has been extended by the Odisha Government and 
their supplementary lease deed will be executed on grant 
of statutory clearances. In the matter of non–operational 
Kalwar–Nagur Iron Ore mining lease of BSP,  the Ministry of 
Mines, vide order dated 7th March, 2023  has directed the 
Government of Chhattisgarh to extend the mining lease 
of Kalwar Mines up to 31st March, 2025 for starting the 
production and dispatch from the Mine, for which efforts are 
being made.
	•
Impact on Chiria Iron Ore Leases being in No-Mining 
Zone
Chiria Mine leases (except already broken up area in 
Dhobil lease) have been proposed to be “No Mining Zone” 
58
in Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) in 
Saranda forest, approved by MoEFCC. Out of the available 
iron ore resource of about 3.7 billion tonnes (BT) with SAIL, 
about 42% i.e. 1.6 BT is available at a single location viz. the 
Chiria Mine in Saranda forest in Jharkhand, which is not only 
critical for raw material security for future expansion but will 
also be required to meet iron ore requirement of currently 
operating facilities, in view of depleting resources at SAIL’s 
other operating mines. On intervention of the Ministry 
of Steel in July, 2022 to allow mining in already broken up 
area of the Chiria leases which have been with SAIL for a 
long time, along with resumption of Reassessment Study on 
MPSM to be carried out concurrently, MoEFCC intimated that 
there is no need for any Reassessment Study, and the same 
was informed to the Department for Promotion of Industry 
and Trade (DPIIT). DPIIT, in February, 2023 has advised the 
Ministry of Steel to take up the matter at an appropriate 
inter-ministerial forum.
	•
Revocation of the Prospecting License (PL) Grant Order 
for Thakurani Block-A by the Government of Odisha 
Government of Odisha vide order dated 19th September, 2022 
while invoking the MMDR Amendment Act, 2021, declared 
the Gazette Notification dated 4th February, 2004 as lapsed 
and revoked the Prospecting License (PL) Grant Order dated 
24th February, 2021 for iron ore over an area of 268.221 ha in 
Thakurani Mine. The matter was taken up in November, 2022 
with the Government of Odisha for grant of a composite 
license including the mining lease. However, due to delay 
in getting the response, a writ petition was filed before the 
Hon’ble High Court of Orissa for directing the Government 
of Odisha to consider the application. Subsequently, the 
Hon’ble High Court of Orissa vide Order dated 17th March, 
2023 directed the Government of Odisha to consider SAIL’s 
application and pass appropriate order within a period 
of three months from the date of production of a certified 
copy of this order. Consequently, in March, 2023, enclosing 
the certified copy of the Hon’ble Court Order, Government 
of Odisha was requested to consider the SAIL’s application 
as per the direction of Hon’ble High Court of Orissa order. 
Decision of the Government of Odisha is awaited.
	•
 Delay in Grant of Stage-II Forest Clearance by MoEFCC
Stage-I Forest Clearance (FC) for development of new 
mining pits at South and Central blocks of Kiriburu and 
Meghahatuburu Mines was granted in October, 2010 and 
Compliance Report was forwarded by the Government of 
Jharkhand for approval of MoEFCC in April, 2016. However, 
approval could not be obtained due to initial link up of 
the grant of FC with the finalisation of Management Plan 
for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) for Saranda Forest and 
subsequently, on account of non-suitability of identified 
Compensatory Afforestation land. During the FY 2022-23, FC 
proposal was considered by the Forest Advisory Committee 
in July, 2022 and January, 2023 and consequently, MoEFCC in 
February, 2023, asked MoEFCC, Ranchi, inter-alia, to explore 
the possibility of handing over of equivalent reclaimed 
area by the user agency from other mines in the State in 
consultation with State Government. Compliance report 
forwarded to MoEFCC, New Delhi on 11th May, 2023 by the 
Jharkhand Government with a copy to IRO, MoEFCC, Ranchi 
for further necessary action. The report from  MoEFCC, Ranchi 
is awaited.
	•
Delay in Grant of Clearance for Selling Iron Ore from 
Jharkhand Mines
On account of the likely shortage of iron ore in the Country, 
Ministry  of  Mines,  Government  of  India  vide Order dated 
16th September, 2019 has entrusted SAIL with the 
responsibility to make available in the open market, 25 
percent of its total mineral production of the previous year. 
Further, in another separate Order dated 16th September, 
2019, Ministry of Mines, has allowed SAIL to dispose of the 
old stock of 70 MT of low grade iron fines and ores (including 
slime) lying dumped across different captive mines of 
the Company. In this regard, efforts were being made in 
obtaining approval of respective State Governments and 
other concerned statutory authorities. However, SAIL has 
not received the necessary approvals from Jharkhand State 
Government. Accordingly, only 0.58 million tonnes of iron 
ore was made available in the open market from SAIL mines 
in Odisha during FY 2022-23. Efforts are being made for 
getting clearances from the Jharkhand State Government to 
commence selling of iron ore from iron ore mines of SAIL in 
Jharkhand.
	•
Delay in Allocation of Suitable Coking Coal Blocks in 
lieu of Surrendered Sitanala and Parbatpur Coking 
Coal Blocks
In order to reduce its dependability on imported coking 
coal, with the intervention of Ministry of Steel, two Coking 
Coal blocks namely Sitanala and Parbatpur were allotted to 
SAIL through allotment route in 2015 and 2016 respectively. 
However, due to decrease in the Coal Mining Lease areas 
for both the coal blocks, SAIL Board approved the return 
of the Parbatpur and Sitanala Coal Blocks to Ministry of 
Coal (MoC). Accordingly, Nominated Authority, MoC, was 
intimated   about   returning   of Parbatpur and Sitanala Coal 
Blocks, with a request to refund the amount paid including 
Bank Guarantee submitted by SAIL at the time of allocation 
of blocks. SAIL had also requested MoC for allotment of 
potential coking Coal Blocks in lieu of Parbatpur and Sitanala 
Coal Blocks in line with NITI Aayog’s recommendation.
Meanwhile, Ministry of Coal terminated the allocations of 
both the Coal Blocks i.e. Sitanala and Parbatpur and advised 
concerned banks to invoke the Bank Guarantees (BGs). In 
both the matters, SAIL has preferred Writ Petitions before the 
Hon’ble High Court of Delhi to challenge the respective Orders.
In the matter of Sitanala Coal Block, Hon’ble Delhi High Court 
declined to pass any interim order. However, Hon’ble Court 
clarified that if the petitioner prevails in this petition, the 
consequential direction for refund of the amount collected 
by invoking the BG will be passed. However, in the matter of 
Parbatpur Coal Block, Hon’ble Delhi High Court directed for 
maintaining status quo in respect of the BG till the next date 
of hearing. In both the cases, the matter is sub-judice.
	•
Inadequate Supply of Raw Material
At Bhilai Steel Plant, the iron ore production is being met from 
the Rajhara Group of Iron Ore Mines. Due to exhaustion of 
iron ore from top benches, mining operations are being done 
in lower benches. As an alternative, mining of iron ore is to 
be started from the Rowghat Mines. Since there is delay in 
the Rowghat project, contract has been awarded for interim 
mining in Anjrel Block. Approach road has been constructed 
but due to agitation by the local people, the dispatch of iron 
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
59
ore is through extended route. The district administration is 
resolving the issue of agitation by the locals. Periodic desilting 
of Hitkasa tailing dam is also in progress. Further, for mining 
leases of Kalwar-Nagur and Pandardalli Rajhara Pahar Lease, 
SAIL has filed review petition in Chhattisgarh High Court.
	•
Possible Shortage of Water Supply may lead to 
Disruption of Operations at IISCO Steel Plant.
Presently the water supply is being managed through newly 
constructed intake water channel at riverbed and the job 
is ongoing. Construction of anicut/barrage/weir, etc. by 
Central Water & Power Research Station (CWPRS) for a long-
term solution to ensure sufficient water availability shall be 
taken up only after receipt of recommendation by CWPRS. A 
contract proposal has been initiated for hydrographic survey 
of Damodar river.  Further, new water pumping stations at 
upstream of river Damodar along with feed line to the Plant 
Reservoir is being envisaged in the upcoming 4.2 MTPA 
expansion plan of IISCO Steel Plant.
	•
Challenges to Ramp up Production of Iron Ore
The matter is being taken up with the concerned authorities 
for obtaining forest clearances for starting mining activities 
at some of the mines. In addition to this, actions are being 
taken to expedite the mining process at Rowghat and matter 
is being taken up with Indian Railways for expansion of 
railway sidings, wherever required.
	•
Non-availability of Spare Parts/Critical Spares due to 
restriction on Import from China
The matter is being pursued with the Government of India 
for procurement through Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) for 
items having no indigenous availability and valued upto 
` 200 crore. Further, in order to encourage indigenization, a 
list of items for which GTEs were issued have been put up 
on the SAIL Tender website to enable  interested indigenous 
vendors to express their interest in supplying these items.
	•
Volatility in Steel Prices
As there is lower than expected demand for steel during part 
of the year, continuous efforts are made to improve upon 
sales in freight advantageous zones. Further, committed 
sales under MoU and other order booking schemes through 
Tier-1 and Tier-2 distributorships mitigate the risk of low 
demand. To reduce the dependence of sales on lower end 
of the product value chain, focus is on increasing targeted 
sales of downstream and ready to use products to diversify 
the segment basket under Tier-1 distribution channel. 
Segment specific approach is being adopted for products 
being difficult to market and seminars and workshops are 
being conducted to bring awareness about the products. 
To mitigate the threat of increase in low value imports from 
China and other leading countries leading to imbalance 
in demand and supply, Government intervention is being 
sought through industry associations for continuing tariff 
based redressal for discouraging low value imports.
	•
Stiff Competition in International Market in respect 
of specific Product Mix may impact plans for Revenue 
generation and Growth from Exports.
As the prices in international market are subject to wide 
fluctuations, focus is on neighbouring markets in SAARC and 
Middle East viz. Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia. 
Efforts are being made for diversification of export product 
basket with inclusion of more value added products and 
products manufactured from new facilities at ISP, RSP and DSP.
	•
Disruption in Supply of Imported Coking Coal.
There is a risk of interruption in supply of imported coking 
coal as there are limited number of vendors and bulk supply 
from one geographical area. Action is being taken to increase 
vendor base through EOI route and increase coal basket 
by exploring new coal producing countries from different 
geographies like Russia, Mongolia, etc.
	•
Brand Misuse
To mitigate the misuse of our brands, existing brand names 
and their registry status is reviewed. Action is being taken 
for extension of registration of all brands except SAIL TIN, 
which is not being produced any more. Last registered 
brand was SAIL SeQR. Updated list of conversion agents, wet 
leasing agents and SPUs is available on the website of the 
Company. Further, major brands are properly displayed on 
SAIL’s website and other media avenues. In addition to this, 
product brochures for major products have been developed 
and are displayed at appropriate places and Brand Manual 
for Tier-1 & Tier-2 retail models is also in use.

D. OUTLOOK
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its April’ 23 Report has 
warned that its outlook for global economic growth over the 
next five years is the weakest in more than three decades. 
As higher interest rates continue, the world economy will 
expand by about 3% over the next half decade, which is 
lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990.  
In its July, 2023 World Economic Outlook report, IMF 
predicts the global economy will grow by 3.0% in 2023 and 
2024. As compared to April’23 outlook, the growth rate has 
been upgraded by 0.2% for 2023, with no change for 2024. 
However, balance of risks to global growth remains tilted 
to downside. World Steel Association forecasts that in 2023, 
world steel demand will see a recovery of just 1.0% to reach 
1,814.7 MT. High inflation, monetary tightening and China’s 
slowdown contributed to a difficult 2022, but infrastructure 
demand is expected to lift 2023 steel demand slightly. 
With regard to Indian economy, IMF has raised its economic 
growth forecast for CY 2023 by 0.2% to 6.1%, as compared 
to April’23 outlook with no change for 2024, reflecting 
momentum from stronger than expected growth in 
4th quarter of 2022 as a result of stronger domestic investment. 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stopped its rate-hike cycle by 
retaining the key lending rate at 6.5%. RBI in its Annual 
Report FY 23 has said that India’s growth momentum is likely 
to sustain in 2023-24 in an atmosphere of easing inflationary 
pressures, sound macroeconomic policies, softer commodity 
prices, a robust financial sector, a healthy corporate sector, 
continued fiscal policy thrust on quality of government 
expenditure, and new growth opportunities stemming from 
global realignment of supply chains. On account of global 
turmoil, India’s merchandise exports in FY’22-23 were US$ 
447.5 bn., up by just 6% as compared to previous year.
Withdrawal of export duties on finished steel by Government 
of India (GoI) has given fresh impetus to India’s steel exports. 
GoI’s strong emphasis on infrastructure development in FY’23-
24 budget is likely to boost domestic steel consumption. 
Current downward trend in international coking coal prices 
is likely to improve the margins of domestic steel companies. 
RBI has paused raising the interest rates, which will also 
support domestic steel demand. India’s strengthening 
industrial production is a good sign for domestic steel 
consumption. However, volatile international situation due 
to continued Ukraine-Russia conflict is a cause of concern.

consumption, repairs & maintenance expenses, increased 
purchased power rates, conversion charges, security expenses, 
higher usage of raw materials like Iron ore, limestone and 
other ferro-alloys, higher interest charges & depreciation, loss 
arising due to foreign exchange fluctuation, etc. However, 
the decline in profit has been partially offset by increased 
production, improved NSR, decrease in salaries & wages, 
better techno-economic parameters like improvement in BF 
Productivity and Coke Rate, lower imported coal in blend, 
etc., decrease in Royalty expenses, higher stock valuation 
rate, higher dividend income, etc.
As compared to CPLY, while there has been an increase in 
turnover, there has also been an increase in debtors, leading 
to an increase in the number of days in Debtors’ Turnover 
Ratio. There has been a reduction in the inventory levels 
during the year. The increase in Current Ratio is mainly on 
account of increase in inventory levels and debtors. Increase 
in borrowings has led to higher debt equity ratio in FY 2022-
23. Reduction in Interest Coverage Ratio is mainly due to 
lower EBIT and higher interest and finance charges.

F.   MATERIALS MANAGEMENT
A number of initiatives were taken to reduce cost of inputs 
and improve the performance of materials management, 
some of which are summarized as under:
•
Procurement on GeM Portal: In the Financial Year 2022- 
23, SAIL continued its thrust on procurement of Goods 
and Services through Government e-Marketplace (GeM), 
with a special focus on procurement of Services, which 
enabled the Company to achieve 2nd position amongst 
CPSEs on GeM with a total procurement value of 
` 9,230.89 crore, including ` 154.47 crore of Services. 
While the total Goods & Services registered a growth 
of about 100%, Services were higher by 170% over the 
previous fi nancial year.

SAIL is continuously making endeavors to develop new 
MSE vendors and provide support to local MSEs by 
mentoring, training, handholding and providing technical 
support to such MSEs in their chosen areas of functioning. 
In this regard, SAIL Plants and Units conducted 24 Vendor 
Development Programs during FY 2022-23. Vendor 
Development Programs were also conducted especially 
for SC/ST and Women MSME vendors, to inform them 
about the opportunities, item requirement and vendor 
registration procedures in the organization.
G.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONSERVATION
SAIL majorly dependent on imported coal, its imports are 
large as compared to the exports, and therefore, the foreign 
exchange has a signifi cant impact on the Company in terms 
of the foreign exchange outgo, with consequential impact on 
the Country’s foreign exchange reserves.
It has been the Company’s endeavour to minimize the imports 
through domestic substitution wherever possible, and also 
emphasise on exports. One of the major raw materials which 
SAIL has been importing is Coking Coal. Eff orts are being 
made to use a blended coal mix with increased indigenous 
coal, which would lead to reducing the dependence on 
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
65
Imported Coking Coal and reduce the outflow of precious 
foreign currency. Further, measures are being taken to 
expand the basket/ pool of suppliers for imported inputs/raw 
materials. Your Company has adhered to the Government of 
India policy initiative restraining Global tender for projects 
up to ` 200 crore, which is expected to provide the domestic 
participants an opportunity on the one hand, and on 
the other hand, result in conserving of Foreign Currency. 
In addition to this, the Company has taken up various 
initiatives to indigenise the procurement of raw materials 
and other inputs to the extent they become available to the 
Company at the commercially acceptable prices/costs and 
commensurate with the requirements of the technologies 
adopted by the Company.

Effi  ciency of operations.
•
Judicious utilization and protection of resources.
•
Accuracy and promptness of fi nancial reporting.

In SAIL, Internal Audit is a multi-disciplinary function which 
reviews, evaluates and appraises various systems, procedures/ 
policies of the Company and suggests meaningful and useful 
improvements. It helps Management to accomplish its 
objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach 
to improve the eff ectiveness of risk management towards 
good corporate governance.
The Company is constantly taking measures to make the 
Internal Audit function more eff ective. The Internal Audit 
is subject to overall control environment supervised by 
Board Level Audit Committee, providing independence 
to the Internal Audit function, emphasizing transparency 
in the systems and internal controls with appropriate skill- 
mix of internal audit personnel, etc. Audit Plan based on 
identifi cation of key-risk areas with thrust on system/process 
audits and benchmarking of the best practices followed in 
the Plants/Units, is made and approved by Audit Committee 
of the Board so as to achieve Cost Saving and Revenue 
Generation, Review of Inventory and Idle Assets, Systems 
Improvement, Compliance with Policies and Procedures, 
etc. Training and development of Internal Audit Executives,

2.	 	
Basis of Preparation
	
	
2.1	Statement of Compliance
	
The financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared on accrual basis of accounting in accordance 
with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013, read with Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
The company has uniformly applied the accounting 
policies during the periods presented.
	
	
2.2 Basis of Measurement
	
The financial statements are prepared on a historical 
cost basis except for the following assets and 
liabilities which have been measured at fair value in 
accordance with the requirements of the relevant Ind 
AS:  
	
•	
certain financial assets and liabilities which are 
classified at fair value through profit and loss or 
fair value through other comprehensive income;
	
•	
assets held for sale, at the lower of the carrying 
amounts and fair value less cost to sell;
	
•	
defined benefit plans and plan assets.
	
	
2.3 Functional and Presentation Currency
	
The financial statements have been presented in 
Indian Rupees (₹), which is the Company’s functional 
currency. All financial information presented in 
₹ have been rounded off to the nearest two decimals 
of Crore unless otherwise stated.
	
	
2.4 Use of estimates, assumptions and judgements
	
In preparing the financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS and company’s accounting policies, 
management is required to make estimates, 
assumptions and judgements that affect reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities 
and the accompanying disclosures as at the date of 
the financial statements. The judgements, estimates 
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised prospectively. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates.
	
	
2.5 Current versus Non-current classification
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in 
the balance sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification. An asset is classified as current when it is:
	
•	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in the Company’s normal operating 
cycle;
	
•	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
	
•	
Expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
	
•	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
A liability is classified as current when:
	
•	
It is expected to be settled in the Company’s 
normal operating cycle;
	
•	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
	
•	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting period; or
	
•	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are classified as non-current only.
3.	 	
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	
A summary of the significant accounting policies 
applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
is given below. These accounting policies have been 
applied consistently to all the periods presented in 
the financial statements.
	
	
3.1	Property, Plant and Equipment
	
	
3.1.1 	 Recognition and Measurement
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
recognised as an asset if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Company and its cost can be measured 
reliably. This recognition principle is applied to costs 
incurred initially to acquire an item of property, plant 
and equipment. Property, plant and equipment held 
for use in the production or/and supply of goods 
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
73
or services, or for administrative purposes, are 
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any, except freehold land which 
are carried at historical cost. The initial cost at cash 
price equivalence of property, plant and equipment 
acquired comprises its purchase price, including 
import duties, non-refundable purchase taxes, any 
directly attributable costs of bringing the assets 
to its working condition and location and present 
value of any obligatory decommissioning costs for its 
intended use.
	
In case of constructed assets, cost includes the 
costs of all materials used in construction, direct 
labour, allocation of overheads, directly attributable 
borrowing costs and trial run expenses (net of 
revenue).
	
Spares having useful life of more than one year and 
having value of Rs. 10 lakh or more in each case, 
are capitalised under the respective heads as and 
when available for use.   Where an item of property, 
plant and equipment comprises major components 
having different useful lives, these components are 
accounted for as separate items.
	
Capital work-in-progress comprises of assets in the 
course of construction for production and/ or supply 
of goods or services or administrative purposes 
or for purposes not yet determined are carried at 
cost less any recognised impairment loss. At the 
point when an asset is operating as intended by the 
management, the cost of construction is transferred 
to the appropriate category of property, plant and 
equipment. Costs associated with the commissioning 
of an asset are capitalised where the asset is available 
for use but incapable of operating at normal levels 
until a period of commissioning has been completed.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising 
on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
3.1.2	 Subsequent Cost
	
Subsequent expenditure is recognised as an increase 
in the carrying amount of the asset or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits derived 
from the cost incurred will flow to the Company and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The 
carrying amount of replaced item(s) is derecognised. 
	
Any repair of ` 50 lakh or more of property, plant and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of 
the respective item if it is probable that the future 
economic benefits of the costs incurred will flow to 
the Company. The carrying amount of the replaced 
item(s) is derecognised. 
	
	
3.2 Investment Properties
	
Investment properties are properties held to earn 
rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are measured initially at cost including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property 
is determined as the difference between net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the property 
and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
3.3	Depreciation
	
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment and 
investment property is provided on straight line 
method, considering residual value of 5% of the cost of 
the asset, over the useful lives of the asset, as specified 
in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in 
case of following category of assets, where useful 
life is determined by technical experts. The useful life 
estimated by the technical experts is as under:
Asset category
Estimated useful life (in years)
Factory Buildings
35 to 40 
Plant and Machinery
10 to 40 
Water Supply & Sewerage
25 to 40 
Railway Lines & Sidings
35 to 40 
	
For these classes of assets, based on technical 
evaluation carried out by external technical experts, 
the Company believes that the useful lives as given 
above best represent the period over which Company 
expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives 
for these assets are different from the useful lives 
as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the 
Companies Act 2013.
	
Freehold land is not depreciated.
	
The estimated useful lives and residual values of 
depreciable/ amortisable assets are reviewed at each 
year end, with the effect of any changes in estimates 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
Where the historical cost of a depreciable asset 
undergoes a change, the depreciation on the revised 
unamortised depreciable amount is provided over 
the residual useful life of the asset. Depreciation on 
addition/ deletion during the year is provided on pro-
rata basis with reference to the month of addition/ 
deletion. Assets costing up to Rs. 5000/- are fully 
depreciated in the year in which they are put to use.
	
Depreciation on capital spares is provided over the 
useful life of the spare or remaining useful life of the 
mother asset, as reassessed, whichever is lower. 
	
	
3.4 Intangible assets
	
	
Mining Rights
	
Mining rights are treated as Intangible Assets and all 
related costs thereof are amortised using the unit of 
production basis over the commercially recoverable 
reserves. In case the mining rights are not renewed, 
the balance related cost paid is charged to revenue in 
the year of decision of non-renewal.
74
	
Acquisition Cost i.e. cost associated with acquisition 
of licenses, and rights to explore including related 
professional fees, payment towards statutory forestry 
clearances, as and when incurred, are treated as 
addition to the Mining Rights.  
	
	
Other Intangible Assets
	
Other intangible assets are amortised on straight-
line method over the expected duration of benefits. 
Software, which is not an integral part of related 
hardware, is treated as intangible asset and amortised 
over a period of five years or its licence period, 
whichever is less.
	
	
Research and development
	
Development expenditure is capitalised only if 
it can be measured reliably and the related asset 
and process are identifiable and controlled by 
the Company Research and other development 
expenditure is recognised as revenue expenditure as 
and when incurred. 
	
	
3.4.1 Subsequent Cost 
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied 
in the specific asset to which it relates. All other 
expenditure is recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
	
3.4.2 De-recognition of intangible assets
	
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or 
when no future economic benefits are expected 
from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from 
derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is 
derecognised.
	
	
3.5 Stripping Cost
	
The stripping cost incurred during the production 
phase of a surface mine is recognised as a component 
of the mining asset if such cost provides a benefit in 
terms of improved access to ore in future periods and 
following criteria are met:
	
•	
It is probable that the future economic benefits 
(improved access to an ore body) associated with 
the stripping activity will flow to the entity,
	
•	
The entity can identify the component of an ore 
body for which access has been improved, and
	
•	
  The costs relating to the improved access to that 
component can be measured reliably.
	
The expenditure, which cannot be specifically 
identified to be incurred to access ore is charged to 
revenue, based on stripping ratio as per five-year 
mining plan for mines, except collieries which is 
based on project report.
	
	
3.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
	
The Company reviews the carrying amount of its 
assets on each Balance Sheet date for the purpose 
of ascertaining impairment indicators if any, by 
considering assets of entire one Plant as Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU).  If any such indication exists, 
the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated, as higher 
of the Net Selling Price and the Value in Use.  An 
impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
	
An assessment is made at each balance sheet date 
to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no longer 
exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the 
Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable 
amount. A previously recognised impairment loss 
is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
	
	
3.7 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing 
costs 
directly 
attributable 
to 
the 
acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset, 
which takes substantial period of time, are capitalised 
as a part of the cost of that asset, during the period 
of time that is necessary to complete and prepare 
the asset for its intended use. Borrowing cost also 
includes exchange differences to the extent regarded 
as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
	
The Company considers a period of twelve months or 
more as a substantial period of time.
	
Transaction costs in respect of long-term borrowings 
are amortised over the tenor of respective loans 
using effective interest method and included within 
borrowing costs. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the 
period in which these are incurred.
	
	
3.8 Inventories
	
Raw materials, Stores & Spares and Finished/Semi-
finished products (including process scrap) are valued 
at lower of cost and net realisable value of the items 
of the respective Plants/Units. In case of identified 
obsolete/ surplus/ non-moving items, necessary 
provision is made and charged to revenue. The net 
realisable value of semi-finished special products, 
which have realisable value at finished stage only, is 
estimated for the purpose of comparison with cost.
	
Immaterial By-products, Residue products and other 
scrap are valued at estimated net realisable value.
	
The basis of determining cost is:
	
Raw materials - Periodical weighted average cost
	
Minor raw materials - Moving weighted average cost
	
Stores & Spares - Moving weighted average cost
	
Materials in-transit - at cost 
	
Finished/Semi-finished products Cost of purchase, 
cost of conversion and other appropriate share of 
costs including manufacturing overheads incurred 
in bringing them to their respective present location 
and condition.
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
75
	
	
3.9 Government Grants 
	
Government grants are recognised when there is 
reasonable assurance that the Company will comply 
with the conditions attaching to them and that the 
grants will be received. 
	
Government grants are recognised in Statement of 
Profit & Loss on a systematic basis over the periods 
in which the Company recognises as expenses the 
related costs for which the grants are intended to 
compensate. Where the Grant relates to an asset 
value, it is recognised as deferred income, and 
amortised over the expected useful life of the asset. 
Other grants are recognised in the statement of Profit 
& Loss concurrent to the expenses to which such 
grants relate/ are intended to cover.
	
Where the Company receives non-monetary grants, 
the asset and the grant are recorded gross at fair 
amounts and released to the income statement over 
the expected useful life and pattern of consumption 
of the benefit of the underlying asset.
	
	
3.10 Foreign Currency Transactions 
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated into 
the functional currency of the Company using 
the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transactions. At the end of each reporting period, 
monetary items denominated in foreign currencies 
are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the end of 
reporting period. 
	
Non-monetary items are not retranslated at period-
end and are measured at historical cost (translated 
using the exchange rates at the transaction date), 
except for non-monetary items measured at fair value 
which are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when fair value was determined.
	
The Company opted for accounting the exchange 
differences arising on reporting of long term foreign 
currency monetary items in line with Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2009 
relating 
to 
Accounting 
Standard-11 
(Revised) 
notified by Government of India on 31st March, 2009 
(as amended on 29th December, 2011), which will 
continue in accordance with Ind-AS 101 for all pre-
existing long term foreign currency monetary items as 
at 31st March, 2016. Accordingly, for foreign currency 
loans taken before 31st March, 2016, for adjustments 
arising from exchange rate variations relating to long 
term monetary items attributable to the depreciable 
fixed assets are capitalised. For foreign currency loans 
taken after 31st March 2016, exchange differences 
arising on settlement or translation of long term 
monetary items are recognised in statement of profit 
or loss.
	
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation or 
settlement of other monetary items are included in 
the Statement of profit and loss for the period.
	
	
3.11 Employee Benefits
	
	
Defined Contribution Plan
	
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed 
contributions to a separate entity. Payment to 
defined contribution benefit plans are recognised as 
an expense when employees have rendered service 
entitling them to the contributions. Contributions 
towards Provident Funds and Pension Funds are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of the 
period when the contributions to the Funds are due.
	
	
Defined Benefit Plan
	
Defined benefit plans are the amount of the benefit 
that an employee will receive on completion of 
services by reference to length of service, last drawn 
salary or direct costs related to such benefits. The 
legal and/ or constructive obligation for such benefits 
remains with the Company. 
	
The liability recognised for Defined Benefit Plans is 
the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation 
(DBO) at the reporting date less the fair value of plan 
assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised 
actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The 
management estimates the present value of the 
DBO annually through valuations by an independent 
actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are included in Statement 
of Profit and Loss or Other Comprehensive Income of 
the year.
	
Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial gains and 
losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if 
applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding 
interest), is reflected in the Balance Sheet with a 
charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive 
income is reflected immediately in retained earnings 
and will not be reclassified to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
	
Short Term Employee Benefits
	
Short term employee benefits comprise of employee 
costs such as salaries, bonus, ex-gratia, annual leave 
and sick leave which are accrued in the year in which 
the associated services are rendered by employees of 
the Company.
	
Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term 
employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted 
amount of the benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for the related services.
	
Expenditure incurred on Voluntary Retirement 
Scheme is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss 
immediately.
	
	
3.12  Revenue Recognition
	
The Company manufactures and sells a range of steel 
and other products. 
76
	
	
Sale of Goods 
	
Sales are net of Goods and Services Tax (GST), rebates 
and price concessions. Sales are recognised when 
it satisfy performance obligation by transferring 
promised goods or services (i.e. assets) to the 
customers and the customers obtain control of those 
goods or services. Where the contract prices are 
not finalised with government agencies, sales are 
accounted for on provisional basis.
	
Marine export sales are recognised on:
	
i)	
the issue of bill of lading, or
	
ii)	 negotiation of export bills upon expiry of laycan 
period, in cases where realisation of material value 
without shipment is provided in the letter of credit 
of respective contracts, whichever is earlier.
	
Export incentives under various schemes are 
recognised as income when the right to receive arises 
and the realisation of the same is not considered 
uncertain. 
	
	
Interest and dividend income
	
Interest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, 
by reference to the principal amount outstanding 
and the effective interest rate applicable. 
	
Dividend income is recognised when the right to 
receive dividend is established.
	
	
3.13 Adjustment pertaining to Earlier Years 
	
Material 
prior 
period 
errors 
are 
corrected 
retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts 
for the prior periods presented in which the error 
occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest 
period presented, the opening of assets, liabilities 
and equity for the earliest period presented, are 
restated.
	
	
3.14 Claims for Liquidated Damages and Price 
Escalation
	
Claims for liquidated damages are accounted for as 
and when these are considered recoverable by the 
Company. These are adjusted to the capital cost or 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, as the 
case may be.
	
Suppliers’ and Contractors’ claims for price escalation 
are accounted for to the extent such claims are 
accepted by the Company.
	
	
3.15 Leases 
	
At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses 
whether a contract is, or contains a lease based on 
whether the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.  
	
	
Company as a Lessee
	
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and 
a lease liability at the lease commencement date 
except for short-term leases of twelve months or less 
and leases for which the underlying asset is of low 
value, which are expensed in the statement of Profit 
& Loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which 
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date, plus any initial direct 
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle 
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less 
any lease incentives received. 
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated 
using 
the 
straight-line 
method 
from 
the 
commencement date to the earlier of the end of the 
useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the 
lease term. Certain lease arrangements include the 
options to extend the lease term. Right-of use assets 
and lease liabilities include these options when it 
is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. 
The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are 
determined on the same basis as those of property, 
plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of-
use asset is periodically reviewed for indicators of 
impairment and reduced by impairment losses, if 
any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the 
lease liability.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
the commencement date, discounted based on the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or if that rate cannot 
be readily determined, the Company’s incremental 
borrowing rate. 
	
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising 
from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change 
in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to 
be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the 
Company changes its assessment of whether it will 
exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. 
	
When the lease liability is re measured, a 
corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in 
profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-
use asset has been reduced to zero. 
	
	
Company as a Lessor
	
	
Finance leases
	
Leases which effectively transfer to the lessee 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of the leased item are classified and 
accounted for as finance lease. Lease rental receipts 
are apportioned between the finance income and 
capital repayment based on the implicit rate of 
return. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in 
the period in which they are earned.
	
	
Operating leases
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer 
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
77
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of an asset are classified as operating leases. The 
respective leased assets are included in the balance 
sheet based on their nature. Rental income is 
recognized on straight-line basis over the lease term 
except where scheduled increase in rent compensates 
the Company with expected inflationary costs. 
	
	
3.16  Non-current assets held for sale
	
Company classifies a non-current asset as held for sale 
if its carrying amount will be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction. This condition is regarded 
as met only when the asset is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition and its sale is highly 
probable.
	
Non-current assets including discontinued operations, 
classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of 
the carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell 
and presented separately in the financial statements. 
Once classified as held for sale, the assets are not 
subject to depreciation or amortisation.
	
Any profit or loss arising from the sale or re-
measurement of discontinued operations is presented 
as part of a single line item in Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
	
	
3.17 Mine Closure
	
Mine Closure Provision includes the dismantling and 
demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual 
materials and the remediation of disturbed areas 
for mines. This provision is based on all regulatory 
requirements and related estimated cost based on 
best available information. Mine closure costs are 
provided for in the accounting period when the 
obligation arises based on the net present value of the 
estimated future costs of restoration to be incurred 
during the life of the operation and post closure.
	
	
3.18 
Provisions, 
Contingent 
Liabilities 
and 
Contingent Assets
	
	
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities
	
A Provision is recognised when the Company has 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation 
and in respect of which a reliable estimate can be 
made. Provisions are discounted to their present 
value, where the time value of money is material. All 
provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
	
When some or all of the economic benefits required to 
settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a 
third party, the receivable is recognised as a separate 
asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will 
be received and the amount of the receivable can be 
measured reliably.
	
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising 
from past events and the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company or a present 
obligation that arises from past events but is not 
recognised because it is not possible that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefit will be 
required to settle the obligations or reliable estimate 
of the amount of the obligations cannot be made. 
	
In cases where the possible outflow of economic 
resources as a result of present obligation is 
considered improbable or remote, no Provision is 
recognised or disclosure is made.
	
	
Contingent Assets
	
Contingent assets usually arise from unplanned 
or other unexpected events that give rise to the 
possibility of an inflow of economic benefits. 
Contingent Assets are not recognised and are 
disclosed only where an inflow of economic benefits 
is probable.
	
	
3.19 Income Taxes
	
Tax expense recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and 
current tax except to the extent that the tax relates 
to the items that are recognised directly in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) or in equity in which 
case the related tax is recognised either directly in 
OCI or equity accordingly.
	
Current income tax is measured at the amount 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities in 
accordance with the Indian Income-tax Act. The 
Company offsets current tax assets and current tax 
liabilities when the legally enforceable right to offset 
exists and they are intended to be settled net or 
realised simultaneously.
	
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the 
balance sheet liability method/approach. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised in full for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying tax loss, unused tax credits or deductible 
temporary difference will be utilised against future 
taxable income. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
	
The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities when the legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets and liabilities exists and they are 
intended to be settled or realised simultaneously.
	
	
3.20 Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and 
cheques on hand and demand deposits, together 
with other short-term highly liquid investments with 
78
original maturities of three months or less that are 
readily convertible into known amount of cash and 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
	
3.21 Financial Instruments
	
	
Recognition, initial measurement and de-recognition
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument and are measured at fair 
value on initial recognition. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and financial liabilities, except for 
those which are classified at Fair Value through Profit 
& Loss (FVTPL) at inception, are adjusted with the fair 
value on initial recognition. 
	
Financial 
assets 
are 
derecognised 
when 
the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expires, or has been transferred, and 
the Company has transferred all substantial risks 
and rewards of ownership. A financial liability (or a 
part of financial liability) is derecognised when the 
obligation specified in the contract is extinguished or 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
	
	
Classification and subsequent measurement of 
financial assets
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified into the following 
categories upon initial recognition:
	
•	
amortised cost
	
•	
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL)
	
•	
financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI)
	
All financial assets except for those at FVTPL are 
subject to review for impairment at least at each 
reporting date.
	
	
Amortised cost 
	
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost using 
effective interest rates if the following conditions are 
met:
	
a)	 the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows; and
	
b)	 the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, trade 
receivables and most of other receivables fall into this 
category of financial instruments.
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL
	
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets 
that either do not meet the criteria for amortised 
cost classification or that are equity instruments 
held for trading or that meet certain conditions and 
are designated at FVTPL upon initial recognition. 
All derivative financial instruments also fall into this 
category. Assets in this category are measured at fair 
value with gains or losses recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss. The fair values of financial assets in 
this category are determined by reference to active 
market transactions or using a valuation technique 
where no active market exists.
	
	
Financial assets at FVOCI
	
FVTOCI financial assets are either debt instruments 
that are managed under hold to collect and sell 
business model or are non-trading equity instruments 
that are irrevocable designated to this category.
	
FVTOCI financial assets are measured at fair 
value. Gains and losses are recognized in  other 
comprehensive income, except for interest and 
dividend income, impairment losses and foreign 
exchange differences on monetary assets, which are 
recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.  
	
	
Classification and subsequent measurement of 
financial liabilities
	
Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method, 
except for financial liabilities held for trading or 
designated at FVTPL, that are carried subsequently at 
fair value with gains or losses recognized in Statement 
of Profit and Loss. All derivative financial instruments 
are accounted for at FVTPL.
	
	
Embedded Derivatives
	
Some hybrid financial liability contracts contain 
both derivative and a non-derivative component. 
In such cases, the derivative component is termed 
as embedded derivative, with a non-derivative 
component representing the host financial liability 
contract. If the economic characteristics and risks 
of embedded derivatives are not closely related to 
those of the host contract and the contract itself is 
not measured at FVTPL, the embedded derivative is 
bifurcated and reported at fair value, with gains and 
losses recognised in net gains (losses) on financial 
assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL). The host financial liability is accounted for in 
accordance with the appropriate Ind AS.
	
	
Fair value measurement
	
The Company classifies the fair value of its financial 
instruments in the following hierarchy, based on the 
inputs used in their valuation: 
	
i)	 Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments 
quoted in active markets is based on their quoted 
closing price at the Balance Sheet date. 
	
ii)	 Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that 
are not traded in an active market is determined 
by using valuation techniques using observable 
market data. Such valuation techniques include 
discounted 
cash 
flows, 
standard 
valuation 
models based on market parameters for interest 
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
79
rates, yield curves or foreign exchange rates, 
dealer quotes for similar instruments and use of 
comparable arm’s length transactions. 
	
iii)	 Level 3: The fair value of financial instruments 
that are measured on the basis of entity specific 
valuations using inputs that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
	
Impairment of Financial Assets  
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss for financial 
assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income.
	
ECL is the weighted average difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to the Company 
in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows 
that the Company expects to receive. 
	
	
Trade Receivables
	
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value 
based on amounts exchanged and subsequently at 
amortised cost less any impairment as per Ind AS 109.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with net 
amount reported in the balance sheet, only when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right 
must not be contingent on future events and must 
be enforceable both in the normal course of business 
and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy 
of the counterparty.
	
	
3.22 Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, 
associates and equity Instruments
	
Investment in subsidiaries, associate and joint 
ventures are carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment, if any in the Company’s standalone 
financial statements in accordance with Ind AS- 27, 
‘Separate Financial Statements’.
	
Investments in equity instruments, where the 
Company has opted to classify such instruments 
at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income. There is no recycling of the 
amounts from OCI to P&L, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Company may transfer the cumulative 
gain or loss within equity. Dividends on such 
investments are recognised in profit or loss unless the 
dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the 
cost of the investment
	
	
3.23 Segment reporting
	
Segments are identified based on the manner in which 
the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) decides 
about resource allocation and reviews performance. 
Segment results that are reported to the CODM include 
items directly attributable to a segment as well as 
those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred 
during the period to acquire property and equipment 
and intangible assets.
	
The Company has eight operating segments: five 
integrated steel plants and three alloy steel plants, being 
separate manufacturing units, have been considered 
reportable operating segments. In identifying these 
operating segments, management generally considers 
the Company’s separately identifiable manufacturing 
operations representing its main operations.
	
Each of these operating segments is managed 
separately as each has different requirements in terms 
of technology, raw material and other resources. All 
inter-segment transfers are carried out at arm’s length 
prices based on prices charged to unrelated customers 
in standalone sales of identical goods or services.	
	
In addition, corporate assets which are not directly 
attributable to the business activities of any operating 
segment are not allocated to a segment. This primarily 
applies to the Company’s administrative head office 
and mining operations.	
	
There have been no changes from prior periods in the 
measurement methods used to determine reported 
segment profit or loss.  
	
	
3.24	
Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing 
profit or loss for the year attributable to equity 
holders by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year. Partly paid-up shares are 
included as fully paid equivalents according to the 
fraction paid-up. 
	
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the 
weighted average number of shares and dilutive 
potential shares except where the result would be 
anti-dilutive
	
	
3.25 Significant Judgements, Assumptions and 
Estimations in applying Accounting Policies
	
	
3.25.1	Leases
	
The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. 
The Company uses significant judgement in assessing 
the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and 
the applicable discount rate.
	
	
3.25.2 Close-down and Restoration Obligations
	
Close-down and restoration costs are normal 
consequence of mining or production, and majority 
of close-down and restoration expenditure are 
incurred in the years following the closure of 
mine. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is 
uncertain, the Company estimate their costs based 
on current interpretation of scientific and legal data 
and existing technology, in addition to assumptions 
about probability and future costs.
80
	
	
3.25.3	Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets
	
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be 
recognized is based on an assessment of the 
probability of the Company’s future taxable income 
against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. 
In addition, significant judgement is required in 
assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits.
	
	
3.25.4	Inventories
	
The Company estimates the cost of inventories taking 
into account the most reliable evidence, such as cost 
of materials and overheads considered attributable 
to the production of such inventories including actual 
cost of production, etc. Management also estimates 
the net realisable values of inventories, taking into 
account the most reliable evidence available at each 
reporting date. Significant technical and commercial 
judgements are required to determine the Company’s 
quality and quantity of inventories. The future 
realisation of these inventories may be affected by 
future technology or other market-driven changes 
that may reduce future selling prices.
	
	
3.25.5	Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)
	
Employee benefit obligations are measured on 
the basis of actuarial assumptions which include 
mortality and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions 
concerning future developments in discount rates, 
medical cost trends, anticipation of future salary 
increases and the inflation rate. The Company 
considers that the assumptions used to measure its 
obligations are appropriate.  However, any changes in 
these assumptions may have a material impact on the 
resulting calculations.
	
	
3.25.6 Fair Value Measurements
	
The Company applies valuation techniques to 
determine the fair value of financial instruments 
(where active market quotes are not available) 
and non-financial assets. This involves developing 
estimates and assumptions consistent with the market 
participants to price the instrument. The Company’s 
assumptions are based on observable data as far as 
possible, otherwise on the best information available. 
Estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices 
that would be achieved in an arm’s length transaction 
at the reporting date.
	
	
3.25.7 Provisions and Contingencies
	
The 
assessments 
undertaken 
in 
recognising 
provisions and contingencies have been made 
in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) 37, ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’. The evaluation of the likelihood of 
the contingent events is applied best judgement by 
management regarding the probability of exposure 
to potential loss.
	
	
3.25.8 Mine Closure and Restoration Obligations
	
Environmental liabilities and Asset Retirement 
Obligation (ARO): Estimation of environmental 
liabilities and ARO require interpretation of scientific 
and legal data, in addition to assumptions about 
probability and future costs.
	
	
3.25.9 Useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable 
assets (tangible and intangible)
	
Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives 
of depreciable/ amortisable assets at each reporting 
date, based on the expected utility of the assets. 
Uncertainties in these estimates relate to actual 
normal wear and tear that may change the utility of 
plant and equipment. 
	
	
3.26	
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standard or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, 
MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 
2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below: 
	
	
3.26.1	Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial 
Statements 
	
The amendments require companies to disclose 
their material accounting policies rather than their 
significant accounting policies. Accounting policy 
information, together with other information, is 
material when it can reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions of primary users of general 
purpose financial statements. The Company does 
not expect this amendment to have any significant 
impact in its financial statements.
	
	
3.26.2	Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes 
	
The amendments clarify how companies account 
for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and 
decommissioning obligations. The amendments 
narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption 
in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition 
exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions 
that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable 
and deductible temporary differences. The Company 
is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial 
statements. 
	
	
3.26.3	Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors 
	
The amendments will help entities to distinguish 
between 
accounting 
policies 
and 
accounting 
estimates. The definition of a change in accounting 
estimates has been replaced with a definition of 
accounting estimates. Under the new definition, 
accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in 
financial statements that are subject to measurement 
uncertainty’’. Entities develop accounting estimates 
if accounting policies require items in financial 
statements to be measured in a way that involves 
measurement uncertainty. The Company does not 
expect this amendment to have any significant 
impact in its financial statements.

information from a variety of  sources including:
a)	
Current prices in an active market for properties of different nature or recent prices of similar properties in less active markets, adjusted to 
reflect those differences.

Discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows.

i)	
Fair values hierarchy
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are categorized into three levels of a fair value 
hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for financial instruments.
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the 
use of observable market data rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

* Already at fair value
(iv)	 Valuation process and technique used to determine fair value
	
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
(a)	 Fair value of interest  swap is determined based on dealer or counterparty quotes for similar instruments.
(b)	 Fair value of forward foreign exchange contract and principal swap is determined using forward rate at balance sheet date.
(c)	 The carrying value of borrowings bearing variable interest rate are considered to be representative of their fair value.
(d)	 The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities with maturities less than 12 months are considered to be representative of their fair value.
(e)	 Fair value of fixed interest rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost (including lease obligations) is determined by discounting the 
cash flows using a discount rate equivalent to market interest rate applicable to similar assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date. 
(v)	 Unquoted investments:
	
Fair value estimates of unquoted equity investments are included in level-3 and are based on information relating to value of investee Group’s net 
assets. For investments in co-operative societies, the Group has determined that cost is appropriate estimate of fair value, therefore, there have been 
no changes on account of fair values.

ii)	 Risk Management
	
The Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate’s 
financial asset and liabilities by category are summarised in note 43 (i). The main types of risks are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s risk management is co-ordinated at its headquarters, in close co-operation with the Board of Directors, and 
focuses on actively securing the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s short to medium-term cash flows by minimising the exposure to volatile 
financial markets. Long term financial investments are managed to generate lasting returns. The Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate does not 
actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes nor does it write options. The most significant financial risks to which the 
Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate is exposed are described below.
102
A)	 Credit risk	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge an obligation to the Company. The Company is exposed to this risk for various financial 
instruments, for example by granting loans and receivables to customers, placing deposits, etc. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is 
limited to the carrying amount of following types financial assets.
	
-	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
-	
Derivative financial instruments
	
-	
Trade receivables
	
-	
Other financial assets measured at amortized cost
	
The Company continuously monitors defaults of customers and other counterparties, identified either individually or by the Company, and 
incorporates this information into its credit risk controls. Where available at reasonable cost, external credit ratings and/or reports on customers and 
other counterparties are obtained and used. The Company’s policy is to deal only with creditworthy counterparties.
a)	
Credit risk management
	
Cash and cash equivalent
	
Credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents is managed by only accepting highly rated banks and diversifying bank deposits and accounts in 
different banks across the country.
	
Derivative financial instruments
	
Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is also managed by only entering into such arrangement with highly rated banks or financial 
institutions as counterparties. The company diversifies its holdings with multiple counterparties.
	
Trade receivables 
	
Credit risk related to trade receivables are mitigated by taking bank guarantees from customers where credit risk is high. The Company closely 
monitors the credit-worthiness of the debtors and only sells goods to credit-worthy parties. The Company’s internal systems are configured to define 
credit limits of customers, thereby limiting the credit risk to pre-calculated amounts.
	
Other financial assets measured at amortized cost
	
Other financial assets measured at amortized cost includes loans and advances to employees and others. Credit risk related to these other financial 
assets is managed by monitoring the recoverability of such amounts continuously, while at the same time internal control system in place ensure the 
amounts are within defined limits.
b)	 Expected credit losses
	
Company provides expected credit losses based on the following;
	
Trade receivables	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company recognizes lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables using a simplified approach and uses historical information to arrive at 
loss percentage relevant to each category of trade receivables. For descriptive note on trade receivables ageing, refer note 48.4 (B)
	
Other financial assets measured at amortized cost
	
Company provides for expected credit losses on “loan advances and other than trade receivables” by assessing individual financial instruments 
for expectation of any credit losses. Since, this category includes loans and receivables of varied natures and purpose, there is no trend that the 
Company can draw to apply consistently to entire population. For such financial assets, the Company’s policy is to provide for 12 month expected 
credit losses upon initial recognition and provide for lifetime expected credit losses upon significant increase in credit risk. The Company does not 
have any expected loss based impairment recognised on such assets considering their low credit risk nature, though incurred loss allowances are 
disclosed under each sub-category of such financial assets.
B)	 Liquidity risk
	
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate 
amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due. Due to the nature of the business, the Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate 
maintain flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed facilities. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s, its 
Joint Venture’s & Associate’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. The Group, its Joint Ventures & 
Associate takes into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates. In addition, the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s liquidity 
management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring 
balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt financing plans.
	
Maturities of financial liabilities
	
The tables below analyse the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity Grouping based on their contractual 
maturities for all non-derivative financial liabilities and the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due 
within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

C)	 Market Risk
a)	
Foreign currency risk
	
Most of the Company’s transactions are carried out in INR. Exposures to currency exchange rates arise from the Company’s overseas borrowing 
arrangements, which are primarily denominated in US dollars (USD).
	
To mitigate the Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk, non-INR cash flows are monitored and forward exchange contracts are entered into in 
accordance with the Company’s risk management policies. Generally, the Company’s risk management procedures distinguish short-term foreign 
currency cash flows (due within 6 months) from longer-term cash flows (due after 6 months). Where the amounts to be paid and received in a specific 
currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further hedging activity is undertaken. Forward exchange contracts are mainly entered into 
for significant long-term foreign currency exposures that are not expected to be offset by other same-currency transactions.
	
Foreign currency risk exposure:
	
The Company’s significant exposures  to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period expressed in ₹ crore are as follows:

Sensitivity
	
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity in regard to the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s financial assets and financial 
liabilities and the USD/INR exchange rate and EUR/INR exchange rate ‘all other things being equal’. It assumes a +/- 4.93% change of the INR/USD 
exchange rate for the year ended at 31st March, 2023 (2022: 4.65%). A +/- 8.75% change is considered for the INR/EUR exchange rate (2022: 5.63%). 
Both of these percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months. The sensitivity 
analysis is based on the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s foreign currency financial instruments held at each reporting date and also takes into 
account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates.

b)	 Interest rate risk	
	
The Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing. Long-term borrowings 
are therefore usually at fixed rates. At 31st March, 2023, the Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate is exposed to changes in market interest rates through 
bank borrowings at variable interest rates. Other borrowings are at fixed interest rates. The Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s investments in 
bonds all pay fixed interest rates. The exposure to interest rates for the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s money market funds is considered 
immaterial. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of +/- 1% (2022: +/- 1%). 
These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change 
in the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest 
rates. All other variables are held constant.

Exposure
	
The Company is exposed to other price risk in respect of its investment shares of other Companies (see Note 8). The Company does not consider 
changes in value of its investments in shares as significant, therefore is not exposed to price risks on exposures outstanding on the balance sheet 
date.
44. Capital management	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company’s capital management objectives are
	
-	
to ensure the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
	
-	
to provide an adequate return to shareholders
	
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the face of balance 
sheet.
	
Management assesses the Company’s capital requirements in order to maintain an efficient overall financing structure while avoiding excessive 
leverage. This takes into account the subordination levels of the Company’s various classes of debt. The Company manages the capital structure and 
makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, 
or sell assets to reduce debt.

The Group considers the assets of one entire plant as Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group internally reviews whether 
there are any indicators that the carrying amount of assets of CGUs may be impaired on each balance sheet date. If any 
such indicators exist, the asset recoverable amount is estimated as higher of the net selling price and the value in use. 
Value in use is based on present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an 
asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amounts of 
assets of a CGU exceed the asset recoverable amount. Further to the internal assessment, the Group also determines net 
selling price of the assets of CGU, in which any such indication exists, once every three years by an independent expert.
	
As on the reporting date, based on the internal assessment done by the group at its different CGUs, Property, Plant and 
Equipment (except leasehold land) of one of the units (Bokaro Steel Plant) is impaired during F/Y 2022-23. The amount 
of impairment losses recognised in profit & loss during the year is ₹ 9.10 Crs. ( ₹ NIL crore as on 31.03.2022) and the same 
is included under the item other expenses (Note no.41).

49.8    Information on leases as per Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 116 on `Leases’:
	
(I)	 The Company has leases for Land, office building, Plant & Equipment, warehouses & related facilities and vehicles. 
With the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is reflected on the 
balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Variable lease payments which do not depend on an 
index or a rate are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and right of use assets. The Company 
classifies its right-of-use assets in a consistent manner to its Property, plant and equipment.
	
	
Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Company to sublease the 
asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Company. Some leases contain an option to 
extend the lease for a further term. The Company is prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets 
as security. For leases over office buildings and other premises the Company must keep those properties in a good 
state of repair and return the properties in their original condition at the end of the lease. Further, the Company is 
required to pay maintenance fees in accordance with the lease contracts.

Power Plant
	
	
The Company has accounted for certain power plants as finance lease under Appendix C of Ind AS 17 by virtue of 
the power purchase agreement with the supplier. Under the terms of the power purchase agreement, the Company 
shall continue to purchase power until the parties decide to terminate the agreement, which has been determined 
to be an un-economic proposition considering the specialised nature and location of the asset. For any new lease 
treatment has been done in accordance with Ind AS 116 – Leases.
	
	
Oxygen Plant
	
	
The Company has accounted for certain oxygen plants as finance lease (or operating lease) under Appendix C of Ind 
AS 17 by virtue of the oxygen purchase agreement with the supplier. The agreement to purchase oxygen is a 15 year 
fixed term agreement. There is no change in treatment under Ind AS 116 – Leases.
	
	
Mining land
	
	
The Company has accounted for leasehold lands for mining as finance leases by virtue of its rights under the lease 
agreement after considering the right/ economic compulsion for renewal. There is no change in treatment under Ind 
AS 116 – Leases.
49.9	
Contributions made in cash and kind for the period from the Financial Year 2006-07 to 2021-22 to Railway authorities 
for laying out railway line from Rajhara to Rowghat would be recovered in cash at the rate of 7% per annum for 37 years 
on total contribution towards redemption of SAIL’s contribution after commencement and fulfilment of assured traffic 
from Rowghat mines. Management is of view that the criteria laid out in Memorandum of Understanding will be met and 
interest accrues from the date of investment. The refund amount comprises principal and interest elements. Accordingly, 
the interest element has been computed and recognised as income during the year amounting to ₹51.60 crore (till date 
₹249.92 crore). As per the opinion of Expert Advisory Committee of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, such 
treatment of recognition on time proportion basis is in order as in view of the Management, no significant uncertainty 
exists regarding collectability and measurability of revenue.
	
During the year, the company has recognised a loss of ₹170.81 crore arising out of modification of financial assets on 
account of revision of estimated period of completion of Rowghat railway line.
49.10	 The inventory of sub-grade iron ore fines generated at the captive mines of the Company were not assigned any value 
in the books of accounts of the Company till the financial Year ended 31st March 2019, since, the Government of India 
Notification dated 19th September 2012 prohibited all captive miners from selling such sub-grade fines.
	
Following the Government of India Order no. F.No.16/30/2019-M.VI dated 16th September 2019 allowing sale of sub- 
grade iron ore fines, the inventories of sub-grade fines held by the Company gained economic value. In this regard, the 
Company also obtained opinions from the Additional Solicitor General of India as well as the Expert Advisory Committee 
(EAC) of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Based on the aforesaid opinions, the Company recognized 
these inventories as by-product inventory as at 31st March 2020. Since, these inventories were generated over many 
years, hence, making it impracticable to ascertain the actual valuation, the Company assigned a valuation to such 
inventories basis average selling price of similar sub-grade fines over the last 36 months as declared by Indian Bureau of 
Mines (IBM), a Government of India organisation and as adjusted for royalty and other selling costs.
	
The Company has obtained all clearances including environmental clearance and clearance from Director General of 
Mines Safety, Government of India. Further, procedural clearances have been obtained from the State Government of 
Odisha. With respect to the State of Jharkhand, the delay in the clearances is procedural and the management expects 
to receive the clearances soon. This is also supported by the legal opinion taken by the Company in this regard.
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
121
	
As a result, the management has been able to sell off such inventories in certain locations. While, on an overall basis 
during the current and the previous year, there has been movement of 1.43 million tonnes in the volume of such 
inventories, there is significant market demand for sub-grade fines and the recent sales price trends are indicative of 
considerable margins over and above the carrying value of such inventories. The management also has plans to set up 
beneficiation plant in future that will consume significant volume of sub-grade fines annually. Accordingly, in view of the 
management, there is no adjustment required in the carrying value of these inventories at this stage.
	
Considering the substantial volume of inventories, the quantity estimated to be sold / consumed within the next one 
year has been recognized as current and the balance has been classified as non-current inventory.
	
As at 31st March 2023, the Company is carrying sub-grade iron-ore fines inventory of 41.55 MT (as at 31st March 2022: 
41.94 MT) valuing ₹3995.75 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing ₹4034.95 crores) at its various mines.
	
Likewise, the Company
	•
at its Barsua and Dalli Mines is carrying inventory of tailings of 10.27 MT (as at 31st March 2022: 7.44 MT) valuing 
₹491.98 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing ₹382.66 crores).
	•
at its Bhilai, Bokaro and Rourkela Steel Plants is carrying inventory of extractable iron and steel scrap embedded in 
BF Slag and LD Slag of 0.47 MT (as at 31st March 2022 : 0.49 Mt) valuing ₹ 460.35 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing 
₹507.10 crores).
	•
at its Chandrapur Ferro Alloys Plant is carrying inventory of Granulated high manganese ore (HMnO) slag and slag 
fines of 0.52 MT (as at 31st March 2022 : 0.52 MT) valuing ₹41.56 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing ₹39.29 crores).
	
The Company is formulating a detailed plan for disposal / consumption of these inventories.
	
Considering the market volatility, steel market dynamics, possibility of future additions to steel and pellet making capacity 
in the country which may augment the demand of these materials, the carrying value of the non-current inventories 
need not be adjusted for any unforeseeable changes in the future prices. Accordingly, in view of the management, the 
carrying values of the aforementioned inventories are the best estimates basis the information available at this stage.
49.11	 The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its meeting held on 27th October, 2016 had accorded ‘in-principle’ 
approval for Strategic Disinvestment of three units of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) viz. Visvesvaraya Iron &

of interest of the shortlisted bidders in proceeding further with the transaction and Alternative Mechanism has approved.
	
In view of the current status and the various disinvestment processes which are underway, no adjustment in these 
financial statements is considered necessary at this stage.

Report on the Audit of Standalone Financial Statements
Qualified opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of STEEL 
AUTHORITY OF INDIA LIMITED (the Company), which comprise the Balance Sheet as 
at 31st March 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year 
then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary 
of Significant Accounting Policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘Standalone Financial Statements’), in which are included the returns 
for the year ended on the date audited by the branch auditors of the Company’s 
branches listed in Appendix 1.
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations 
given  to us, and based on the consideration of the reports of the branch auditors 
as referred to in paragraph 19 below, except for the effects / possible effects of the 
matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act 
2013 (‘the Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified under section 133 of the Act read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 
31st March, 2023 and its profit (including other comprehensive income), its cash flows 
and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
3.	
As referred in note 47(2)(a)(i) to the accompanying standalone financial statements, 
the constitutional validity of the Entry Tax Act has been upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court and the matters relating to levy of entry tax are now pending before regular 
benches of the Supreme Court / Jurisdictional High Courts / assigned authorities. 
Pending decision by the other Courts, the management is of the view that no adjustment 
is required in the accompanying standalone financial statements of the Company for 
the disputed entry tax demand in various states amounting to INR 1,184.81 crores as on 
31st March 2023. However, in the absence of sufficient appropriate evidence to 
support the management’s view, we are of the opinion that a provision for entry tax 
liability should be recognized in the standalone financial statements.
The Nine Judge Bench of the Supreme court, vide its order 
dated 11th November, 2016, upheld the Constitutional 
validity of the Entry tax legislations passed by the various 
States. However, the Bench directed that certain other 
matters raised by the Petitioner, such as discriminatory 
rates of entry tax amounting to ` 1092.28 crore on iron Ore 
and Coking Coal in Bhilai-Durg area @ 6% as compared to 
lower rate of 1% on Coking Coal and 3% on Iron ore in rest 
of the areas of Chhattisharh, tax amounting to ` 92.53 crore 
on goods entering into the local area of Jharkhand from 
other State etc. may be determined by regular benches 
hearing the matters. Accordingly, various matters raised by 
SAIL are pending with Supreme Court / Jurisdictional High 
Courts / assigned authorities. Pending decision by the 
Courts, the disputed Entry Tax liabilities of ` 1,184.81 crore 
have been treated by the Company as Contingent Liability.
4.	
As referred in note 47(2)(b) to the accompanying standalone financial statements, 
current assets include advance of INR 587.72 crores paid under dispute to Damodar 
Valley Corporation against the bills raised for supply of power for period upto 
31st March 2017. The matter is under litigation with Jharkhand State Electricity 
Regulatory Commission for finalisation of tariff, pending which, the management is 
of the view that the amount is fully recoverable and thus no adjustment is required 
in the accompanying standalone financial statements. However, in the absence 
of sufficient appropriate evidence to support the management’s contention of 
recoverability of these balances, we are of the opinion that an allowance for possible 
non-recoverability of such advance should be created in the standalone financial 
statements.
The Company’s view is that the cases are sub-judice 
and pending for adjudication before the various judicial 
authorities for a long time. Further, the civil appeal filed 
by DVC pertaining to tariff of 2004-09 against the Order 
of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL), have been 
dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India vide its 
Order dated 3rd December, 2018. Accordingly, State Electricity 
Regulatory Commission (SERC) will finalise the retail tariff as 
directed by APTEL, the financial implication of which can 
only be ascertained after the Tariff fixation by SERC. DVC 
filed its Retail Tariff Application in November, 2020 along 
with application for Annual Revenue Requirement before 
the Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission for 
the period 2006-07 to 2011-12 and also seeking adjustment 
of Revenue Gap/Surplus in the period of 2012-13 to 
2014-15. The Company has also filed their objections on 
28th December, 2020 to the aforesaid Application of DVC.
The above disputed demands stated at (3) and (4), 
contested on valid and bonafide grounds, have been 
treated as contingent liabilities as it is not probable that 
present obligations exist as on 31st March, 2023. Therefore, 
there is no adverse impact on Profit for the year.

The audit report on the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31st March 
2022 was also modified in respect of above matters.
6.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (‘Sas’) 
specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the ‘Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Company in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (‘ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules 
thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained together with the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, 
in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 19 of the Other Matter section 
below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion on the 
Standalone financial statements.
Emphasis of matter
7.	
We draw your attention to the following matter:
a.	
Note 49.2(a) to the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements, which 
describes that the revenue from operations include sales to Government agencies 
aggregating to INR 8,688.65 crores for the year ended 31st March 2023 (cumulative 
up to 31st March 2023 of INR 29,182.75 crores) which is recognized on the basis of 
provisional prices as per the terms of sales with such Government agencies.
	
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Key Audit Matters
8.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, and based 
on the consideration of the reports of the branch auditors as referred to paragraph 19 
below, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
9.	
In addition to the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we 
have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key 
audit matter
1.
Provision and contingent liabilities 
relating to ongoing litigations
The Company is subject to a number 
of legal, regulatory and tax cases for 
which final outcome cannot be easily 
predicted and which could potentially 
result in significant liabilities.
Management’s disclosures with regards 
to provisions and contingent liabilities 
relating to ongoing litigation are 
presented in Note No. 47.1 read with 
note 3.18 to the Company’s Standalone 
Financial Statements.
The assessment of whether a liability 
is 
recognised 
as 
a 
provision 
or 
disclosed as a contingent liability in 
the standalone financial statements 
is inherently subjective and requires 
significant management judgement 
in determination of the cash outflows 
from 
the 
business, 
interpretation 
of applicable laws and regulations, 
and careful examination of pending 
assessments 
at 
various 
levels 
of 
regulatory authorities.
Our audit procedures included, but 
were not limited to the following:
Obtained understanding of the process 
of identification and measurement of 
provisions and contingent liabilities 
relating 
to 
ongoing 
litigations 
implemented by the Management, 
through various discussions held with 
Company’s legal and finance personnel.
Tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the controls put in 
place by the management in relation 
to assessment of the outcome of the 
pending litigations.
Inspected the summary of litigation 
matters 
and 
discussed 
key 
developments during the year with the 
Company’s Legal and Finance personnel.

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key 
audit matter
Since 
the 
amounts 
involved 
are 
significant and due to the range of 
possible outcomes leading to high 
estimation uncertainty that requires 
significant management and auditor 
judgement, this matter is considered 
to be a key audit matter for the current 
year audit.
Inspected 
and 
evaluated, 
where 
applicable, 
external 
legal 
and/
or 
regulatory 
advice 
sought 
by 
the 
Company. 
Obtained 
direct 
confirmations from the dealing lawyers 
for certain material ongoing litigations.
Discussed 
and 
challenged 
the 
management’s 
assessment 
of 
the 
likelihood, magnitude and accounting 
of any liability that may arise in 
certain material cases. Accordingly, 
we reviewed the amount of provisions 
recognised and contingent liabilities 
disclosed in the standalone financial 
statements 
and 
exercised 
our 
professional 
judgment 
to 
assess 
appropriateness of such conclusions, 
involving experts as required.
Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures 
made in the  Company’s standalone 
financial statements in accordance with 
the applicable accounting standards.
2.
Property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets (including capital 
work in progress)
As at 31st March 2023 the Company has 
Property, Plant and Equipment (‘PPE’), 
Intangible Asset (‘IA’) and Capital Work-
in-Progress (‘CWIP’) with carrying value 
of  INR 67,091.46 crores, INR 1,521.02 
crores, INR 4,891.36 crores, respectively, 
as disclosed in note 4, note 7 and note 
5 of the accompanying Standalone 
Financial Statements. Refer note 3.1 
for the accounting policies adopted 
by the Company for recognition and 
measurement of such non-current 
assets.
Determination 
of 
carrying 
values 
and 
their 
respective 
depreciation 
and amortisation amounts of PPE, 
IA and CWIP requires considerable 
management 
judgement. 
These 
include the decisions to capitalise 
or expense costs, the annual asset 
life review, the timeliness of the 
capitalisation of assets and the use 
of management’s assumptions and 
estimates for the determination and 
measurement of assets retired from 
active use, in accordance with the 
requirements of Ind AS 16 – Property, 
Plant and Equipment (‘Ind AS 16’) and 
Ind AS 38 – Intangible Assets (‘Ind AS 
38’).
The carrying value of CWIP also 
includes balances pertaining to long-
term projects which requires careful 
examination of continuity and viability 
of such projects.
Considering 
the 
significance 
of 
amounts involved in the context of 
the balance sheet of the Company and 
the level of judgements and estimates 
required, we consider this to be a key 
audit matter in the current year audit.
Our audit procedures included, but 
were not limited to the following:
Obtained an  understanding of the 
management’s process of recording 
the transactions pertaining to capital 
expenditure incurred by the company 
and evaluated the accounting policies 
adopted by the company in accordance 
with the requirements of Ind AS 16 and 
Ind AS 38
Tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the controls put in 
place by the management in relation to 
the above process.
Tested 
the 
amounts 
capitalized 
during the year, on a sample basis, by 
inspecting supporting documents and 
evaluating whether assets capitalized 
satisfied the recognition criteria and 
were recognized accurately in the 
correct periods and with correct 
amounts.
Reviewed the judgements made by 
management 
in 
determination 
of 
carrying values of the specified non-
current assets including the nature 
of 
underlying 
costs 
capitalized, 
determination of realizable value of 
the assets retired from active use, the 
appropriateness of useful lives applied 
in the calculation of depreciation as 
determined by technical assessment 
by management and external technical 
experts, where required, and evaluation 
of appropriateness of long standing 
CWIP balances pertaining to long-term 
projects
Evaluated the appropriateness and 
adequacy of the related disclosures in 
the standalone financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable 
accounting standards.

By-products inventory
Refer to note 3.8 of summary of 
significant accounting policies and 
other 
explanatory 
information 
for 
accounting policy for valuation of by-
products amounting to INR 4,989.64 
crores as at 31st March 2023 and 
significant 
accounting 
judgements, 
estimates and assumptions related 
thereto and the note 3.25.4 of the 
standalone financial statements. 
Inventories of by-products mainly 
consist of sub- grade fines, iron and 
steel scrap embedded in BF slag and LD 
slag and slime, and tailings containing 
iron ore fines, which are accumulated 
in stock piles.
Further, as explained in notes 49.10, 
pursuant to the order of Ministry of 
Mines, Government of India dated 16th 
September 2019, certain by-products 
were allowed to be sold and hence, 
were valued for the first time in the 
previous years.
The management of the Company also 
sought the opinion of Expert Advisory 
Committee of the ICAI (‘EAC Opinions’) 
in the previous year and current year 
on recognition and measurement of 
by-product inventories. 
Valuation of such items requires 
management to exercise significant 
judgement in respect of use of 
estimates for determination of the 
quantity, quality and valuation rate of 
these items. 
Further, basis the expected future 
saleability 
and 
plans 
for 
captive 
consumption 
of 
such 
by-product 
inventories, 
the 
management 
has 
classified inventory expected to be 
sold / consumed after 12 months from 
the date of balance sheet, being the 
operating cycle of the Company, as 
non-current inventory. 
Owing to the insignificant movement 
in sales / consumption of such by-
products inventory, the materiality 
of the carrying value thereof and the 
complexities discussed above, we have 
considered this area as a key audit 
matter in the current year audit. 
Further, the management’s assessment 
of classification and valuation of 
aforesaid inventory as described in 
note 49.10 is considered fundamental 
to the understanding of the users of the 
standalone financial statements.
Our audit procedures included, but 
were not limited to the following:
Obtained an understanding of the 
processes and procedures, including 
controls relating to sub grade fines, 
iron and steel scrap embedded in BF 
slag and LD slag and slime containing 
iron ore fines (‘by-products’).
–	
Evaluated the accounting policy 
adopted by the Company for 
valuation 
of 
the 
by-product 
inventory 
in 
accordance 
with 
the requirements of Ind AS 2, 
Inventory in conjunction with the 
EAC Opinions obtained by the 
management. 
–	
In 
assessing 
management’s 
assessment 
of 
the 
value 
of 
by-products, 
we 
discussed 
in 
detail 
with 
the 
management 
to understand the procedures 
adopted 
in 
ascertaining 
the 
quantity and quality (including 
gradation) of the by- products 
considered for valuation.
–	
Management’s estimate of the 
NRV was verified with reference 
to the average selling price (ASP) 
published by the Indian Bureau of 
Mines. We also obtained technical 
analysis 
report 
from 
external 
experts sought by management 
for determining the quantity of by- 
products and the chemical analysis 
report used by the management 
for arriving at the quality (including 
gradation) of fines. 
–	
Obtained 
management’s 
working 
of 
estimated 
future 
sales / consumption used for 
classification of the by- product 
inventory 
between 
current 
and noncurrent, and tested the 
underlying assumptions basis our 
understanding of the processing 
and further approvals required for 
sale of such inventory in addition 
to 
evaluating 
management’s 
estimates 
on 
availability 
of 
demand for such by-products.
–	
Evaluated 
the 
appropriateness 
and adequacy of the related 
disclosures 
in 
the 
standalone 
financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable accounting 
standards. (Also refer to Para 1 
of sub-directions in Annexure-3 
attached)

therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those charged with Governance for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
11.	 The accompanying standalone financial statements have been approved by the 
Company’s Board of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible 
for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
and presentation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies, 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent, and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error
12.	 In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate 
the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
13.	 Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial 
reporting process.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone financial statements
14.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with Standards on Auditing (Sas) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
Standalone Financial Statements.
15.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing, specified under section 
143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control;
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls; 
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management;
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Director’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained upto the date of our auditors’ report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a 
going concern;
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone 
Financial Statements including the disclosures, and whether the standalone 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.

complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
18.	 From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters

branches / units / marketing regions included in the standalone financial statements, 
whose annual financial statements/ financial information reflects total assets and net

crores, total comprehensive income of INR 281.71 crores and cash inflows (net) of 
INR 3.39 crores for the year then ended, as considered in the standalone financial

the branch auditors, whose reports have been furnished to us by the management, 
and our opinion on the standalone financial statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts and disclosures included in respect of branches, and our report in terms 
of sub-section (3) of section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid

In terms of the information and explanations sought by us and given by the Company and the books of 
account and records examined by us in the normal course of audit and based on the consideration of the 
reports of the branch auditors and, to the best of our knowledge and belief, we report that: 
(i)	
(a)	 (A)	 The Company has maintained proper records showing full particulars,   including quantitative 
details and situation of property, plant and equipment, right of use assets and investment 
property except in respect of certain lands where area and location needs to be updated in 
the fixed assets register. Further, the area in respect of these lands need to be reconciled with 
the records of the authorities in the respective States and wherein, as informed to us by the 
management, the delay is due to procedural matters involved
(B)	 The Company has maintained proper records showing full particulars of intangible assets.
(b)	 The Company has a regular programme of physical verification of its property, plant and 
equipment, right of use assets and investment property under which the assets are physically 
verified in a phased manner over a period of three years, which, in our opinion, is reasonable 
having regard to the size of the Company and the nature of its assets. In accordance with this 
programme, certain property, plant and equipment, right of use assets and investment property 
were verified during the year and no material discrepancies were noticed on such verification. 
However, there are certain land and buildings which are under encroachment/unauthorised 
occupation and hence, were not subjected to physical verification
(c)	 The title deeds of all the immovable properties (including investment properties) held by the 
Company (other than properties where the Company is the lessee and the lease agreements are 
duly executed in favour of the lessee) disclosed in note 4,4a  and 48.1(B) to the standalone financial 
statements are held in the name of the Company, except for the following properties, for which the 
Company’s management is in the process of getting the registration in the name of the Company:

Management’s Replies
Independent auditors’ report on the internal financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) 
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of Steel Authority of India Limited 
(‘the Company’) as at and for the year ended 31st March 2023, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the Company as at that date. 
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for internal financial controls
2.	
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of the Company’s business, including adherence to the Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ responsibility for the audit of the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements 
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing issued by the ICAI prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, and the Guidance 
Note issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements includes obtaining an understanding 
of such internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch 
auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other matter paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
7.	
 Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

Questions
Auditor’s Comment

transactions outside IT system on 
the integrity of the accounts along 
with the financial implications, if 
any, may be stated.
The Company uses SAP software for processing accounting 
transactions at five integrated steel plants, Central Marketing 
Organisations and Head Office. In respect of other plants / 
units, the Company uses legacy software systems. Based on 
our audit and based on reports received from the branch 
auditors, wherever the accounting transactions are based on 
workings outside IT system, no instances of lack of integrity 
of accounts and no financial implications have been noted / 
reported
2.
Whether there is any restructuring 
of an existing loan or cases of 
waiver/write-off of debts/loans/
interest etc., made by a lender 
to the Company due to the 
Company’s inability to repay the 
loan? If yes, the financial impact 
may be stated
As per information and explanations given to us by the

Sub-Direction under section 143(5) of the Companies Act 2013
1.
Considering the slow movement 
and uncertainty in liquidation of 
the stock of sub-grade iron ore fines 
by the company during last three 
years from the old dump of sub-
grade iron ore fines and absence of 
permission of the State Government 
of Jharkhand for sale of this fine 
from the mines located in the state, 
following may be examined:
i)
Whether valuation of such sub-
grade iron ore fines is continued 
in the Balance Sheet of SAIL as 
on 31st March 2023. If yes, it may 
be stated whether the valuation 
is appropriate and reasonable 
in view of quantum of sale and 
demand as well as age of the stock 
of sub-grade iron ore fines lying 
at different captive mines of the 
Company.
Yes, valuation of such sub-grade iron ore fines is continued 
in the Balance Sheet of Steel Authority of India Limited as on 
31st March 2023.
As explained in note 49.10 of the standalone financial 
statements, based on the opinions taken by the Company 
from the Additional Solicitor General of India as well as the 
Expert Advisory Committee (EAC) of Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI), the Company recognized these 
inventories as by-product inventory as at 31st March 2020 
and since, these inventories were generated over many 
years, hence, making it impracticable to ascertain the 
actual valuation, the Company assigned a valuation to such 
inventories basis average selling price of similar sub-grade 
fines over the last 36 months as declared by Indian Bureau 
of Mines (IBM), a Government of India organisation and as 
adjusted for royalty and other selling costs.
Further, as explained in the note, while, on an overall basis 
during the current and the previous year, there has been 
insignificant movement in the volume of such inventories, 
there is significant market demand for sub-grade fines and 
the recent sales price trends are indicative of considerable 
margins over and above the carrying value of such inventories. 
As informed by the management in the process  of getting 
permission for issuance of transit pass in Jharkhand, the 
company has approached the concerned authorities to make 
the necessary modification in the portal to facilitate generation

of transit pass for movement of goods. Further, considering 
the market volatility, steel market dynamics, possibility 
of future additions to steel and pellet making capacity 
in the country which may augment the demand of these 
materials, the carrying value of these inventories can’t 
be adjusted for any unforeseeable changes in the future 
prices. Additionally, the management also has plans to set 
up a beneficiation and palettization plant in future that will 
consume significant volume of sub-grade fines annually. 
Moreover, in order to establish the usability of Dump Fines 
at Gua, fresh assessment of quality and quantity through a 
NABL accredited agency was carried out during 2021-22. 
The average quality of Dump Fines at Gua is confirming to 
60-62% Fe Grade. The quality of the subgrade fines have not 
deteriorated with passage of time as mentioned above. Fines 
of such quality are in high demand across the steel industry. 
The management’s assessment of classification and valuation 
of aforesaid inventory as described in note 49.10 is also 
considered fundamental to the understanding of the users of 
the standalone financial statements. Also refer to “Key audit 
matters” section of our main report.
ii)
Whether there was sale of sizeable 
quantity 
in 
comparison 
with 
the entire quantity valued to 
determine the realistic market 
rate?
There is insignificant movement of sub-grade iron ore fines 
during the year in comparison with the entire quantity 
valued. However, for the reasons mentioned in note 49.10, in 
view of the management, there is no adjustment required in 
the carrying value of these inventories at this stage.
2 (i)
Whether uniform practice and 
reporting was followed by all 
the Joint Statutory Auditors like 
addressee of the Independent 
Auditors’ Report, Title of the Audit 
Report while issuing Independent 
Auditors Report on the audit 
of financial statements of steel 
plants/units of SAIL?
Uniform practice and reporting was followed by all the Joint 
Statutory Auditors like addressee of the Independent Auditors’ 
Report, Title of the Audit Report while issuing Independent 
Auditors Report on the audit of financial statements of steel 
plants / units of the Company in accordance with Revised 
Standard on Auditing 700, Forming an opinion and Reporting 
on Financial Statements (‘SA 700’), except in respect of three 
units, being a) Corporate Office, b) Alloy Steels Plant and 
c) Central Marketing Organisation, for which the auditors 
have issued an audit report under ‘Standard on Auditing 
800, Special Considerations - Audits of Financial Statements 
Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks 
(‘SA 800’). However, the level of assurance provided through 
all the audit reports issued by all the Joint Statutory auditors 
in respect of all the steel plants/ units is equal and uniform.
2(ii)
Whether Basis of Preparation 
of Financial Statements of all 
the steel plants/units of the 
Company was uniform? Whether 
preparation of unit accounts of 
three units (Corporate office, Alloy 
Steels Plant and Central Marketing 
Organisation of SAIL) out of 13 
units of SAIL in accordance with 
Guidance note on Combined and 
Carved out Financial Statements 
was as per requirement and 
justified?
The Company follows uniform accounting policies for 
preparation of financial statements for all the steel plants/ units.
Approach of joint statutory auditors – Walker Chandiok 
& Co LLP
With regards to preparation of unit accounts of three units, 
being a) Corporate Office, b) Alloy Steels Plant and c) Central 
Marketing Organisation, the statutory joint auditor for such 
units, is of the view that the different steel plants / units of 
the Company, represent subsets of the reporting entity, SAIL, 
and thus, are covered by the definition of ‘Carve-out business’ 
as per paragraph 9 of the Guidance note on Combined and 
Carved out Financial Statements (‘the Guidance Note’). The 
carve-out financial statements, as per the Guidance Note 
are identified to be special purpose financial statements 
(refer paragraph 8 of the Guidance Note) and is based on 
the adjustments made by the management for allocation of 
various elements of income and expenses to the respective 
units through the IT system used for maintaining accounts. 
Such special purpose financial statements are then 
aggregated to prepare the standalone financial statements of 
the company as a whole.
The relevant guidance / definitions from the Guidance Note 
have been reproduced below for ease of reference–
Paragraph 3: The combined/carve-out financial statements 
can include financial information pertaining to different 
entities, divisions, branches and/or an aggregation of similar 
assets, associated liabilities and operations in a specified 
geographic region or line of business pertaining to different 
entities. These financial statements can be prepared by 
aggregating financial statements of segments, separate 
entities or components of groups which may not necessarily 
have separate management and accounting records.

Paragraph 8: Scope
This Guidance Note should not be construed to be applicable 
to the general purpose financial statements as the combined/
carve-out financial statements are prepared for specific 
purposes and, therefore, are ‘special purpose financial 
statements’.
Paragraph 9: Definitions
Carve-out business: For the purpose of this Guidance 
Note and notwithstanding the definition of ‘business’ as 
contained in Ind AS 103, Business Combinations, the term 
‘carve-out business’ refers to an identifiable set of assets and 
liabilities, pertaining to an economic activity carved out of 
the aggregate activities of an entity. A division, segment, 
or business activity of an entity may also signify a carve-out 
business.
Carve-out Financial Statements: Carve-out financial 
statements are the financial statements pertaining to a carve-
out business.
However, it is pertinent to note that reporting under SA 
800 also requires applying requirements of all other SAs 
including SA 700 (refer paragraphs 1, 3, 9, 10 and 11 of SA 
800), and thus, in effect, other than taking into account 
special considerations in applying the requirements of other 
SAs, pursuant to the adoption of a special purpose financial 
reporting framework by the reporting entity, the level of 
assurance provided through all the audit reports issued by all 
the Joint Statutory auditors in respect of all the steel plants/
units as equal and uniform.
 
Approach of Joint Statutory auditors – Tej, Raj & Pal, S. 
Jaykishan and KASG & Co.
The appointment as statutory auditors was made under 
Section 139 of the Companies Act 2013 for the financial year 
2022-23 vide letter dated 26th August 2022 in exercise of 
the powers conferred by Section 139 of the Companies Act 
2013 (“Act”). We were appointed as statutory/ joint statutory/ 
Branch auditors of the Company as per Annexure – II for 
Consolidation of SAIL Accounts and respective units. As such, 
we are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of 
Section 143 of the Act. As per the provisions of Section 143(8) 
of the Act, “the branch auditor shall prepare a report on the 
accounts of the branch examined by him and send it to the 
auditor of the company who shall deal with it in his report in 
such manner as he considers necessary”.
Accordingly, the auditor’s report of the respective units 
audited by the joint statutory auditors - Tej, Raj & Pal, S. 
Jaykishan and KASG & Co. and the units audited by the 
branch auditors was issued in compliance with SA 700. The 
financial statements of the respective units are prepared in 
accordance with general purpose framework. Examples of 
special purpose frameworks as provided in paragraph A1 
of SA 800 are not applicable to the financial statements of 
the respective units. Reference may also be made to the 
publication on “Guidance note on Bank Audit” issued by 
ICAI wherein the illustrative format of report of the Branch 
Auditor of a bank is drafted in compliance with SA 700.
Further, the joint statutory auditors - Tej, Raj & Pal, S. Jaykishan 
and KASG & Co. – are of the view that financial statements 
of the branch cannot be considered as “carve-out financial 
statements” in respect of a “carve-out business” referred to in 
the Guidance Note on Combined and Carved out Financial 
Statements. 
The situations warranting the preparation of combined/ 
carve-out financial statements, as indicated in paragraph 
13 of the Guidance Note, do not apply to the financial 
statements of the respective units. Paragraph 13 suggests 
that the carve-out financial statements are required pursuant 
to the specific requirements of the management in scenarios 
where a restructuring of a division is undertaken.

Management’s Replies
Paragraph-13
Carve-out financial statements may be prepared for one 
or more divisions, segments, businesses, etc. of the same 
entity. Examples where carve-out financial statements may 
be required to be prepared are demerger, spin-off, hiving off 
or any other related restructuring of a segment/ divisions/ 
business of the same entity or acquisition of a segment/ 
division/ business of another entity. 
The purpose of the Guidance note is to provide guidance 
on procedure of preparation of the carve-out financial 
statements including basis of allocating transaction amounts 
and balances. In the case of the Company, separate books 
of accounts are maintained by each of the units and there 
is no question of carving out the financial statements. Each 
unit maintains its distinct set of books and records. Therefore, 
the concept of ‘carving out’ financial statements doesn’t 
apply here. In other words, each unit operates and records its 
financial transactions independently, negating the need to 
separate or ‘carve-out’ its financial information from a larger, 
consolidated set of accounts.
Joint Statement of all Joint Statutory auditors – Walker 
Chandiok & Co LLP, Tej, Raj & Pal, S. Jaykishan and KASG 
& Co.
It is pertinent to note that while the approach appears to be 
different as above, the resultant financial information is the 
same for the units under the two approaches.
Further, as mentioned above, even the level of assurance 
issued through the respective audit reports is the same under 
the two approaches.

Pursuance 
to 
Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/ CMD1/ CIR/ P/2018/ 
0000000141 dated 15th November, 2018, SAIL 
does not perceive any risk with respect to 
commodities, as it has taken adequate steps to 
ensure uninterrupted supply of major materials. 
However, in case of imported coking coal, there 
is a risk of interruption in supply as there are 
limited number of vendors and bulk supply from 
one geographical area. Action is being taken to 
increase vendor base through EOI route and 
increase coal basket by exploring new coal 
producing countries from different geographies 
like Russia, Mongolia, etc. For iron ore, SAIL has 
its own captive iron ore mines which meet its 
requirement. Similarly, for refractories and ferro-
alloys, SAIL has its own captive Plants and SAIL is 
procuring limestone under Long Term Agreement.

Environment
1
Conserving 
water 
by 
recycling and reusing
R
Production processes at SAIL involve 
consumption of water from different 
sources. To ensure that there is proper 
usage and no non-compliance with 
respect to regulatory requirements, 
it is identified this as an important 
material issue.
Across all SAIL Plants, substantial 
investments 
are 
being 
made 
to 
achieve the long-term goal of “Zero 
Liquid Discharge”  through adequate 
treatment and recycling of effluent 
being discharged through the outfalls 
at the Plant boundary
Negative
2
Reducing 
greenhouse 
gas emissions & carbon 
footprint
R
Transition to low carbon steel making 
is an important factor for the long-
term success of the Company. Hence 
this is identified as an important 
material issue.
SAIL is taking the steps to substantially 
reduce CO2 emission and increase the 
share of renewable / non conventional 
energy by 2030 as well as to achieve net 
zero emission by 2070.
Negative
Social
3
Upholding human rights in 
operations and supply chain
R
As a steel manufacturing company 
with plants operational in multiple 
locations, SAIL has a vast pool of 
human resources to cater to. As a 
result of this, it becomes important 
to address all human rights related 
concerns across all locations in 
compliance with norms under ILO. 
Any form of non-compliance can 
lead to reputational damage for the 
company and hence is an important 
material issue.

Providing fair and equal 
wages
O
Employees at SAIL are treated equally 
irrespective of caste, creed, colour 
or gender. Fair and equal treatment 
is critical for all our employees at

i.e ISO 45001:2018 certification. The 
Company 
makes

SAIL has not conducted any independent assessment/evaluation of the working of its policies by any external agency. However, SAIL, being a government 
company, is subject to review & audit by C&AG of India across various areas/functions of the organization which also encompasses various policies as per 
the NGRBC guidelines. Material Non- compliances find mention in their report and placed in the Parliament. The processes and compliances are reviewed 
by internal auditors and regulatory compliances , as applicable. Further, SAIL has rich technical expertise in its domain of operations and accordingly peer 
review is being done by their other plants. From a best practices perspective as well as from a risk perspective, policies are periodically evaluated and 
updated. An internal assessment of the workings of the policies is being done at regular intervals. Additionally, SAIL has engaged Safety Management 
Consultant for safety culture transformation at its Plants in Bhilai, Rourkela & Bokaro and is in the process of being followed up in other Steel plants.

2.	 	
a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?  (Yes/No)
	
	
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
Yes. SAIL has been a pioneer in the establishment of the Environment Management System (EMS) in the steel industry 
in the Country. All the Integrated Steel Plants, major Mines/Units and warehouses of SAIL are compliant with EMS ISO: 
14001 Standard. Further, all mines are accredited with Integrated Management System (IMS) combining all aspects 
under ISO-9001, ISO-14001 & ISO-45001. The mines are also having IBM star rating. The procurement of majority of coal 
is done from the international market of the advanced economies which are compliant with the global sustainable 
standards. Other inputs like Iron Ore, Limestone etc. are all sourced from organizations having robust ESG practices. 
	
All these practices described above have enabled SAIL to establish procedures for sustainable sourcing. 
	
To secure transparent and sustainable procurement, proactive measures are undertaken like on boarding vendors on 
GeM (Government e-Marketplace) for which over 19,000 vendor records were shared with GeM, organizing exclusive 
awareness programs for vendors (refractory / ancillary, etc.), encouraging sense of competition among Plants / Units for 
procurements, empanelment, review and updation of vendor database, etc.
3.	 	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
	
SAIL has adopted the “4R’s Policy” (Reduce, Recover, Recycle and Reuse) across all its processes and is committed to its 
Corporate Environmental Policy to reduce solid waste generation and maximize its utilization to 100%.
	
	
As a commitment towards the 4R’s Policy, various steps undertaken by SAIL are as follows: 
	
a.	 Iron and Steel Slag: The iron slag and steel slag are the two major contributors towards solid waste generation. To 
ensure reuse and safe disposal, the granulated BF slag is used in cement industry as a substitute of clinker. This way 
100% utilization of iron slag through cement industry is achieved after it is granulated. Various avenues for use of BOF 
Slag as soil ameliorant, in rural road making, in cement making, as rail track blast are being explored.
	
b.	 Solid Waste (other than Slag): Solid wastes like mill scales, BF flue dust, and waste refractory bricks are utilized fully. 
SAIL is also working towards utilizing Municipal wastes in an environment friendly way. Three of Steel Plants have 
installed bio-digesters for processing of canteen wastes daily, resulting in safe disposal of biodegradable wastes 
from the canteens inside plant premises. These bio-digesters convert the biodegradable solid wastes into compost, 
which is then used as manure for horticulture.
	
c.	 E-Waste: SAIL being a bulk consumer of Electrical and Electrical Equipment generated an appreciable quantity of 
e-wastes during FY 2022-23 and its environmentally sound management was done in accordance with the applicable 
E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. 
	
	
The procedure for handling and disposal of e-wastes as per the rule is available with the concerned departments of 
each Plant and Unit and has already been in practice. Nodal agencies were identified internally to facilitate collection 
of the wastes and dispatch of the same thereafter to the place designated centrally for its storage.
	
	
In line with the rule, record of e-wastes is being maintained in the Form-2. The e-waste is then channelised through 
authorised collection centres or dealers of authorised producers or authorised dismantlers or recyclers or through 
the designated take back service provider of the producer to authorised dismantler or recycler. 
	
	
As per the notified rule, annual return in the Form-3 has been submitted to the respective State Pollution Control 
Board on or before the 30th day of June following the financial year to which that return relates.
180
	
d.	 Hazardous Waste:  Wastes which are hazardous in nature due to their physical and/or chemical characteristics are 
safely disposed as per the rules of the “Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) 
Rules, 2016” and its amendments, either in the Secured Landfill Facility (SLF) or through the authorized agency dealing 
with Treatment, Storage and Disposal of hazardous wastes. Some hazardous wastes are reused/co-processed.
	
d.	 Packaging Waste: Usually packaging material is dispatched along with consignment to customers; the loose/left 
over packaging after dispatching of products are disposed-off sustainably from warehouses at regular intervals
	
Various R&D initiatives either through in-house research wing or in association with other research centres or academies 
of national repute are being undertaken to improve upon the BOF slag utilization. Some notable amongst the R&D 
initiatives are given below:  
	
a.	 Utilization of steel slag in construction of rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)  
	
b.	 Development of steel slag based cost effective eco-friendly fertilizers for sustainable agriculture and inclusive 
growth in association ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)  
	
c.	 Study on use of composite slag (mix of BF slag and BOF slag) for making of Portland Slag Cement (PSC) 
4.	 	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, EPR is applicable to the activities of SAIL.     
	
All Integrated Steel Plants of SAIL have obtained the EPR registration number from CPCB as per amended Schedule-II 
rule of the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment), Rules-2022. The guideline says any importer who imports material 
with plastic packaging is obligated to obtain registration in the centralized portal of CPCB.
	
SAIL gets most of the imported items wrapped in plastic packaging and it falls under the purview of obligations of 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Importers who are not directly associated with plastic packaging but are 
importing goods wrapped in plastic packaging are required to upload the EPR registration certificate in the Customs 
Portal, without which the clearance of goods are not  permitted.

have ISO 45001:2018 certification, and the coverage is as required by the system. In line with the statutory requirements/
regulations/guidelines/polices, SAIL makes constant efforts to avert all illnesses and accidents related to the workplace. 
Accordingly, health and safety are crucial components of all its operations. It aids in risk assessment and offers safeguards 
against health and safety issues in operations and activities. Internal and surveillance audits and evaluations are conducted 
on a regular basis, which leads to continuous improvement in safety systems, standards, and performance.

b.	 Inspections   
	
c.	 Audits   
	
d.	 Safety Observation & Behavioral Intervention rounds 
	
e.	 ROKO-TOKO drives & campaigns 
c. 	 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes. Central to our operations is a steadfast commitment to ensuring the safety and welfare of our employees. Our 
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) procedure, crafted for both routine and specialized tasks, guarantees 
that each team member is equipped with knowledge and protection to perform their duties effectively. We routinely 
revise our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) & Safe Method Procedures (SMPs) based on continuous feedback, 
reflecting our proactive stance in enhancing workplace safety.
	
Communication is key in our safety strategy. Workers are not only encouraged but also provided with incentives to 
report any perceived hazards or anomalies. Leveraging contemporary technologies, such as safety portals and mobile 
applications, we ensure real-time and efficient reporting of workplace hazards.
	
Our ‘ZERO TOLERANCE RULES’ and ‘LIFE SAVING RULES’ serve as a firm assertion of our commitment to safety standards. 
Moreover, workers are empowered and advised to distance themselves from situations they deem hazardous, 
underscoring our belief in placing their safety above all else.
d.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
	
SAIL has a Safety Policy to ensure that its employees and the people associated with them, such as those residing in the 
vicinity of Plants, Units and Mines are protected. A dedicated Board Sub-Committee on Health, Safety & Environment 
(BSC on HSE) is in place to review the policy, procedures and systems on Health, Safety and Environment matters. 
At corporate level, SAIL Safety Organisation (SSO) centrally monitors and guides the Plants & Units in safety efforts. 
Every Monday, performance on safety parameters is reviewed at the highest level at each Plant / Unit. In line with this 
commitment, systematic approach to safety is adopted and workplace hazards have been identified, risks assessed 
and accordingly, control measures are taken on continuous basis to bring the risk to an acceptable level. Good Safety 
Practices (G-SaPs) are identified from the Steel industry and are implemented at different levels. Various kinds of 
initiatives & drives/campaigns are undertaken on regular basis in all the Plants, Units & Mines to ensure safe working 
and continual improvement in the safety performance.

Stakeholders are an integral part of the company’s growth strategy. Engagement with stakeholders is crucial to identify 
risks and develop a management plan for integration into the company’s business model. At SAIL, a rigorous Stakeholder 
Engagement approach is being followed, which entails identifying and capturing stakeholders; assessing and evaluating 
their views; prioritizing key material issues; identifying sustainability indicators; preparing action plans; implementation 
and communication. 
	
The identification of the various stakeholders is largely based on their material influence on the business strategy and

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
SAIL believes that effective stakeholder engagement is essential for inclusive growth. The Company aims to strengthen its 
relationships with key stakeholders, such as government, shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, communities, 
NGOs, academics, consultants, competitors, and financial institutions.
	
SAIL engages with stakeholders through a variety of channels, from daily interaction with employees to Annual General 
Meetings (AGMs). The Company also has dedicated Board Sub-Committees to deal with economic, environmental, and 
social topics. These Sub-Committees meet regularly to discuss and address identified issues. Recommendations from 
the meetings are presented to the Board for approval, and an effective follow-up mechanism keeps the Board apprised 
of the actions taken.
	
An effective engagement mechanism is incorporated in the Stakeholder Engagement Matrix. This matrix anchors 
stakeholder engagement on the following principles:
	
Completeness: Understanding key concerns of stakeholders and their expectations, and transparent and balanced 
reporting.
	
Materiality: Prioritized consideration of the economic, environmental, and social impacts identified to be important to 
the stakeholders as well as the Company.
	
Responsiveness: Responding coherently and transparently to such issues and concerns.
	
In addition to these principles, SAIL uses numerous modes to engage with its both internal and external stakeholders in 
a constructive manner and consciously captures their expectations. Frequent interaction with stakeholders, especially 
suppliers, allows the Company to recognize focus areas and strengthen relationships with them. The Company has 
adopted Customer Satisfaction Index and Employee Satisfaction as a few of the metrics and methodologies to gauge 
and quantify the stakeholders’ feedback. The outcomes of the feedback received are integrated into the organization’s 
medium- and long-term strategy and planning. The Company strives to meet the identified goals for the shared growth 
of the Company and society.
	
Customer feedback also goes into forming the basis for product improvement, product, and services development 
necessary for customer retention, market penetration, and growth.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics. 
	
At SAIL we have conducted Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality Assessment for 109 employees. Stakeholder 
engagement is an essential element for the sustainability strategy that helps the company to learn from its stakeholders 
to identify and manage risks, to build trust and strong relationships and to identify ways to improve its performance. 
The Company tries to understand where business interests overlap with the sustainability priorities of a Company’s 
stakeholders. Basis the surveys, we have highlighted materiality topics and are taking them into consideration.

Programs (VDPs). Further, Special Vendor Development Programs targeted towards developing a supportive ecosystem 
to SC/ST entrepreneurs were conducted in collaboration with National SC/ST Hub Office (NSSHO) along with participation 
from Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industries and TICCI (Tribal Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industries) where 
procurement procedure and vendor registration procedures were explained to intended beneficiaries.
	
During these meets, the vendors are also informed about the requirements of SAIL, items reserved for SC ST / Women 
vendors, registration procedures, benefits available to SC/ST and Women MSEs etc. SAIL has also been actively 
participating in conclaves organized by NSSHO for SC/ST entrepreneurs.
	
Officials of Invoice Mart are also invited to some SVDPs to inform the participants regarding benefits of bill discounting 
through TReDS. SAIL has organized 24 VDPs and 19 SVDPS in FY 2022-23.
	
SAIL Plants also provide support to local MSEs by mentoring, training, hand-holding and by providing technical support. 
SAIL is also incentivizing the local MSMEs (located in the same district as our 5 ISPs) by making steel available to them at 
affordable & competitive prices with suitable commercial terms to accelerate industrial growth of the region.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
SAIL is committed to its Corporate Environmental Policy to reduce solid waste generation and maximise its utilisation 
to achieve 100%. SAIL thus adopted the “4R’s Policy” (Reduce, Recover, Recycle and Reuse) across all its processes 
in order to improve sustainability of the industry. The iron slag and steel slag are the two major contributors towards 
solid waste generation. 100% utilization of iron slag through cement industries is achieved after it is granulated. On 
the other hand, BOF slag is used internally in blast furnace & steel melting shop as a partial replacement of limestone 
and in sinter making through base-mix. Solid wastes like mill scale and lime/dolo fines are recycled entirely through 
sinter making process and waste refractory bricks are fully utilized through either selling to external agencies or reusing 
internally. Various R&D based studies have been/are being taken up by SAIL either through in-house research wing or 
in association with other research centres or academies of national repute to explore potential avenues for enhancing 
BOF slag utilization. Wastes, hazardous in nature by reasons of their physical and/or chemical characteristics are safely 
disposed as per the rules of the “Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016”, 
either in captive Secured Landfill Facility (SLF) or through the authorized recyclers dealing with Treatment, Storage and 
Disposal of hazardous wastes. Some hazardous wastes are reused/co-processed.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
Environment-friendly 
disposal of waste plastics 
through 
Coke 
Oven 
Batteries at Bhilai Steel 
Plant
A pilot scale facility for charging of waste plastic granules was 
installed at Coal Handling Plant-II of Bhilai Steel Plant with in-
house research wing RDCIS. The waste plastics is utilised in 
the form of granules along with coal in coke making process. 
By this process, waste plastic granules do not burn rather 
decompose in the coking chamber along with carbonisation 
of coal, in absence of air at high temperature.
This initiative will help in recycling of large 
amount of waste plastics in the coke oven 
batteries with no adverse effect on the 
environment and added advantage of better 
coking properties.
2.
Eco-labelling 
of 
steel 
TMT rebar, a product of 
Merchant Mill at DSP
Durgapur Steel Plant is the first PSU steel plant in Indian steel 
sector, of which steel TMT rebar, a product of its Merchant Mill 
is certified with the ‘GreenPro’ instituted by the Confederation 
of Indian Industry (CII). GreenPro Ecolabel is accredited by 
Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN) through GENICES – GEN’s 
Internationally Coordinated Ecolabelling System.
This initiative enables the end users in the 
building sector and manufacturing industries 
to choose right products, materials and 
technologies for reducing the environment 
impacts during the construction, operation and 
maintenance of their buildings and factories.

(CCUS) is one of the technologies that can 
mitigate offset the carbon emission from the iron 
and steel industry and has immense potential to 
help India meet its emission targets as per NDC, 
while ensuring the sustainability of the sectors 
critical to growth of the Indian economy. This 
would prove to be an important milestone in 
SAIL’s journey towards carbon neutrality.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023
1.   		
Corporate Information 
	
	
Nature of Operation
	
Steel Authority of India Limited (‘SAIL’ or the ‘Parent 
Company’), a public sector undertaking conferred 
with Maharatna status by Government of India 
and it’s  subsidiaries (the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries together referred to as the ‘Group’), it’s 
joint ventures and it’s associate  is engaged primarily 
in steel manufacturing business in the country.
	
General information and statement of compliance 
with Ind AS
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group 
and joint ventures & associate have been prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS)  prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013,  read with Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) 
and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. The Group has uniformly applied the 
accounting policies during the periods presented. 
	
These consolidated financial statements (the ‘financial 
statements’) for the year ended 31st March, 2023 were 
approved by the Board of Directors and authorised 
for issue in their meeting held on 25th May, 2023. 
2.	
Summary of significant accounting policies
	
a)	 Overall consideration
	
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared using the significant accounting policies 
and measurement bases summarised below, which 
were applied uniformly during the period presented:
	
	
Basis of preparation
	
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on going concern basis under the historical 
cost basis except for the following assets and liabilities 
which have been measured at fair value in accordance 
with the requirements of the relevant Ind AS:
	
•	
certain financial assets and liabilities which are 
classified as fair value through profit and loss or 
fair value through other comprehensive income;
	
•	
assets held for sale, at the lower of the carrying 
amounts and fair value less cost to sell;
	
•	
defined benefit plans-plan assets measured at fair 
value.
	
	
Basis of consolidation
	
	
Subsidiaries
	
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured 
entities) over which the Group has control. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with 
the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power to direct the relevant activities of 
the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
They are deconsolidated from the date when control 
ceases. Profit/(loss) and Other Comprehensive Income 
(‘OCI’) of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during 
the period are recognised from the effective date of 
acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as 
applicable. All the consolidated subsidiaries have a 
consistent reporting date of 31st March, 2021.
	
The Group consolidate the financial statements of the 
parent and its subsidiaries on line by line basis adding 
together the items of assets, liabilities, equity, income 
and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances 
and unrealised gains on transactions between group 
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
	
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, 
represent the portion of a subsidiary’s statement 
of profit and loss and net assets that is not held by 
the Group. Profit/(loss) and each component of OCI 
are attributed to the equity holders of the Parent 
Company and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance. The Group attributes total 
comprehensive income or loss of the subsidiaries 
between the owners of the parent and the non-
controlling interests based on their respective 
ownership interests.
	
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling 
interests that do not result in a loss of control, as 
transactions with equity owners of the group. Such a 
change in ownership interest results in an adjustment 
between the carrying amounts of the controlling 
and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative 
interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between 
the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling 
interests and any consideration paid or received is 
recognised within equity.
	
	
Associate and Joint ventures
	
	
Associate
	
Investment in entity in which there exists significant 
influence but not a controlling interest is accounted 
for under the equity method i.e. the investment is 
initially recorded at cost, identifying any goodwill/
capital reserve arising at the time of acquisition, as 
the case may be, which will be inherent in investment. 
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted 
thereafter for the post acquisition change in the 
share of net assets of the investee, adjusted where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting 
policies of the Group. The consolidated statement 
of profit and loss includes the Group’s share of the 
results of the operations of the investee. Dividends 
received or receivable from associate ventures are 
recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount 
of the investment. Unrealised gains on transactions 
between the Group and associates are eliminated to 
the extent of the Group’s interest in these entities.
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
211
	
	
Joint ventures
	
Investments in joint arrangements are classified 
as either Joint operations or Joint ventures. The 
classification depends on the contractual rights and 
obligations of each investor, rather than the legal 
structure of the Joint arrangement.
	
•	
Joint ventures – Interest in Joint venture are 
accounted for using the equity method, after 
initially being recognised at cost. The carrying 
amount of the investment is adjusted thereafter 
for the post acquisition change in the share of net 
assets of the investee, adjusted where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the accounting 
policies of the Group. The consolidated statement 
of profit and loss includes the Group’s share of 
the results of the operations of the investee. 
Dividends received or receivable from joint 
ventures are recognised as a reduction in the 
carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised 
gains on transactions between the Group and 
Joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in these entities.
	
•	
Joint operations – The Group recognises its 
direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses of Joint operations and its share of any 
jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenue 
and expenses. These have been incorporated in 
the financial statement under the appropriate 
heading.
	
	
When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-
accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest 
in the entity, including any other unsecured long-
term receivables, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the other entity.
b)	 	
Business combinations
	
The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting 
for 
business 
combinations. 
The 
consideration 
transferred by the Group to obtain control of a 
subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the fair values 
of assets transferred on acquisition date, liabilities 
incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, 
which includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
	
Identifiable acquired assets and liabilities and 
contingent 
liabilities 
assumed 
in 
a 
business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values 
on acquisition date.
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for non-controlling 
interests, and any previous interest held, over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If 
the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of 
the aggregate consideration transferred, the resulting 
gain on bargain purchase is recognised in OCI and 
accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, 
if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the 
entity recognise the gain directly in equity as capital 
reserve, without routing the same through OCI.
	
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is 
deferred, the amount payable in future is discounted 
to their present value as at the date of exchange. 
The discount rate used is the Group’s incremental 
borrowing rate, being the rate at which the similar 
borrowing could be obtained from an independent 
financier under comparable terms and condition.   
	
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity 
or financial liability. Amount classified as financial 
liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value 
with changes in fair value recognised in statement of 
profit and loss.
	
Business 
combinations 
involving 
entities 
or 
businesses under common control have been 
accounted for using the pooling of interest method. 
The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are 
reflected at their carrying amounts. No adjustments 
have been made to reflect fair values, or to recognise 
any new assets or liabilities except changes made to 
harmonise the accounting policies.
c)	 	
Current versus Non-current classification
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance 
sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An 
asset is classified as current when it is:
	
•	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle;
	
•	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
	
•	
Expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
	
•	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
A liability is classified as current when:
	
•	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle;
	
•	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
	
•	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting period; or
	
•	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current 
assets and liabilities.
	
	
2.1 Functional and Presentation Currency
	
The Financial Statements have been presented in 
Indian Rupees (₹), which is the Group’s functional 
currency. All financial information presented in 
₹ have been rounded off to the nearest two decimals 
of Crore unless otherwise stated.
212
	
	
2.2 Use of estimates, assumptions and management 
judgements
	
In preparing the financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS and Group’s accounting policies, 
management is required to make estimates, 
assumptions and judgements that affect reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities 
and the accompanying disclosures as at the date of 
the financial statements. The judgements, estimates 
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised prospectively. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. 
3	
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	
A summary of the significant accounting policies 
applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
is given below. The Group, Joint ventures and 
Associate have uniformly applied the accounting 
policies during the periods presented.
	
	
3.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
	
	
3.1.1	 Recognition and Measurement
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
recognised as an asset if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. 
This recognition principle is applied to costs incurred 
initially to acquire an item of property, plant and 
equipment. Property, plant and equipment held 
for use in the production or/and supply of goods or 
services, or for administrative purposes, are stated at 
cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any, except freehold land which are carried at 
historical cost. The initial cost at cash price equivalence 
of property, plant and equipment acquired comprises 
its purchase price, including import duties, non-
refundable purchase taxes, any directly attributable 
costs of bringing the assets to its working condition 
and location and present value of any obligatory 
decommissioning costs for its intended use.
	
In case of constructed assets, cost includes the costs 
of all materials used in construction, direct labour, 
allocation of overheads, directly attributable borrowing 
costs and trial run expenses (net of revenue).
	
Spares having useful life of more than one year 
and having value of ₹ 10 lakh or more in each case, 
are capitalised under the respective heads as and 
when available for use.   Where an item of property, 
plant and equipment comprises major components 
having different useful lives, these components are 
accounted for as separate items.
	
Capital work-in-progress comprises of assets in the 
course of construction for production and/ or supply 
of goods or services or administrative purposes 
or for purposes not yet determined are carried at 
cost less any recognised impairment loss. At the 
point when an asset is operating as intended by the 
management, the cost of construction is transferred 
to the appropriate category of property, plant and 
equipment. Costs associated with the commissioning 
of an asset are capitalised where the asset is available 
for use but incapable of operating at normal levels 
until a period of commissioning has been completed.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising 
on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
3.1.2 Subsequent Cost
	
Subsequent expenditure is recognised as an increase 
in the carrying amount of the asset or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits derived from 
the cost incurred will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying 
amount of replaced item(s) is derecognised. .
	
Any repair of `50 lakh or more of property, plant and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of 
the respective item if it is probable that the future 
economic benefits of the costs incurred will flow 
to the Group. The carrying amount of the replaced 
item(s) is derecognised. 
	
	
3.2 Investment Properties
	
Investment properties are properties held to earn 
rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are measured initially at cost including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property 
is determined as the difference between net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the property 
and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
3.3 Depreciation
	
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment and 
investment property is provided on straight line 
method, considering residual value of 5% of the cost of 
the asset, over the useful lives of the asset, as specified 
in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in 
case of following category of assets, where useful 
life is determined by technical experts. The useful life 
estimated by the technical experts is as under:
Asset category
Estimated useful life (in years)
Factory Buildings
35 to 40 
Plant and Machinery
10 to 40 
Water Supply & Sewerage
25 to 40 
Railway Lines & Sidings
35 to 40 
	
For these classes of assets, based on technical 
evaluation carried out by external technical experts, 
the Group believes that the useful lives as given above 
best represent the period over which Group expects 
to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these 
assets are different from the useful lives as prescribed 
under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
213
	
Freehold land is not depreciated.
	
The estimated useful lives and residual values of 
depreciable/ amortisable assets are reviewed at each 
year end, with the effect of any changes in estimates 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
Where the historical cost of a depreciable asset 
undergoes a change, the depreciation on the revised 
unamortised depreciable amount is provided over 
the residual useful life of the asset. Depreciation on 
addition/ deletion during the year is provided on pro-
rata basis with reference to the month of addition/ 
deletion. Assets costing up to Rs. 5000/- are fully 
depreciated in the year in which they are put to use.
	
Depreciation on capital spares is provided over the 
useful life of the spare or remaining useful life of the 
mother asset, as reassessed, whichever is lower. 
	
	
3.4 Intangible assets
	
	
Mining Rights
	
Mining rights are treated as Intangible Assets and all 
related costs thereof are amortised using the unit of 
production basis over the commercially recoverable 
reserves. In case the mining rights are not renewed, 
the balance related cost paid is charged to revenue in 
the year of decision of non-renewal.
	
Acquisition Cost i.e. cost associated with acquisition 
of licenses, and rights to explore including related 
professional fees, payment towards statutory forestry 
clearances, as and when incurred, are treated as 
addition to the Mining Rights.
	
	
Other Intangible Assets
	
Other intangible assets are amortised on straight-
line method over the expected duration of benefits. 
Software, which is not an integral part of related 
hardware, is treated as intangible asset and amortised 
over a period of five years or its licence period, 
whichever is less.
	
	
Research and development
	
Development expenditure is capitalised only if it can 
be measured reliably and the related asset and process 
are identifiable and controlled by the Group Research 
and other development expenditure is recognised as 
revenue expenditure as and when incurred.
	
	
3.4.1 Subsequent Cost 
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied in the 
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
3.4.2 De-recognition of intangible assets
	
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or 
when no future economic benefits are expected 
from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from 
derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is 
derecognised.
	
	
3.5 Stripping Cost
	
The stripping cost incurred during the production 
phase of a surface mine is recognised as a component 
of the mining asset if such cost provides a benefit in 
terms of improved access to ore in future periods and 
following criteria are met:
	
•	
It is probable that the future economic benefits 
(improved access to an ore body) associated with 
the stripping activity will flow to the entity,
	
•	
The entity can identify the component of an ore 
body for which access has been improved, and
	
•	
  The costs relating to the improved access to that 
component can be measured reliably.
	
The expenditure, which cannot be specifically 
identified to be incurred to access ore is charged to 
revenue, based on stripping ratio as per five-year 
mining plan for mines, except collieries which is 
based on project report.
	
	
3.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
	
The Group reviews the carrying amount of its 
assets on each Balance Sheet date for the purpose 
of ascertaining impairment indicators if any, by 
considering assets of entire one Plant as Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU).  If any such indication exists, 
the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated, as higher 
of the Net Selling Price and the Value in Use.  An 
impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
	
An assessment is made at each balance sheet date 
to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no longer 
exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the 
Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable 
amount. 
A 
previously 
recognised 
impairment 
loss is reversed only if there has been a change 
in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognised.
	
	
3.7 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing 
costs 
directly 
attributable 
to 
the 
acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset, 
which takes substantial period of time, are capitalised 
as a part of the cost of that asset, during the period 
of time that is necessary to complete and prepare the 
asset for its intended use.
	
The Group considers a period of twelve months or 
more as a substantial period of time.
	
Transaction costs in respect of long-term borrowings 
are amortised over the tenor of respective loans 
using effective interest method and included within 
borrowing costs. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the 
period in which these are incurred.
	
	
3.8 Inventories
	
Raw materials, Stores & Spares and Finished/Semi-
finished products (including process scrap) are valued 
214
at lower of cost and net realisable value of the items 
of the respective Plants/Units. In case of identified 
obsolete/ surplus/ non-moving items, necessary 
provision is made and charged to revenue. The net 
realisable value of semi-finished special products, 
which have realisable value at finished stage only, is 
estimated for the purpose of comparison with cost.
	
Immaterial By-products, Residue products and other 
scrap are valued at estimated net realisable value.
	
The basis of determining cost is:
	
Raw materials - Periodical weighted average cost
	
Minor raw materials - Moving weighted average cost
	
Stores & Spares - Moving weighted average cost
	
Materials in-transit - at cost 
	
Finished/Semi-finished products Cost of purchase, 
cost of conversion and other appropriate share of 
costs including manufacturing overheads incurred 
in bringing them to their respective present location 
and condition.
	
	
3.9 Government Grants 
	
Government grants are recognised when there is 
reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with 
the conditions attached to them and that the grants 
will be received. 
	
Government grants are recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the 
periods in which the Group recognises as expenses 
the related costs for which the grants are intended 
to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset 
value, it is recognised as deferred income, and 
amortised over the expected useful life of the asset. 
Other grants are recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss concurrent to the expenses to which such 
grants relate/ are intended to cover.
	
Where the Group receives non-monetary grants, 
the asset and the grant are recorded gross at fair 
amounts and released to the income statement over 
the expected useful life and pattern of consumption 
of the benefit of the underlying asset.
	
	
3.10 Foreign Currency Transactions 
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency of the Group using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. At 
the end of each reporting period, monetary items 
denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated 
at the rates prevailing at the end of reporting period. 
	
Non-monetary items are not retranslated at period-
end and are measured at historical cost (translated 
using the exchange rates at the transaction date), 
except for non-monetary items measured at fair value 
which are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when fair value was determined.
	
The Group opted for accounting the exchange 
differences arising on reporting of long term foreign 
currency monetary items in line with Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2009 
relating to Accounting Standard-11 (Revised) notified 
by Government of India on 31st March, 2009 (as 
amended on 29th December, 2011), which will continue 
in accordance with Ind-AS 101 for all pre-existing 
long term foreign currency monetary items as at 31st 
March, 2016. Accordingly, for foreign currency loans 
taken before 31st March, 2016, for adjustments arising 
from exchange rate variations relating to long term 
monetary items attributable to the depreciable fixed 
assets are capitalised. For foreign currency loans taken 
after 31st March 2016, exchange differences arising on 
settlement or translation of long term monetary items 
are recognised in statement of profit or loss.
	
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation or 
settlement of other monetary items are included in 
the Statement of profit and loss for the period.
	
	
3.11 Employee Benefits
	
	
Defined Contribution Plan
	
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity. Payment to 
defined contribution benefit plans are recognised as 
an expense when employees have rendered service 
entitling them to the contributions. Contributions 
towards Provident Funds and Pension Funds are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of the 
period when the contributions to the Funds are due.
	
	
Defined Benefit Plan
	
Defined benefit plans are the amount of the benefit 
that an employee will receive on completion of 
services by reference to length of service, last drawn 
salary or direct costs related to such benefits. The 
legal and/ or constructive obligation for such benefits 
remains with the Group.
	
The liability recognised for Defined Benefit Plans is 
the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation 
(DBO) at the reporting date less the fair value of plan 
assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised 
actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The 
management estimates the present value of the 
DBO annually through valuations by an independent 
actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are included in Statement 
of Profit and Loss or Other Comprehensive Income of 
the year.
	
Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial gains and 
losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if 
applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding 
interest), is reflected in the balance sheet with a 
charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive 
income is reflected immediately in retained earnings 
and will not be reclassified to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
	
Short Term Employee Benefits
	
Short term employee benefits comprise of employee 
costs such as salaries, bonus, ex-gratia, annual leave 
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
215
and sick leave which are accrued in the year in which 
the associated services are rendered by employees of 
the Group.
	
Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term 
employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted 
amount of the benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for the related services.
	
Expenditure incurred on Voluntary Retirement 
Scheme is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss 
immediately.
	
	
3.12  Revenue Recognition
	
The Group manufactures and sells a range of steel 
and other products. 
	
	
Sale of Goods 
	
Sales are net of Goods and Services Tax (GST), rebates 
and price concessions. Sales are recognised when 
it satisfy performance obligation by transferring 
promised goods or services (i.e. assets) to the 
customers and the customers obtain control of those 
goods or services. Where the contract prices are 
not finalised with government agencies, sales are 
accounted for on provisional basis. 
	
Marine export sales are recognised on:
	
i)	
      the issue of bill of lading, or
	
ii)     negotiation of export bills upon expiry of laycan 
period, in cases where realisation  of material 
value without shipment is provided in the letters 
of credit of respective contracts, whichever is 
earlier.
	
	
Interest and dividend income
	
Interest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, 
by reference to the principal amount outstanding 
and the effective interest rate applicable. 
	
Dividend income is recognised when the right to 
receive dividend is established.
	
	
3.13 Adjustment pertaining to Earlier Years 
	
Material 
prior 
period 
errors 
are 
corrected 
retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts 
for the prior periods presented in which the error 
occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest 
period presented, the opening of assets, liabilities 
and equity for the earliest period presented, are 
restated.
	
	
3.14 Claims for Liquidated Damages and Price 
Escalation
	
Claims for liquidated damages are accounted for as 
and when these are considered recoverable by the 
Parent Company. These are adjusted to the capital 
cost or recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, 
as the case may be on final settlement of Liquidated 
damages.
	
Suppliers’ and Contractors’ claims for price escalation 
are accounted for to the extent such claims are 
accepted by the Parent Company.
	
	
3.15 Leases 
	
At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses 
whether a contract is, or contains a lease based on 
whether the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.
	
	
Group as a Lessee
	
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability at the lease commencement date except 
for short-term leases of twelve months or less and 
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, 
which are expensed in the statement of Profit & 
Loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which 
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date, plus any initial direct 
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle 
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less 
any lease incentives received. 
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using 
the straight-line method from the commencement date 
to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-
of-use asset or the end of the lease term. Certain lease 
arrangements include the options to extend the lease 
term. Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised. The estimated useful lives of right-of-
use assets are determined on the same basis as those of 
property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right-
of-use asset is periodically reviewed for indicators of 
impairment and reduced by impairment losses, if any, 
and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease 
liability. 
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
the commencement date, discounted based on the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or if that rate cannot 
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental 
borrowing rate 
	
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising 
from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change 
in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to 
be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if 
the Group changes its assessment of whether it will 
exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. 
	
When the lease liability is re measured, a 
corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in 
profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-
use asset has been reduced to zero. 
	
	
Group as a Lessor
	
	
Finance leases
	
Leases which effectively transfer to the lessee 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
216
to ownership of the leased item are classified and 
accounted for as finance lease. Lease rental receipts 
are apportioned between the finance income and 
capital repayment based on the implicit rate of 
return. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in 
the period in which they are earned.
	
	
Operating leases
	
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of an asset are classified as operating leases. The 
respective leased assets are included in the balance 
sheet based on their nature. Rental income is 
recognized on straight-line basis over the lease term 
except where scheduled increase in rent compensates 
the Group with expected inflationary costs. 
	
	
3.16  Non-current assets held for sale
	
Group classifies a non-current asset as held for sale if its 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through 
a sale transaction. This condition is regarded as met 
only when the asset is available for immediate sale in 
its present condition and its sale is highly probable.
	
Non-current 
assets 
including 
discontinued 
operations, classified as held for sale are measured at 
the lower of the carrying amounts and fair value less 
costs to sell and presented separately in the financial 
statements.  Once classified as held for sale, the assets 
are not subject to depreciation or amortisation.
	
Any profit or loss arising from the sale or re-
measurement 
of 
discontinued 
operations 
is 
presented as part of a single line item in Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
3.17 Mine Closure
	
Mine Closure Provision includes the dismantling and 
demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual 
materials and the remediation of disturbed areas 
for mines. This provision is based on all regulatory 
requirements and related estimated cost based on 
best available information. Mine closure costs are 
provided for in the accounting period when the 
obligation arises based on the net present value of the 
estimated future costs of restoration to be incurred 
during the life of the operation and post closure.
	
	
3.18 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets
	
	
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities
	
A Provision is recognised when the Group has present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event and it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and in respect 
of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions 
are discounted to their present value, where the time 
value of money is material. All provisions are reviewed 
at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimate.
	
When some or all of the economic benefits required to 
settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a 
third party, the receivable is recognised as a separate 
asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will 
be received and the amount of the receivable can be 
measured reliably.
	
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising 
from past events and the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that arises from past events but is not 
recognised because it is not possible that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefit will be 
required to settle the obligations or reliable estimate 
of the amount of the obligations cannot be made. 
	
In cases where the possible outflow of economic 
resources as a result of present obligation is 
considered improbable or remote, no Provision is 
recognised or disclosure is made.
	
	
Contingent Assets
	
Contingent assets usually arise from unplanned 
or other unexpected events that give rise to the 
possibility of an inflow of economic benefits. 
Contingent Assets are not recognised and are 
disclosed only where an inflow of economic benefits 
is probable.
	
	
3.19 Income Taxes
	
Tax expense recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and 
current tax except to the extent that the tax relates 
to the items that are recognised directly in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) or in equity in which 
case the related tax is recognised either directly in 
OCI or equity accordingly.
	
Current income tax is measured at the amount 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities in 
accordance with the Indian Income-tax Act. The 
Group offsets current tax assets and current tax 
liabilities when the legally enforceable right to offset 
exists and they are intended to be settled net or 
realised simultaneously.
	
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the 
balance sheet liability method/approach. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised in full for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying tax loss, unused tax credits or deductible 
temporary difference will be utilised against future 
taxable income. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
217
	
The Group offsets deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities when the legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets and liabilities exists and they are 
intended to be settled or realised simultaneously.
	
	
3.20 Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand 
and demand deposits, together with other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less that are readily convertible 
into known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
	
3.21 Financial Instruments
	
	
Recognition, initial measurement and  
de-recognition
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument and are measured at fair 
value on initial recognition. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and financial liabilities, except for 
those which are classified at Fair Value through Profit 
& Loss (FVTPL) at inception, are adjusted with the fair 
value on initial recognition. 
	
Financial 
assets 
are 
derecognised 
when 
the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expires, or has been transferred, and the Group 
has transferred all substantial risks and rewards of 
ownership. A financial liability (or a part of financial 
liability) is derecognised when the obligation 
specified in the contract is extinguished or discharged 
or cancelled or expires.
	
	
Classification and subsequent measurement of 
financial assets
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified into the following 
categories upon initial recognition:
	
•	
amortised cost
	
•	
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL)
	
•	
financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI)
	
All financial assets except for those at FVTPL are 
subject to review for impairment at least at each 
reporting date.
	
	
Amortised cost 
	
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost 
using effective interest rates if both of the following 
conditions are met:
	
a)	 the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows; and
	
b)	 the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents, trade 
receivables and most of other receivables fall into this 
category of financial instruments.
	
	
Financial assets at FVOCI
	
FVOCI financial assets are either debt instruments that 
are managed under hold to collect and sell business 
model or are non-trading equity instruments that are 
irrevocable designated to this category.
	
FVOCI financial assets are measured at fair value. Gains 
and losses are recognized in other comprehensive 
income, except for interest and dividend income, 
impairment losses and foreign exchange differences 
on monetary assets, which are recognized in 
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL
	
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets 
that either do not meet the criteria for amortised 
cost classification or that are equity instruments 
held for trading or that meet certain conditions and 
are designated at FVTPL upon initial recognition. 
All derivative financial instruments also fall into this 
category. Assets in this category are measured at fair 
value with gains or losses recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss. The fair values of financial assets in 
this category are determined by reference to active 
market transactions or using a valuation technique 
where no active market exists.
	
	
Classification and subsequent measurement of 
financial liabilities
	
Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method, 
except for financial liabilities held for trading or 
designated at FVTPL, that are carried subsequently at 
fair value with gains or losses recognized in Statement 
of Profit and Loss. All derivative financial instruments 
are accounted for at FVTPL
	
	
Embedded Derivatives
	
Some hybrid financial liability contracts contain 
both derivative and a non-derivative component. 
In such cases, the derivative component is termed 
as embedded derivative, with a non-derivative 
component representing the host financial liability 
contract. If the economic characteristics and risks 
of embedded derivatives are not closely related to 
those of the host contract and the contract itself is 
not measured at FVTPL, the embedded derivative is 
bifurcated and reported at fair value, with gains and 
losses recognised in net gains (losses) on financial 
assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL). The host financial liability is accounted for in 
accordance with the appropriate Ind AS. 
	
	
Fair value measurement
	
	
The Company classifies the fair value of its financial 
instruments in the following hierarchy, based on the 
inputs used in their valuation: 
	
i)	 Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments quoted 
in active markets is based on their quoted closing 
price at the Balance Sheet date. 
218
	
ii)	 Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are 
not traded in an active market is determined by using 
valuation techniques using observable market data. 
Such valuation techniques include discounted cash 
flows, standard valuation models based on market 
parameters for interest rates, yield curves or foreign 
exchange rates, dealer quotes for similar instruments 
and use of comparable arm’s length transactions. 
	
iii)	 Level 3: The fair value of financial instruments that 
are measured on the basis of entity specific valuations 
using inputs that are not based on observable market 
data (unobservable inputs).
	
	
Impairment of Financial Assets  
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss for financial 
assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income.
	
ECL is the weighted average difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in 
accordance with the contract and all the cash flows 
that the Group expects to receive. The loss allowance 
for trade receivables is measured using the simplified 
impairment approach recognising expected lifetime 
losses from initial recognition. For recognition of 
impairment loss on other financial assets, the Group 
determines whether there has been a significant 
increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. 
	
	
Trade Receivables
	
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value 
based on amounts exchanged and subsequently at 
amortised cost less any impairment as per Ind AS 109.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with net 
amount reported in the balance sheet, only when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right 
must not be contingent on future events and must 
be enforceable both in the normal course of business 
and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy 
of the counterparty. 
	
	
3.22  Investments in equity Instruments
	
Investments in equity instruments, where the Group 
has opted to classify such instruments at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) are 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income. There is no recycling of the amounts from 
OCI to P&L, even on sale of investment. However, the 
Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within 
equity. Dividends on such investments are recognised 
in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents 
a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
	
	
3.23 Segment reporting
	
Segments are identified based on the manner in which 
the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) decides 
about resource allocation and reviews performance. 
Segment results that are reported to the CODM include 
items directly attributable to a segment as well as 
those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred 
during the period to acquire property and equipment 
and intangible assets.
	
The Group has eight operating segments: five 
integrated steel plants and three alloy steel plants, being 
separate manufacturing units, have been considered 
reportable operating segments. In identifying these 
operating segments, management generally considers 
the Group’s separately identifiable manufacturing 
operations representing its main operations.
	
Each of these operating segments is managed 
separately as each has different requirements in terms 
of technology, raw material and other resources. All 
inter-segment transfers are carried out at arm’s length 
prices based on prices charged to unrelated customers 
in standalone sales of identical goods or services.	 	
In addition, corporate assets which are not directly 
attributable to the business activities of any operating 
segment are not allocated to a segment. This primarily 
applies to the Group’s administrative head office and 
mining operations.	
	
There have been no changes from prior periods in the 
measurement methods used to determine reported 
segment profit or loss. 
	
	
3.24  Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing 
profit or loss for the year attributable to equity 
holders by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year. Partly paid-up shares are 
included as fully paid equivalents according to the 
fraction paid-up. 
	
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the 
weighted average number of shares and dilutive 
potential shares except where the result would be 
anti-dilutive.
	
	
3.25 Significant Judgements, Assumptions and 
Estimations in applying Accounting Policies
	
	
3.25.1	Leases
	
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to 
be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. 
The Group uses significant judgement in assessing 
the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and 
the applicable discount rate.
	
	
3.25.2 Close-down and Restoration Obligations
	
Close-down and restoration costs are normal 
consequence of mining or production, and majority 
of close-down and restoration expenditure are 
incurred in the years following the closure of 
mine. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is 
uncertain, the Group estimate their costs based on 
current interpretation of scientific and legal data 
and existing technology, in addition to assumptions 
about probability and future costs.
2022-23
ANNUAL REPORT 
219
	
	
3.25.3	Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets
	
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be 
recognized is based on an assessment of the 
probability of the Group’s future taxable income 
against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. 
In addition, significant judgement is required in 
assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits.
	
	
3.25.4	Inventories
	
The Group estimates the cost of inventories taking 
into account the most reliable evidence, such as cost 
of materials and overheads considered attributable 
to the production of such inventories including actual 
cost of production, etc. Management also estimates 
the net realisable values of inventories, taking into 
account the most reliable evidence available at each 
reporting date. Significant technical and commercial 
judgements are required to determine the Group’s 
quality and quantity of inventories. The future 
realisation of these inventories may be affected by 
future technology or other market-driven changes 
that may reduce future selling prices.
	
	
3.25.5	Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)
	
Employee benefit obligations are measured on the 
basis of actuarial assumptions which include mortality 
and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions concerning 
future developments in discount rates, medical cost 
trends, anticipation of future salary increases and the 
inflation rate. The Group considers that the assumptions 
used to measure its obligations are appropriate. 
However, any changes in these assumptions may have 
a material impact on the resulting calculations.
	
	
3.25.6 Fair Value Measurements
	
The Group applies valuation techniques to determine 
the fair value of financial instruments (where active 
market quotes are not available) and non-financial 
assets. This involves developing estimates and 
assumptions consistent with the market participants 
to price the instrument. The Group’s assumptions are 
based on observable data as far as possible, otherwise 
on the best information available. Estimated fair 
values may vary from the actual prices that would 
be achieved in an arm’s length transaction at the 
reporting date.
	
	
3.25.7 Provisions and Contingencies
	
The 
assessments 
undertaken 
in 
recognising 
provisions and contingencies have been made 
in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) 37, ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’. The evaluation of the likelihood of 
the contingent events is applied best judgement by 
management regarding the probability of exposure 
to potential loss.
	
	
3.25.8  Mine Closure and Restoration Obligations
	
Environmental liabilities and Asset Retirement 
Obligation (ARO): Estimation of environmental 
liabilities and ARO require interpretation of scientific 
and legal data, in addition to assumptions about 
probability and future costs.
	
	
3.25.9 Useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable 
assets (tangible and intangible)
	
Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives 
of depreciable/ amortisable assets at each reporting 
date, based on the expected utility of the assets. 
Uncertainties in these estimates relate to actual 
normal wear and tear that may change the utility of 
plant and equipment. 
	
	
3.26  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standard or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, 
MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 
2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below: 
	
	
3.26.1 Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial 
Statements 
	
The amendments require companies to disclose 
their material accounting policies rather than their 
significant accounting policies. Accounting policy 
information, together with other information, is 
material when it can reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions of primary users of general 
purpose financial statements. The Company does 
not expect this amendment to have any significant 
impact in its financial statements.
	
	
3.26.2  Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes 
	
The amendments clarify how companies account 
for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and 
decommissioning obligations. The amendments 
narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption 
in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition 
exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions 
that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable 
and deductible temporary differences. The Company 
is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial 
statements. 
	
	
3.26.3  Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors 
	
The amendments will help entities to distinguish 
between 
accounting 
policies 
and 
accounting 
estimates. The definition of a change in accounting 
estimates has been replaced with a definition of 
accounting estimates. Under the new definition, 
accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in 
financial statements that are subject to measurement 
uncertainty’’. Entities develop accounting estimates 
if accounting policies require items in financial 
statements to be measured in a way that involves 
measurement uncertainty. The Company does not 
expect this amendment to have any significant 
impact in its financial statements..

information from a variety of  sources including:
a) 	 Current prices in an active market for properties of different nature or recent prices of similar properties in less active markets, adjusted to 
reflect those differences.
b) 	 Discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows.
c) 	 Circle rate of the property as provided by State Government.

42. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
i)	 Fair values hierarchy
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are categorized into 
three levels of a fair value  hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the 
measurement, as follows:
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for financial instruments.
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation 
techniques which maximise the use of observable market data rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

* Already at fair value
(iv)	Valuation process and technique used to determine fair value
	
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
(a)	 Fair value of interest  swap is determined based on dealer or counterparty quotes for similar instruments.
(b)	 Fair value of forward foreign exchange contract and principal swap is determined using forward rate at balance sheet date.
(c)	 The carrying value of borrowings bearing variable interest rate are considered to be representative of their fair value.
(d)	 The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities with maturities less than 12 months are considered to be representative 
of their fair value.
(e)	 Fair value of fixed interest rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost (including lease obligations) is 
determined by discounting the cash flows using a discount rate equivalent to market interest rate applicable to similar 
assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date. 
(v)	 Unquoted investments:
	
Fair value estimates of unquoted equity investments are included in level-3 and are based on information relating to value 
of investee Group’s net assets. For investments in co-operative societies, the Group has determined that cost is appropriate 
estimate of fair value, therefore, there have been no changes on account of fair values.

C)	 Market Risk
a)	 Foreign currency risk
	
Most of the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s transactions are carried out in INR. Exposures to currency exchange rates 
arise from the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s overseas borrowing arrangements, which are primarily denominated 
in US dollars (USD). To mitigate the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s exposure to foreign currency risk, non-INR cash 
flows are monitored and forward exchange contracts are entered into in accordance with the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & 
Associate’s risk management policies. Generally, the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s risk management procedures 
distinguish short-term foreign currency cash flows (due within 6 months) from longer-term cash flows (due after 6 months). 
Where the amounts to be paid and received in a specific currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further 
hedging activity is undertaken. Forward exchange contracts are mainly entered into for significant long-term foreign 
currency exposures that are not expected to be offset by other same-currency transactions.

Sensitivity
	
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity in regard to the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s 
financial assets and financial liabilities and the USD/INR exchange rate and EUR/INR exchange rate ‘all other things being 
equal’. It assumes a +/- 4.93% change of the INR/USD exchange rate for the year ended at 31st March, 2023 (2022: 4.65%). 
A +/- 8.75% change is considered for the INR/EUR exchange rate (2022: 5.63%). Both of these percentages have been 
determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months. The sensitivity analysis is 
based on the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s foreign currency financial instruments held at each reporting date and 
also takes into account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates.

b)	 Interest rate risk	
	
The Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing. 
Long-term borrowings are therefore usually at fixed rates. At 31st March, 2023, the Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate 
is exposed to changes in market interest rates through bank borrowings at variable interest rates. Other borrowings are 
at fixed interest rates. The Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s investments in bonds all pay fixed interest rates. The 
exposure to interest rates for the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s money market funds is considered immaterial. 
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of +/- 1% 
(2022: +/- 1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. 
The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments 
held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held constant.
i)	 Liabilities
	
The Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term 
financing. At 31st March, 2023, the Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate is exposed to changes in market interest rates 
through bank borrowings at variable interest rates.

ii)	 Assets
	
The Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s fixed deposits are carried at amortised cost and are fixed rate deposits. They 
are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash 
flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.

c)	 Price risk
	
Exposure
	
The Group is exposed to other price risk in respect of its investment shares of other companies (see Note 8). The Group does 
not consider changes in value of its investments in shares as significant, therefore is not exposed to price risks on exposures 
outstanding on the balance sheet date.
44. Capital management	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s s capital management objectives are
	
 - 	
to ensure the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	
- 	
to provide an adequate return to shareholders
	
The Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity less cash and cash 
equivalents as presented on the face of balance sheet.
	
Management assesses the Group’s, its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s capital requirements in order to maintain an efficient 
overall financing structure while avoiding excessive leverage. This takes into account the subordination levels of the Group’s, 
its Joint Venture’s & Associate’s various classes of debt. The Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate manages the capital structure 
and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying 
assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group, its Joint Ventures & Associate may adjust the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

44.C.3	Under equity method, investment in a Joint venture/Associate is not calculated on a line by line method unlike in the 
case of subsidiaries. Therefore, only profit/loss element on closing stock of purchase/sale from jointly controlled entities 
is to be considered for elimination. SAIL mainly purchases power from its Joint ventures which has no closing stock. 
Further, transactions with other Jointly controlled entities is very immaterial and it is also not practically possible to 
compute profit/loss on the same.

599/ 2014-FC dated 1st  April 2015 issued revised 
Guidelines for diversion of Forest Land for non-
forest purpose under the Forest (Conservation) 
Act, 1980 (FC Act). These revised Guidelines 
stipulated that in case of existing mining leases 
having Forest Land (partially or fully), where 
approval for only a part of forest land has 
been obtained under the FC Act, the Central 
Government accorded general approval under 
Section-2(iii) of the FC Act for the remaining 
area also to be Forest Land, subject to certain 
conditions, which includes realising Net Present 
Value (NPV) for the entire forest land falling in the 
mining lease, in case NPV of such forest land has 
not already been realised.
	
	
In this matter, as per legal opinion obtained 
by the Group, Section 2 (iii) of FC Act, 1980 will 
not apply to Government Corporation and NPV 
is required to be paid only for that limited area, 
which has been approved by MoEF& CC and in 
which mining activities are proposed to be done 
and not for the entire forest area. The matter of 
applicability of NPV for total forest land has been 
challenged by the Group in Hon’ble High Court 
of Jharkhand. The Hon’ble Court, in its order, 
has directed to place the matter before Division 
Bench of this Court.
	
	
A writ petition has also been filed in the Hon’ble 
high Court of Chhattisgarh against the demand 
of `96.28 crores received during 2017-18 from

Chhattisgarh, in which the Hon’ble High Court 
of Chhattisgarh awarded judgement in favour of 
Chhattisgarh Government.
	
	
The Group has deposited `96.28 crores with 
Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Chhattisgarh 
and a Special Leave Petition has been filed in 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the 
order of Hon’ble High Court of Chhattisgarh.

The Group considers the assets of one entire plant as Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group internally reviews whether 
264
there are any indicators that the carrying amount of assets of CGUs may be impaired on each balance sheet date. If any 
such indicators exist, the asset recoverable amount is estimated as higher of the net selling price and the value in use. 
Value in use is based on present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an 
asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amounts of 
assets of a CGU exceed the asset recoverable amount. Further to the internal assessment, the Group also determines net 
selling price of the assets of CGU, in which any such indication exists, once every three years by an independent expert.
	
As on the reporting date, based on the internal assessment done by the group at its different CGUs, Property, Plant and 
Equipment (except leasehold land) of one of the units (Bokaro Steel Plant) is impaired during F/Y 2022-23. The amount 
of impairment losses recognised in profit & loss during the year is ₹ 9.10 Crs. ( ₹ NIL crore as on 31.03.2022) and the same 
is included under the item other expenses (Note no.41).

49.8    Information on leases as per Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 116 on `Leases’:
	
(I)	 The Group has leases for Land, office building, Plant & Equipment, warehouses & related facilities and vehicles. With 
the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is reflected on the balance 
sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Variable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate 
are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and right of use assets. The Group classifies its right-
of-use assets in a consistent manner to its Property, plant and equipment.
	
	
Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublease the asset 
to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Group. Some leases contain an option to extend the 
lease for a further term. The Group is prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets as security. 
For leases over office buildings and other premises the Group must keep those properties in a good state of repair 
and return the properties in their original condition at the end of the lease. Further, the Group is required to pay 
maintenance fees in accordance with the lease contracts.

Contributions made in cash and kind for the period from the Financial Year 2006-07 to 2021-22 to Railway authorities for 
laying out railway line from Rajhara to Rowghat would be recovered in cash at the rate of 7% per annum for 37 years on 
total contribution towards redemption of SAIL’s contribution after commencement and fulfilment of assured traffic from 
Rowghat mines.  Management is of view that the criteria laid out in Memorandum of Understanding will be met and 
interest accrues from the date of investment. The refund amount comprises principal and interest elements. Accordingly, 
the interest element has been computed and recognised as income during the year amounting to `51.60 crore  (till date 
`249.92 crore). As per the opinion of Expert Advisory Committee of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, such 
treatment of recognition on time proportion basis is in order as in view of the Management, no significant uncertainty 
exists regarding collectability and measurability of revenue.   
	
During the year, the group has recognised a loss of `170.81 crore arising out of modification of financial assets on 
account of revision of estimated period of completion of Rowghat railway line.
49.10   The inventory of sub-grade iron ore fines generated at the captive mines of the Group were not assigned any value in the 
books of accounts of the Group till the financial Year ended  31st March 2019, since, the Government of India Notification 
dated 19 September 2012 prohibited all captive miners from selling such sub-grade fines.
	
Following the Government of India Order no. F.No.16/30/2019-M.VI dated 16th September 2019 allowing sale of sub-
grade iron ore fines, the inventories of sub-grade fines held by the Group gained economic value. In this regard, the 
Group also obtained opinions from the Additional Solicitor General of India as well as the Expert Advisory Committee 
(EAC) of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Based on the aforesaid opinions, the Group recognized these 
inventories as by-product inventory as at 31st March 2020. Since, these inventories were generated over many years, 
hence, making it impracticable to ascertain the actual valuation, the Group assigned a valuation to such inventories 
basis average selling price of similar sub-grade fines over the last 36 months as declared by Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), 
a Government of India organisation and as adjusted for royalty and other selling costs.
	
The Group has obtained all clearances including environmental clearance and clearance from Director General of Mines 
Safety, Government of India. Further, procedural clearances have been obtained from the State Government of Odisha. 
With respect to the State of Jharkhand, the delay in the clearances is procedural and the management expects to receive 
the clearances soon. This is also supported by the legal opinion taken by the Group in this regard.
	
As a result, the management has been able to sell off such inventories in certain locations. While, on an overall basis 
during the current and the previous year, there has been insignificant movement (1.43 million tonnes) in the volume of 
such inventories, there is significant market demand for sub-grade fines and the recent sales price trends are indicative 
of considerable margins over and above the carrying value of such inventories. The management also has plans to set 
up beneficiation plant in future that will consume significant volume of sub-grade fines annually. Accordingly, in view of 
the management, there is no adjustment required in the carrying value of these inventories at this stage.
	
Considering the substantial volume of inventories, the quantity estimated to be sold / consumed within the next one 
year has been recognized as current and the balance has been classified as non-current inventory. 
	
As at 31st  March 2023, the Company is carrying sub-grade iron-ore fines inventory of 41.55 MT (as at 31st March 2022: 
41.94 MT) valuing ₹3995.75 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing ₹4034.95 crores) at its various mines. 
	
Likewise, the Company 
	•
at its Barsua and Dalli Mines is carrying inventory of tailings of 10.27 MT (as at 31st March 2022: 7.44 MT) valuing 
₹491.98 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing ₹382.66 crores). 
	•
at its Bhilai, Bokaro and Rourkela Steel Plants is carrying inventory of extractable iron and steel scrap embedded in 
BF Slag and LD Slag of 0.47 MT (as at 31st March 2022 : 0.49 Mt) valuing ₹ 460.35 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing 
₹507.10 crores).
	•
at its Chandrapur Ferro Alloys Plant is carrying inventory of Granulated high manganese ore (HMnO) slag and slag 
fines of  0.52 MT (as at 31st March 2022 :  0.52 MT) valuing ₹41.56 crores (as at 31st March 2022 valuing ₹39.29 crores).
	
The Group is formulating a detailed plan for disposal / consumption of these inventories.
	
Considering the market volatility, steel market dynamics, possibility of future additions to steel and pellet making capacity 
in the country which may augment the demand of these materials, the carrying value of the non-current inventories 
need not be adjusted for any unforeseeable changes in the future prices. Accordingly, in view of the management, the 
carrying values of the aforementioned inventories are the best estimates basis the information available at this stage.

 As referred in note 47.2 (a) (i) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the 
constitutional validity of the Entry Tax Act has been upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
and the matters relating to levy of entry tax are now pending before regular benches of 
the Supreme Court / Jurisdictional High Courts / assigned authorities. Pending decision 
by the other Courts, the management is of the view that no adjustment is required in the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the disputed entry tax demand in 
various states amounting to ` 1184.81 crores as on 31st March 2023. However, in the absence 
of sufficient appropriate evidence to support the management’s view, we are of the opinion 
that a provision for entry tax liability should be recognized in the consolidated financial 
statements.
The Holding Company’s view is that  Nine Judge Bench 
of the Supreme court, vide its order dated 11th November, 
2016, upheld the Constitutional validity of the Entry 
tax legislations passed by the various States. However, 
the Bench directed that certain other matters raised by 
the Petitioner, such as discriminatory rates of entry tax 
amounting to `1,092.28 crore on iron Ore and Coking Coal 
in Bhilai-Durg area @ 6% as compared to lower rate of 1% 
on Coking Coal and 3% on Iron ore in rest of the areas of 
Chhattisharh, tax amounting to ` 92.53 crore on goods 
entering into the local area of Jharkhand from other State 
etc. may be determined by regular benches hearing the 
matters. Accordingly, various matters raised by SAIL are 
pending with Supreme Court / Jurisdictional High Courts 
/ assigned authorities. Pending decision by the Courts, the 
disputed Entry Tax liabilities of ` 1,184.81 crore have been 
treated by the Company as Contingent Liability. 
4.	
As referred in note 47.2(b) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, current 
assets include advance of ` 587.72 crores paid under dispute to Damodar Valley Corporation 
against the bills raised for supply of power for period upto 31st March 2017. The matter is 
under litigation with Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission for finalisation of 
tariff, pending which, the management is of the view that the amount is fully recoverable 
and thus no adjustment is required in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
However, in the absence of sufficient appropriate evidence to support the management’s 
contention of recoverability of these balances, we are of the opinion that an allowance for 
possible non-recoverability of such advance should be created in the consolidated financial 
statements.
The Holding Company’s view is that the cases are sub-
judice and pending for adjudication before the various 
judicial authorities for a long time. Further, the civil appeal 
filed by DVC pertaining to tariff of 2004-09 against the 
Order of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL), 
have been dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India vide its Order dated 3rd December, 2018. Accordingly, 
State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) will 
finalise the retail tariff as directed by APTEL, the financial 
implication of which can only be ascertained after the Tariff 
fixation by SERC. DVC filed its Retail Tariff Application in 
November, 2020 along with application for Annual Revenue 
Requirement before the Jharkhand State Electricity 
Regulatory Commission for the period 2006-07 to 2011-12 
and also seeking adjustment of Revenue Gap/Surplus in the 
period of 2012-13 to 2014-15. The Company has also filed 
their objections on 28th December, 2020 to the aforesaid 
Application of DVC.
The above disputed demands stated at (3) and (4), 
contested on valid and bonafide grounds, have been 
treated as contingent liabilities as it is not probable that 
present obligations exist as on 31st March, 2023. Therefore, 
there is no adverse impact on Profit for the year.

of sales with such Government agencies.
	
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
8.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the 
consideration of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements and on the 
other financial information of the subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities and the reports 
of the branch auditors of the Holding Company’s branches, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
9.	
In addition to the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we have determined 
the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Provisions 
and 
contingent 
liabilities 
relating to ongoing litigations
The Holding Company is subject to a number 
of legal, regulatory and tax cases for which 
final outcome cannot be easily predicted and 
which could potentially result in significant 
liabilities.
Management’s disclosures with regards to 
provisions and contingent liabilities relating 
to ongoing litigations are presented in note 
47 read with note 3.18 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The assessment of whether a liability is 
recognized as a provision or disclosed as 
a contingent liability in the consolidated 
financial statements is inherently subjective 
and 
requires 
significant 
management 
judgement in determination of the cash 
outflows from the business, interpretation of 
applicable laws and regulations, and careful 
examination of pending assessments at 
various levels of regulatory authorities
Our audit procedures included, but were 
not limited to the following:
–	
Obtained understanding of the process 
of identification and measurement of 
provisions and contingent liabilities relating 
to ongoing litigations implemented by the 
management, through various discussions 
held with Holding Company’s legal and 
finance personnel.
–	
Tested 
the 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness of the controls put in 
place by the management in relation 
to assessment of the outcome of the 
pending litigations.
–	
Inspected the summary of litigation 
matters and discussed key developments 
during the year with the Holding 
Company’s Legal and Finance personnel.
–	
Inspected 
and 
evaluated, 
where 
applicable, 
external 
legal 
and/or 
regulatory advice sought by the Holding 
Company. Obtained direct confirmations 
from the dealing lawyers for certain 
material on going litigations.

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Since the amounts involved are significant 
and due to the range of possible outcomes 
leading to high estimation uncertainty that 
requires significant management and auditor 
judgement, this matter is considered to be a 
key audit matter for the current year audit.
–	
Discussed 
and 
challenged 
the 
management’s 
assessment 
of 
the 
likelihood, magnitude and accounting 
of any liability that may arise in certain 
material cases. Accordingly, we reviewed 
the amount of provisions recognized 
and contingent liabilities disclosed in 
the consolidated financial statements 
and exercised our professional judgment 
to 
assess 
appropriateness 
of 
such 
conclusions, involving experts as required.
–	
Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures 
made in the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards.
Property, 
plant 
& 
equipment 
and 
intangible assets (including capital work in 
progress)
As at 31 March 2023, the Group has Property, 
Plant and Equipment (‘PPE’), Intangible Assets 
(‘IA’) and Capital Work-in-Progress (‘CWIP’) 
with carrying values of Rs. 67,110.71 crores, 
Rs.1,521.04 crores   and   Rs.   4,891.36 crores, 
respectively, as disclosed in note 4, note 7 and 
note 5 of the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements. Refer note 3.1 for the 
accounting policies adopted by the Group for 
recognition and measurement of such non-
current assets.
Determination of the carrying values and their 
respective 
depreciation 
and 
amortisation 
amounts of PPE, IA and CWIP requires 
considerable management judgement. These 
include the decisions to capitalise or expense 
costs, the annual asset life review, the timeliness 
of the capitalisation of assets and the use of 
management’s assumptions and estimates 
for the determination and measurement of 
assets retired from active use, in accordance 
with the requirements of Ind AS 16 - Property, 
Plant and Equipment (‘Ind AS 16’), and Ind AS 
38-Intangible Assets (‘Ind AS 38’).
The carrying value of CWIP also includes 
balances pertaining to long-term projects 
which 
requires 
careful 
examination 
of 
continuity and viability of such projects.
Considering the significance of the amounts 
involved in the context of the balance sheet 
of the Group and the level of judgements and 
estimates required, we consider this to be a 
key audit matter in the current year audit.
Our audit procedures included, but were 
not limited to the following:
–	
Obtained 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
management’s 
process 
of 
recording 
the transactions pertaining to capital 
expenditure incurred by the Group and 
evaluated the accounting policies adopted 
by the Group in accordance with the 
requirements of Ind AS16and Ind AS 38. 
–	
Tested 
the 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness of the controls put in place 
by the management in relation to the 
above process.
–	
Tested the amounts capitalised during 
the year, on a sample basis, by inspecting 
supporting documents and evaluating 
whether assets capitalised satisfied the 
recognition criteria and were recgonised 
accurately in the correct periods and with 
correct amounts.
–	
Reviewed the judgements made by 
management in determination of carrying 
values of the specified non-current assets 
including the nature of underlying costs 
capitalised, determination of realisable 
value of the assets retired from active 
use ,the appropriateness of useful lives 
applied in the calculation of depreciation 
as determined by technical assessment 
by management and external technical 
experts, where required, and evaluation 
of appropriateness of long standing CWIP 
balances pertaining to long-term projects.
–	
Evaluated 
the 
appropriateness 
and 
adequacy of the related disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable 
accounting standards.

accounting policies and other explanatory 
information 
for 
accounting 
policy 
for 
valuation of by-products amounting to 
` 4989.64 crores as at 31st March 2023 and 
significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions related thereto and the 
note 3.25.4 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
Inventories of by-products mainly consist 
of sub-grade fines, iron and steel scrap 
embedded in BF slag and LD slag and slime, 
and tailings containing iron ore fines, which 
are accumulated in stockpiles.
Our audit procedures included, but were 
not limited to the following:
–	
Obtained an understanding of the 
processes and procedures, including 
controls relating to sub-grade fines, iron 
and steel scrap embedded in BF slag and 
LD slag and slime containing iron ore 
fines (‘by-products’).
–

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Further, as explained in notes 49.10, pursuant 
to the order of Ministry of Mines, Government 
of India dated 16th September 2019, certain 
by-products were allowed to be sold and 
hence, were valued for the first time in the 
previous years.
The management of the Holding Company 
also sought the opinion of Expert Advisory 
Committee of the ICAI (‘EAC Opinions’) in the 
previous year and current year on recognition 
and measurement of by-product inventories.
Valuation of such items requires management to 
exercise significant judgement in respect of use 
of estimates for determination of the quantity, 
quality and valuation rate of these items.
Further, basis the expected future sales and 
plan for captive consumption of such by-
product inventories, the management has 
classified inventory expected to be sold after 
12 months from the date of balance sheet, 
being the operating cycle of the Holding 
Company, as non-current inventory.
Owing to the insignificant sales / consumption 
of 
such 
by-products 
inventory, 
the 
significance of the carrying value thereof and 
the complexities discussed above, we have 
considered this area as a key audit matter in 
the current year audit.
Further, the management’s assessment of 
classification and valuation of aforesaid inventory 
as described in note 49.10 is considered 
fundamental to the understanding of the users 
of the consolidated financial statements.
–	
In assessing management’s assessment 
of the value of by-products, we discussed 
in detail with the management to 
understand the procedures adopted in 
ascertaining the quantity and quality 
(including gradation) of the by-products 
considered for valuation.
–	
Management’s estimate of the NRV was 
verified with reference to the average 
selling price (ASP) published by the 
Indian Bureau of Mines. We also obtained 
technical   analysis  report  from  external	
experts sought by management for 
determining the quantity of by-products 
and the chemical analysis report used 
by the management for arriving at the 
quality (including gradation) of fines.
–	
Obtained management’s working of 
estimated future sales / consumption 
used for classification of the by-product 
inventory between current and non-
current, and tested the underlying 
assumptions basis our understanding 
of the processing and further approvals 
required for sale of such inventory in 
addition to evaluating management’s 
estimates on availability of demand for 
such by-products.
–	
Evaluated 
the 
appropriateness 
and 
adequacy of the related disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable 
accounting standards.
Information other than the consolidated financial statements and auditors’ report thereon
10.	 The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not 
include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Annual 
Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.
	
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information 
and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the Audit otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
	
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated 
financial statements
11.	 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Holding 
Company’s Board of Directors. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position, consolidated financial performance (including other comprehensive income), 
consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its associate 
and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the 
Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included

adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the 
assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are

the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

12.	 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the Group and of its associate and jointly controlled entities are 
responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its associate and jointly controlled 
entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
13.	 Those respective Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of the companies included in the Group and of its associate and jointly controlled entities.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
14.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements.
15.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 
143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by management;
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and 
its associate and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report 
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group and its associate and jointly controlled entities to cease to continue as a going concern;
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the 
under lying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information / financial 
statements of the entities within the Group, and its associate and jointly controlled entities, 
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial statements of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, of which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entities and branches included in the consolidated financial statements, which 
have been audited by the other auditors and the branch auditors, such other auditors and 
the branch auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
16.	 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
17.	 We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
18.	 From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

and explanations given to us by the management, these financial statements are not material 
to the Group. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and our report on other 
legal and regulatory requirements below are not modified in respect of the above matter.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
22.	 Based on our audit and on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors, referred to 
in paragraph 19, on separate financial statements of the subsidiaries and jointly controlled 
entities, we report that the provisions of section 197 read with Schedule V to the Act are 
not applicable to the Holding Company, its one subsidiary and one jointly controlled entity 
covered under the Act, since these are Government companies as defined under section 2(45) 
of the Act and one jointly controlled entity is not public company as defined under section 
2(71) of the Act. Accordingly, reporting under section 197(16) is not applicable in respect of 
the Holding Company and the aforesaid subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities.
	
Further, as stated in paragraph 20, financial statements of one associate company and eight 
joint controlled entities covered under the Act are unaudited and have been furnished to us by

Annexure-1 to the Independent Auditors’ Report on Consolidated Financial Statement of Steel 
Authority of India Limited for the year ended 31st March 2023
Comments
Management’s Replies
Independent auditors’ report on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’)
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Steel Authority of India Limited 
(‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as ‘the Group’), its associate and jointly controlled entities as at and for the year ended 
31st March 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, its associate company and jointly controlled 
entities, which are companies covered under the Act, as at that date.
	
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for internal financial 
controls
2.	
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, its associate 
company and jointly controlled entities, which are companies covered under the Act, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of the 
Company’s business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
	
Auditors’ responsibility for the audit of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, its associate company and jointly 
controlled entities, as aforesaid, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, and the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements includes  obtaining 
an understanding of such internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures elected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other 
auditors and the branch auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other matters paragraph 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, its 
associate company and jointly controlled entities as aforesaid.
	
Meaning of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management over ride of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
	
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors and branch auditors 
on internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the subsidiary companies, 
jointly controlled entities and branches of the Holding Company and the financial statements reports 
certified by the management in respect of the associate company and jointly controlled entities which 
are unaudited, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, its associate company and jointly 
controlled entities, which are companies covered under the Act, have in all material respects, adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such controls were 
operating effectively as at 31st March 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
(‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).
	
Other matters
9.	
We did not audit the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements / financial 
information in so far as it relates to one subsidiary company, which is a company covered under 
the Act and eleven branches included in the separate annual financial statements of the Holding 
Company, whose financial statements / financial information reflect total assets and net assets of 
` 61,268.07 crores and ` 37,235.36 crores respectively as at 31st March 2023, total revenues of 
` 39,954.56 crores and cash inflows (net) of ` 17.74 crores for the year ended on that date, as considered 
in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements also include the Group’s 
share of net profit (including other comprehensive income) of ` 560.67 crores for the year ended 
31st March 2023, in respect of two jointly controlled entities, which are companies covered under 
the Act, whose internal financial controls with reference to financial statements have not been 
audited by us. The internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in 
so far as it relates to such subsidiary company, jointly controlled entities and branches of the Holding 
Company, have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the 
management and our report on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements for the Holding Company, its subsidiary company and 
jointly controlled entities, as aforesaid, under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act in so far as it relates to such 
subsidiary company, jointly controlled entities and branches of the Holding Company, is based solely 
on the reports of the auditors of such companies and branches. Our opinion is not modified in respect 
of this matter with respect to our reliance on the work done by and on the reports of the other auditors 
and branch auditors.
10.	 We did not audit  the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements / financial 
information in so far as it relates to one subsidiary company, which is a company covered under the  Act 
but which have not been reviewed/audited by any of the Auditors, whose annual financial information 
reflect total assets of NIL as at 31st March 2023, total revenues of NIL for the year ended 31st March 2023, 
and cash flow (net) of NIL for the year then ended on that date and one associate company and nine 
jointly controlled entities, which are companies covered under the Act, in respect of which, the Group’s 
share of net profit (including other comprehensive income) of ` 212.46 crores for the year ended 
31st March 2023 has been considered in the consolidated financial statements.
	
The internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of this subsidiary company, 
associate company and jointly controlled entities, which are companies covered under the Act, are 
unaudited and our opinion under Section143(3)(i) of the Act on adequacy and operating effectiveness 
of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in so far as it relates to the 
aforesaid subsidiary, associate and jointly controlled entities, which are companies covered under 
the Act, is solely based on the corresponding internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements reports certified by the management of such companies. In our opinion and according 
to the information and explanations given to us by the management, these financial statements/ 
financial informations are not material to the Group. Our opinion is not modified in respect of the 
above matter with respect to our reliance on the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements reports certified by the management.

Further, We did not audit the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in so 
far as it relates to two jointly controlled entities, which are companies covered under the Act, whose 
financials were not provided to us by the management and one of the entities was under closure, 
since the annual financial results of these entities are not available as per the management. In our 
opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us by the management, these 
financial statements/ financial informations are not material to the Group. Our opinion is not modified 
in respect of the above matter with respect to our reliance on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements reports certified by the management.

i)	 Steps taken or impact on conservation of energy
	
Improving energy-efficiency is a low-hanging fruit for 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction. The trend of 
increasing environmental degradation due to increased 
GHG emission has necessitated a renewed thrust towards 
reduction in energy consumption. In order to give the 
impetus towards improving energy efficiency requiring 
minimal Capital Expenditure and adopting globally 
defined best available technologies with established 
outcomes, Ministry of Steel, Government of India, 
constituted a Task Force #4 on Energy Efficiency in the 
National Mission on Green Steel.
