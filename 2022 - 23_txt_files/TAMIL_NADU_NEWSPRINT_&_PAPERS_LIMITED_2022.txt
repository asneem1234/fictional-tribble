1)
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Identifying health & safety as 
a risk in TNPL is based on 
several factors. The machinery 
and equipment used in product 
(paper, cement) production 
can stand physical hazards 
if not properly operated or 
maintained. 
In 
addition, 
exposure to dust, chemicals 
and noise can lead to long 
term health issues. Heavy 
machinery can increase the 
potential for accidents.
Implementing 
Health 
& Safety Plan which 
mitigates 
risks 
and 
hazards associated with 
heavy machinery.
Awareness 
programs 
and 
training 
to 
employees 
to 
use 
personal 
protective 
equipment and conduct 
safe 
work 
practices, 
emergency 
response 
plan 
along 
with 
contractor worker permit 
system
Negative 
Implications:
Workplace accidents 
and 
injuries 
lead 
to an increase in 
insured costs such as 
compensation paid to 
employees, 
medical 
costs, 
damage 
to 
plant or equipment, 
legal fines.
It also has uninsured 
costs like production 
delays of down time.
2)
Business 
Ethics
Risk
TNPL is in the paper Board 
and cement industries which 
stems 
from 
the 
potential 
for 
environmental 
and 
social 
disquiets. 
Ethical 
considerations 
arise 
when 
profits 
are 
prioritized 
over 
sustainable 
practices, 
transparency and fair treatment 
of workers, responsible waste 
management 
are 
important 
ethical 
aspects. 
Failure 
to 
address these issues can result 
in reputational damage and 
loss of stakeholder trust and 
cause disruption in business.
TNPL has a Code of 
Conduct and Whistle 
Blower 
Mechanism 
Policy 
which 
mentions 
clear 
lines 
of 
responsibility 
and 
accountability within the 
company.
Negative 
Implications:
Unethical 
Business 
practices 
can 
lead 
to 
financial 
consequences 
such 
as legal penalties and 
fines.
It can also cause 
lower 
sales 
and 
potential 
loss 
in 
investors.

A skilled and trained employee 
improves operational efficiency 
which increases productivity. 
Effective 
employee 
development in regards with 
training 
improves 
employee 
satisfaction and offers a higher 
retention rate.

encourages creativity within 
the organization leading to new 
product ideas and processes.
Providing 
training 
to 
employees 
to 
enhance their skills and 
knowledge. 
Engaging 
with 
employees 
and 
giving 
opportunities 
to 
have 
innovative 
ideas 
which 
helps 
the 
company 
and

framework of relevant 
compliance monitoring 
system
Negative 
Implications:
N o n - c o m p l i a n c e 
causes legal costs 
involving 
fines 
and 
penalties. 
Regulatory 
issues 
require 
changes 
to procedures and 
systems 
leading 
production delays
5)
Energy 
Efficiency
Opportunity
Energy efficiency is a significant 
opportunity for TNPL as it 
reduces cost and environmental 
impact. 
The 
optimized 
equipment decreases energy 
consumption. Also, enhanced 
energy efficiency configures 
with 
sustainability 
goals, 
reducing GHG emissions and 
resource depletion.
To 
ensure 
efficiency 
an approach of Energy 
Saving 
Assessment, 
Energy 
Audit, 
Key 
Initiatives 
to 
Energy 
Management 
systems 
is 
considered.

with focus on renewable 
source of energy is an 
approach 
to 
efficient 
energy
Positive 
Implications:

6)
Water 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Effective Water Stewardship 
and efficiency can reduce water 
utilized in TNPL’s cement and 
paper industry. As consumption 
of water is the primary material 
in TNPL, responsible water 
management 
aligns 
with 
sustainable 
water 
balance, 
lowering water pollution for both 
the company and communities. 
Water Stewardship can also 
boost 
the 
organization’s 
reputation and customers.
Implementing 
Water 
Stewardship 
has 
c o m p r e h e n s i v e 
approach 
which 
includes:
Effluent 
Treatment-to 
ensure it is treated to 
meet 
environmental 
standards before being 
discharged.
Reuse of water leads 
to overall reduction in 
water consumption.
Positive 
Implications:
Water 
Stewardship 
contributed to cost 
savings as reduced 
water 
consumption 
directly 
leads 
to 
lower 
treatment 
costs, 
wastewater 
treatments 
plants 
provide 
water 
for 
reuse. 
Meeting 
R e g u l a t o r y 
Compliances avoids 
fines 
which 
block 
financial setbacks for 
the company. Positive 
water 
stewardship 
can establish good 
relations among local 
communities too.
7)
Availability of 
Raw Material
Risk
Wood pulp is a major raw 
material in the paper industry 
which is solely dependent on 
natural resources like wood 
fiber. If these are depleted or 
over utilized, it can result in 
scarcity of the raw material. This 
risk is profound in the regions 
where there is an increased 
demand 
for 
certification 
and 
stricter 
environmental 
regulations which limit access 
to raw materials and cause 
impact of the supply chain. 
Dependency on imported coal 
is another risk as coal has 
volatile prices which causes 
higher procurement costs.
To mitigate this risk, 
TNPL has a plantation 
strategy 
incepted 
to 
achieve self-reliance in 
pulpwood.
Acres of plantation which 
as a source to wood 
pulp is set in motion 
for socially acceptable 
and 
environmentally 
compatible raw material. 
The Company is striving 
to use more renewable 
energy 
sources 
to 
relegate the dependency 
on coal.
Negative 
Implications:
Shortage 
of 
raw 
material 
leads 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
procurement 
costs 
and 
affects 
productivity. 
Delays 
or disruption is supply 
of 
raw 
material 
potentially 
cause 
higher 
prices 
and 
change in customer 
preferences.

Climate 
Change
Risk
Altered climate patterns can 
impact 
forestation 
leading 
to changes in tree growth, 
reduced 
wood 
quantity 
potentially 
causing 
scarcity 
in 
raw 
material. 
Climate 
changes like floods or delays in 
monsoon causes disruption in 
supply chain leading to delays 
in production. Climate related 
changes in energy availability 
impacts paper and cement 
production
Implementing 
forest 
management 
for 
continuous supply raw 
materials, 
investing 
in 
energy 
efficiency 
systems, 
waste 
reduction 
plants 
contribute 
as 
risk 
mitigating 
approach 
while 
maintaining 
its 
operational readiness.
Negative 
Implication:
Increased 
climate 
related risks cause 
delays in supply chain 
operations 
(disrupt 
t r a n s p o r t a t i o n 
network) 
which 
inevitably 
increases 
the cost. Companies 
not 
addressing 
climate change face 
reputational damage 
leading to decrease in 
sales and loss of trust 
in stakeholders.

Governance, Leadership, and Oversight
7)	 Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related 
challenges, targets, and achievements
	
Over the past fifty years, the importance of sustainability has grown significantly due to the increasing global 
population and higher per capita resource consumption on our planet. This has led to the emergence of 
sustainability science as a field that bridges different disciplines. Inclusive and sustainable development 
has become a top priority for nations and industries alike. TNPL stands out as an excellent example of an 
organization that efficiently uses natural resources, maintains environmental cleanliness, uses non-traditional 
raw materials and energy sources, and even converts waste from paper processes into cement. TNPL’s 
dedication to sustainability positions it as a leader in guiding industries toward a more sustainable future.
 
TNPL is dedicated to efficient resource utilization and renewable energy generation through a circular economy 
model. The company is investing in Research and Development to enhance operational efficiency and minimize 
environmental impact. This development will yield cost savings in resource utilization while boosting overall 
operational effectiveness.
	
Acknowledging that engaged employees are crucial for sustained success, TNPL encourages collaboration to 
enhance well-being and satisfaction. The company offers diverse training opportunities to motivate employees 
at all levels, fostering a culture prioritizing health, safety, collaboration, inclusivity, continuous learning, and 
personal growth. TNPL recognizes its responsibility to uplift surrounding communities, investing in education, 
infrastructure, health facilities, and youth livelihoods.
 
Ongoing involvement and partnership with our stakeholders are crucial for our advancement and fulfilling our 
goal of safeguarding people and the environment. To establish a solid basis for our ESG strategy, we engaged 
with stakeholders to grasp significant matters for the Company and are actively dealing with them.

	 Since its inception, the company has been at the forefront of adopting cutting-edge technologies. This 
includes practices like ECF bleaching, Oxygen delignification, integrated Chlorine dioxide production, Wash 
presses, Odour-free recovery boiler, Collection and Incineration of NCG (Non-Condensable Gases), and bio-
gas production from bagasse wash effluent, alongside manufacturing pulp from wastepaper. The mill also 
contributes to sustainability by producing precipitated Calcium Carbonate to mitigate GHG emissions and 
crafting high-grade Cement from pulp and paper mill waste materials. 
	
	 The cornerstone of TNPL’s products is Bagasse, a by-product of the sugar cane industry. This resource, 
combined with sustainably sourced wood, serves as the primary raw material for paper and paper board 
production. Additionally, the company champions eco-friendliness by generating deinked pulp from waste 
paper collected from diverse sources. All raw materials used are procured from environmentally responsible 
sources.
160
	
	 During FY22, an RO-based pilot plant was employed to reclaim process water from pre-treated bleach plant 
effluent. This endeavour aimed to curtail treated effluent discharge and diminish raw water consumption by 
recycling bleach plant effluent. This initiative marked a substantial stride in optimizing resource utilization 
and enhancing wastewater management. Concurrently, in FY22, the replacement of filter bags ensured that 
suspended particulate matter levels remained compliant with CPCB norms, underscoring the commitment 
to environmental standards.
	
	 Moving to FY23, a notable achievement was the reduction of sand content in bagasse-derived final pulp. This 
achievement led to decreased rejection percentages during paper production, consequently streamlining 
rejection optimization and curtailing solid waste generation. Simultaneously in FY23, the installation of a 
flue gas line linking the Lime Sludge Drying System to the OMYA plant line elevated CO2 content. This 
strategic measure yielded a tangible reduction in CO2 emissions, underscoring a meaningful stride in 
environmental responsibility.
	
	 Furthermore, to offer an alternative to plastic products, efforts are directed at integrating Carry Bag Base 
Paper into the existing paper machine infrastructure. This innovation has the potential to replace disposable 
plastics in our daily lives.
2.a. 	Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No):
	
	 Yes, “Sustainable Sourcing” lies at the heart of TNPL’s environmental commitment. Launched in 2004, 
TNPL’s Plantation initiative is grounded in the pursuit of self-sufficiency in pulpwood. Over 18 years, this 
endeavour has spread across an extensive 2,11,280-acre area, aiming to source economically viable, 
socially acceptable, and environmentally compatible pulpwood. This initiative encompasses several key 
objectives. It seeks to establish renewable plantations by transforming barren and degraded lands into 
thriving ecosystems, extending tree cover beyond natural forests. 
	
	 TNPL’s responsible sourcing extends beyond paper production, with pulpwood procurement, mechanized 
harvesting, and aid for cyclone-affected farmers showcasing the company’s commitment to ethical and 
eco-conscious practices. The positive ecological impact of the plantation includes nurturing biodiversity 
and contributing to reforestation and water balance. With sustainable sourcing deeply ingrained, TNPL’s 
Plantation Program stands as a symbol of holistic, environmentally sensitive practices in the paper industry. 
	
	 Additionally, TNPL’s main site demonstrates unwavering dedication to efficiency and sustainability, with 
100% utilization of lime sludge and dry fly ash, as well as innovative approaches in the Soda Recovery 
Plant that maximize resource utilization. These practices exemplify TNPL’s commitment to environmentally 
conscious operations.
  b.  If yes, what percentages of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
	 100% (88% pulpwood)
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and 
disposing at the end of life:
(a) Plastics  
(including packaging)
TNPL is committed to the proper disposal of plastic used for packaging its products, 
including Printing and Writing Paper, Paper Boards, and Cement. It follows the 
extended producer responsibility outlined in the plastic waste management rule 
of 2022. This responsibility is fulfilled through collaboration with a third-party 
contractor to ensure the safe disposal of plastic packaging waste at the end of its 
life cycle.
(b) E-waste
TNPL falls under the category of a Bulk consumer according to the E-waste 
management rules. The company's procedure for the disposal of E-waste involves 
identifying and disposing of E-waste through authorized recyclers. Following the 
amended E-waste management rule, TNPL ensures that E-Waste is disposed of only 
to recyclers possessing valid Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) certificates.
161
(c) Hazardous waste
TNPL is a pioneer in the Indian Paper Industry, having established a cement 
manufacturing factory that converts mill waste such as lime sludge and fly ash into 
high-grade cement. These waste materials are used as raw materials in cement 
manufacturing, aligning with the company's solid waste management approach. 
Lime sludge and lime grits, categorized as hazardous waste, are safely incinerated 
along with raw materials for cement production at LSFM, TNPL Unit-1.
Sodium hypochlorite solution, a hazardous by-product from the ClO2 Plant's safety 
mechanism, is unavoidable due to continuous venting of gases, absorbed by the 
Hypo system. Its continuous formation during ClO2 Plant's operation or shutdown 
is purchased by fabric and dyeing industries.
(d) other waste
The company effectively utilizes organic waste generated from the pulp mill process 
as a fuel, contributing to wealth generation from waste. This internal organic 
waste, including bagasse pith, wood dust, and pulpwood bark, is used in Power 
Boilers, resulting in the conservation of imported coal. TNPL's Unit-I generates 
Black liquor solid from hard wood pulp and chemical bagasse pulp plant, which is 
used in chemical recovery boilers for power and high-pressure steam production, 
further reducing the consumption of imported coal. Additionally, a state-of-the-art 
Bio-methanation plant in Unit I produces methane, contributing to reductions in 
furnace oil consumption and imported coal in the lime kiln and Power Boiler.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities 
(Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken 
to address the same. 
	
	 The Company’s waste collection strategy is in alignment with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
action plan set forth by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), underscoring its commitment to EPR 
within its operational framework. EPR pertains to TNPL due to its utilization of various types of plastic, 
including flexible and multilayered plastic, for packaging its products like Printing and Writing Paper, Paper 
Boards, and Cement. To address this, TNPL has undertaken several activities in line with EPR requirements.
	
	 For the FY23, CPCB has established TNPL’s EPR target at 1000MT/Annum. Subsequently, TNPL obtained 
an EPR certificate from CPCB under the category of Brand Owner during FY22, following the Plastic Waste 
Management Rule 2022.
	
	 To fulfil its EPR obligations as a Brand Owner, TNPL has engaged the services of M/s. GEM ENVIRO 
MANAGEMENT PVT LTD. Acting as intermediaries, they facilitate TNPL’s connection with plastic waste 
recyclers in states where the company’s products are sold. This strategic collaboration ensures TNPL’s 
adherence to Extended Producer Responsibility principles, enhancing its contribution to responsible plastic 
waste management.
Principle 3: 	 Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those 
in their value chains.

production process. The usage of water spans multiple key areas, including raw material cleaning, pulp 
mills, showers on washers, paper formation, and boiler operations. At TNPL, the primary water source is 
fresh water drawn from the Cauvery River. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, TNPL has effectively 
harnessed water recycling in its operations. 
	
	 Driven by a strong commitment to sustainability, TNPL actively seeks ways to lessen its reliance on freshwater 
intake. The company has a vision to potentially transition to Zero Liquid Discharge, harnessing modern 
innovations for this purpose. A noteworthy distinction is that TNPL pursues a minimum liquid discharge 
strategy rather than the conventional Zero Liquid Discharge.
	
	 With unwavering commitment, the company diligently complies with SPCB regulations, overseeing 
wastewater management with meticulous care. The outcome of this dedication is evident as treated effluent 
from the Effluent Treatment Plant finds purposeful use within the TNPL Effluent Water Lift Irrigation Society 
(TEWLIS), supporting on-land irrigation. This eco-conscious approach extends with the presence of a 20 
KLD on-site sewage treatment plant, pivotal in the company’s strategic blueprint. Here, treated sewage 
water serves a dual purpose - nurturing thriving plantations while effectively suppressing dust.
	
	 Unit I resonate TNPL’s sustainability drive as treated wastewater irrigates 1650 acres, facilitated through 
the TEWLIS Scheme. Similarly, Unit II takes a green initiative, channelling all generated wastewater to 
irrigate the company’s vast 650-acre land. This transformation is realized through the implementation of an 
advanced wastewater treatment plant.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then 
provide detail:
	
	 At TNPL, our commitment to environmental responsibility and carbon footprint reduction is evident through 
our pursuit of green energy generation and adoption of a circular economy approach. Here are the key 
points regarding energy reduction initiatives:
Green Energy Generation:
• 
TNPL has embraced renewable energy resources by establishing a 15 MW Wind Farms in Tirunelveli 
District in FY 1993-94. Over the years, capacity additions in four phases have increased the plant’s 
capacity to 35.5 MW.
• 
Wind farms cover more than 1,100 acres, strategically located to harness seasonal winds during 
monsoon seasons.
• 
Low Tension (LT) Rooftop Solar Power Plants, with a 3 KW capacity, were installed in wind farms to 
reduce LT consumption bills.
• 
TNPL remains dedicated to a carbon-neutral mantra through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). 
The Company has recognized 1,90,920 Certified Emission Reductions for energy production without 
carbon emissions from wind farms.
Resource Utilization and Efficiency:
• 
Unused spaces among Wind Electric Generators are transformed into eucalyptus plantations, repurposing 
2,300 Tons of EH pulpwood. This initiative supports carbon sequestration and sustainable forestry 
methods.
• 
TNPL employs an eco-friendly process where bagasse wash water is treated in a bio-methanation plant, 
producing biogas. This biogas replaces furnace oil in the lime kiln, curbing pollution. This pioneering 
Clean Development Project in the paper industry reduces approximately 45,000 MT of CO2 annually.
• 
Carbon emission reduction efforts are extended through the conversion of bagasse pith and wood dust 
into biofuel. This biofuel is utilized in the paper mill’s boiler as an energy-efficient and safe alternative 
to fossil fuels.
Efficient Resource Planning:
• 
TNPL ingeniously repurposes flue gas from the cement mill to facilitate fuel drying in the coal mill and 
lime sludge drying, crucial for our paper mill’s operation. This process also heats raw materials in TNPL’s 
cement manufacturing, boosting efficiency and reducing energy consumption.
• 
Caustic waste is reused in the Soda Recovery Plant, facilitating power generation and reducing 
environmental impact.
• 
Utilizing the organic waste material, lignin, extracted as black liquor after wood and bagasse pulping, 
174
TNPL repurposes it in the Soda Recovery Plant to generate steam. This steam is then employed in the 
turbo generator as an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels, resulting in cost-effective and sustainable 
power generation.
• 
Waste materials from the paper mill, such as lime sludge and fly ash, are reused to produce high-grade 
cement, minimizing waste and promoting sustainability.
	
	 These energy reduction initiatives reflect TNPL’s dedication to responsible energy practices, circular economy 
adoption, and sustainable resource utilization.

your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
	 To effectively manage waste, TNPL has implemented diverse measures. The Company tailors waste 
management strategies to different waste types. 
• 
Plastic waste is co-processed in cement industries, while battery and E-waste are directed to authorized 
recyclers. Bio-medical waste is incinerated at an authorized TSDF.

Hazardous waste, including spent oil, used glass wool, copper, and alloys, are sent to authorized 
recyclers. ETP primary sludge, lime sludge, lime grits, Deinking Sludge, and fly ash find purpose in 
cardboard manufacturing and TNPL’s cement plant. 
• 
Hazardous items like used FRP sheets, discarded thermacol, hard wood fine rejects, pith, wood dust, 
and wood bark are repurposed into alternative fuel in authorized pre-processing units.
• 
Additionally, Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS) undergoes a process involving dewatering, solar
