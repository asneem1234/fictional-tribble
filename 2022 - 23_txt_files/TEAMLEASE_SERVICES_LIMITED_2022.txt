The prism through which companies are being looked at, is rapidly changing. In the recent period, the resilience of companies 
has been tested in terms of how they have been able to withstand the turmoil of the COVID-19 induced pandemic. The other 
issue taking centre stage is a Company’s commitment towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) parameters. Each 
Company’s experience on dealing with the pandemic is different as is each Company’s journey on ESG. For TeamLease Services 
Limited (TeamLease/Company), the pandemic has reiterated that there can be no greater security in life than having a job, a 
source of income. ESG links together all spheres of activity within TeamLease.
Due credit must be given to the Indian capital markets regulator, The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for taking the 
lead in putting together the Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework. In response to the worldwide 
trends, SEBI, has adopted new sustainability reporting criteria as part of its ongoing efforts to improve ESG disclosures. This 
new, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), reporting format intends to establish ties between a Company’s 
financial outcomes and its ESG performance. This can help regulators, investors, and other stakeholders get a more accurate 
picture of a Company’s overall stability, growth, sustainability and transparency. It is a comprehensive framework, which calls for 
more measureable, quantitative metrics to facilitate better benchmarking. 
With effect from the Financial Year 2022-2023, ESG Reporting - as per guidelines provided by SEBI, India, i.e. Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is mandated for the top 1000 listed companies (by market capitalization). The 
existing Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) which is based on the National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct 
(NGRBCs) is succeeded by the BRSR. SEBI through a notification dated May 05, 2021 has discontinued the requirement of 
submitting BRR by listed companies after FY 2021-22. As per the notification, TeamLease is required to submit a new report on 
ESG parameters, namely Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report from FY 22-23 onwards. 
At TeamLease, it was a collective decision to adopt the BRSR ahead of schedule from previous year FY22 itself.
At TeamLease, we remain committed towards deepening our engagement with our stakeholders as we strive towards increasing 
Employment, Employability and E-workforce in the country.
As we all know, ESG- where E represents Environment; S represents Social and G represents Governance – These are the three 
core pillars to measure the sustainability, societal impact, and corporate governance, plus investment potential in a business/
organization.

Leadership:
	
	
Board of Directors
	
	
TeamLease Group is committed to effective corporate governance that strengthens the accountability of the Board of 
Directors (Board) and Management. The Board is collectively responsible for the management, general, and financial 
affairs of TeamLease, as well as our policy and strategy. The Executive Director of the Board, who is also our Managing 
Director and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for day–to–day management and for preparation and execution of 
Board resolutions, to the extent these tasks are not delegated to a Board committee. 
	
	
Board Composition 
	
	
The number of executive and non–executive directors is determined by the Board based on the recommendation of 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Our directors have a wide variety of relevant skills, professional experience, 
and backgrounds. Their diverse viewpoints and varying perspectives help us represent the interests of all stakeholders. 
	
	
Expertise
	
	
The Board, with the support of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, maintains an appropriate balance with 
respect to the expertise, experience, and diversity on the Board. Evaluations of Board composition consider a number 
of matters, including director independence, skill set, experience, expertise, and diversity, to ensure the Board remains 
effective and well–qualified. During FY 22-23, we inducted one new Director with relevant experience and expertise. 
	
	
Diversity 
	
	
The Board is committed to supporting, valuing, and leveraging diversity in its composition. This includes gender and 
ethnic/cultural diversity, to ensure a balance in representation. 
	
	
Independence of the Board
	
	
TeamLease has two Executive Directors, seven Independent Directors and one Non-Executive, Non-Independent 
Director, as detailed below in point b. The eight non–executive directors (80%), including the Chairman, are a 
combination of Independent and Non-Independent Directors under the applicable SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. 
Our Board has an average tenure of approximately 5 years. However, there is no specific tenure for Non-Executive and

Section C: Principle-Wise Performance Disclosure
Principle 1 - Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with Ethics, Transparency and Accountability
TeamLease is committed to  achieving the highest principles of integrity and ethics. Our Code of Conduct (COC / Code) 
outlines the Company’s expected standards of ethical conduct and behavior. Our core values represent mutual respect, trust 
and personal growth for all. The Code of Conduct extends to employees at all  levels  and  other  individuals  working  with  the 
Company,  its  subsidiaries,  associates,  suppliers,  service  providers, channel partners and explicitly prohibits bribes, kickbacks, 
improper payments and direct them to ensure ethical business conduct.
The three pillars supporting the governance structure of the Company are as under:
a.	
Ethics: In consonance with the Regulation 17 of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015 (as amended from time-to-time), the Company 
has adopted a “TeamLease Code of Conduct and Business Ethics” which mandates the Directors, Senior Management and 
Employees of the Company to act honestly, fairly, ethically and with integrity, conduct themselves in professional, courteous 
and respectful manner.
b.	
Transparency: The Governance structure of the Company is further supported by a Vigil Mechanism Policy which serves 
as a tool for its directors and employees to report any genuine concerns about unethical behaviour, actual or suspected 
without fear of reprisal. The mechanism provides an avenue to stakeholders to raise concerns or violations pertaining to 
activities of the Company.
c.	
Accountability: In order to instil accountability amongst the employees of the Company and its Group Companies, 
TeamLease has in place an Internal Code of Conduct for Regulating, Monitoring and Reporting of Trades by Designated 
Persons. The Code serves a threefold objective of: • monitoring the trades of designated employees of the Company; 
• obligating the employees to handle price sensitive information of the Company on a need-to-know basis thereby avoiding 
leakage of information; • mandating the employees to restrict unauthorized access to any individual other than the intended 
recipient of the information.

are supported through automation with the help of technology. Hence IT resiliency forms a critical component of 
BCP. Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) are defined for all critical business 
processes. The IT Disaster Recovery Plan ensures that the defined RTO and RPO are met. The BCP defines the 
overall governance and monitoring of the business continuity function, including setting up of Emergency Response 
Teams (ERT) and Function Recovery Teams (FRT). Business continuity spans people, processes and technology. 
Requisite training programmes have been conducted for the teams to be prepared to respond in a crisis. Disaster 
drills and table top exercises are conducted at regular intervals to test whether the set procedures are working as 
defined within the pre-defined RTO and RPO and people understand and follow it appropriately.
Principle 2 - Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their 
life cycle
While evaluating the impact of business operations, TeamLease aims to reduce any fallouts during the lifecycle of its services 
across the value chain.

186
	
III.	 Does the company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?	
	
	
	
Yes. Given the nature of the business of the Company, at a corporate level, consumption of resources is limited to running 
the operations. The Company, however, remains cognisant of reducing its resource consumption through ensuring 
better energy efficiency standards whilst procuring electronic equipment, lighting devices, computers, HVACs, sensors, 
amongst others. This initiative will bring in energy savings over the medium to long-term. At most of the Company’s 
offices, there are LED light fittings to conserve energy and conscious endeavours have been made to replace electronic 
equipment with high energy star ratings. Sensors are installed to economise power and water consumption only when 
these facilities are being used. The major suppliers of hardware are green standard compliant.
	
IV.	 Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services wherever possible from local &small producers, 
including communities surrounding their place of work? If yes, what steps have been taken to improve their capacity 
and capability of local and small vendors?
	
	
The Company endeavours to engage with suppliers who integrate environmental and social considerations into their 
products and services. At an all-India level, preference is always given to sourcing from local suppliers.
	
V.	
Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and wherever possible waste? If yes what is the percentage 
of recycling of products and waste (separately as <5%, 5-10%, >10%). Also, provide details thereof, in about 50 words 
or so.
	
	
Given the nature of the business, the Company has limited scope to use recycled material as processed inputs. 
	
	
However, the Company has systems in place at an all-India level to manage and dispose dry/wet waste efficiently.
	
VI.	 Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the environmental 
and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity, respectively. 
	
	
Given the nature of business of the Company, the relevance of the above is largely restricted to information technology 
(IT) capex. In FY23, capex incurred towards IT hardware and software (including capital work in progress), which 
facilitated the enhanced digital initiatives of the Company was 0.13% of total revenue. Greater adoption of digital 
platforms not only brings in increased efficiencies of operations but also ensures substantially reduced consumption of 
paper.”

Industry.
	
III.	 Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry). Not Applicable owing to the nature of the Industry.
	
IV.	 Reclaimed products and their packaging materials (as percentage of products sold) for each product category. Not 
Applicable owing to the nature of the Industry.
	
V.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused, recycled, and 
safely disposed? Not Applicable owing to the nature of the Industry.
Principle 3 - Businesses should promote the well-being of all employees
TeamLease believes that its success depends on its ability to develop knowledge, skills and expertise of its employees. This 
belief translates in ensuring that every business vertical  is  equipped  with  right  talent,  which  is both competent and engaged. 
The Company achieved this objective by undertaking various initiatives for talent development, employee engagement and

representation of women leaders in our senior team is at 44%. Our policies are for the benefit of all employees . In today’s 
world, the need for flexibility in terms of workplace (Work from home / work from office) is the most commonly mentioned 
and highly valued benefit and we are trying to create as much flexibility as possible without compromising on cohesion and

adherence to our Principles. We have several recognition and connect activities to ensure that people have the resources and 
information they need to succeed and successes are recognized and rewarded. 
RETURNING TO OFFICE
At the start of the pandemic, many team members transitioned to working from home, allowing us to better protect both our 
team members who were required to come to our offices for essential operations as well as our team members who could 
perform their job duties remotely. As conditions improved in our communities around the country, we began enacting plans 
to return all team members to our TeamLease offices. We continue to adjust those plans, along with our Health & Safety 
protocols, to account for developments such as the emergence of variants. Recognizing that the needs of our team members 
have shifted over the course of the last two years, we remain committed to flexible work arrangements, and will continue to 
offer the option to work a combination of at office and remotely if the job allows once the pandemic ends. Hybrid working 
models give employees the benefit of in–person interactions with their colleagues while also enjoying the conveniences of 
working remotely.

All employees of the Company undergo an annual performance appraisal process as determined by the Company. Further, 
the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board evaluates the performance of the Executive Directors, 
members of Executive Management (one level below the Board), Senior Management Personnel and the Company 
Secretary on an annual basis. The underlying philosophy of the performance management system is to have a fair and 
transparent system of appraisal, which ensures an objective mechanism to measure each employee’s performance and 
potential and implement a reward system which recognises merit. The performance appraisal system has been designed 
to achieve the following objectives: • Review the previous year’s performance with specific reference to achievement 
of targets and give constructive feedback on performance; • Provide an opportunity for communication and interaction 
between the appraiser and appraisee regarding the previous year’s performance and setting of performance targets for 
the next appraisal period; and • Reward employees who have performed well during the appraisal period and those who 
demonstrate the ability to handle higher responsibilities with promotions/increased job responsibilities.

Principle 6 - Business should respect, protect, and make efforts to restore the environment
Along its journey towards path of sustainability, the Company explored and implemented several green solutions. It is also 
continuously in search of more energy efficient technologies and innovative solutions for a greener future.
We are committed to playing our part in safeguarding the planet for future generations. We understand environmental stewardship 
to be an integral part of our purpose as an organisation. We dedicate our commitment in the following ways: • Seek to avoid and 
minimize the adverse impacts of our operations on the environment while promoting opportunities to conserve and enhance 
resources in the areas of our operations. • Stewardship initiatives aim to produce benefits for the environment and people, build 
trust, and support our social license to operate. • Environmental focus areas include climate, water, biodiversity, reclamation and 
waste management.
In our efforts, we continue to focus on areas where we see the biggest reduction potential, based on our industry and footprint. 
• Providing sustainable offices and taking a responsible approach to business travel. • Reduced water and paper usage in office 
workspace. • Our ability to impact electricity procurement is limited, especially for branches where we do not rent the entire 
building, but share it with other tenants. • To limit the use of fossil fuels, we constantly seek to increase the use of alternative, 
efficient, and natural energy resources (e.g., by replacing traditional lighting with LED lighting in our buildings).
