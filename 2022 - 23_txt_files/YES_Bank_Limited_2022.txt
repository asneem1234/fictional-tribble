Our Life. Let’s think of it as the single-most 
important account we have. Holding all the 
wealth of our experiences. The memories 
we treasure, the friendships we’ve earned, 
and the happiness we’ve accrued along the 
way.
Imagine the returns we would get if only
we would put away some joy in it everyday.
A moment here, an indulgence there.
If only we were as concerned about making 
memories, as we are about making money.
If following our interests mattered as much 
to us as interest rates do. 
Life. It’s the one account that matters the 
most. The only account you should concern 
yourself with. As for the rest? Our banking 
solutions, have it covered.

Message from Chairman
Dear Shareholders,
I write to you as the Chairman of the Board of Directors at YES BANK Limited, a position 
I took charge of with a deep sense of humility and gratitude. Both, in my earlier 
association as an Additional Director appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
(between May 14, 2019 and March 5, 2020 and March 26, 2020 till July 20, 2022) 
under the Banking Regulations Act, and subsequently as the Chairman of the Board 
of Directors, I have had an opportunity to be part of a resolute turnaround 
journey of YES BANK. 
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
06
For the Bank, the past three 
years 
have 
been 
a 
testament 
of 
its 
resilience, 
adaptability, 
and collective effort of all its 
stakeholders. Our ability to navigate 
through these turbulent times was 
a testimony to the commitment 
and dedication of our employees, 
the loyalty of our customers, and 
the unwavering support of our 
shareholders and the regulator.
Macro-economic scenario 
In FY23, as the world grappled 
with rising geopolitical tensions, 
supply 
chain 
disruptions 
and 
rise 
in 
commodity 
prices, 
the 
global economy faced significant 
headwinds and underwent through 
its weakest medium-term growth 
with increased financial stability 
risks. 
Resultant 
inflationary 
pressures caused central banks to 
raise interest rates which further 
impacted growth. However, despite 
global macroeconomic challenges, 
the Indian economy, continued to 
exhibit resilience, and emerged as 
the fastest growing major economy 
in the world and clocked GDP 
growth at 7.2% in FY23 supported 
by continued economic reforms, 
tailwinds from pent-up domestic 
demand and consumption, revival 
in contact-intensive services sector, 
and a significant step-up in public 
and private capital expenditure, etc. 
During the year, while there were 
some 
concerning 
developments 
in select banks globally, however, 
owing to the prompt regulatory 
interventions, it did not have any 
major impact on the depositors. 
On the other hand, India's banking 
sector, being well regulated and 
well 
capitalised, 
continued 
to 
perform well in the previous fiscal. 
In FY23, despite globally induced 
volatility hiccups and supply chain 
disruptions, the banking sector 
credit growth was 15.6% Y-O-Y, 
compared 
to 
a 
Y-O-Y 
growth 
of 11.0% in FY22. This growth 
was 
broad-based 
and 
across 
all 
population 
groups 
viz. 
rural, 
semi-urban, 
urban, 
and 
metropolitan. Aggregate deposits 
within the banking sector saw some 
moderation and grew at 10.2% 
vs. 10.4% a year ago. Asset quality 
improved to the best in several 
years, with the banking industry's 
GNPA ratio at a 7-year low, and 
NNPA ratio being at a decadal low. 
Like its global counterparts, India 
too, witnessed elevated levels of 
inflation in FY23. However, several 
measures undertaken by the RBI, 
including hiking the benchmark 
repo rate cumulatively by 250 basis 
points (since May 2022) helped 
in cooling it down in the second 
half of FY23, causing the RBI to 
take a ‘tactical pause’ on rate hikes 
in the recent MPC meetings of 
April and June 2023.
DURING FY23, THE BANKING 
SECTOR WITNESSED DECADAL 
HIGH CREDIT GROWTH AND BEST 
ASSET QUALITY LEVELS SEEN 
IN SEVERAL YEARS

Chairman's Message
FY23 for YES BANK in brief
FY23 was a milestone year for 
YES BANK, characterised by its 
continued transformation journey. 
As part of which, the Bank fortified 
its balance sheet by completing 
the assignment of a legacy stress 
assets portfolio to an ARC, raising 
growth capital from funds affiliated 
with two global marquee private 
equity investors. 
With sufficient capital and a very 
strong liability franchise, a fortified 
and granular balance sheet, YES 
BANK is extremely well prepared 
to focus on growth as well as 
profitability, while continuing to 
adapt the best-in-class Risk and 
Governance practices. 
I take pride in sharing with you, that 
this is also the second straight year 
of profitability recorded post the 
Reconstruction of the Bank, with 
operating profits having grown 9.2% 
Y-O-Y. The balance sheet continued 
to grow at a healthy pace with 
further enhancement in granularity 
in both Assets and Liabilities.
In yet another key achievement, 
the Bank received credit rating 
upgrades during the year from 
several 
prominent 
independent 
rating agencies, including Moody's, 
CRISIL, CARE and India Ratings. 
The long-term rating of the Bank by 
domestic agencies has improved to 
A- from D in March 2020, while the 
short-term rating is at the highest 
possible level of A1+. 
During 
the 
previous 
year, 
pursuant to the Reconstruction 
Scheme, the Bank constituted an 
alternate Board on July 15, 2022, 
which 
was 
further 
expanded 
during the year with new nominee 
Directors 
joining 
the 
Board. 
Currently, the Board consists of 
13 eminent Directors, comprising 
7 independent Directors and 3 
women Directors, who are domain 
specialists with extensive strategic, 
operational 
and 
leadership 
experience. 
Moreover, 
ensuring 
stability in both Governance and 
Management, the RBI also approved 
the appointment of our MD & CEO 
effective October 2022, for a period 
of three years.
ESG-focussed banking 
Given its outsized role in achieving 
India's Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and climate objectives, 
the 
financial 
sector 
continues 
to see major regulatory actions 
and developments on the ESG 
front. The RBI's ‘Discussion Paper 
on Climate Risk and Sustainable 
Finance’, 
published 
this 
year, 
sought to highlight the risks posed 
by climate change to the banking 
sector and called on banks to take 
preparatory actions. With a view to 
foster the development of a green 
finance ecosystem in the country 
and augment the flow of finance 
towards green activities, the RBI 
also introduced a framework for 
acceptance 
of 
Green 
Deposits. 
The 
Central 
Bank 
is 
further 
expected to issue a disclosure 
framework 
for 
climate-related 
financial risks and guide banks 
on 
protecting 
their 
portfolios 
through climate scenario analysis 
and stress testing. The market 
regulator on the other hand has 
undertaken a slew of measures 
to 
strengthen 
and 
standardise

STRAIGHT YEAR OF PROFITABILITY

ESG 
disclosures 
through 
the 
mandatory Business Responsibility 
& 
Sustainability 
Report 
(BRSR), 
which became applicable to the 
top 1,000 listed companies, this 
year. The Government of India also 
successfully launched India's first 
sovereign Green Bonds, raising 
an aggregate amount of ` 16,000 
crore (USD 2 billion) through two 
issuances, 
and 
providing 
a 
huge impetus to the domestic 
green 
debt 
securities 
market. 
These developments underscore 
the 
growing 
importance 
of 
aligning the objectives of India's 
banking sector with the country’s 
sustainable development agenda 
and 
global 
best 
practices 
in 
ESG. As the only Indian banking 
signatory to the Principles for 
Responsible Banking, YES BANK is 
committed to aligning its business 
with the objectives of the SDGs 
and the Paris Climate Agreement. 
In FY 2022-23, the Bank strengthened 
this commitment by undertaking 
significant actions, including, targets 
to reduce its financed emission 
intensity 
(electricity 
generation 
sector 
portfolio) 
and 
enhance 
financial inclusion amongst women 
microfinance borrowers.
Moving ahead
We, at YES BANK, continuously 
endeavour 
to 
build 
a 
strong 
institution of global repute, size and 
stature that generates exceptional 
value 
for 
our 
shareholders. 
Our ongoing efforts continue to 
revolve around adhering to the 
highest standards of Governance, 
Risk and Compliance, simplifying 
the operations of the Bank, creating 
a more user-friendly environment 
for 
both 
employees 
and 
customers. We aim to provide 
customers with suitable products 
and sound advice, along with a 
robust 
people-oriented 
culture. 
We remain focussed on data and 
information 
security 
risk 
and 
its mitigation so that we remain 
trustworthy and relevant to the 
needs of our customers. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
on the Board for their continued 
support and dedication in steering 
through these crucial times. 
On behalf of the entire Board of 
Directors and the Management 
team, 
I 
extend 
my 
warmest 
greetings 
and 
express 
our 
most sincere appreciation for your 
unwavering support and trust in 
the YES BANK franchise.

Dear Shareholders,
Financial Year 2022-23 will be remembered as a milestone year in our history as 
the Bank achieved multiple significant milestones including a successful capital raise 
from funds affiliated with two global marquee private equity investors; completing the 
transfer of the largest pool of stressed assets to JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Company

This has been in the backdrop 
and 
in 
continuation 
of 
major 
progressions 
made 
on 
several 
strategic objectives, including the 
strengthening of our Governance 
and 
Compliance 
standards, 
bolstering 
the 
balance 
sheet 
through 
granularity, 
a 
strong 
liability franchise and expanding 
our customer base. I am humbled 
to 
say 
that 
our 
Bank 
has 
successfully 
emerged 
as 
a 
reenergised, well capitalised, new 
generation (next gen), refreshed 
and recalibrated banking institution. 
And while treading this journey, 
we remain fully aligned to our 
unwavering commitment towards 
our customers, employees, and 
all our stakeholders. A reflective 
of 
our 
reenergised 
version 
is 
captured through our refreshed 
Brand identity which has been 
recently launched. 
As we have surpassed a difficult 
phase 
and 
rebuilt 
the 
Bank’s 
foundation with purpose, resilience 
and character, I am pleased to share 
with you that, the YES BANK of 
today, being an environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) led, 
responsible banking franchise, is 
quite well prepared to continue to 
achieve scale along with profitability. 
Key highlights of FY23
During the year, the Bank raised 
an 
equity 
capital 
of 
nearly 
` 8,900 crore (USD 1.1 billion) 
from funds associated with two 
marquee 
global 
private 
equity 
investors, viz. Carlyle and Advent 
International, with them acquiring 
a 9.99% stake each in the Bank 
(on a fully diluted basis and post 
full 
conversion 
of 
outstanding 
warrants). This has been one of 
the largest private capital raise 
by an Indian private sector bank 
over the last two decades, and 
is a testimony of our inherent 
strengths. With the induction of 
two new nominee directors (one 
each from Carlyle and Advent 
International), we now have an 
eminent 13-member Board with 
7 independent directors and 2 
nominee directors from State Bank 
of India. We are extremely proud 
to have three women directors on 
our Board, which embodies that 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
remain 
the 
core 
ethos 
of 
the 
Bank. 
The capital raise has also bolstered 
the 
Bank’s 
capital 
adequacy 
with CET-I Ratio at 13.3% as at 
March 31, 2023 vis-à-vis 11.6% as 
at March 31, 2022 and is expected 
to 
further 
increase 
by 
nearly 
150 
basis 
points 
post 
full 
conversion of warrants. This strong 
capital 
base 
will 
support 
the 
Bank in its long-term sustainable 
growth objectives. 
THE EQUITY CAPITAL RAISE 
FROM CARLYLE AND ADVENT 
INTERNATIONAL IS ONE OF 
THE LARGEST PRIVATE CAPITAL 
RAISE BY AN INDIAN PRIVATE 
SECTOR BANK OVER THE 
LAST TWO DECADES.

Message from Managing Director & CEO
In another strategic move, the Bank 
assigned identified stressed loan 
portfolio of the Bank aggregating 
to around ` 48,000 crore (principal 
outstanding as at March 31, 2022) 
to JC Flowers ARC. Post-sale of the 
assets, our Net NPA has improved 
to 0.8%, as at March 31, 2023 vis-à-
vis 4.5% as at March 31, 2022. 
The combined value of our Net NPA 
and Net Carrying Value of Security 
Receipts improved to 2.4% of Net 
Advances as at March 31, 2023 
vis-à-vis 4.8% as at March 31, 2022 
and 6.8% as at March 31, 2021. 
Key Business Highlights - FY23
YES BANK originated new loans and 
sanctions of nearly ` 1 lakh crore 
during the course of FY23. Our loan 
book recorded a growth of 12.3% 
Y-O-Y while our Deposits grew by 
10.3% Y-O-Y. We are becoming 
more granular, as at March 31, 
2023; the mix of Retail and SME 
advances to our Mid-Corporate and 
Large Corporate book was nearly 
59:41% and we expect it to not 
change materially from hereon as 
the de-bulking and de-risking of the 
large corporate portfolio is nearing 
completion. On the Deposits front, 
our strategic focus on Current 
Account 
growth 
and 
Granular 
segments, resulted in 27.3% Y-O-Y 
growth in Current Account Deposits 
and 21.1% Y-O-Y growth in Deposits 
from Retail segments. Our customer 
acquisition machinery is gaining 
momentum, with 13 lakh new CASA 
accounts being added last year. 
We are now adding more than one 
lakh customers every month, while 
constantly improving our customer 
satisfaction scores. 
During the year, the Bank reported 
a rise in standalone total assets, 
which stood at ` 354,786 crore, 
up 11.5% from total assets of 
` 318,220 crore in the previous year.
Our Net Profit for FY23 stood at 
` 717 crore. The Bank managed 
to report full-year profitability for 
the second straight year, despite 
an 
accelerated 
provisioning 
during 
Q4FY23 
that 
resulted 
into 
Provisioning 
Coverage 
Ratio 
on 
NPAs 
rising 
from 
nearly 49% to nearly 62% as at 
March 31, 2023. The Bank reported 
an Operating Profit of ` 3,183 crore 
in FY23, which is a 9.2% growth over 
the previous year. Total income 
for the reporting period stood at 
` 11,844 crore, up 21.4% Y-O-Y. 
For the year ending March 2023, 
the Bank’s net interest income 
stood at ` 7,918 crore, a growth 
of 21.8% Y-O-Y.
Among other major highlights, the 
Bank’s Gross NPA reached 2.0% 
as at December 31, 2022 which 
is lowest since quarter ending 
September 2018, owing to the 
transfer of stressed assets to JC 
Flowers ARC. Despite a sharp 
rise in the prevailing interest rate 
environment, we managed a better 
control on our cost of funding and 
worked further on improving yields 
on the loan book, which resulted 
in expansion in our Net Interest 
Margins (NIMs) to 2.6% for FY23 
(vis-à-vis 2.3% in FY22) and 2.8% for 
Q4FY23 (vis-à-vis 2.5% in Q4FY22). 
While in the near term, margins 
will have headwinds from deposit 
repricing, we are confident to 
expand our NIMs over the next four 
to six quarter period on the back of 
yields calibration, improvement in 
our cost of funds, further recoveries, 
upgrades 
and 
resolutions 
in 
NPAs and Security Receipts, and

Refreshed Brand Identity: 
Poised to Soar Higher
With 
growth 
fundamentals 
firmly in place, the next strategic 
move involved reimagining the YES 
BANK brand. While our erstwhile 
brand was loved for its innovation, 
digital 
prowess 
and 
service 
standards, the Bank’s capabilities 
needed a new-age narrative and 
a brand personality that is in 
sync with the YES BANK of today. 
The YES BANK of today and its 
refreshed 
brand 
ethos 
reflects 
what we stand for, the values we 
hold, and the bond that we share 
with our customers. As part of 
the refreshed identity, a vibrant 
new logo has been launched in 
May 2023 which carries forward 
the visual DNA of the Bank and 
builds on it. The tick has been 
transformed into a soaring bird, 
which represents our aspiration 
to 
soar, 
even 
higher. 
The 
smoothened out fonts, a vibrant 
colour 
palette 
and 
a 
visual 
flourish reflect the modern, agile 
and digitally forward Bank that 
we are.  
As we transform ourselves into a 
modern, agile and digitally superior 
bank, that is at the cutting edge of 
innovation, our refreshed identity 
also reflects what we stand for 
today and what is the vision for 
tomorrow. Our new identity depicts 
a bold, fresh way of doing things 
and promises to deliver a Banking 
experience 
that 
is 
Seamless, 
Intuitive and Effortless.
A customer-centric approach 
We 
have 
enhanced 
capacity 
and 
means 
to 
serve 
more 
customers 
across 
a 
wider 
spectrum. 
With 
a 
best-in-class 
and well-diversified products and 
services portfolio, we will continue 
to expand our reach. Further, 
we are enabling the Bank to 
innovate in the digital space, with 
better 
technology 
architecture. 
Moreover, 
an 
efficient 
risk 
management 
structure 
and 
corporate governance is helping the 
Bank create superior and consistent 
value for our customers.
We are pushing on enhancing our 
responsiveness to customers and 
making us the banker of choice. 
Our strategic focus will be on 
expanding our footprint with a mix of 
digital and physical. Having opened 
83 new branches in FY23, we plan to 
continue to expand our distribution 
network and add nearly 150 new 
branches in FY24 in strategically 
important business clusters and 
districts, alongside densifying our 
presence in some of the existing 
key geographies. 
To further serve the changing 
requirements of our customers, 
last year, we launched a number 
of innovative and customer-centric 
products 
including 
the 
first-of-
its-kind floating rate Fixed Deposit 
linked to The Reserve Bank of 
India’s 
(RBI) 
Repo 
Rate, 
fully 
customisable credit card (Build Your 
Own Card), becoming the first bank 
in Asia Pacific to bring forth a debit 
card on Mastercard’s premium 
World Elite Platform, among many 
other initiatives.
At forefront of innovation in 
digital solutions
With technology adoption being 
imperative 
for 
sustenance 
of 
any business strategy execution, 
we 
are 
enhancing 
our 
digital 
capabilities and making a major 
shift 
towards 
accelerating 
our 
digital 
transformation 
journey.

our API-enabled ecosystem and 
that 
enabled 
our 
integration 
and collaboration with National 
e-Governance 
Services 
to 
issue the first electronic bank 
guarantee (e-BG).
We partnered with the Government 
of India to develop logistic use 
cases on Unified Logistics Interface 
Platform (ULIP). Besides, we also 
launched 
a 
dedicated 
Digital 
Banking Unit in the town of 
Naharlagun in Itanagar district, 
Arunachal 
Pradesh, 
to 
bring 
digital services to our customers. 
YES BANK also featured amongst 
the first set of four pilot Banks 
that were chosen by the RBI for 
the launch of Digital Rupee (e`) – 
the Central Bank Digital Currency 
(CBDC), 
launched 
by 
the 
RBI. 
Our digital and transaction banking 
capabilities 
were 
recognised 
at multiple platforms and the 
Bank was presented with several 
accolades and honours.
Strengthening human capital
To foster a culture of diversity, 
equity and inclusion, YES BANK’s 
‘EVE’olution 
initiative 
focussed 
on upskilling and developing its 
women executives. In line with its 
responsible 
banking 
objectives 
and to ensure that employees 
have a say in making YES BANK 
a trusted and successful institution, 
the Bank undertook the second 
edition 
of 
the 
‘Voice 
of 
YES 
Employee Survey’ during FY 2022–23.
Further, to build a steady stream 
of high-quality talent, the Bank 
has 
implemented 
innovative 
‘train and hire’ programmes in 
FY 2022–23, including the YES 
Professional 
Banker, 
the 
YES 
Force 
and 
the 
YES 
Graduate 
programmes. The Bank continues 
to 
invest 
in 
hiring 
top-end, 
young 
talent 
from 
premier 
educational 
institutions 
through 
its 
flagship 
YES 
Professional 
Entrepreneurship Programme. 
I am humbled to share with you 
that YES BANK was certified as one 
among the Top 50 Great Place To 
Work (2023) in the BFSI category. 
Having said that, we recognise 
attrition as a risk to successful 
execution of the Bank’s strategy. 
As a responsible organisation, we 
are taking all the necessary steps to 
ensure that this issue is contained, 
not only in the near short term, 
but we will also evolve into an 
organisation who operates with 
a difference and our employees 
continue to be our core strength 
even in times to come. 
Towards sustainable 
performance
The Bank has over the years taken 
a 
proactive 
approach 
towards 
instilling within its culture, a strong 
ethos of sustainability. This has 
enabled the organisation to stay 
highly responsive to the emerging 
expectations, 
regulations 
and 
opportunities 
presented 
by 
an 
ESG-driven 
business 
landscape. 
This year, the Bank continued to 
define targets and demonstrate 
progress towards enhancing its 
ESG performance. 
As an environmentally accountable 
institution, the Bank continued 
its 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
environmental performance, and 
has expanded the scope of its ISO 
14001:2015 certified Environmental 
Management System to cover its 
833 facilities across the country. 
In line with its net zero by 2030 
target, the Bank also reduced its 
operational carbon emissions by an 
estimated 13.6% over the previous 
year and enhanced the share 
of renewables in its energy mix. 
On the portfolio front, we undertook 
voluntary targets to decarbonise 
our electricity generation sector 
portfolio and achieved a 35% 
reduction in its financed emission 
intensity from the previous year.

The Bank enhanced its gender 
diversity to 21% in line with its 
target to achieve a gender diversity 
ratio of 25% by FY 2024-25. With an 
aim to enhance its positive impact 
amongst vulnerable communities, 
community 
development 
programmes by YES Foundation 
have impacted over 35,000 youth 
and are on track to catalyse 
employment and entrepreneurship 
opportunities 
for 
over 
1 
lakh 
youth by 2026. 
YES 
BANK 
continues 
to 
be 
recognised for its benchmark ESG 
disclosures. In FY 2022-23, the Bank 
achieved the highest ESG score 
of 68 out of 100, amongst Indian 
banks, in the S&P Global Corporate 
Sustainability 
Assessment 
2022. 
The Bank was also rated ‘A-’ 
(Leadership Band) by CDP, making 
it the highest rated Indian Bank for 
climate disclosures.
A franchise poised to create 
superior stakeholder value
We believe that our franchise, both 
in terms of book size as well as 
customer base, is at an inflection 
point to unlock the profitability 
potential with corporate growth 
engine also beginning to improve. 
The Bank will focus on strategic 
levers 
to 
further 
accelerate 
this 
expansion 
in 
profitability. 
Enhanced focus on growing current 
account balances and granularity 
in savings account balances will 
further help in reducing Bank’s 
cost of funds. Alongside this, a 
calibrated mix change and resultant 
yield enhancement will improve 
the NIMs. The Bank is also taking 
active steps towards addressing 
the 
RIDF/PSL 
drag 
through 
a 
combination 
of 
organic 
and 
inorganic 
means. 
Moreover, 
stronger 
fee 
growth 
through 
cross-sell on an expanded customer 
base 
and 
higher 
transaction 
banking volumes would further 
augment the revenues. I believe 
that through the operating leverage 
and productivity improvement via 
digitisation, the Bank will be able 
to gradually reduce its operating 
costs through the years which 
will help in delivering a better 
operating performance. 
In Conclusion
There is excitement about our 
journey ahead as we strategise 
to deliver on our simple aim – to 
make YES BANK the best bank 
for its customers, with also the 
fundamental building blocks to 
make it a great place to work for its 
people, and a focussed bank that 
India can be proud of.
I would like to express my personal 
gratitude to the Reserve Bank of 
India, our Chairman and the Board 
for guiding us, and for bringing a 
clear sense of purpose and direction 
for the Bank, and a positive change. 
I am also a great believer in creating 
long-term shareholder value.
With YES BANK firmly focussed 
on its customers and all other 
stakeholders, there is still a lot of 
work to do. As we work towards 
creating 
better 
value 
for 
our 
customers and other stakeholders, 
we look forward to your continued 
support and valuable association.
While this has been an enjoyable 
and one of the most exciting periods 
of our journey so far, we are excited 
about the journey ahead and are 
looking forward to even more 
exciting times.

Prashant Kumar

Having ticked all the right boxes, 
we realised that now was the time 
to reflect upon the transformed 
YES BANK of today. With this 
confidence, we took a critical step 
towards 
refreshing 
our 
brand 
identity. 
The 
all 
new 
identity 
represents our organisational ethos 
of delivering a banking experience 
that is seamless, intuitive, and 
effortless. As part of our refreshed 
identity, we have unveiled a vibrant 
new logo which carries forward 
the visual DNA of the Bank and 
builds on it. You would see that 
the tick has been transformed into 
a soaring bird, which represents 
our aspiration to soar even higher. 
The smoothened-out fonts, a vibrant 
colour palette and a visual flourish 
reflect the modern, 
agile and 
digitally forward Bank that we are.
As the YES BANK of today, we 
are resolute in building upon our 
strengths and driving performance 
to newer heights. We hope to 
achieve this through our unflinching 
focus 
on 
expanding 
branch 
footprint, 
launching 
pioneering 
products, enhancing our digital 
capabilities, and keeping customer 
convenience 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
everything that we do. 
The Bank has over the years taken 
a 
proactive 
approach 
towards 
instilling within its culture, a strong 
ethos of sustainability. This has 
enabled the organisation to stay 
highly responsive to the emerging 
expectations, 
regulations 
and 
opportunities 
presented 
by 
an 
ESG-driven 
business 
landscape. 
To ensure that the Bank adheres 
to 
the 
highest 
environmental 
performance standards: 
 YES BANK has instituted a robust 
Environmental 
Management 
System (EMS) through which it 
responsibly monitors resource 
consumption
 In FY 2022-23, the Bank’s EMS 
was certified ISO 14001:2015 
compliant for the 10th year in 
a row with a total of 833 ISO 
certified facilities – the highest 
within the BFSI sector, globally 
	 The Bank has established an 
Environment 
and 
Social 
Risk 
Management 
System 
(ESMS) 
to 
identify 
prudent 
lending 
opportunities for climate-aligned 
sectors such as Renewable Energy 
and Electric Vehicles
	 The 
Bank 
also 
promotes 
renewable 
energy 
adoption 
amongst SMEs through its YES 
Kiran loan which is an attractive 
financing 
scheme 
aimed 
at 
enabling SME manufacturers to 
set up solar panels and save on 
electricity overheads
 Moreover, the Bank has stopped 
printing as well as deploying of 
banners, standees and danglers 
at its branches, and has replaced 
them with digital screens
Going forward, we continue to 
define targets and demonstrate 
progress towards enhancing our 
ESG performance. 
FY23 serves as a testament to 
YES 
BANK’s 
commitment 
to 
transformation and progress, and 
paves the way for the Bank to be 
recognised as a brand that walks the 
extra mile to offer comprehensive 
solutions to the evolving needs of 
all its stakeholders and customers.

streams, led by the retail 
and SME segments.
Financial Capital
YES BANK strives to embed integrated thinking into its business, in order to ensure, that 
all aspects of its value creation process coalesce around its goal of achieving sustainable 
growth. As challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, income and 
gender inequality redefine the paradigms of a 21st century economy, the Bank believes 
that true value creation must not be limited to financial capital, but encompass an 
organisation’s aggregate impact on people, planet and profits. YES BANK thus aims to 
harmonise its actions, account for its impacts and report its performance across its 
financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and relationship, and natural capitals.

and customer demand. 
They constantly strive to provide 
best-in-class services to customers 
and are committed to nurturing 
faith and trust for the institution 
amongst all stakeholders.

footprint and disclose its 
environmental performance.

Key macro trends which influence the Bank’s business and our response
The economic setting for FY 2022-23 was a difficult 
one. Even as the global economy was recovering 
from the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the world witnessed a major geopolitical conflict in 
early 2022 which prolonged the economic recovery. 
The pandemic-induced output contraction was followed 
by supply chain disruptions, rise in commodity prices 
and a surge in inflation in most economies worldwide. 
Global central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, 
responded with a synchronised policy rate action. 
The tightening of financial conditions across the world 
took its toll on the economic activity, while the financial 
markets remained volatile and usually sensitive to 
the incoming data.
Global Uncertainties causing Growth Moderation, 
India Outperformance 
The 
Indian 
economy, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
demonstrated 
continued 
resilience 
and 
thrived 
despite all odds. Our economy carefully navigated 
the twists and turns through prudent structural 
reforms, effective policy response, and governance 
initiatives, while also maintaining its energy security 
simultaneously. CY2022 marked the 75th year of 
independence for India, as the nation entered 
its ‘Azadi ka Amritkaal'. Moreover, India emerged 
as a global power of influence as it assumed the 
Presidency of G20 nations in December 2022. 
As per the official government estimates, India’s GDP 
is estimated to have clocked 7.2% growth in 
FY 2022-23 and continues to be one of the world’s 
40
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
fastest growing economies, and also the fastest 
growing Asian economy.
Akin to its global peers, the Indian economy also 
witnessed elevated levels of inflation during the year. 
Headline CPI inflation dropped to 6.2% in second half 
of FY 2022-23 from 7.2% in first half of FY 2022-23, 
averaging at 6.7% for the full year. While food prices 
exhibited volatility, core CPI remained sticky at higher 
levels through FY 2022-23, averaging at 6.2% in second 
half of FY 2022-23, from 6.4% in first half of FY 2022-23. 
Foreign exchange (FX) reserves were around USD 618 
billion at the end of FY 2021-22. Despite a drawdown, 
these were at a healthy USD 578 billion (as at March 31, 
2023). The second half of FY 2022-23 presented a better 
atmosphere for USD/` as it moved in a relatively narrow 
range of 81-83, with support coming from correction 
in USD in the global markets and a more comforting 
Current Account Deficit (CAD) scenario.
Continued spend on National Infrastructure Pipeline, 
increase in private capex, expansion of public digital 
infrastructure, path-breaking initiatives such as PM 
Gati Shakti Yojana, National Logistics Policy, and 
the Production-Linked Incentive schemes to boost 
manufacturing output, together with India emerging 
as a preferred, alternate supply chain destination, 
propelled strong growth as reflected across all 
the key economic indicators. Despite the global 
slowdown and a tighter domestic monetary policy, the 
Indian economy is projected to grow between 5.8% and 
6.5% in FY 2023-24.
The Bank continued to pursue its strategic 
objective to further ‘granularise’ its balance 
sheet with significantly higher focus on Retail, 
SME and Mid Corporate segments. Moreover, the 
Bank also fortified its balance sheet through a 
significant reduction in its Gross NPA and Net NPA 
in the previous fiscal. Backed by its strong digital 
and technological capabilities, the Bank featured 
amongst the four Pilot Banks chosen for the 
launch of Digital Rupee (e`) – the Central Bank 
Digital Currency (CBDC) launched by the RBI.

ESG and Climate Change 
Sustainability and climate action received significant 
attention in FY 2022-23 with the Government of India 
placing sustainable development at the heart of its 
G20 Presidency, marked by its theme, 'One Earth, 
One Family, One Future'. In line with its Nationally 
Determined Contribution of reducing the carbon 
intensity of the economy by 45% by the year 2030 (over 
2005 levels), India joined a handful of countries to launch 
its first sovereign green bonds, raising ` 16,000 crore 
(USD 2 billion) through two issuances. The proceeds 
of these issuances will be deployed in public sector 
projects that help reduce the economy's carbon 
intensity. In addition to being oversubscribed multiple 
times, India’s first sovereign green issuance sold at 
a 'greenium' of 6 basis point versus the benchmark 
10-year and 5-year bonds, signalling a strong appetite 
for domestic green debt issuances. 
The year was also marked by decisive regulatory 
actions 
towards 
promoting 
the 
Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) focussed development. 
SEBI’s 
mandatory 
Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) became applicable 
to the top 1,000 listed companies (by market 
capitalisation), ensuring standardised ESG disclosures 
across listed entities. The capital market regulator 
also approved a new regulatory framework for ESG 
rating providers pertaining to India specific ratings and 
introduced a regulatory framework proposing stricter 
investment and disclosure norms for ESG-focussed 
mutual funds. The RBI published a ‘Discussion Paper on 
Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance’ describing potential 
physical risks, transition risks and liability risks posed by 
climate change to the financial sector. The RBI called for 
banks and NBFCs to establish robust climate-focussed 
governance, strategy and risk management practices, 
and initiated stress testing and scenario analysis of their 
portfolios, against climate-related physical and transition 
risks. The banking regulator also issued a 'Framework 
for acceptance of Green Deposits' enabling banks to 
offer green deposits to its customers, helping them 
achieve their sustainability agenda, and augmenting the 
flow of credit to green activities/projects.

Climate Agreement and India’s net zero transition. 
The Bank has pledged to reduce GHG emissions from 
its operations to a net zero by 2030. In FY 2022-23, 
the Bank reduced its emissions by an estimated 
13.6% from FY 2021-22 and avoided an estimated 
4,435 tCO2e by switching key facilities to renewable 
energy. 
Towards 
reducing 
its 
climate-related 
transition risk and decarbonising its portfolio, 
the Bank has measured and reported financed 
emissions of its fund-based electricity generation 
portfolio and undertaken decarbonisation targets to 
reduce the financed emissions intensity of the Bank’s

electricity 
generation 
portfolio, 
in line with the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) well below 2 degree, striving for 1.5

Digital Innovations leading Paradigm Shift in Customer 
Engagement / Relationship
Digital innovation has brought about a paradigm shift 
in customer engagement by offering newer ways 
to connect with customers and create a delightful 
personalised experience. With the rise of social media, 
mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT), 
companies have more touchpoints than ever before to 
engage with their customers.
Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and 
Instagram 
have 
become 
popular 
platforms 
for 
customer engagement. The Bank now communicates 
with the customers, offers support, promotes its 
products, and collects valuable feedback, all in real 
time. Mobile devices have also transformed customer 
engagement by enabling the Bank to offer personalised 
experiences 
to 
customers 
'on-the-go', 
such 
as 
personalised notifications, in-app messaging, and 
mobile payments. Moreover, new digital platforms such 
as Chatbot, WhatsApp, offer real-time interaction and 
transaction convenience to customers.
In conclusion, digital innovation has enabled companies 
to shift their focus towards creating highly personalised 
experiences for customers.
YES BANK has always been at the forefront of 
digital adoption and innovations. During the year, 
the Bank launched a unique and an industry-first 
Floating Rate Fixed Deposit Offering (allowing 
customers to swiftly switch to fixed deposits with 
dynamic returns linked to repo rates) through online 
banking, mobile banking and Chatbot/WhatsApp. 
The Bank launched several new products including

Our Strategy: Propelling Ahead and 
Delivering on Our Vision
The Indian economy weathered the COVID-19 pandemic 
storm well with vaccination, a host of fiscal measures 
and sufficient liquidity support from the Reserve Bank 
of India (RBI). Consistent capex support from the 
Central Government and relatively stable consumption 
demand led the Indian economy to grow by 7.2% in 
FY 2022-23, maintaining its status of being one of the 
world’s fastest growing economies. At the same time, 
the banking sector remained strong and resilient despite 
global financial market volatility. Year-on-year (Y-O-Y) 
credit growth for FY 2022-23 was at 12.3%, while deposit 
growth was 10.3%, making it a year of consistent and 
steady growth for YES BANK. The early investments 
made in building our digital capabilities, a broad-based 
distribution franchise, a diversified product suite 
and a strong emphasis on being a customer-focussed 
bank positioned us well to ride these evolving times.
The Bank’s strong business performance is in line 
with its long-term strategic objectives and reflects its 
strong underlying fundamentals and growth potential. 
The Bank has reported consistent improvement across 
metrics on book quality, liquidity and coverage. On the 
deposit side, in spite of deposit pressure and external 
headwinds, the Bank grew its deposit base by 10.3% 
Y-O-Y to ` 2.18 lakh crore, with an underlying CASA 
ratio of 30.8%. The Bank continues to maintain its 
near-term CASA guidance of 35%, but in the current 
market environment, it is prioritising and focussing on 
maintaining the current CASA levels. 
On the advances side, reported advances grew by 12.3% 
Y-O-Y. Within our advances book, the Retail and SME 
segments grew by 34%, medium enterprises by 36%, 
with debulking on the large corporate base resulting 
into decline to the extent of 25%.1 In the second half of 
1 If not for the ARC transaction, Bank loan growth would have been 13.2% and Wholesale book would have de-grown 18.9% on Y-O-Y basis

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
FY 2022-23, the Bank successfully concluded and closed 
two strategic and transformational transactions:
1) The successful capital raise from marquee investors, 
Carlyle and Advent International, which aided in 
significant expansion in the capital base. This was the 
second largest private capital raise transaction in the 
Indian Banking Sector in the last two decades. 
2)	The successful transfer of the Bank’s non-performing 
assets (NPA) book to JC Flowers ARC. This was the 
single-largest transaction of sale of non-performing 
assets in the Indian Banking System, leading to 
significant improvement in reported GNPA and NNPA 
ratios. At the same time, the operational momentum 
continues with further step-up in disbursements 
across segments and improving operating profit in 
the last eight quarters.
Building on this momentum, the Bank now plans to move 
into the next phase of its journey and deliver returns to 
its stakeholders – sustainable, profitable growth with a 
target of ~1.5% RoA in the next five years. The Bank’s 
ambition and vision rests on three main pillars:
1) To continue to be a universal bank, but with a focus 
on granularising all businesses, 
2)	To build on inherent digital market leadership 
to become a relationship banker to the new-age 
economy and future value pools, while continuing to 
facilitate and capture flow business, and
3) To focus on building an employee-centric culture, 
efficient processes and fit-for-scale technology 
architecture. Importantly, our strategy is underpinned 
by strong risk management to provide a secure 
banking platform and risk-adjusted returns. 
Last, but not the least, the Bank recognises that 
sustainable 
growth 
is 
inextricably 
linked 
with 
environmental sustainability, social development, and 
good governance and, therefore, continues to integrate 
ESG considerations into its core business strategically.

	 The Bank’s customer first approach is embedded 
in our distribution approach as well, and we 
plan to keep increasing and nurturing these 
relationships we have with our customers, while 
also creating accessibility for a wider pool of

in size and scale, the Bank will also pay particular 
attention on building a focussed branch network 
with profitable unit economics. We plan to fund 
our branch expansion strategy over time, both 
by exploring leaner formats integrated with tech

	 The Bank recognises that there is an immense 
opportunity in relationship banking to the 
start-ups, e-Commerce and Fintech ecosystem. 
The Bank aspires to be the “Banker of Choice” 
to these new-age companies by providing niche 
and customised banking solutions. The Bank 
is already a market leader in API banking (with 
450+ APIs), but it will look to proliferate the 
API marketplace with existing clients through 
the development of an integrated front-end 
solution and engage with 3rd party partners 
across different fields (accounting, legal, taxation, 
expense management, invoicing and payment 
gateways) to strengthen its connected banking 
proposition

	 The Bank will seek inorganic growth opportunities 
in businesses or assets that either enable it to: 
expand its market share; allow entry into an 
industry, customer or geographic segment that it 
is currently not present in; or provide with new 
capabilities
	 These partnerships could be pure-play business 
arrangements such as co-lending arrangements 
or ‘Banking as a Service’ partnerships, or it could 
also take the form of acquisitions, strategic 
investments or asset purchases
	 For example, in order to remain at the forefront 
of digital innovation, especially in the areas of 
customer servicing, customer acquisition, digital 
lending and last-mile lending, the Bank will 
actively partner with relevant start-ups that are 
focussed on specific propositions in these areas. 
At the same time, the Bank will also consider 
strategic investments in niche capability areas 
such as Wealth Management and Analytics
	 The Bank is also continuously exploring and 
evaluating 
strategic 
investments 
and 
/ 
or 
inorganic opportunities in the priority sector 
lending arena in order to increase proportion of 
its PSL compliant book and gain access to newer 
geographies and capabilities
	
The Bank has launched a Fintech Investment 
programme for strategic investments in 
unlisted start-ups and new-age companies. 
These investments will enable the Bank to: 
	
Enhance 
technical 
capability/prowess 
of the Bank’s products by infusing parts 
of the investee companies’ solutions to 
their own or through other modes of joint 
Go-to-Market; and/or
 
Enhance the product offerings provided to

Access additional granular liability or asset

Third Line of Defence: 
Internal Audit
The Board has the overall responsibility for Risk 
Management and oversees the Risk & Control 
environment, and also reviews and approves the policies 
as a part of overseeing the Risk Management practices. 
In this regard the Board – 
 Ensures that comprehensive policies, systems and 
controls are in place to identify, monitor and manage 
material risks at a Bank-wide level with clearly 
defined risk limits
 Lays down the Risk Appetite Statement which 
articulates the quantum of risk that the Bank is willing 
and able to assume in its exposures and business 
activities, in pursuit of its strategic objectives and 
desired returns
	 Establishes policies governing various aspects of risk 
management, which lays down the Risk Appetite 
Framework within the overall Risk Appetite Statement
The Board has put in place Board-level Committees, 
as highlighted above, which inter-alia pertain to Risk 
Management, to deal with the risk management 
practices, policies, procedures and to have adequate 
oversight on the risks faced by the Bank. The Board, in 
turn, has set up various Executive-level committees for 
independent oversight over the entire risk universe of 
the Bank. (Details of these committees can be referred 
to of Page 192 of the Directors’ Report).
These Committees review various aspects / key risks 
and ensure that the best-in-class frameworks are in 
place to oversee day-to-day management of underlying 
business activities, transactions and associated risks, 
while dealing with internal and external stakeholders.
The Bank also conducts a detailed Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Policy (‘ICAAP’) review exercise, 
approved by the Board, at least on an annual basis to 
identify its Risk universe, review its Risk appetite in line 
with the business strategy and also assess its internal 
controls and mitigation measures in place for its risks 
and capital requirements.

Operational Risk is the loss to the Bank resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, 
people and systems or external events, including 
loss arising out of legal risk.
  Impact
Operational Risk may lead to financial loss to 
the Bank. Additionally, any Operational Risk 
event may lead to multiple customer grievances 
and may also cause reputation loss. The Bank 
may also face legal actions and incur losses due 
to penalties imposed or compensation paid to 
customers as required by the legal or regulatory 
bodies. Operational Risk based events may 
also result in loss of data or pose an increased 
Information Security risk.
Governance Framework
Operational Risk is monitored and reviewed 
by 
the 
Operational 
Risk 
Management 
Committee on an overall basis. Further, it is also 
reviewed by various Executive Committees, 
i.e., 
Product 
Process 
Approval 
Committee, 
Fraud Identification Committee, Accountability 
Review Committee, Whistle Blower Committee, 
Disciplinary 
Committee, 
and 
Standing 
Committee on Customer Service based on the 
underlying risk.

Market Risk is the risk of loss in on-balance sheet 
and off-balance sheet positions arising from 
movements in market prices due to unfavourable 
movement in market variables such as Interest 
rate risk, foreign exchange risk, price risk, 
volatility risk, etc.
  Impact
Market Risk may have impact on the Bank's 
financial performance, capital ratios, regulatory 
compliance, and reputation. It is essential for 
banks to manage market risk effectively to 
ensure that they maintain a diversified portfolio, 
reduce their exposure to risk, and minimise 
potential losses.
Governance Framework
Market Risk is monitored and reviewed by the 
Asset & Liability Management Committee (ALCO).
Risk, Management and Mitigation
	 The Bank manages market risk through a 
well-defined Market Risk, Investment and 
Derivative Policies and limit framework 
 Additionally, the Bank has a robust limit 
framework which supports various measures 
such as Risk Sensitivity, Value-at-Risk, Stop Loss, 
Stress Testing, Rate Scan etc.
 Additionally, the Bank also has strong processes 
and systems in place along with independent 
Middle Office and Market Risk Functions to 
monitor the risk on an ongoing basis and submit 
the same with the ALCO and Board

Credit Risk is defined as potential losses associated 
with diminution in the credit quality of borrowers 
or counter-parties. Losses stem from outright 
default or a reduction in portfolio value.
  Impact
Credit Risk may have a significant impact 
on the Bank's financial performance, capital 
ratios, regulatory compliance and reputation. 
It is essential for the Bank to manage credit 
risk effectively to ensure that they maintain a 
diversified loan portfolio, reduce their exposure 
to risk, and minimise potential losses.
Governance Framework
Credit Risk is monitored and reviewed by 
various committees such as Management Credit 
Committee (MCC), Executive Credit Committee 
(ECC), Stressed Asset Management Committee 
(SAMC), Committee for Classification of Wilful 
Defaulters & Non Co-operative Borrowers.
Risk, Management and Mitigation
	 The Bank has a distinct architecture of 
policies, procedures and systems for managing 
Credit Risk in both its retail and wholesale 
businesses. Wholesale lending is managed on 
an individual and portfolio basis. In contrast, 
retail 
lending, 
given 
the 
granularity 
of 
individual exposures, is managed largely on 
a portfolio basis across various products and 
customer segments. 
 Furthermore, multiple Credit Risk models are 
used to appraise and score different customer 
segments 
based 
on 
portfolio 
behaviour. 
In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by 
capping exposures based on borrower groups, 
industry, credit rating grades and country, 
among others. This is backed by portfolio 
diversification, 
stringent 
credit 
approval 
processes and periodic post-disbursement 
monitoring and remedial measures.

Risk Management Governance Framework
 Driven by rapid advancements in technology, 
digitalisation is becoming a key differentiator 
for customer retention and service delivery 
in the banking sector. Digital lending enables 
customers to secure loans at the click of a 
button in a matter of minutes, if not seconds. 
However, attendant risks are associated 
with this, and the Bank has put appropriate 
checks and balances in place to manage these 
risks. Such loans are sanctioned primarily 
to the Bank’s existing customers who often 
avail of multiple products, thus, allowing the 
Bank ready access to their credit history and 
risk profile. This facilitates the evaluation of 
their loan eligibility, and most of the credit 
checks and scores used by the Bank involve 
process-based underwriting, which is replicated 
for digital loans. The Bank has an independent 
validation unit that minutely assesses the 
models used to generate credit scores for such 
loans. These models are monitored, reviewed 
periodically, back tested, and corrective action 
is taken when needed
 For wholesale and retail categories, robust 
front-end and back-end systems are in place 
to ensure credit quality and minimise loss 
from defaults. The factors considered when 
sanctioning 
retail 
loans 
include 
income, 
demographics, 
credit 
history, 
loan 
tenor 
and banking behaviour. In the Retail Assets 
space, the Bank has adopted a calibrated and 
granular asset growth strategy with emphasis 
on superior risk filters, with an endeavour to 
increase the proportion of Retail in the Bank’s 
overall advances book
	 The 
Bank 
has 
been 
able 
to 
ensure 
strong 
asset 
quality 
on 
incremental 
lending post-March 2020, despite volatile 
times 
in 
the 
lending 
environment, 
by 
stringently adhering to prudent norms and 
institutionalised processes
Asset Concentration Risk is defined as the risk 
arising from any single exposure or a group of 
exposures with the potential to produce losses 
large enough (relative to the Bank’s capital, total 
assets, or overall risk level) which can pose a 
threat to the Bank’s health or ability to maintain 
its core operations.
  Impact
Asset concentration risk can have a significant 
impact on the Bank's financial performance, credit 
quality, regulatory compliance and reputation. 
Governance Framework
Asset Concentration Risk is primarily monitored 
and reviewed by Enterprise Risk, Reputation 
Risk and Model Assessment Committee (ERMC). 
Further, it is also reviewed by various Executive 
Committees, i.e., Executive Credit Committee 
(ECC), Management Credit Committee (MCC) and 
Stressed Asset Management Committee (SAMC). 
Risk, Management and Mitigation
The 
Bank 
monitors 
concentration 
in 
its 
portfolio across various categories such as, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
name 
concentration, 
concentrations to business groups, rating-wise 
concentration, 
sectors 
(industry 
groups), 
correlated industry groups (economic sectors), 
etc. The Bank uses percentage analysis as well 
as Normalised Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) 
for analysing concentration risk, over and above 
various concentration limits such as sector caps, 
rating wise caps etc.

Compliance Risk is the risk of legal or regulatory 
sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to 
reputation that the Bank may suffer as a result of 
its failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules 
applicable to its banking activities.
  Impact
Non-compliance with applicable regulations and 
laws can result in adverse regulatory action which 
may have implications on the Bank’s business (in 
case of stringent regulatory action in the form of 
curtailing expansion/specific business lines etc.). 
This may also result in reputation risk to the Bank.

Brief Description of Risk
Reputation Risk refers to the potential damage 
to the Bank’s reputation, brand image or public 
perception due to negative publicity, scandal, 
adverse regulatory actions or other events. 
The Risk arises when an organisation’s actions or 
behaviours do not align with its stated values or 
societal expectation.
  Impact
Reputation Risk can result in a decline in market 
value, loss of customers, difficulty in attracting 
and 
retaining 
employees, 
and 
increased 
regulatory scrutiny. It may undermine the 
public's confidence in the Bank leading to 
Liquidity Risk to the Bank. Reputation Risk can 
have long-lasting effects and it may be difficult 
to recover from an extreme event.
Governance Framework
Reputation Risk is reviewed and monitored 
by Enterprise Risk, Reputation Risk and Model 
Assessment Committee (ERMC).

ALM (Asset Liability Mismatch) Risk arises on 
account of Liquidity Risk and Interest Rate Risk. 
Liquidity Risk is the risk that a Bank may not be 
able to meet its short-term financial obligations 
due to an asset-liability mismatch or interest rate 
fluctuations. Further, asset liability mismatch may 
also lead to Interest Rate Risk to the Bank. 
  Impact
ALM Risk may result in the Bank not being able 
to meet obligations to its depositors and creditors 
on a timely basis, which can result in severe 
reputational risk and a run on the Bank, thereby 
resulting in insolvency. Improper management of 
Liquidity Risk will also result in the Bank having 
to borrow at higher rates to meet its obligations, 
thereby eroding its profitability and thereby its 
capital. Excess interest rate risk may also result 
in erosion of profitability when interest rates 
move adversely.
Governance Framework
ALM Risk is reviewed and monitored by Asset & 
Liability Management Committee (ALCO).
Risk, Management and Mitigation
	 The Bank has an asset liability management 
policy for Liquidity Risk and Interest Rate Risk 
management that is implemented, monitored 
and periodically reviewed by the ALCO
 As part of this process, the Bank has various 
Board-approved limits for both Liquidity and 
Interest Rate Risks. While the maturity gap and 
stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, net 
interest income and market value impacts help 
mitigate Interest Rate Risk. This is reinforced 
by a comprehensive Board-approved stress 
testing framework covering Liquidity and 
Interest Rate Risk
	 The Bank also has a detailed Contingency 
Funding Plan along with various triggers for the 
extreme scenario
	 The Bank conducts various studies to assess the 
behavioural pattern of non-contractual assets 
and liabilities and embedded options available 
to customers that are used while managing 
maturity gaps. The Bank also has the necessary 
framework to manage intra-day Liquidity Risk
	 The Bank has been maintaining Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR) in line with extant regulatory 
guidelines. Further, the Bank has internal 
thresholds for these ratios more stringent than 
the regulatory minimum
	 To avoid Liquidity Risk arising out of excess 
depositor concentration, the Bank has a 
strong mechanism to track top depositor 
concentration, 
bulk 
and 
retail 
depositor 
concentration which internal policy limits as well 
as a robust monitoring and reporting process

Risk, Management and Mitigation
Strategic Risk management at the Bank is not 
viewed as a task that is performed in isolation. 
It is ingrained in the Bank’s day-to-day processes 
as well as our decision-making and governance 
structures. All Group entities conduct annual 
business and capital planning exercise individually 
based on business strategy and risk appetite. 
The regulatory guidelines are also considered while 
formulating the business strategy, as are issues of 
talent, organisational culture, risk management 
and governance. The plan is challenged internally 
in an iterative process with respect to its 
assumptions, credibility and integrity. The strategy 
is reviewed and approved by the Board after 
deliberation and discussion. 
The Top Management and the Boards of the 
respective entities review performance vis-à-vis 
business plans and Strategic Risks periodically 
to ensure adequate oversight of implementation 
and recommend course corrections, if required. 
The 
Bank 
periodically 
reviews 
performance 
against its strategic objectives and business 
plans through its Apex Management Committee. 
Performance on various financial parameters 
and strategic objectives is reviewed by the Bank’s

Attrition may impact the Bank in several ways such 
as lowering the morale, reducing productivity and 
also impacting the Bank’s culture. Higher attrition 
is also linked to higher costs associated with 
replacing, onboarding and training the human 
assets. This may additionally result in Operational 
Risk due to lack of adequate skilled manpower to 
perform critical activities.
Governance Framework
Attrition Risk is reviewed and monitored by the 
Apex Management Committee.

Review of material topics
This year, the Bank undertook a review of its key 
material topics to identify changes in their impacts 
and materiality. The Bank identified actual and 
potential, positive and negative impacts of its material 
issues through a scoping exercise involving its top 
management. The impacts identified were assessed 
and rated for their severity, scale & scope, likelihood 
and significance. The review and impact assessment 
also resulted in the identification of 4 new material 
topics – climate change; financial inclusion; data 
security and privacy and employee engagement; 
retention and turnover. 
74
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Materiality Matrix based on significance of impacts
	
Four new Material Topics have been identified - "Climate Change"; "Financial Inclusion"; "Data Security and 
Privacy"; "Employee Engagement; Retention and Turnover"
	
Similar topics from the list of the previous 16 material issues were clubbed together as part of the review to 
enhance coherence – "Collaborative and Entrepreneurial Work Culture" & "Market-aligned Compensation 
have been grouped into one material topic"; "Value System" and "Long Term Vision & Mission have 
been grouped into one material topic"; "Asset Quality" and "Credit Quality" have been grouped into 
one material topic
	
Significance rating for a negative impact was ascertained by the product of its severity score (scale of 1-3:  
1 - minimal impact which can be corrected in the short-term; 2 - moderate impact which can be corrected 
in the long-term; and 3 - maximum impact which is difficult to correct within a given timeframe) and its 
likelihood of occurrence (scale 1-3: 1 - impact is unlikely to occur; 2 - impact is likely to occur; 3 – will occur) 
	
Significance rating for positive impacts was ascertained by the product of its scale/ scope (scale of 1-3:  
1 - minimally beneficial with low coverage of beneficiaries; 2 - moderately beneficial with modest coverage of 
beneficiaries; and 3 - highly beneficial with large coverage of beneficiaries), and its likelihood of occurrence 
(scale 1-3: 1 - impact is unlikely to occur; 2 - impact is likely to occur; 3 – will occur) 
	
The mean of average score of 4 was ascertained to be the significance threshold. Topics corresponding to 
impacts rated 4 or above were identified as most significant material topics

Climate Change
The Bank's ability to address the 
risks and opportuntites posed 
by climate change and to adapt 
its business by building climate 
resilience
	 Increase in the frequency and severity of 
extreme weather and climatic events may 
adversely affect bank’s infrastructure, 
employees and client performance and 
therefore the bank’s revenues and costs
	 Stricter environmental/ climatic regulations 
and policy changes may impact operations /
strategy of the bank and/ or its clients
	 The Banking sector has a crucial role to play 
in energy transition, climate adaptation and 
the shift to a low-carbon economy
	 According to an independent study by the 
Council on Energy, Environment and Water, 
(one of Asia’s leading not-for-profit policy 
research institutions), India would need 
cumulative investments of USD 10.1 trillion 
to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 to

	 The Bank uses resources such as 
non-renewable energy and paper to run

amongst the unbanked and 
underbanked populations of rural

	 Financial inclusion is a prerequisite to 
inclusive growth and can play a vital 
role in boosting income generation and 
employment opportunities amongst 
vulnerable communities such as rural 
women, farmers, and other underbanked 
segments
	 The banking sector's initiatives towards 
financial inclusion and financial literacy can 
also help protect vulnerable communities 
from falling prey to unregulated money 
lenders and a cycle of overindebtedness

Fostering Gender Equality
At YES BANK, we ensure that our recruitment 
processes are fair and unbiased, which is also 
contributing to improving gender diversity ratio in 
our workforce. The employees are trained through 
various initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion 
and to raise awareness of the prejudices that are 
unintentional. During the year, the Bank conducted 
curated interventions in the form of engaging webinars, 
and drama-based workshops aimed at fostering gender 
equality and creating a more inclusive workplace.
Some of these initiatives include:
Ascend (Women Leaders – Junior to 
Middle Management): The programme 
focussed on sensitising employees on 
how gender stereotyping and career 
limiting 
beliefs 
hold 
women 
back 
in their careers.
Transcend (Women Leaders – Middle to 
Senior Management): The programme 
focussed on how women leaders could 
influence 
their 
careers 
by 
radiating 
confidence, declaring their brand, and 
enhancing their networking skills.
Encouraging Gender Respect: Say Yes To G.R.A.C.E
The Bank has ‘zero tolerance’ towards any act by 
any employee which may fall under the ambit 
of ‘sexual harassment’ at workplace and is fully 
committed to uphold and maintain the dignity 
of every woman employee working for the Bank. 
In line with “The Sexual Harassment of Women at 
Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 
& Rules 2013”, the Bank has a policy on ‘Prevention 
& Prohibition of Sexual Harassment at Workplace’. 
The Bank also has Internal Committees to investigate 
and inquire into sexual harassment complaints, 
in line with its policy. The policy provides for the 
prevention 
of 
sexual 
harassment 
at 
workplace, 
protection of women, and redressal of their complaints. 
The Bank has implemented the ‘Gender Respect 
and Commitment to Equality’ (“GRACE”) programme 
which helps employees understand what constitutes 
sexual harassment, how to prevent it and the 
redressal mechanism in case of any incidents 
reported. The key points of the Act and the details of 
the Internal Committees are shared with all the 
employees and are displayed at branches and 
offices of the Bank. 
There was one pending case at the close of 
FY 2021-22. During FY 2022-23, 20 complaints pertaining 
to sexual harassment were filed, of which 14 cases 
have been closed and 6 cases are pending resolution. 
Investigation has been closed for the pending cases and 
further action is in progress which will be completed 
within the timelines. The complaints received by the 
Bank were handled promptly and effectively with 
utmost sensitivity and confidentiality by the Internal 
Committees. Cases where allegations were established, 
appropriate action was taken in line with the Internal 
Committee’s recommendations.

by the Bank under the Environmental Management 
Policy (EMP) and its compliance to ISO 14001:2015 
requirements (including any health and safety related 
issues that may arise). To ensure compliance and

Human Capital representatives review the assessment 
of senior executives and sign-off their performance 
descriptors. This stage of the process ensures objectivity, 
transparency and collaboration. The performance 
assessment of executives is based on performance 
descriptors and their definitions. The definitions 
not only focus on executive’s achievements vis-à-vis 
expectations of the Bank, but also emphasise on the 
need to uphold core values of the Bank and consistently 
adhere to regulatory compliance and governance 
norms. The focus is not only on the Results (What), but 
also on the process of achieving them (How).
The performance review process has been aligned 
further with the Bank’s priorities. The Management 
team’s goals include Governance and Compliance Key 
Performance Indicators (“KPI”) along with their respective 
functional/business KPIs. As Environmental, Social and 
Governance (“ESG”) is an important element of our 
strategy, domain-specific ESG KPIs have been identified

YES BANK remains committed to environmental accountability and climate action. 
The Bank applies an environmental and climate lens to the way it manages its operations, 
and conducts its lending activity, with a fervent endeavour to minimise the negative 
environmental impacts of its business, and to align with global and national climate 
commitments. The Bank is also a strong advocate for building and sharing knowledge on 
environmental and climate-related issues and continues to work with stakeholders across 
the spectrum to find ways to integrate environmental considerations into business and the 
larger economy.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Integrating E&S Considerations into Lending
YES BANK has adopted a proactive approach to address 
environmental and social impacts that could result from 
its lending activities. Towards this, the Bank has instituted 
an Environment and Social Risk Management System 
(ESMS) to assess and mitigate Environment and Social 
(E&S) risks of its financing activities, centred around its 
Environment and Social Policy. The Bank’s Environment 
and Social Policy (ESP), implemented in 2006, serves as a 
structured approach towards responsible lending.
Environment and Social Policy
The ESP, as an integral part of the Bank’s Environment 
& Social Management System sets out the overarching 
framework for identification and management of 
potential and/or existing E&S risks commensurate with 
the nature and scale of transactions and their potential 
impacts. Through this policy, the Bank integrates 
environmental and social risks into its overall credit risk 
assessment framework, which goes beyond financial risk 
mitigation. It has voluntarily adopted the policy, based 
on international frameworks such as IFC Performance 
Standards. The ESP is a crucial part of the Bank’s credit 
risk appraisal process and the Bank further continues 
to mainstream environment and social considerations 
across its lending by strengthening ESP integration with 
the overall credit risk assessment framework. The policy 
encompasses all the lending transactions of the Bank 
integrating E&S considerations in its financing activities 
and establishes a risk-based approach where high value 
transactions that carry high ESG risks are subject to 
enhanced evaluation and approval through a specialised 
team of internal/external E&S risk assessment experts. 
The policy provides for a ‘list of prohibited activities’ 
that the Bank does not finance, irrespective of the 
credit-related outcomes. The list is derived from the IFC‘s 
exclusion list and include sectors or activities that have 
highly negative impact from Environment and Social lens. 
The policy identifies and classifies the Bank’s lending 
activity into various segments, and accordingly advises 
the applicable procedures for E&S risk assessment. 
Typically, for project finance/project related corporate 
loan transactions as defined in the policy, the E&S risk 
team undertakes an initial assessment to determine the 
degree of adverse environmental or social impact arising 
from business activities of the borrower and accordingly 
categorises transactions based on the level of E&S risks 
involved. For projects with significant E&S risks, the Bank 
conducts enhanced due diligence/ assessment in line 
with IFC PS and national regulations through internal/
independent E&S risk analysts and develops corrective 
action plans with the borrower, performance on which 
is monitored throughout the credit cycle. The Bank 
strives to positively influence borrowers by engaging 
them in adopting appropriate sustainable practices to 
meet higher ESG industry expectations.

Overview of projects for which detailed E&S Due Diligence / Assessment was conducted (FY22)
In FY 2022-23, detailed E&S due dilligence/assessment were conducted for 12 transactions out of which 8 
were project finance cases while 4 were project-related corporate loan transactions.
CASE STUDIES
API and Intermediate Bulk Drug 
Manufacturing Unit
The Borrower approached the Bank to seek 
term loan sanction for setting up a bulk drug 
manufacturing unit. As per the provisions of the 
E&S Policy, the Bank conducted a preliminary 
desk-based 
assessment 
to 
determine 
the 
severity of potential adverse environmental or 
social impact arising from business activities 
of the Project.
The preliminary assessment highlighted the need 
of a detailed Environment & Social Due-Diligence 
(E&S DD) in line with IFC PS, apart from assessment 
of regulatory E&S compliances and clearances. 
Accordingly, a detailed E&S DD of the project 
was commissioned by the Bank to identify and 
mitigate potential E&S risks identified with the 
Project. The E&S DD identified deficiencies such 
as lack of formalised Environmental and Social 
Management System (ESMS) to identify, assess 
and mitigate potential E&S aspects and absence 
of formal Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM). 
The Bank in consultation with the Borrower 
formalised an Environmental & Social Action Plan 
(ESAP) addressing the key concerns identified 
in the E&S DD assessment. The timelines for 
the ESAP implementation have been mutually 
agreed and the same is being monitored on a 
periodic basis.
Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resin Paste 
Manufacturing Unit 
The Bank sanctioned facilities to a Borrower 
for setting up a Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) resin 
paste manufacturing unit. As per the provisions 
of the Bank’s Environmental & Social Policy, 
a 
preliminary 
desk-based 
assessment 
was 
undertaken to identify potential significant 
environmental and social risks. 
Review of the preliminary desk-based assessment 
indicated the need for a detailed E&S DD. The E&S 
DD assessment highlighted the need to improve 
the overall on-site health and safety (H&S) aspects 
during the construction phase.
The Bank engaged with the Borrower to develop 
and implement on-site H&S aspects such as 
formal procedure for hazard identification and 
risk assessment (HIRA), EHS training calendar 
and work permit system. Improvements were 
also made to the existing on-site emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
plan 
(EPRP) 
by 
incorporating 
appropriate 
signages 
in 
vernacular and Hindi languages and further 
suggested to revise the EPRP periodically in 
order to commensurate with increase in the 
on-site labours.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Wind Energy Project: 
The Borrower approached the Bank to sanction 
facilities for developing a wind energy project. 
The Environmental & Social Impact Assessment 
(ESIA) Report prepared for the project identified 
presence of sensitive biodiversity habitats in 
proximity to the project site. As recommended 
in the ESIA Report, a Critical Habitat Assessment 
(CHA) was conducted to assess critical habitat 
values as outlined in IFC Performance Standard 6 
Guidance Note (IFC PS6 GN). The CHA evaluated 
the project to assess project compliance with the 
quantitative thresholds outlined in the IFC PS6 GN.
Subsequent to the CHA, a detailed Bird and 
Bat Diversity and Mortality Assessment was 
commissioned to assess bird population at 
risk. The assessment comprised desk-based 
assessment of the project site using available 
tools such as Integrated Biodiversity Assessment 
Tool (IBAT) and ebird.org, review of bird 
population in the project area, review of 
available literature including the ESIA Report 
and CHA Report, two season field survey for 
detailed habitat mapping, consultation with 
local communities and field staff of local Forest 
Department etc. 
Based on this assessment, a detailed Biodiversity 
Action Plan (BAP) was developed providing 
mitigation measures that can be implemented at 
the project site across the lifecycle (construction to 
decommissioning) to reduce the impact on species. 
The Bank in consultation with the Borrower shall 
be monitoring the implementation of the BAP.
Climate Strategy, Risk and Transition
Climate change poses a significant challenge to 
economies 
globally, 
with 
India 
being 
especially 
vulnerable. YES BANK is committed to aligning its 
business to the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of 
limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C 
and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C, by reducing 
the carbon emissions intensity of its operations, 
measuring and limiting its financed emissions, support 
climate-aligned sectors and aligning its portfolio with 
global decarbonisation pathways.
Climate Strategy 
YES BANK, in its constant quest, to mitigate risks 
and 
leverage 
opportunities 
arising 
out 
of 
a 
low carbon transition, has put in place a holistic 
and long-term roadmap. Guided by this blueprint, 
the Bank strives to respond to the global clarion 
call 
of 
climate 
action 
and 
contribute 
towards 
sustainable 
development. 
Key 
pillars 
of 
the 
strategy focus on: 
Financing low carbon transition 
opportunities 
The Bank strives to mobilise finances 
towards low carbon transition opportunities 
in India, leveraging global green funds 
and green credit lines through innovative 
finance structures.
Building resilience from climate risk
The Bank will develop robust frameworks for 
measuring and assessing material climate 
risk related to its lending operation and 
apply a climate lens to business decisions. 
The Bank will strive to develop its capacity 
and understanding for assessing its portfolio 
under various scenarios and take actions to 
build climate resilience of its portfolio.

Policy advocacy, climate literacy, and 
robust disclosures 
The Bank will engage with its stakeholders 
including clients, peer banks, regulators and 
Governments and climate scenario providers 
for 
accelerating 
low 
carbon 
transition. 
The Bank leveraged its association with global 
initiatives such as UNEP FI Principles for 
Responsible Banking, Collective Commitment 
to Climate Action, and Science Based Targets 
Initiative, 
for 
developing 
forward-looking 
methodologies on climate assessment and 
integration. The Bank is committed to aligning 
its disclosures to industry-best practices such 
as the TCFD recommendations.
Climate-related Risks Identification
YES BANK recognises climate risk as a critical risk and 
since FY 2018-19, the Bank’s management committees 
have been considering climate risk in their briefing. 
The Bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process details its importance within the framework, 
alongside other Pillar II risks. In line with the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB)’s Taskforce on Climate-related 
Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, the Bank has 
classified these climate-related risks as Transition Risks 
and Physical Risks. 
Through a desk research, the Bank enlisted material 
climate-related risks faced by the financial sector. 
The climate-related risks were ranked by the senior 
management, in the order of relevance to the Bank in 
the foreseeable medium-term. Based on this survey, top 
ranking climate-related risks, with maximum potential 
to generate significant change in the Bank’s business 
operations, revenue or expenditure, were identified to 
establish a climate risk profile.
The top three risks identified for the Bank are:
Enhanced Disclosure Policies: Introduction 
of enhanced disclosure policies by the 
government and/or regulatory bodies may 
result in legal proceedings or penalties for 
organisations failing to comply with the 
enhanced disclosure requirements.
Stringent 
Environmental 
Regulation: 
With growing awareness on Environmental 
& Social (E&S) issues globally, countries 
have established robust E&S regulations 
that specify requirements for operating 
licenses, occupational health and safety 
standards, and emission/ discharge limits. 
Stricter environmental regulations may affect 
repayment capability of clients who fail to 
meet the enhanced regulations. 
Increased Severity of Extreme Weather 
Events: In recent years, severe climatic events 
such as droughts, cyclones, high temperatures 
and floods, have impacted India’s economy, 
especially in sectors such as agriculture 
and allied industries. Climate change may 
increase the frequency and severity of climatic 
events, which can adversely affect employee 
& client performance, and therefore the 
Bank’s revenues.

Climate-related Risk Management
YES BANK recognises climate risk as a significant 
risk and refers to the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) 
Taskforce on Climate related Disclosures (TCFD) 
recommendations for adoption of best practices around 
managing and disclosing climate risk. YES BANK broadly 
categorises climate risks into physical and transitional 
risks. Physical risks are a consequence of direct physical 
impacts of climate change and range from acute 
risks (such as extreme weather events) to chronic 
risks (like gradual rise in sea level and temperature). 
Transition Risks arise from external efforts to address 
climate change including, but not limited to, regulatory 
and policy changes, technological advancement or 
shifts in investor sentiment and consumer behaviour. 
The Bank considers climate risk as a material Pillar II 
risk in its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP) document and in it details its overall governance 
and control framework.
In line with its sustainability-focussed vision and 
commitments, YES BANK has put in place systems for 
managing climate-related risks at the organisational, 
project and portfolio levels.
Organisational level
The Bank has a formal process in place for the 
identification of climate risks and opportunities. 
ESG and climate change related risks and opportunities 
are evaluated by Risk Management, Infrastructure 
and 
Facilities 
Management 
(IFM) 
and 
Strategic 
Procurement Units, for the projects and initiatives under 
respective domains. 
In FY 2018-19, ‘Climate risks’ were added to the Bank’s 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), 
which is an integral part of the management and 
decision-making process in the Bank. Climate-related 
risks are reviewed annually to establish adequacy of 
measures taken by the Bank, along with the ongoing 
annual review of the ICAAP. 
The Bank has also constituted an Executive level 
Sustainability Council to ensure deeper integration 
of sustainability into all aspects of business and 
banking. The Council helps develop formal structures 
and actionable frameworks to include risks and 
opportunities arising out of climate change and 
sustainable development.

Environment Management System (EMS) standard, 
globally. The recertification is based on the Bank’s 
Environmental Management Policy released in 2016, 
which commits to reducing the Bank’s carbon emissions 
through broad-level actions.
Recognising the importance of enhanced transparency 
and disclosures, the Bank has been proactively reporting 
on its triple bottom line performance through its 
annual and sustainability reports. These sustainability 
disclosures are aligned with benchmark reporting 
frameworks, 
including 
Integrated 
Reporting, 
GRI 
Standards, TCFD recommendations, Principles for 
Responsible Banking.
Project level 
At a project level, E&S risk assessment is integrated 
into its overall credit approval framework. As part of 
the Bank’s Environment & Social Management System 
(ESMS), a Board-approved Environment & Social 
Policy (ESP) mandates appropriate assessment of E&S 
risks for project finance. The Bank has dedicated E&S 
experts housed within the Credit Risk Unit who are 
responsible for implementing the provisions of the ESP. 
These experts undertake preliminary E&S assessment 
of projects basis the severity of risk. Further detailed 
Environment and Social Impact Assessment is conducted 
against IFC Performance Standards (A number of cross 
cutting topics such as climate change, gender, human 
rights, and water are addressed across multiple 
Performance Standards) by internal/external E&S Risk 
experts and appropriate covenants are included in the 
credit documents which are monitored throughout the 
credit cycle. Further, for identified high risk projects, 
the Bank includes climate risk screening as a part of 
the Environment and Social Due Diligence. Bank has 
also put in framework for readily capturing information 
on key physical and transition risk related indicators 
from clients in preliminary assessment checklist for 
all projects/ project related loan (sanctioned amount 
above a threshold).
Portfolio level 
At a portfolio level, the Bank has identified climate 
sensitive sectors and is taking a sectoral approach 
to measure and mitigate climate risk. It has initiated 
measurement of financed emission of its carbon 
intensive sectors. Further, the Bank is leveraging 
scenario-based assessment to develop roadmaps for 
building climate resilience of portfolio. As a starting 
point, the Bank has specifically focussed on its energy 
exposure, as the sector is at the centre stage for climate 
action globally. The Bank has analysed the financed 
emission intensity in the energy sector and developed 
internal targets to reduce the sectoral emission 
intensity, in line with global de-carbonisation pathways. 
It is in the process of quantifying financed emission 
of rest of its portfolio, to identify carbon intensive 
holding and develop emission reduction targets 
(intensity/absolute) in line with the Paris Agreement, 
as per availability of data and methodologies.

Financed emissions and Portfolio decarbonisation 
targets
In line with global best practices, the Bank has initiated 
measurement and disclosure of financed emissions. 
Financed emissions are emissions of borrowers, that 
can be attributed to the Bank in proportion to quantum 
of financing provided. The Bank is utilising “The Global 
GHG accounting and reporting Standard for the Financial 
Industry” as a guidance for measurement and treatment 
of financed emissions. The Bank has measured financed 
emission of its electricity generation portfolio (covering 
corporate loans, investment (treasury), project finance) 
and is striving to scale up the approach to climate 
intensive sectors.

For electricity generation portfolio (asset classes as 
mentioned), the Bank has used sectoral decarbonisation 
approach by SBTi to establish interim targets in line with 
well below 2 degree scenario, striving for a 1.5 degree 
scenario. Considering base year of FY22, the Bank has 
developed interim target of reducing financed emission 
intensity of its electricity generation portfolio, at least 
by 50%, while striving for achieving 75% reduction by 
FY32. The Bank has developed an internal roadmap 
of mix of non renewable energy and renewable 
energy, that has been incorporated in risk appetite. 
Further, Bank has developed internal additional 
criteria 
for 
financing 
towards 
non-renewable 
energy sector.

In FY22, the emission intensity of electricity generation 
fund based portfolio (corporate loans, project finance, 
investments) was estimated to be 0.628 tCO2e/MWh. 
At the end of FY23, the financed emission of the 
portfolio has declined to 0.404 tCO2e/MWh. This decline 
is attributable to decline in fossil fuel based energy 
generation portfolio from a mix perspective, on account 
of stringent internal lending criteria as well as sale of 
stressed non-renewable energy portfolio, to the ARC. 
In the Indian context, there are challenges regarding 
availability and reliability of emission data. Further, there 
remains challenges in availability of generic sector 
specific financed emission intensity (such as financed 
emission per revenue or finance emission per unit of 
production). As the ESG reporting ecosystem in India 
evolves, disclosure on these aspects would further 
help the Bank to improve data quality of its financed 
emissions. The Bank would also be exploring other 
approaches for some of the sectors/asset classes to 
measure degree of alignment with the Paris Agreement.
Climate-related scenario analysis 
Methodologies and tools to link climate risk to 
traditional financial risk parameters, economic impact 
modelling, scenario analysis and stress testing are 
in early stages and are being progressively explored 
through global collaborations. There are challenges 
that need to be addressed in terms of climate 
related data availabilities (such as frequency of 
climate events at good spatial resolution, regional 
and global impact on sector), availability of regional 
climate impact scenarios and holistic climate risk 
assessment tools and methodologies. To that extent, 
the Bank strives to be ahead of the curve through 
striving to build its capacity and understanding 
of 
financial 
impact 
of 
climate 
change 
and 
methodologies for scenario analysis, working in 
collaborations with peer banks, regulators, data 
providers etc.
In line with its climate commitments, the Bank has 
initiated developing its capacity for scenario analysis 
and is leveraging scenario-based target setting approach 
to develop long-term climate resilient strategies and 
roadmaps on a best effort basis. The Bank has analysed 
its emission from its own operation in various scenarios, 
such as Business as usual, 1.5 degree scenario, well 
below 2 degree scenario, 2 degree scenarios, and 
has drawn insights to develop an ambitious target of 
becoming net zero by 2030. Further, the Bank is striving 
to leverage methodologies and scenarios provided 
by the Science Based Targets Initiative for initiating 
assessment and taking concrete actions to develop 
roadmaps for climate intensive/ vulnerable sectors for 
alignment scenarios limiting global warming to well 
below 2 degrees/striving for 1.5°C. 
To start with, the Bank has developed a roadmap to 
reduce financed emissions of its lending sub-portfolio 
(electricity 
generation) 
emissions 
aligning 
with 
ambitions outlined in Paris Agreement. The Bank would 
continue to build its capacity on this front, through 
piloting emerging methodologies and collaborating with 
regulators, peer banks, think tanks and data providers to 
accelerate developments at this front, both in regional 
and global context.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Transition to low-carbon
The Banking sector has a crucial role to play in energy 
transition, climate adaptation and the shift to a low 
carbon economy. According to the latest estimates, 
India would need over USD 10 trillion of financing to 
achieve its net zero by 2070 target, with investments 
of over USD 8.4 trillion required by the power sector 
alone. A majority of this financing will have to be 
driven by domestic financial institutions to support the 
technology shifts that would be required if India has 
to achieve net zero. The Bank, through its financing to 
renewable energy, contributes to avoidance of emission 
in electricity generation, and assists in decarbonising 
India’s electricity generation.
Clean and renewable energy lending 
In FY 2022-23, YES BANK sanctioned debt facilities of 
` 1,482 crore for supporting renewable energy projects 
including solar, wind, hybrid projects of around 264 MW, 
and transmission and smart metering projects. YES BANK 
continues to offer innovative and responsible solutions 
to the industry and support the country’s transition to a 
low carbon future through its business activities. 
The Bank has continued to channelise its efforts in 
meeting the country’s sustainability goals by sanctioning 
debt facilities amounting to ~ ` 35,650 crore, towards 
~7.26 GW since 2015. Projects underwritten by the Bank 
have found a healthy appetite in the financing market 
with a significant portion of projects being successfully 
downsold/ refinanced. The Bank continues to have a 
positive outlook on the renewable sector and is now 
exploring growth in transmission as well as smart 
metering space.
As at March 31, 2023, the Bank’s lending book size for 
renewable energy generation stood at ~ ` 2,280 crore

CASE STUDIES
Smart Metering
The performance of power sector is a key 
indicator of resilient economy and sustainable 
socio-economic development. Electricity enables 
transformation across all the sections of the 
society by empowering consumers through 
economic benefits which come along with it. 
In this context, Smart Meters play a crucial role in 
enabling consumers to have adequate access to 
optimally priced electricity. 
In order to support the implementation of a Smart 
Metering project, YES BANK has sanctioned credit 
facilities to Advanced Metering Infrastructure 
Service Provider (AMISP). As part of the Project 
which was awarded through the bidding route 
by the state DISCOM, the borrower is required to 
instal smart meters across several districts of the 
state over a period of 27 months. The recovery 
of the capex incurred by AMISP shall be done 
partially through grant provided by the Ministry 
of Power and the balance through Monthly 
Service Charge collected from the DISCOM over 
93 months. While the project offers benefits to 
consumers in terms of accurate meter readings, 
close monitoring of consumption patterns 
and time of day billings (to be introduced later 
by DISCOMS), it enables the state DISCOMS 
in remote meter readings, fault detections, 
improvement in billing & collection efficiency, and 
better planning of generation resources basis the 
load profile of the region.

Avoided emissions 
The Bank, through its financing of renewable energy, 
contributes to avoidance of emissions in electricity 
generation, 
and 
assists 
in 
decarbonising 
India’s 
electricity generation sector. The clients/ projects in the 
Bank’s renewable energy book (as at March 31, 2023) 
would lead to attributable electricity generation of 722 
GWh and attributable avoidance of 685 ktCO2e, annually. 
Avoided emissions through Green Bonds 
YES BANK was the first to issue a green bond in India in 
February 2015 and went on to raise ` 1,645 crore (USD 
260 million), through a total of three green bonds for 
channelising finance towards India’s renewable energy 
sector. The renewable energy projects financed through 
the green bonds proceeds would annually avoid 
2,214 ktCO2e in total, with attributable avoidance of 
414 ktCO2e.
Electric Vehicle (EV) Financing 
India's EV financing industry is projected to be 
worth ` 3.7 lakh crore in 2030, about 80% of India's 
current retail vehicle finance industry of ` 4.5 lakh 
crore (NITI Aayog). Investment in India's transition 
to e-mobility has the potential to create significant 
economic, social, and environmental benefits for the 
country. Currently, one-third of EV vehicles are being 
sold through financing and have the potential 
to grow cent percent with access to the right 
financing options. YES BANK offers EV loans at lower 
interest rates and contributes to the development of the 
electric vehicle ecosystem by financing auto ancillaries 
and charging infrastructure players. In FY 2022-23, 
the Bank’s book size towards EV financing stood at to 
` 120.41 crore.
Sustainable Investment Banking
YES BANK was early to recognise the emergence 
of sustainability-focussed capital raise and deal 
making activities globally and in India. A dedicated 
Sustainable Investment Banking (SIB) practice resides 
within YES BANK’s wholly owned subsidiary, YES 
SECURITIES. The SIB team has a rich sector-specific 
expertise and experience in providing investment 
banking and advisory services in the sustainability 
space, including renewable energy, clean technology, 
environmental services, healthcare, and education. 
SIB 
specialises 
in 
private 
equity 
fund 
raising, 
mergers & acquisitions, technology transfer, business 
advisory and corporate restructuring, among others. 
Since inception, it has successfully executed over 40 
transactions in the sustainability sector, cumulating to a 
transaction value of over USD 8.0 billion. 
During the reporting period, the renewable sector 
transactions remained the staple for the SIB team with 
multiple ongoing mandates for sale of over 500 MW 
of renewable assets. While M&A/ consolidation will 
continue as a common theme for the renewable sector, 
the commercial and industrial (C&I)/ open access (OA) 
projects will look for fund raise. Electric mobility is a 
fast-growing segment where SIB has made inroads 
assisting companies with their fund raising efforts 
including in the battery cell manufacturing space. 
SIB undertook its maiden platform transaction, a unique 
construct involving combination of fund raise and role-up 
of projects via M&A, across water and smart cities. 
Climate-focussed knowledge and advocacy 
Climate change is a pressing and unavoidable challenge. 
However, YES BANK regards climate adaptation as 
a significant opportunity for financial intuitions to 
play a central role. The Bank continues to work with 
stakeholders across the spectrum to develop frameworks 
and methodologies for addressing climate-related 
risks; build and share knowledge on green financing 
opportunities and mobilise finance and attention 
towards climate-aligned sectors. Initiatives undertaken 
by the Bank towards climate action include:
	 Working with Indian Banking Association as Member 
of the Standing Committee on Environmental, 
Social and Governance
	 The Bank is also member of IBA Working Groups on 
“Developing National Green Finance Taxonomy for 
Banks” and “Transition Financing” 
	 Contributed as special invitee to Working Group on 
Sustainable Finance by CDP
 YES BANK continues to collaborate with the 
Department 
of 
Science 
& 
Technology 
(DST), 
Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Climate Modelling 
at 
IIT 
Delhi 
to 
develop 
an 
India 
Centric 
Climate Model (ICCM). As a part of its efforts, 
the DST has developed 10 papers on various 
aspects of the ICCM that have advanced the 
understanding of the Indian climate and the impacts 
of climate change on crops, health, glaciers, and 
wind energy resource of the country. In the process, 
about a dozen early career researchers have been 
trained in climate modelling as a part of capacity 
building, thus preparing the next generation of India’s 
climate modellers.

Green Climate Fund (GCF)
YES BANK is one of only five Accredited Entities for the 
Green Climate Fund in India. The Bank was approved as 
an accredited entity by GCF in November 2019, post a 
rigorous assessment of the Bank’s key administrative 
and financial capacities (which includes general 
management, 
financial 
management, 
control 
frameworks, transparency and accountability), fiduciary 
capacities (which includes project management, grant 
awards, on-lending and blending), and environment and 
social safeguards and gender capacities. The Bank was 
one of the first Indian private Banks to be nominated 
as ‘Direct Access Entities’ for GCF by the Ministry of 
Environment, Forests and Climate Change. The Bank 
is expediting its agreement with GCF to access GCF 
funding for climate mitigation and adaptation projects 
in India. The Bank is exploring potential project pipelines 
in climate change sectors like e-mobility, water & waste 
management, green real estate & energy efficiency, and 
climate smart agriculture.
Enhancing Operational Eco-efficiency
YES BANK is committed to minimising the environmental 
footprint of its operations, and to ensure that its 
branches, offices, products and services, adhere to 
the highest standards of environmental performance. 
In FY 2021-22, the Bank enhanced its processes 
for tracking and reducing consumption of key 
resources 
such 
as 
electricity; 
water; 
paper, 
amongst others. The Bank is also instituting new 
mechanisms for responsible waste management and 
rolled-out a bank-wide training module to educate its 
employees on its environmental goals and best practices 
in environmental management. 
Environmental Management System 
The Bank has adopted an Environmental Management 
Policy (EMP) which outlines its commitment to 
continuously benchmark and enhance its environmental 
performance, reduce impacts, fulfil its environmental 
obligations 
and 
support 
sustainable 
growth. 
Guided by its EMP, the Bank has instituted a 
robust Environmental Management System (EMS) 
to manage the significant environmental impacts of 
its operations. In FY 2022-23, the Bank’s EMS was 
certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant for the 10th year 
in a row. Additionally, the Bank increased the number 
of ISO 14001 certified facilities to 833 from 732 in the 
previous year. 
Energy consumption
Cognizant of its use of energy to power its facilities 
and 
operations, 
YES 
BANK 
has 
undertaken 
a 
focussed approach to monitor and reduce its energy 
consumption by enhancing energy efficiency and 
promoting 
energy 
saving 
practices 
amongst 
its 
employees. The Bank has migrated all its facilities 
from conventional fixtures to light-emitting diode (LED) 
lighting, across India. In FY 2022-23, the Bank replaced 
21,259 conventional fixtures with LED units across 565 
branches, resulting in 2,362.56 GJ in energy savings^. 
The Bank also replaced 167 CFL signage with LED units 
across 154 branches. The Bank is also in the process 
of phasing out air conditioning systems that use ozone 
depleting coolants. This year, the Bank replaced 1,055 
tonnage/ 970 Units of R22 air conditioners (in 248 
branches) that were more than 10 years old with energy 
efficient (star rated) systems that use eco-friendly 
coolants, thus reducing its environmental footprint. 
The Bank’s focussed energy conservation initiatives 
resulted in 11.57% reduction its energy intensity (per 
FTE*) from the previous year, even as its overall energy 
consumption for FY 2022-23 increased by a marginal 
2.26% over the previous year, due to the addition of 
new facilities. 
Emission reduction 
The carbon emissions from its use of energy, 
represent 
one 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
most 
significant 
environmental impacts. YES BANK is cognizant of 
its climate-related impacts and strives to align its 
business to the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting 
global temperature rise. Towards this, the Bank 
aims to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
with a target of reaching net zero by 2030 (from 
base year FY 2019-20). To achieve its net zero target, 
the Bank plans to migrate most of its facilities to 
renewable energy. In FY 2022-23, the share of renewable 
electricity in the Bank’s electricity mix increased to 
~11% resulting in approximately 4,435.77 tCO2e in 
avoided emissions. Currently, the Bank’s corporate 
office, YES BANK House along with 34 of its 81 
Branches in Mumbai have been shifted to renewables. 
Led by its adoption of renewable energy, the Bank 
reduced its direct emissions by 13.66% in FY 2022-23, 
over the previous year. In FY 2022-23, the Bank reduced 
its emissions intensity (per FTE) by 23.61% from 
the previous year.

Air emissions: NOx, SOx and PM emissions through diesel consumption are 826.09 kg, 275.78 kg, and 50.91 kg 
respectively. This has been estimated on a sampling basis using weighted average methodology
GHG Table Footnotes
# Scope 1 emissions include 10% refrigerant leakage from AC systems (as suggested in the “IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the 
Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System”). Scope 1 emissions also include diesel consumption for the Bank. The emission factors and 
GWP (Global Warming Potential) values have been taken from the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol
## Scope 2 emissions constitute CO2 emissions from grid electricity (from non-renewable sources) consumed by YES BANK. 
The emission factors have been taken from Central Electrical Authority (CEA’s) CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, 
Version 18. In January 2022, the Bank started sourcing renewable energy to power YES BANK House, avoiding 4,435.77 tCO2e in 
FY 2022-23. Grid electricity consumed has been estimated from facility-wise electricity bills and state-wise tariff charges 
Energy consumption and GHG emissions from the Bank's operations
The Bank monitors and tracks its energy consumption and GHG emissions, and undertakes measures to minimise it 
on an annual basis. Given its nature of business, the Bank’s highest environmental impacts come from its Scope 1, 
Scope 2 and Scope 3, GHG emissions, as part of operating a pan India physical and digital presence. In FY 2022-23, 
the Bank’s energy consumption stood 220.23 TJ (for a breakup of the Bank’s energy consumption from renewable 
and non-renewable sources, refer page 306). The Bank’s energy intensity, within its operational boundaries^ stood 
at 8.00 GJ/ FTE. The energy consumed by its outsourced data centres is estimated at 36.30 TJ.

Protection Agency document 
Category 7: Employee Commuting: includes employee commute (2,316.14 tCO2e). The emission factors for employee commute have been 
taken from India Specific Road Transport Emission Factors (2015) & India Specific Rail Transport Emission Factors for Passenger Travel and 
Material Transport (2015) by India GHG programme. The emissions through daily employee commute have been estimated basis 17,118 
responses received through primary pan-bank survey
Category 8: Upstream Leased Assets: Upstream Leased Assets: incudes outsourced data centres (7,208.79 tCO2e). The emission factor for 
electricity consumption through data centres is taken from Central Electrical Authority (CEA’s) CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power 
Sector, Version 18. Due to incorrect estimation of KwH consumption, the emissions from data centers in FY 2021-22 were over-reported by 
62,328 tCO2e. The same has been restated, resulting in a positive reduction in the Bank's overall Scope 3 emissions.
Category 15: Investments: includes financed emissions from the Bank’s electricity generation portfolio (covering corporate loans, investment, 
project finance). Attributed Financed emission 5,59,982.76 and emission intensity (tCO2e/MWh) 0.404. The Bank has utilised PCAF (2022). 
The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard Part A: Financed Emissions. Second Edition. to calculate financed emission. For emission

for measurement and treatment of financed emissions wherever emission data is not available publicly
^	 The Bank's operational boundary for data pertaining to its energy consumption and GHG emissions include its 9 major offices, 1,192 
Branches and its IFSC Banking Unit (IBU) in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT). Emissions through currency chests and YES 
Securities (India) Limited (YSIL) (a subsidiary of YBL) which operates from YES BANK House are also included. Emissions through electricity 
consumption at off-site ATMs have not been included due to the unavailability of reliable data
*	 FTE includes all full-time employees across YES BANK’s pan-India and Abu Dhabi facilities. 
Internal Carbon Pricing
In order to drive low carbon transition of its operations, 
the Bank undertook an exercise to determine its internal 
carbon price. At an organisation level, the Bank has 
estimated an implicit price of ` 970 per tCO2e emissions, 
i.e. to avoid one unit tCO2e emissions, annual cost or 
required expenditure is of around ` 970. The estimation 
is based on the internal roadmap to achieve its 
ambition of net zero target covering Scope 1 and Scope 
2 emissions, and annual expenditures required to 
achieve the reduction. The implicit carbon price varies 
for different facilities in different geographical locations. 
Facility level estimates range from implicit price of ` 660/
tCO2e emissions to ` 1,520/tCO2e emissions, with the 
overall carbon price at an organisational level estimated 
at ` 970 per tCO2e emissions emitted. The Bank will relook 
and re-calibrate its carbon price on a periodic basis to 
consider emerging alternatives and evolving ecosystem. 
The implicit price enables the Bank to drive low carbon 
investment, energy efficiency and change internal 
behaviour and in turn meet stakeholder expectation of 
Environment
doing business in an environmentally sustainable way. 
The implicit carbon price enables the Bank for a faster 
transition to energy efficient equipment and renewable 
energy sourcing, through inclusion of the cost of 
carbon abatement in its investments and expenditures, 
reflecting the holistic cost-benefit analysis.

Financial Inclusion & Social Financing
YES BANK is committed to contribute to and 
further the government and RBI’s goals to expand 
the access of financial services, deeper into rural 
underserved areas. The Bank has taken steps to widen 
the reach and uptake of government schemes such as 
the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and Kisan 
Credit Card (KCC) amongst women and individuals in 
rural, hard to reach areas. In line with the strategic pillars 
of RBI’s National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, the 
Bank has focussed on frugal innovations and on-ground 
partnerships to enhance access to basic financial 
services such as savings accounts, loans and remittance 
facilities; promote financial literacy; support livelihood 
and skill-building of vulnerable communities; and 
safeguard such customers through robust responsible 
lending and grievance redressal processes. The Bank 
has implemented a comprehensive Financial Inclusion 
Plan which is reviewed by its Board of Directors on 
an annual basis.

Financial inclusion continues to be a key national priority and a critical developmental goal 
for India. Deepening the reach and access of formal financial services and credit amongst 
unbanked, hard to reach, and vulnerable communities, can reduce income inequality, boost 
economic output and prevent vulnerable communities from falling prey to unregulated money 
lenders and over indebtedness. Initiatives aimed at the financial inclusion of women can also 
help accelerate gender equality and women’s economic empowerment.

Support livelihood and skill-building 
of vulnerable communities
The Bank has committed to catalyse 
employment and entrepreneurship 
opportunities for 100,000 youth by 2026. 
Through programmes undertaken by 
YES Foundation, its social development 
arm, the Bank provides underprivileged 
youth, skill-based training for market 
oriented jobs – over 5,000 youth have 
been skilled since 2021 through the 
Bank’s initiatives. The Bank has also 
created entrepreneurship opportunities 
for 30,000 villagers, aimed at enhancing 
the earning capability of rural population 
with a focus on farm productivity, farm 
extension, handicrafts, among others.
Promoting financial literacy 
The Bank undertakes various interventions to engage 
with customers and incubate financial discipline among 
its members. Women members are imparted financial 
literacy training through a process called Compulsory 
Group Training (CGT), by BC Agents and the Bank’s 
staff, and training efficacy is assessed through a verbal 
interactive test called Group Recognition Test (GRT). 
The Bank in collaboration with Accion International has 
also designed customised training modules to promote 
financial literacy amongst its customers. In FY 2022-23, 
over 1,798 Financial Literacy Camps were conducted 
across 133 rural Branches. 
Responsible lending and grievance redressal 
processes
The Bank undertakes several measures to protect its 
microfinance customers from over indebtedness and to 
ensure that they are able to repay the loan without any 
harassment and duress. 
Financial Inclusion & Social Financing

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Steps to mitigate over indebtedness of borrowers:
	 	Household Assessment: Prior to loan sanctioning, 
the 
Bank 
undertakes 
a 
detailed 
household 
assessment capturing the amenities and assets 
available in the household, income, expense 
and loan obligations of all household members. 
Through this process, the Bank arrives at the 
net disposable income for the household which 
is one of the key determinants for deciding loan 
eligibility and sanction amount
	 	Limit of total indebtedness: To avoid over 
indebtedness of the customer, a loan is only 
sanctioned for cases where total indebtedness 
is less than ` 2 lakh (basis the MFI Credit Bureau report)
	 	Loan 
applications 
are 
screened 
basis 
combined credit report (CCR) of the household: 
In addition to the total indebtedness limits, screening 
is also done basis delinquency in microfinance, 
agri 
as 
well 
as 
retail 
loans 
for 
customers 
as well as household members
	 	Loan eligibility based on customer categorisation: 
Loan eligibility limits are also set based on 
categorisation of New to Credit (NTC), New to Bank 
(NTB) and Existing to Bank customers. The limit 
for NTC and NTB is deliberately set lower taking a 
conservative approach towards their credit exposure
	 	Promoting responsible usage of loan: At the time 
of Compulsory Group Training (CGT) and Group 
Recognition Training (GRT), customers are advised to 
utilise the loan that will be sanctioned for productive 
purposes. The purpose of the loan is also captured in 
the Loan Application Form and Sanction Letter
	 	Group Credit Product Plus and Hospicash: The 
Bank provides customers an opportunity to opt for 
insurance products such as Group Credit Product Plus 
(GCPP) and Hospicash. GCPP relieves the customer 
and household of the debt burden in the eventuality 
of the death of the customer or co-insured. In most 
instances this is a critical support as the loss of a key 
earning member leads to economic hardship for the 
family and delinquency could affect access to future

credit. Hospicash on the other hand ensures that 
the customer/ household doesn’t have to dip into 
their savings/ monthly income in case of medical 
emergencies, thus minimising any adverse impact 
on the customer’s repayment capacity
Responsible customer handling and staff training:
  YES BANK has a Board approval Fair Practices Code 
specific to Microfinance customers, which outlines 
its commitment to not resort to undue harassment 
or use of force against customers and that the 
Bank would be accountable for any inappropriate 
behaviour by its employees or employees of its 
outsourced agency 
  All ISB employees undergo the mandatory ‘Code 
of Conduct’ training module of the Bank. All BCAs 
(employees of YBL’s BC partners who are involved in 
sourcing and collection on behalf of YBL) are required 
to get a certification from the Indian Institute of 
Banking & Finance (IIBF) within 9 months of their 
association with YES BANK. In addition to general 
banking and technical aspects, this IIBF module also 
includes a section on behavioural aspects
Responsible repayment and collection practices: 
	 	Customers are provided with a detailed repayment 
schedule at the time of loan disbursement, along with 
a loan card which is updated at the time of collection
	 	Collection is undertaken only at a designated place 
(centre) for the ease of customers
  Any deviation from the collection date, non 
updation of loan card, behavioural issues and other 
service issues can be reported by the customer on 
the toll free grievance redressal number (which 
is shared at the time of CGT, GRT, is also mentioned 
on 
the 
repayment 
schedule 
and 
displayed 
in the BC Branch)
Financial Inclusion & Social Financing
Grievance Redressal:
	 	In order to provide timely redressal of customer 
grievances at no extra cost and given that most of 
the Bank’s microfinance customers are located in 
rural, hard to reach areas, the Bank has introduced 
a “Missed Call Facility” for customers to register 
their grievances
	 	Missed calls made by customers are responded to 
through a callback in the customer’s vernacular 
language, wherein the customer may comfortably 
explain his/ her complaints or grievances. The Missed 
Call number is prominently displayed at BC Banking 
outlets, BC branches and on the Loan Card given 
to the borrowers
  Additionally, BCBO being a fixed point outlet, 
additional options of Grievance Redressal are also 
provided to the customers. Customers may register 
their complaints through the existing YES TOUCH 
grievance channels (ex: calling up the contact centre 
at 1800 1200). The Grievance Redressal posters in 
local languages are prominently displayed at the 
BCBO outlets to guide the customers in this regard. 
For customers who wish to submit any complaint 
in written form at the outlet, three ply complaints 
registers with serial numbers are maintained at the 
BC banking outlets. All BCBOs are also equipped with 
a separate Complaint/Suggestion Box
Social financing
The Bank continues to finance a number of significant 
sectors that play a huge role in contributing to 
sustainable development goals, enhancing employment 
opportunities, 
reducing 
income 
inequality 
and 
generating social impact. 
	 	SME Financing: India’s SMEs contribute to nearly 
one-third of the country’s GDP through their domestic 
and international commerce and are a key focus 
area for the Bank. The Bank reported ` 24,502 crore 
136
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
in disbursement to the SME segment in FY 2022-23. 
The Bank continues to develop targeted products for 
green financing; for example, offering loans to SMEs 
for the adoption of rooftop solar panels, promoting 
solar water pumps for farming under the PM Kusum 
Scheme, offering bank guarantees and commercial 
vehicle financing to urban waste collectors and 
processors, financing equipment manufacturers of 
effluent treatment and sewage treatment plants, 
and supporting the electric vehicle ecosystem by 
financing auto ancillaries and charging infrastructure 
players. As at March 31, 2023, the Bank’s SME 
financing advances stood at ` 28,186 crore
	 	Affordable Housing: Affordable housing is a critical 
sector to enable India’s socio-economic development. 
To address the grave issue of affordable housing 
shortage, the government has already taken various 
initiatives including “Housing for All”. Most of the 
organised lenders require standard documented 
income proof thus making it difficult for this section of 
the society to avail a home loan. Understanding their 
challenges, YES BANK decided to take a step forward 
to help people fulfil their dreams and launched YES 
KHUSHI Home Loans in May 2016, as a step towards 
social responsibility by serving the underserved/ 
neglected segment of the society & meeting their 
financial need. YES KHUSHI home loans is primarily 
targeted towards the Economically Weaker Section 
and Low Income Group segments which may 
have formal, semi-formal or informal income 
documents and looking for financial assistance 
to buy or construct their first home. The Bank’s 
target customers majorly include small traders & 
Green and Social Financing
The Banking sector has a crucial role to 
play in climate adaptation, shifting to 
a low-carbon economy and achieving 
sustainable developmental goals. 
According to the latest estimates, 
India would need over USD 10 trillion 
of financing to achieve its net zero by 
2070 target, and an estimated USD 
2.6 trillion to meet its Sustainable 
Development Goals by 2030. A majority 
of this financing will have to be driven by 
domestic financial institutions.

Sustainable Supply Chain
YES BANK’s large and diverse supplier base of over 11,450+ large, medium, and small suppliers 
are integral to the vitality of its business and ecosystem. The Bank has set up a Strategic 
Procurement Unit (SPU) staffed with executives, skilled in responsible sourcing practices across 
categories, functions and domains. The Bank’s SPU has adopted a robust procurement model 
which aims to strike the right balance between cost, agility and governance in its procurement 
practices and integrate ESG principles into the Bank’s larger value chain. 
The Bank continues to manage its supply chain based on the following principles:
Supplier base
In FY 2022-23, the Bank transacted with over 6,900+ 
suppliers for provision of goods and services across all 
its offices and branches. The Bank has formed strategic 
relationships with eminent Indian and global companies, 
however, almost all transactions and procurements are 
done through domestic vendors. As the Bank is spread 
across the country, it also procures from local vendors 
for localised consumption of products and services. 
Ensuring governance, transparency and 
greater accountability
The Bank has established a clearly defined risk 
management framework for its suppliers, based on the 
risk profile of the vendor and item category. In order to 
mitigate the risks for the Bank, control and governance 
parameters have been constructed, implemented and 
reviewed on a periodic basis. Additionally, the Bank 
has implemented a Vendor Performance Evaluation 
Framework wherein periodic vendor performance 
reviews are conducted based on vendor category. 
The Bank has also put in place processes to ensure 
vendor redundancy/ Business Continuity Planning (BCP) 
for critical spend categories.
In addition to assessing vendors’ credibility, capability 
and cost to deliver, YES BANK has implemented 
well-established vendor guidelines, outlining its vendor 
selection criteria in compliance with the law. This has 
been further enhanced with the introduction of SAP

Ariba e-Sourcing Platform which has improved fairness 
and transparency in sourcing processes. The e-sourcing 
platform is helping the Bank bring in fair and transparent 
sourcing processes. While this has already become 
an integral part of the sourcing process, the Bank is 
continually looking to enhance the institutionalisation 
of 
the 
implemented 
system-based 
workflows. 
One of the key focus areas this year has been skill 
development within the procurement team wherein 
the team has collectively clocked more than 115 
man-days of learning and development engagements 
on functional and cognitive skill development. This also 
includes participation in conferences and seminars for 
knowledge enhancement.
As 
part 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
stated 
objective 
and 
commitment to implement best practices in Corporate 
Governance, the Bank has a Whistle-blower Portal viz. 
‘Corporate Whistle-blower Initiative’ (CWI) which is an 
independent online reporting service aimed at facilitating 
secure and confidential communication of any concerns 
faced by its vendors to the designated and independent 
Whistle-blower Committee constituted by the Bank.
During FY 2022-23, SPU continued to identify cost 
management initiatives based on spend analytics to 
optimise cost structures and collaborated with various 
operation/ functional units, to identify opportunities for 
value engineering and innovative solutions. 
Digitisation
In line with YES BANK’s vision of digitisation of processes 
and strengthening digital paperless procurement, the 
Bank is implementing Procure to Payment solutions, 
which will digitise Sourcing to Procure to Payment 
process with adequate controls built into the solutions 
to meet policy and process requirements. The Bank has 
significantly increased the receipt of e-Invoices from key 
suppliers to enhance its digital procurement journey.
Integrating ESG considerations into supply 
chain 
As India’s first banking signatory to the UN Global 
Compact, YES BANK continues to abide by the 10 
principles of the Compact encompassing human 
rights, 
labour, 
environment, 
and 
anti-corruption. 
The Bank uses these principles as a foundation for 
its sustainable supply chain practices. The Bank 
has instituted a Supplier Code of Conduct, based on 
benchmark Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
parameters, defining its commitment to environmental, 
health and safety regulations; local employment and 
labour laws; human rights including elimination of 
forced labour, child labour and discrimination; national 
and international antitrust and trade control regulations; 
anti-corruption, anti-bribery & anti-competitive trade 
practices; and norms related to data privacy and conflict 
of interest, amongst others. Through its Supplier Code, 
which forms part of its business agreements and 
contracts, the Bank ensures that its suppliers support 
its sustainability agenda; comply with applicable laws 
and adhere to globally recognised ESG standards. 
The Bank continues to take steps towards assessing 
the ESG awareness and preparedness of its suppliers 
in a phased manner and educating them about 
ESG best practices through webinars and surveys. 
The 
assessments 
will 
enable 
the 
Bank 
to 
score vendors on their ESG performance and identify 
areas for improving controls and limiting potential 
negative impacts of its supply chain. In FY 2022-23, the 
Bank’s ESG awareness initiatives covered over 60 of its 
strategic vendors, representing nearly 85% of the Bank’s 
SPU-led spends.
Sustainable sourcing
The Bank continues to enhance its sustainable sourcing 
practices 
and 
proactively 
identifies 
opportunities 
to 
adopt 
innovative 
sustainable 
products 
and 
solutions. In FY 2022-23, the Bank began sourcing 
renewable energy to power 34 of its 81 Branches 
in Mumbai. For its head office, YES BANK House 
(YBH), the Bank continues to procure renewable 
energy partly through open access, Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy producers 
along 
with 
subscribing 
to 
Green 
Power 
Tariff 
programmes. To enhance its energy efficiency, the Bank 
completely migrated all its facilities from conventional 
fixtures to light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, across 
India. The Bank is also eliminating the use of printed 
flexes for its promotional activities and switching to 
digital screens at many of its facilities. Over the years, 
YES BANK has eliminated the use and procurement of 
single-use plastics and switched to procuring 100% 
recycled paper (A4) for internal operational use, across 
all its facilities.

Digital Leadership

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Over the past few years, the financial sector has seen a 
significant rise in investments towards digitisation and 
in the adoption of cutting-edge digital technologies. 
However, the rise in digitisation has also led to the 
emergence of security risks which could occur due to 
the breach of confidentiality, integrity and availability 
of classified data like customers’ personal and financial 
information. Protecting customer information is a key 
priority at YES BANK.
The Bank has instituted a well-defined governance 
structure for information security and data protection. 
It has constituted an Information Security Unit led by 
the Chief Information Security Officer and adopted 
a 
Board-approved 
Information 
Security 
Policy. 
A management level committee (“Security Council”), with 
cross-functional representation, meets on quarterly 
basis 
to 
review 
security 
implementation 
across 
the Bank and provide guidance to the information 
security function.
The Board-level Risk Management Committee monitors 
information/ cyber security related risks as part of the 
Bank’s overall risk profile and provides guidance and 
direction on information security. The Bank has also 
adopted the Global Information Security Standard 
ISO 27001:2013 and implemented a Board-approved 
Information Security Policy and Cyber Security Policy, as 
directives to protect its information assets.
YES BANK has adopted a Risk-based approach and 
follows defence-in-depth to protect its information 
systems against cyber-attacks. It has adopted a Cyber 
Security Resilient framework to manage cyber security 
risk. The framework rides on four pillars – Protect, 
Detect, Respond and Recover. The Bank has established 
a 24x7 security operations center (SOC) to monitor 
Cyber Risks, which keeps vigil on suspicious network 
traffic and events to detect any anomalies and helps 
respond to potential incidents, in a timely manner.
The Bank also subscribes to various threat intelligence 
services that help identify malicious indicator of 
compromise (IOCs) and block them as a proactive 
approach to prevent potential attacks.
The Bank undertakes various initiatives to build 
awareness about cyber security. It organises regular 
awareness campaigns for employees, consultants, 
vendors, customers, and other stakeholders on 
global cyber security threats, and issues guidance on 
using digital platforms in a safe and secure manner. 
The Bank also performs simulated phishing drills to 
check the awareness of its employees and contract 
staff with targeted trainings for staff who fall prey to 
such phishing simulations. Additionally, independent 
reviews of the cyber security function are carried out by 
the Bank’s internal audit team and presented to Board 
level committees.
The Bank has initiated Digital Forensics Readiness 
Assessment to ensure that all relevant logs are captured, 
in case of any forensics investigation, and has also 
initiated Cloud Security Assessment which would assist 
in building a framework for Cloud security.

Enhancing customer experience through AI
AI has evolved into a credible strategic tool for addressing business problems. AI projects drive value 
across the business, especially in customer service, cost optimisation and revenue generation 
	 YES ROBOT: YES BANK’s flagship AI-powered chatbot, YES ROBOT, is a comprehensive, secure, 24*7 
Personal Banking Assistant for customers and is currently available on the Bank’s website and on 
WhatsApp. It has helped the Bank enhance its customer service by reducing the time-of-first-response to 
just a few seconds. The chatbot is witnessing over 7 million interactions per month. The chatbot empowers 
customers to get their basic banking queries and requests addressed anytime anywhere. It also enables the 
Bank’s Branch staff to address more complex customer requirements, effectively
	 YES ROBOT 2.0: The Bank recently launched YES ROBOT 2.0, a Digital Assistant that empowers YES 
BANKers to connect with customers & generate high quality leads instantly. Over 29,500 leads have been 
generated since its launch in April 2023. In the near future, the Bank plans to extend AI bot services to 
additional channels and applications like IVR and IOT interfaces like Alexa and Google Assistant. The Bank is 
also exploring the use of multi-lingual and voice bots for the coming future
Customer Experience
As a customer-centric Bank, YES BANK has built a culture 
that is focussed on delivering quality customer service 
with empathy and ownership. The Bank leverages 
state-of-the-art 
technology 
to 
enhance 
customer 
delight through a three-pronged strategy comprising 
customer experience, innovation and quality assurance. 
The Bank’s Customer Experience unit captures the Voice 
of the Customer (VOC) and Customer Scoring through 
transaction and engagement feedback, utilising digital 
platforms, and assessing performance across key 
service drivers. 
The Bank has institutionalised Net Promoter Score 
(NPS) as a key metric to drive superior service 
experience, customer loyalty and advocacy, across 
its various customer channels. NPS is a metric for 
measuring Customer Experience and is a predictor of 
customer loyalty. It has been adopted by several global 
organisations to improve customer experience across 
products and services. NPS is calculated by subtracting 
the percentage of customers who are Detractors (i.e. 
customer rating between 0 and 6) from the percentage 
who are Promoters (i.e. customer rating 9 or 10).
The Bank continues to make steady progress in its 
commitment to Customer Service Experience and 
Satisfaction, as demonstrated by a reduction in 
Detractors and increase in Promoter trends resulting 
in improved Net Promoter Scores across customer 
channels. The Bank ended the FY 2022-23 with a 9 points 
improvement in its overall Retail Banking NPS score as 
compared to the previous year.
The Bank’s investment in digital platforms has 
strengthened its Customer Experience measurement 
process by making it real-time and based on contextual 
conversations with the customers. Along with measuring 
NPS, the Bank has also initiated ‘close looping’ 
customer feedback by implementing methodologies 
like carrying out service recoveries of the Detractors, 
Winback initiative to retain customers, and deepening 
of relationship with the Promoters. Specific insights 
based on the Voice of the Customer (VOC) are 
reviewed periodically with the respective stakeholders / 
functions to drive improvement in People, Process and 
Technology/Infrastructure so as to enable consistent 
and superior banking experience to customers.

Progress across our Key Intervention Areas in FY 2022-23
Employability
Over the past decade, India has witnessed rapid 
growth, driven by the development of the new-age 
sectors. The rise in purchasing power has resulted 
in the demand for a new level of quality of service. 
Employers frequently report a skill gap deficit in the 
candidates they hire, leading to a high demand of 
skilled manpower to address the rising requirements 
of the economy. 
In this context, YES Foundation has undertaken skilling 
programmes for underprivileged youth in the service 
sector with a focus on soft skills and work readiness 
trainings. The programme ensures that 30% of 
targeted beneficiaries are women, and at least 70% 
of the trainees get employed. Over 2,500 youth were 
trained through the project in FY 2022-23.
“I got to know about YES Foundation’s future 
skills programme through an orientation 
session organised at our college. I completed 
my course in Java, which helped me in coding. 
I now have an improved skill set and I am 
grateful to the project for changing my life.” 
- Shruti, Project Beneficiary
Entrepreneurship
YES Foundation remains committed to playing its part 
in the achievement of the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and contribute to the national vision of an 
Atmanirbhar Bharat. The Foundation’s enhanced value 
proposition focusses on nurturing rural entrepreneurs 
and maximising their potential with an objective of 
strengthening rural economies. 
The 
Foundation’s 
entrepreneurship 
focussed 
programme enhances income generation opportunities 
through farming extensions, agricultural inputs and 
promotion of handicrafts and handlooms. During the 
year, over 15,000 community members from rural 
Haryana, 
Odisha, 
Madhya 
Pradesh, 
Rajasthan, 
Assam and Uttar Pradesh were engaged through 
entrepreneurship development training and capacity 
building, market linkage and productivity enhancement. 
In addition, over 5,000 farming households from rural 
Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan 
enhanced their income as they adopted climate resilient 
cropping practices, supported with soil conservation 
and water management technologies.
Uma Bai, a Project Beneficiary in the village 
of Bagdar in Rajasthan, belongs to a poor 
landless family whose primary source of 
income is labour work. Her husband also works 
as a farm labourer but they face livelihood 
insecurity during monsoons when no labour 
work is available in the village. Uma expressed 
interest in starting a dairy business when 
consulted by the programme. She received 
training on dairy management through YES 
Foundation and is now able to earn a monthly 
income of seven thousand rupees by selling 
buffalo milk to a cooperative. Commenting on 
the programme, Uma said, “I can take care of 
my small children since I have a regular source 
of income and I don’t have to stay away from 
home for long hours.”

1. Climate Modelling
The YES Foundation Chair at IIT Delhi promotes 
excellence and leadership in the field of climate 
change research, climate model development and 
improvement for accurate future climate change 
projections in the Indian context. The YES Foundation 
Chair in collaboration with the Department of 
Science & Technology (DST), Centre of Excellence 
(CoE) in Climate Modeling at IIT Delhi, has been 
instrumental in developing an India Centric Climate 
Model (ICCM) and worked on 10 research papers on 
various aspects of the ICCM that have advanced the 
understanding of the Indian climate and the impacts 
of climate change on crops, health, glaciers, and 
wind energy resource of the country. In the process, 
about a dozen early career researchers have been 
trained as climate modellers as a part of capacity 
building, thus preparing the next generation of 
India’s climate modellers.
2. YES! to Sustainable SMEs in India
Small and Micro Enterprises (SMEs) play a critical 
role in India’s economic growth but the sector 
also accounts for a significant portion of India’s 
total industrial pollution. ‘YES! to Sustainable 
SMEs in India’ is a programme implemented by 
YES Foundation, which aims to support SMEs for 
adopting best practices in Energy Efficiency. 
Chemical 
Resources, 
a 
Panchkula-based 
SME, manufactures medicines since 2003. 
As part of the project, a walk-through energy 
audit was conducted and it was identified 
that the unit’s power factor controlled panel 
was not working properly which led to 
additional energy consumption. The auditor 
suggested installing a variable frequency 
drive on large motors which could operate at 
variable loads and installation of automatic 
control of cooling tower fan, which would 
enable energy conservation during cold 
days. Reparation of the plant’s power factor 
controlled panel, helped the SME unit save 
approximately ` 1.42 lakh, thereby conserving 
18,000 kWh of electricity.
Payroll Giving Programme
In 2022, YES BANK launched its payroll giving programme for YES Foundation. Over 20% of the Bank’s 
employees enrolled for this initiative, contributing nearly ` 80 lakh per annum towards various social causes. 
Employee Volunteering
In FY 2021-22, YES BANK instituted its employee volunteering policy and launched its employee volunteering 
programme called ‘EVOLVE’ to enable its employees to contribute towards social causes and the community. 
Since then, YES BANKers have volunteered to provide financial literacy to rural groups, build capacity for 
select NGOs through a consultative approach and deliver work readiness modules to trainees. Over 25% of 
the Bank’s senior and middle management contributed their time towards these social efforts in FY 2022-23.

Principles for Responsible Banking: 
Portfolio Impact Assessment and Targets
The United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a holistic blueprint 
for building a sustainable society of the future. The SDGs provide the banking sector an 
opportunity to align its business activities and financing to larger societal goals and outcomes, 
and to ensure that financial systems of the future are geared towards sustainable growth.
In 2019, YES BANK along with 32 global Banks and UNEP 
FI, founded the UNEPI Principles for Responsible Banking 
(PRB) – the first global framework for enabling the banking 
sector to align its business to the objectives of the SDGs 
and the Paris Climate Agreement. YES BANK continues 
to be the only Indian Founding signatory amongst 
230 global Banks that have joined PRB’s call to action. 
The PRB framework calls upon banks to undertake an 
impact analysis of their portfolios in order to assess how 
their businesses interact with and impact the 17 SDGs, 
and to minimise negative impacts and maximise positive 
impacts of their businesses.
In FY 2021-22, the Bank used the amended UNEP FI 
PRB Portfolio Impact Assessment tool v2, (published on 
July 16, 2021), to assess its portfolio. The tool assesses 
the potential impacts of the Bank’s exposure towards 
various sectors on 22 key impact categories, derived from 
core elements of SDGs (as defined in the UNEP FI Impact 
Radar), in the context of India’s need and challenges. 
These impact categories include availability and quality 
of water, food, education, employment, housing, health 
& sanitation, energy, climate change, resource efficiency, 
waste, information, culture & heritage, mobility, air, 
soil etc. The portfolio covered under the assessment, 
comprised of the Bank’s Wholesale Banking portfolio 43% 
of total advances and Retail and SME Banking segment 
57% of total advances (including the entire Product Suite 
of Retail Banking viz. CASA deposit, Home Loan, Vehicle 
Loan, Business Loan etc.).

MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
The economic setting for FY 2022-23 was a difficult 
one. Even as the global economy was recovering 
from the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the world witnessed a major geopolitical conflict in 
early 2022 which prolonged the economic recovery. 
The pandemic-induced output contraction was followed 
by supply chain disruptions, rise in commodity prices 
and a surge in inflation in most economies worldwide. 
Global central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, 
responded with a synchronised policy rate action. 
The tightening of the financial conditions across the 
world took its toll on the economic activity, while 
financial markets remained volatile and usually sensitive 
to the incoming data.
Even though, India's economic growth has significant 
bearing of domestic consumption and investments, the 
country was unlikely to have remained totally decoupled 
from these global developments. High global commodity 
prices, especially of food and oil, led to an increase in 
imports, exports also lagged on account of slower global 
growth. This, along with the strengthening of the US 
dollar vis-à-vis basket of other global currencies, led to 
sharp depreciation pressures on the domestic currency. 
The second half of the financial year saw some respite 
in commodity prices owing to global slowdown fears, 
mending of the supply chains and reopening of China. 
Though inflation in many countries have cooled down 
from the peak, policy makers globally face a likely 
scenario of a slowdown in economic activity.
Domestic economic activity exhibited resilience in 
FY 2022-23 due to pent-up consumption demand, 
revival in the contact-intensive services sector and 
government’s push for capital expenditures. In the first 
half of the previous financial year, the higher trade 
gap remained a drag on Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) growth from the expenditure side, while private 
investment continued to lag on the back of weak 
external and domestic demand outlook. In the second 
half of the year, private consumption demand started to 
exhibit sluggishness with the normalisation of pent-up 
demand. This was partly neutralised by a reduction in

drag from external trade as imports moderated faster 
than exports due to declining global commodity prices.
As per the official government estimates, India’s 
GDP is projected to have clocked 7.2% growth in FY 
2022-23 and continues to be one of the world’s fastest 
growing economies, and also the fastest growing 
Asian economy. However, going forward, protracted 
geopolitical tensions, tighter global financial conditions, 
volatility in global financial market, slowing down 
of global growth and external demand, pose critical 
risks for India’s growth outlook. The Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI) estimates India’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in 
FY 2023-24, while the latest GDP growth estimate of 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is at 5.8%, quite 
higher than average level of growth estimated at 3.9% 
for Emerging and Developing Economies.
Like in many other parts of the world, India too, 
witnessed elevated levels of inflation in FY 2022-23. 
India's, headline CPI inflation was already a tad above 
its threshold level of 6% in January and February 2022, 
while it shot up from March 2022 onwards to 7%+ levels. 
Matters were further complicated by the heat wave in 
April and a consequent loss of agricultural production, 
leading to food prices shooting up by 7.8% to 8.3% in 
April-June 2022. Government policies were unleashed 
to address the inflationary pressures. Exports of wheat 
and rice were banned, while the customs duty on edible 
oil was reduced. This led to retail food prices dropping to 
an average of 5.4% in the second half of FY 2022-23 from 
7.8% in the first half of FY 2022-23. Headline CPI inflation 
dropped to 6.2% in the second half of FY 2022-23 from 
7.2% in the first half of FY 2022-23, averaging at 6.7% for 
the full year. While food prices exhibited volatility, core 
CPI remained sticky at higher levels through FY 2022-23, 
averaging at 6.2% in the second half of FY 2022-23 from 
6.4% in the first half of FY 2022-23.
To contain inflation pressures in the economy, the RBI 
started to move away from pandemic-related monetary 
measures. First, the Central Bank set up a Standing 
Deposit Facility (SDF) at 40 bps above the fixed rate 
reverse repo rate. The repo rate hiking cycle started from 
May 2022 and it was raised by 250 bps till the end of 
FY 2022-23. Thus, the cumulative rate increase effected 
by RBI was 290 bps over the past one year. In tandem, the 
RBI also started to rein in surplus liquidity infused into the 
system through the pandemic period. With conditions 
around inflation improving, the central bank skipped 
hiking the repo rate in the April 2023 Monetary Policy, 
but RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das indicated this to be a 
“tactical pause and not a pivot”.

A strong and well-functioning financial sector fortifies the 
foundations of growth and development. The pandemic 
period had led to fears of erosion of health of India’s 
financial sector. However, the RBI accorded the highest 
priority to preserving financial stability by taking quick 
and decisive steps to ease liquidity constraints, ensure 
adequate credit flows to the production sector and 
restore market confidence.
The 
RBI 
also 
strengthened 
the 
regulatory 
and 
supervisory framework for both banking and non-banking 
financial sectors to proactively identify, assess and deal 
with vulnerabilities. Thus, despite pandemic-induced 
bouts of volatility and global supply chain disruptions, 
the Indian financial system continued to be resilient, 
and is currently in a comfortable position to meet the 
credit demands as recovery and investment activity 
picks up. Indeed, the credit growth in FY 2022-23 was 
up 15.6% Y-O-Y, compared to a Y-O-Y growth of 11.0% in 
FY 2021-22. Credit growth has been improving in double 
digits for all population groups (rural, semi-urban, urban, 
and metropolitan). Growth was led by bank branches 
in metropolitan centres and accounted for nearly 60% 
of total credit by Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs). 
Private sector banks continued to outpace their public 
sector counterparts in credit growth and accounted for 
38.4% share in total credit in September 2022 (vis-à-vis 
37.5% a year ago and 29.6% five years ago).

According to the RBI’s Financial Stability Report 
(December 2022), SCBs continued to bolster their capital, 
with a capital-to-risk assets ratio (CRAR) of 16.0% in 
September 2022. Gross non-performing assets (GNPA) 
ratio of SCBs has been steadily trending down, falling to 
a seven-year low of 5.0% in September 2022, while net 
non-performing assets (NNPA) dropped to ten-year low 
of 1.3%. The provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) has been 
increasing steadily from March 2021 and has risen to 
71.5% by September 2022. Despite a challenging global 
environment, the Indian banking system continues to 
be stable on the back of improving profitability and 
asset quality, with adequate level of liquidity and capital 
buffers. Moreover, the RBI’s macro-stress tests for credit 
risks indicate that now SCBs are well-capitalised to 
withstand “moderate to severe” macroeconomic shocks.
Aggregate 
deposits 
recorded 
some 
moderation, 
growing at 10.2% in FY 2022-23 vis-à-vis 10.4% in 
FY 2021-22. This was led by a 13.5% growth in term 
deposits; while current and savings deposits recorded 
moderate growth of 9.8% and 5.0%, respectively. 
While the deposit mobilisation by public sector banks 
improved to 8.1% in FY 2022-23 (8.0% a year ago), it 
remained lower than 14.8% growth of the private 
sector banks. The all-India credit-deposit (C-D) ratio 
increased to 75.6% in March 2023 (compared to 75.9% 
in the previous quarter and 71.9% the last year).
External sector dynamics worsened in the first half of 
FY 2022-23 on account of an increase in imports (higher 
commodity prices) and a drop in exports (government 
restraint on exports of some commodities, including oil 
products and steel). Consequently, trade gap widened to 
around USD 28 billion by September 2022, but dropped 
back again to USD 19.7 billion by March 2023 owing to a 
drop in global commodity prices, including that of crude 
oil. On the other hand, net services exports improved 
consistently in the first three quarters of FY 2022-23. 
Consequent to the above trends, India’s Current Account 
Deficit (CAD) widened to 3.7% of GDP in Q2-FY 2022-23 
from 1.6% in Q4-FY 2021-22. Subsequent drop in oil 
prices led to a sharp improvement in the CAD/GDP ratio 
to 0.2% in Q4-FY 2022-23.
Global monetary policy dynamics led to an appreciation 
in the USD in first half of FY 2022-23 by around 16% 
against a basket of major currencies. However, the 
Indian Rupee (INR) depreciated by only 6.8% against 
the USD, better than many other Emerging Market 
Economies. Market interventions by the RBI contained 
volatility and ensured orderly movement of the INR. 
The RBI also announced measures to enhance capital 
inflows. Foreign exchange (FX) reserves were at around 
USD 618 billion at the end of FY 2021-22, and despite a 
drawdown, FX reserves were at a healthy USD 578 billion 
(as at March 31, 2023). The second half of FY 2022-23 
presented a better atmosphere for USD/INR as it moved 
in a relatively narrow range of 81-83, with support 
coming from correction in USD in the global markets 
and a more comforting CAD scenario. 
RETAIL BANKING
The Retail business in India’s banking sector witnessed 
robust growth during the year under review, as the 
industry strongly bounced back post COVID-19 related 
slowdown. Official data indicates that private final 
consumption expenditure increased by around 8% in 
FY 2022-23 as compared with FY 2021-22. This aided an 
18.5% growth in Retail Loans for the Banking Industry 
(Source: RBI Sectoral Deployment of Credit for 
February 2023 published on March 31, 2023). 
The share of YES BANK’s retail advances increased to 
45% in FY 2022-23 from 24% in FY 2019-20, and the 
share of CASA + Retail Term Deposits stood at ~59% of 
total deposits. The Bank performed well across deposits 
and retail asset products and continued to provide 
personalised banking solutions.

Risk Management
The Bank’s long-term financial security and success is 
built on its risk management architecture. The Bank's 
risk management is based on three lines of defence: (a) 
business units, (b) independent control functions, and (c) 
and internal audit. Further, the Bank’s Board of Directors 
have the overall responsibility of risk management, with 
the risk management architecture being overseen by 
the Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Board. 
Additionally, risk management is undertaken by four 
Board-level committees for respective risks, wherein risk 
assessment and management is undertaken within the 
Bank’s Board-approved risk architecture.
The Bank is exposed to three Pillar 1 risks in the course 
of its business: credit risk, market risk, and operational 
risk. With the evolving banking landscape, the Bank is 
also exposed to Pillar 2 risks - liquidity risk, interest rate 
risk in banking book, and cyber security risk. These risks 
are also critical as they not only have a bearing on the 
Bank’s financial strength and operations, but also on its 
reputation. The Bank is also exposed to many other risk 
parameters. A detailed description of various risks faced 
by the Bank, their respective governance framework, 
management and mitigation strategies, and their 
implication to the Bank is presented on Page 58.
The Bank has Board-approved risk policies that define 
its risk framework. The RMC and the Board monitors 
the compliance of various risk parameters and risk 
exposures on a periodic basis. The RMC also ensures 
that frameworks are established for assessing and 
managing various risks faced by the Bank. The RMC 
ensures that risk the Bank's framework is adequate 
and appropriate for changing business and economic 
conditions, structure and needs of the Bank and is well 
within its risk appetite.
Further, the Bank has a structured strategy assessment 
and management framework in the Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess 
and manage the risks that may have a material adverse 
impact on its business strategy, financial position and 
capital adequacy. The ICAAP framework is guided by 
the Board-approved ICAAP policy. It also has in place 
a Board-approved risk appetite statement for key risks 
identified under ICAAP. There are internal policies and 
processes to ensure that the Bank operates within its 
risk appetite thresholds.
The Bank has also implemented a Board-approved 
stress testing framework that forms an integral part of 
ICAAP and risk assessment. Stress testing involves the 
use of various techniques to assess the Bank’s potential 
vulnerability to extreme, but plausible, stressed business 
conditions. The Bank evaluates the impact of various 
stress testing scenarios on account of various Pillar I and 
Pillar II risk exposures.
Internal Audit
The Bank’s Internal Audit Department (IAD), which is 
ISO 9001:2015 certified (Quality Management System), 
provides an independent and objective assurance and 
consulting services to add value and improve its risk and 
control environment. The IAD monitors the adequacy, 
effectiveness and adherence to internal controls, 
processes and procedures instituted by the Bank’s 
management and extant regulations.
The Internal Audit team reports to the Audit Committee 
('ACB') of the Board for audit planning, reporting and 
review, and the Head of the IAD reports directly to the ACB 
of the Bank’s Board of Directors. The IAD has unlimited 
and unrestricted access to all relevant data, systems, 
personnel and information to achieve its objectives. 
It is staffed with qualified team members with relevant 
certifications, and its training programme ensures that 
all team members are upskilled at frequent intervals.
The IAD has adopted a risk-based approach towards 
internal auditing, as per regulatory guidelines and 
internationally established best practices. A risk-based 
audit plan (RBAP) is prepared annually and is duly 
approved by the 'ACB'. The IAD audits various 
businesses, operations, information security/systems 
and support units as per the RBAP. The IAD prepares a 
report for each audit, recommends mitigation plans for 
the risks identified and ensures compliance with all the 
recommendations. The 'ACB' monitors the progress of 
the RBAP on a quarterly basis.
THE BANK HAS BEEN CERTIFIED 
AS ‘A GREAT WORKPLACE’ BY 
THE GREAT PLACE TO WORK 
INSTITUTE, INDIA FOR THE

to the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of limiting 
global temperature rise. YES BANK continues to 
be the only Indian banking signatory to key global 
climate commitments such as UNEP FI’s Principle for

completely to renewable energy sources. In FY 2020-21, 
YES BANK emerged as the first Indian Bank to measure

the market faced headwinds on account of geo-political

sector 
layoffs 
and

weakened market sentiments, deferment of deals/
IPOs and sharp decline in average trading volumes.

deliver steady growth in terms of diversified revenue, 
profitability and RoE.

fields of growth. This was possible due to both, (a) the 
management setting the right direction at the top, and

for 38.8% of operating expenses of the Bank for FY 2022-23 compared to 41.7% for FY 2021-22. 
Other administrative expenses increased by 35.6% to ` 48,697 million in FY 2022-23 driven by business volumes, 
higher IT spends due to escalated annual maintenance charges and support resources. Number of branches also 
increased to 1,192 as at March 31, 2023 from 1,122 as at March 31, 2022.
Provisions and contingencies (including provision for tax): 
Provisions and contingencies increased by 33.3% from ` 18,497.17 million to ` 24,653.55 million primarily led by 
accelerated provision to step-up PCR. 
The key components of provisions are provisions for NPAs of ` (169.46) million [FY 2021-22: ` 7,185.19 million], 
provision for taxation of ` 2,455.10 million [FY 2021-22: ` 3,696.36 million], and provision for standard assets

` 7,903.78 million]. 
During the year for stressed loans transferred to ARC where the consideration received was higher than that net 
book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is lower than the net book value, such excess amounts 
were not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further, as of reporting date, the 
security receipts have being assessed for the provisioning as per the extant RBI guidelines and taking into account 
the principle that there should be no provisioning arbitrage between the provisioning on security receipts vis-à-vis 
the provisioning requirements on the underlying exposure, had it stayed in the books.

(standalone as well as consolidated) for the financial 
year ended March 31, 2023.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
FY 2022-23 was the third year of the new journey of 
YES BANK under the new management, post the YES 
BANK Limited Reconstruction Scheme, 2020 (“Scheme”) 
which was implemented in March 2020. Whilst, in the 
first year, the focus was on rebuilding the Bank, in the 
second year, we swiftly shifted our focus on growing the 
Bank, in the third year, we achieved critical milestones 
of equity capital raise from two global marquee Private 
Equity investors, transfer of legacy stressed asset pool 
to ARC- which was by far the single largest transaction 
of sale of non-performing assets in the Indian Banking 
System, and continued to build on a strong momentum 
on both our asset and liability with focus on granularity 
and in risk calibrated manner. The Directors are pleased 
to inform the shareholders that the Bank’s Total Assets in 
FY 2022-23 crossed ` 3.55 lakh crore, with deposits 
crossed ` 2.18 lakh crore and CASA ratio at ~30.8%.
The Bank has further progressed on its transformation 
journey and has emerged as a re-energised, recapitalised 
and recalibrated organisation, by leveraging on a unique 
opportunity to learn from past challenges and become 
stronger, while continuing to fulfill its unwavering 
commitment towards its customers and stakeholders. 
The Bank is on track to achieve its longer-term Strategic 
Objectives and none of this would have been possible 
without the confidence reposed of the Bank’s customers, 
depositors and investors. The confidence of stakeholders 
has not only been seen through the improving financial 
performance of the Bank during the last year, but also 
through external validation in the form of Credit Rating 
upgrades, successful client win-backs and acquisition 
strategy, re-inclusion of the stock in marquee indices 
amongst others.
The Bank undertook multiple initiatives to grow the 
Bank’s business and launched innovative and tailored 
propositions for its customers. The Bank launched a first 
of its kind floating rate Fixed Deposit linked to RBI repo 
rate – an Intelligent Fixed Deposit with Dynamic Returns. 
In addition, the Bank was a preferred partner of choice 
for the Government/RBI in multiple new breakthrough 
initiatives such as Unified Logistics Interface Platform 
("ULIP"), Digital Banking Units and Digital Rupee (e`) – the 
Central Bank Digital Currency ("CBDC"). The Bank issued 
first e-BG in partnership with National E-Governance 
Services Limited. YES BANK also became the first bank 
in Asia Pacific to bring forth a debit card in Mastercard’s 
premium Elite Platform. The Bank also launched industry 
first Build Your Own Card which allows customer to fully 
customise a credit card.
The Bank was certified as Great Place To Work® 
Certified™ which is a reflection of Bank’s high-trust and 
high performance culture. 
Key highlights of the transformation Journey over the 
course of FY 2022-23 included:
	
Completed assignment of identified pool of stressed 
assets to the J.C. Flowers ARC amounting to nearly 
` 48,000 crore. This is single largest transaction of sale 
of non-performing assets in Indian Banking System.
	
Capital raise of ` 8,887 crore from two marquee 
private equity investors viz. CA Basque Investments 
(affiliates of The Carlyle Group) & Verventa Holdings 
Limited (affiliates of Advent International), the 
second largest private capital raise transaction to 
take place in the Indian Banking Sector over the 
last two decades.
	
The Bank also received multiple ESG certifications 
and scoring highest amongst the bank on S&P 
Global, CDP rating and Moody's ratings.
The Bank continued its efforts towards building a 
stronger retail franchise with contribution of retail 
advances compared to total advances, increased to 
~45% in FY 2022-23 compared to 36% in FY 2021-22. 
Digitisation remains the Bank’s key pillar to grow the 
Retail, SME and the Transaction Banking businesses. 
The Bank has seen new sanctions/disbursements 
of ~` 1,00,000 crore in FY 2022-23 with Retail Assets 
disbursements of ~` 50,000 crore. The Bank has 
significant presence within the new-age payments 
space with the highest market share of ~38% in UPI 
transactions (by volume) in FY 2022-23. 
STATE OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE BANK
The Bank’s fundamentals have strengthened and it 
has emerged from the crisis as a financially sound, well 
capitalised, well governed institution, with customer 
centricity and digital at the heart of its strategy. The Bank 
remains focused on its priorities and looks to continue this 
momentum onwards and upwards so that it can deliver on 
its strategic objectives while creating superior value for all 
its stakeholders.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK
The overall bank credit trajectory is expected to remain healthy on account of continued capex investments, expansion 
of public digital infrastructure, several path breaking growth impetus initiatives such as PM Gatishakti, National 
Logistics Policy and the Production Linked Incentives ("PLI") scheme announced for 13 key sectors by the government.
Improved resilience of the banking system is likely to support stronger credit growth to SME’s and retail segments. 
Home Loans will be a major driver of credit growth as demand for residential purchases is expected to continue 
growing. Unsecured Lending is also expected to see improvement as the segment will continue to be attractive on a 
risk-adjusted return basis.
Overall, the Indian Banking Sector is well positioned to fund faster credit growth, with healthy capital buffers, high 
profitability metrics, and waning asset quality pressures. These factors together with a strong deposits growth augur 
well for the Banking sector. 
While, the above-mentioned are positive for the sector, there are also certain risks that could impact the sector, 
such as continued geopolitical tensions that could impact interest rates as well as many downstream sectors (some 
of which are already under pressure because of increased commodity prices); and higher-than-expected slowdown 
in private consumption. Credit growth may also be partially impacted by movement in real cost of credit in the 
international markets, overall inflation trajectory and consumption behaviour.
CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF BUSINESS
During the year under review, there has been no change in the nature of business of the Bank.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Management Discussion and Analysis Report for 
the year under review as stipulated in SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 ("Listing Regulations") is presented in a separate 
section forming part of the Annual Report.
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 
The Bank’s Enterprise Risk Management framework 
encompasses the following:
Risk 
Governance 
Framework: 
The 
Bank 
has 
implemented an Enterprise Risk Governance framework 
to ensure non-silo based management and oversight of 
Risk. The Bank’s Risk Management philosophy is guided 
by the Three Lines of Defence:
	
First Line of Defence - Business Management: 
Each business segment of the Bank has risk 
ownership and is responsible for assessment 
and management of risks and has the overall 
responsibility of the management and mitigation of 
the Risk. The segments are required to implement 
appropriate 
procedures 
to 
fulfil 
their 
risk 
governance responsibilities.
	
Second Line of Defence - Independent functions: 
The Bank’s independent oversight functions, 
such as, Risk Management, Credit Underwriting, 
Compliance, Legal, Fraud Containment Unit, etc. 
set standards for management and oversight of 
risks, including compliance with applicable laws, 
regulatory requirements and policies.
	
-	
Risk Management: Risk Management team 
reporting into the Chief Risk Officer establishes 
policies and guidelines for risk assessment 
and management and contributes to controls 
and tools to manage, measure and mitigate 
risks faced by the Bank. Risk Management 
comprises units such as Enterprise Risk, 
Market Risk, Operational Risk, Legal Risk, 
Information Security, Portfolio Analytics, Retail, 
SME & Rural Policy, Risk Secretarial Unit, etc 
which are responsible for independent review, 
monitoring and reporting of all risk control 
parameters and taking appropriate corrective 
actions where necessary. These units also 
ensure compliance to internal policies and 
regulatory guidelines.
	
-	
Credit Underwriting: The Credit Risk team 
reporting into the Chief Credit Risk Officer 
ensures an independent assessment of credit 
proposals and is responsible for monitoring 
the credit quality of the Bank’s portfolio and 
undertaking portfolio reviews. The Credit 
Risk team is a specialised function that is well 
staffed with individuals having the necessary 
experience as well as skillsets to provide 
a balanced view of credit proposals to the 
sanctioning authorities.
	
-	
Compliance: 
The 
Compliance 
unit 
is 
responsible 
for 
tracking 
implementation 
of all regulatory circulars/communication, 
review 
of 
new 
products 
& 
processes 
from 
regulatory 
perspective, 
conducting 
compliance reviews to ensure adherence to 
regulatory guidelines and monitoring progress 
in rectification of significant deficiencies (if 
any) pointed out by regulators in inspection 
reports 
as 
well 
as 
implementation 
of 
recommendations made therein. This ensures 
that the overall Compliance Risk of the Bank is 
managed and mitigated.
	
-	
FCU & AML: The Fraud Containment Unit 
("FCU") is responsible for prevention and 
detection of internal and external frauds in 
the areas of Liabilities, Product and Support 
functions. The unit conducts transaction 
monitoring, 
forensic 
scrutiny, 
employee 
awareness 
trainings 
and 
vulnerability 
assessments to help achieve the said objective. 
The Anti Money Laundering Unit ("AML") is 
responsible for identifying and reporting of 
192
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
suspicious transactions and other regulatory 
reports such as Cash Transaction Report, 
Cross Border Wire Transfer Report, Not for 
Profit Organisation Transaction report etc. 
as prescribed under PMLA Act/Regulators, 
across all Business segments of the Bank. 
The AML unit is equipped with qualified, trained 
and experienced staff, which monitors various 
transactions undertaken by customers with a 
view to combat financial crimes and prevents 
misuse of the accounts for money laundering.
	
Third Line of Defence – The Bank’s Internal Audit 
Department independently reviews activities of 
the first two lines of defence based on a risk-based 
audit plan and methodology approved by the Audit 
Committee of the Board. Internal Audit Department 
provides independent assurance to the Audit 
Committee of the Board, top management and 
regulators regarding the effectiveness of the Bank’s 
governance and controls framework designed for 
risk mitigation.
The Board of Directors of the Bank has overall 
responsibility for Risk Management. The Board oversees 
the Bank’s Risk and related control environment, 
reviews and approves the policies designed as part of 
overseeing the Risk Management practices. The Board 
ensures that comprehensive policies, systems and 
controls are in place to identify, monitor and manage 
material risks at a Bank-wide level, with clearly defined 
risk limits. The Board has laid down Risk Appetite 
Statement which articulates the quantum of risk the 
Bank is willing and able to assume in its exposures and 
business activities in pursuit of its strategic objectives 
and desired returns. The Board has also established 
policies governing risk management, such as, Credit 
Policy, Asset Liability Management Policy, Operational 
Risk Management Policy, Information Security Policy, 
Enterprise Risk Management Policy, Group Risk 
Management Policy, Model Risk & Governance Policy, 
Risk Based Pricing Policy, Stress Testing Policy, etc. 
which establish the Risk Appetite Framework within the 
overall Risk Appetite Statement.
The Board has put in place four Board level Committees 
which inter-alia pertain to Risk Management, viz. 
Risk Management Committee ("RMC"), Audit Committee 
("AC"), Fraud, Willful Defaulters and Non Co-operative 
Borrowers Monitoring Committee (FWD & NCBMC) 
and Board Credit Committee ("BCC") to deal with risk 
management practices, policies, procedures and to 
have adequate oversight on the risks faced by the Bank.

Green Bond issue in the world through the first offshore 
rupee denominated bond or “Green Masala Bond”. 
Moving ahead with its conviction towards Climate 
Finance, YES BANK has raised ` 330 crore (equivalent 
to USD 50 million) in December 2016, through an issue 
of a 7-year Green Infrastructure Bonds to FMO, the 
Dutch Development Bank, on a private placement basis. 
This is FMO’s 1st investment in a Green Bond issued by 
a bank in India.
The amount raised through all these issuances, are 
used to finance Green Infrastructure Projects, in 
whole, or in part, as per ‘Eligible Projects’ outlined in 
the Bank’s internal guidelines for adherence to Green 
Bond Principles. The proceeds are managed through 
MIS-based asset tagging which tracks green bonds 
investments. The unutilised proceeds are invested in 
G-Secs. KPMG, India has provided limited assurance 
on conformity of the use of proceeds, process for 
evaluation and selection of projects, management of 
proceeds and reporting of these green bonds to Green 
Bond Principles (GBP) 2021.
The GBP are voluntary guidelines, developed by the 
International Capital Markets Association, for broad 
use by the market that recommend transparency and 
disclosure, and promote integrity in the development 
of the Green Bond market. They have the following 
four key components and the bank showcases its 
adoption below:
	
Use of Proceeds: The proceeds raised by the 
bank are used in eligible project categories and 
include all projects funded in whole, or in part, in 
the fields of renewable and clean energy projects 
including Wind, Solar, Biomass, Hydropower and 
other such projects
	
Process for Evaluation and Selection of Eligible 
Projects: The bank’s process starts with interactions 
with potential borrowers to understand the overall 
aspects of the project and a preliminary confirmation 
against the eligibility criteria. The evaluation moves 
to risk assessment for confirmation of the eligibility, 
post which further documentation is sought as per 
the Bank’s policies and GBP
	
Management of Proceeds: Green Bond allocations 
to eligible projects are tracked by the bank through 
an MIS based asset tagging system. The unallocated 
proceeds, if any, are placed in liquid instruments

To the Management of YES BANK Limited, YES BANK 
House, Off Western Express Highway, Santacruz (East),

Introduction
KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP was 
engaged by YES BANK Limited (‘Issuer’) to undertake an 
independent review of the following green bonds:
	
Green bonds for ` 1,000 crores issued on 
February 24, 2015
	
Green bonds for ` 315 crore issued on August 05, 
2015
	
Green 
bonds 
for 
` 330 
crore 
issued 
on 
December 29, 2016
Our responsibility was to provide “limited assurance” on 
continued compliance of the green bonds along with 
the accompanying report “Disclosures under Green 
Infrastructure Bonds” with the Green Bond Principles, 
2021 for the period 01 January 2023 - 31 March 2023. 
The Statement is based on information and data covering 
the period from 01 January 2023 to 31 March 2023.
Assurance standards
We conducted our engagement in accordance with 
the requirements of ‘Limited Assurance’ as per the 
International 
Federation 
of 
Accountants’ 
("IFAC") 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements [ISAE 
3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information].
Assurance scope
Our scope of assurance included information on 
material aspects of the above-mentioned green bonds 
during 01 January 2023 to 31 March 2023 based on 
the requirements of the Green Bond Principles, 2021 
as listed below:
	
Use of Proceeds
	
Process for Project Evaluation and Selection
	
Management of Proceeds
	
Reporting
Specific limitations and exclusions
Our assurance process was subject to the following 
limitations as we have not been engaged to:
	
Determine which, if any, recommendations should 
be implemented
	
Provide assurance on information outside the 
assurance scope and period
	
Verify the Issuer’s financial statements & economic 
performance
Verify the Issuer’s statements that describe expression 
of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or future 
intention and national or global socio-economic and 
environmental aspects provided by the Issuer.
Work undertaken
We planned and performed our work to obtain 
selected evidences, information and explanations 
that we considered necessary to obtain a meaningful 
level of assurance in relation to the above scope. 
The procedures we performed, which are set out in 
detail below, were based on our professional judgment 
and included, as appropriate, inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, 
analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness 
of quantification methods and reporting policies and 
agreement or reconciliation with underlying records. 
We believe that the procedures we have performed 
and the evidences we have obtained are sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited 
assurance conclusion.
To reach our conclusion we:
	
Checked the Issuer’s Green Bond Framework, that 
includes processes, systems and controls in place 
for management of bond proceeds; investment 
areas for green bond proceeds and intended 
types of temporary investment instruments for the 
management of unallocated proceeds;
	
Read sections of the bond disclosure documentation 
that also support the objectives of the green bond 
issue, investment areas for proceeds and intended 
types of temporary investment instruments for the 
management of unallocated proceeds;
	
Conducted interviews with management and 
key staff responsible for the green bond to 
understand how the processes, systems and 
controls defined in the Green Bond Framework, 
have been implemented during 01 January 2023 
to 31 March 2023;
Assurance Statement By KPMG India For Green Bond
218
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
Checked the list of projects to which bond proceeds 
have been allocated during 01 January 2023 to 31 
March 2023 and their conformance with the criteria 
defined in the Green Bond Framework; and
	
Recalculated estimated carbon dioxide emission 
reductions 
from 
projects 
using 
information 
collected by the Issuer
Conclusions
Based on the limited assurance procedures performed 
by us, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that 
the green bonds issued in February 2015, August 2015 
and December 2016 by the Issuer and the accompanying 
report “Disclosures under Green Infrastructure Bonds” 
are not, in all material respects, conforming to the 
requirements of the Green Bond Principles, 2021, during 
the period 01 January 2023 - 31 March 2023.”
Independence
The assurance was conducted by a multidisciplinary 
team including professionals with suitable skills and 
experience in auditing environmental, social and 
economic information in line with the requirements 
of ISAE 3000 standard. Our work was performed in 
compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of 
Ethics for Professional Accountants, which requires, 
among other requirements, that the members of 
the assurance team (practitioners) as well as the 
assurance firm (assurance provider) be independent 
of the assurance client, in relation to the scope of this 
assurance engagement. The Code also includes detailed 
requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, 
objectivity, professional competence and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour. We have 
systems and processes in place to monitor compliance 
with the Code and to prevent conflicts regarding 
independence. We apply ISQM 1 and comply with the 
applicable independence and other ethical requirements 
of the IESBA code.
Management’s responsibility
The Management of the Issuer is responsible for ensuring 
that the Issuer and their green bond complies with 
the requirements of the Green Bond Principles, 2021. 
This responsibility includes designing, implementing 
and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the 
management of green bond proceeds.
The Management of the Issuer is also responsible for 
preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and 
ensuring that Issuer complies with laws and regulations 
applicable to its activities.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to report in the form of an 
independent 
limited 
assurance 
conclusion 
in 
relation to the above scope based on the procedures 
performed and the evidence obtained. We conducted 
our 
engagement 
with 
a 
multidisciplinary 
team 
which included professionals with suitable skills and 
experience in auditing environmental, social and 
economic information in line with the requirements of 
ISAE 3000 (Revised) standard.
This assurance report is made solely to Issuer in 
accordance with the terms of our engagement, which 
include agreed arrangements for disclosure. Our work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to Issuer 
those matters we have been engaged to state in 
this assurance report and for no other purpose.

Corporate Governance Report
(The Report on Corporate Governance for the year ended March 31, 2023) 
In compliance with Regulation 34(3) and Clause (C) of 
Schedule V of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI LODR”), a Report on Corporate 
Governance 
for 
the 
Financial 
Year 
2022-23 
is 
presented below:
1.	
BANK’S 
PHILOSOPHY 
ON 
CODE 
OF 
GOVERNANCE
	
YES BANK, under the Bank’s new leadership 
successfully reconstructed the Bank’s corporate 
governance 
accountability, 
monitoring 
and 
oversight and risk management structures. The Bank 
is committed to sound corporate governance 
practices based on conscience, openness, fairness, 
professionalism, and accountability in building 
confidence of its various stakeholders and thereby 
paving the way for its long-term success. The Bank 
is also committed to achieve highest standards of 
Corporate Governance as a good corporate citizen. 
Effective Corporate Governance is the interaction 
between 
various 
participants 
(Shareholders, 
Board of Directors, and Bank’s Management) in 
shaping Bank’s performance. Transparency and 
Accountability are the fundamental principles to 
sound Corporate Governance, which ensures 
that the organisation is managed and monitored 
in a responsible manner for ‘‘creating and 
sharing value".
	
With a view to bring in more transparency and 
accountability, the Bank upgrades its systems and 
policies regularly, to meet the requirements of 
dynamic and challenging business environment 
and to provide reasonable assurance with regard 
to maintaining of proper internal controls and 
monitoring of operations. YES BANK’s Board is 
committed to adhere to highest standards of 
ethics, transparency, disclosures and governance 
and to protect the interest of all its stakeholders. 
The Board is focused on ensuring both Corporate 
Governance and Risk Controls of the Bank.
	
YES BANK’s Corporate Governance Framework 
ensures that timely disclosures are made and 
accurate information is shared regarding the 
financial performance, operations as well as the 
leadership and governance of the Bank.
	
During 
the 
past 
years, 
certain 
Corporate 
Governance issues were raised by Stakeholders 
and Regulators. Taking a positive note of such 
observations, the Bank has worked effortlessly to 
strengthen its governance and disclosure practices 
and promises to continue to be on the progressive 
path to nourish Corporate Governance practices 
to make it more effective from regulatory and 
market perspective.
	
Environmental, Social & Governance Rating
	
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
performance refers to the non-financial performance 
of an organisation on crucial issues such as climate 
change, 
environmental 
sustainability, 
social 
responsibility, ethics, institutional frameworks, and 
transparency, amongst others.
	
Globally, there is an emerging awareness that an 
organisation’s overall performance is linked to 
non-financial, yet financially material issues, which 
pose significant material risks to long term returns. 
This has led to the emergence of ESG, a set of 
non-financial metrics or parameters, which along 
with financial metrics, provide a holistic assessment 
of an organisation’s impact on three fronts – profits, 
people and planet.
	
YES BANK views the emergence of ESG as an 
important development for the corporate sector 
both from an ethical and financial perspective. 
The Bank continuously strives to integrate ESG 
principles into its core business strategy, adopt 
best practices in ESG and align its business to global 
frameworks on sustainability such as the United 
Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Principles 
for Responsible Banking (PRB). The Bank has set 
up a robust governance structure for integrating 
ESG considerations into its business by constituting 
an Executive level Sustainability Council chaired by 
the Managing Director & CEO which oversees the 
implementation of the Bank’s sustainability agenda, 
sets long, medium & short-term sustainability 
targets and evaluates the Bank’s ESG performance. 
The Bank further strengthened its ESG governance 
by including ESG in its a Board level Committee 
and renaming the same as CSR&ESG Committee to 
oversee the Sustainability Council and strengthen 
the Bank’s ESG performance. 
	
YES 
BANK 
continues 
to 
disclose 
its 
ESG 
performance in line with international benchmark 
disclosure frameworks such as Global Reporting

The Bank under the Code maintains a Structured 
Digital Database ("SDD") containing the nature of 
UPSI, names of such persons who have shared 
the UPSI along with names of such persons or 
entities, as the case may be, with whom UPSI is 
shared under this Code. Additionally, for the ease 
of convenience of the Designated Persons and as 
a part of Bank’s digitisation initiative, the reporting 
mechanism/ process which facilitates Designated 
Person in reporting of transactions in Securities of 
the Bank and seeking of pre-clearance for trading 
in securities other than YES BANK securities, was 
automated by the Bank, which can be accessed 
by the Designated Person through intranet. 
The system allows employees to submit online 
disclosures while dealing in the Securities of the 
Bank, i.e. submission of initial disclosures, obtaining 
of pre-clearances and submission of periodic 
declarations and to obtain pre-clearance for 
trading in any other securities. Thus, enabling the 
Compliance Officer in monitoring of transactions, 
for certain acts of omissions/ commissions on 
the part of the Designated Person and to take 
appropriate actions as per the SEBI PIT Regulations 
and Bank’s Code.
	
Further, based on the Board approved penalty 
matrix all identified violations are being reported 
to the Disciplinary Committee for its action(s) which 
may result into monetary implications depending 
on the instance and nature of violation.
	
Also, the Bank reports to the Stock Exchanges, 
violations by the Designated Persons as concluded 
by Disciplinary Committee of the Bank in the format 
as prescribed by SEBI.
	
The Bank from time to time creates awareness 
through 
webinars, 
quiz, 
e-mails, 
mandatory 
declaration amongst the Designated Persons on 
the compliance and obligation requirements under 
the SEBI PIT Regulations read with the Bank’s Code.
(p)	 Dividend Distribution Policy:
	
In terms of the provisions of Regulation 43A of the 
SEBI LODR, the Board of Directors of the Bank has 
formulated and approved the Dividend Distribution 
Policy with the objective of providing clarity to its 
stakeholders on the profit distribution strategies of 
the Bank. The Policy is in line with the parameters 
prescribed thereunder for payment / distribution of 
dividend to the shareholders.
	
The Dividend Policy of the Bank states that the 
Bank shall recommend first dividend payout post 
moratorium only after the Bank has demonstrated 
profitability for a continuous period of three 
successive financial years. In FY 2022-23, the Bank 
posted second straight year of full year profitability 
since the adoption of the revised policy post 
moratorium. However, the above clause still stands 
unfulfilled, on account of which, the Board of 
Directors of the Bank has not recommended any 
dividend for the FY 2022-23. The said Policy has 
been hosted on the Bank’s website under Corporate 
Governance Section and can be accessed at the link 
https://www.yesbank.in/pdf?name=dividend_

Integrated Reporting (‘IR’) on a voluntary basis 
from the FY 2017-18 onwards. Since FY 2015-16, 
the Bank has taken steps to adopt key elements 
of the International Integrated Reporting Council’s 
Integrated Reporting (IR) framework as part of its 
Annual Report. YES BANK’s Annual Integrated Report 
for FY 2022-23 is fully aligned with the requirements 
of the IR framework and is externally assured by

Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System”). Scope 1 emissions also include diesel consumption for the Bank. The emission factors and 
GWP (Global Warming Potential) values have been taken from the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. 
#Scope 2 emissions constitute CO2 emissions from grid electricity (from non-renewable sources) consumed by YES BANK. The emission 
factors have been taken from Central Electrical Authority (CEA’s) CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, Version 18. In January 
2022, the Bank started sourcing renewable energy to power YES BANK House, avoiding 4,435.77 tCO2e in FY 2022 23. Grid electricity 
consumed has been estimated from facility-wise electricity bills and state-wise tariff charges

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emission? If Yes, then provide 
details.
	
In order to align with the net zero pathways suggested by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
the Bank has pledged to reduce GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) from its operations to net 
zero by 2030. To achieve its net zero target, the Bank plans to migrate most of its facilities to renewable energy. 
In FY 2022-23, the share of renewable energy in the Bank’s electricity mix increased to around 11% resulting in 
approximately 4,435.77 tCO2e in avoided emissions. Currently, the Bank’s corporate office, YES BANK House 
along with 34 of its 81 Branches in Mumbai have been switched to renewables. Led by its adoption of renewable 
energy, the Bank reduced its direct emissions by 13.66% in FY 2022-23, over the previous year. The Bank also 
aims to reduce its energy consumption by enhancing its energy efficiency. The Bank has completed its migration 
to light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures at all its facilities and in the process of switching to star-rated air conditioners 
and equipment in all its offices.

Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
	
Disruption in services of the Bank (planned and unplanned) does have the potential to cause grave reputational 
damage. Keeping this in view, Corporate Communication is one of the most critical functions that is informed 
about any such development. The Corporate Communication team is entrusted with the responsibility of building 
a relevant communication strategy, based on the severity of the situation. The objective of this strategy is to 
position the Bank as a responsible financial entity that puts customer convenience at the centre of everything 
that it does. Appended below, are some steps taken by the Corporate Communication team to mitigate the risk 
that could arise as a result of service disruptions. 
316
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
Unplanned/Planned Downtimes: In case of a downtime, the Bank’s Corporate Communication team works with 
the Bank’s Business and Digital Technology Solutions Group (BDTS) team to assess the cause of the disruption. 
The team then frames a communication that not just acknowledges the issue, but also provides a fair idea of the 
time required to restore normalcy. Post relevant approvals, the communication is disseminated to customers in 
the following ways:
	
1.	
Press Release: We may issue a brief press release to the media which talks about the downtime and carry 
other relevant details like services that got impacted, services that remain intact, as well as the time it will 
take to restore normalcy. Depending on the magnitude of the issue, we may choose to restrict the issuance 
of the release to a certain geographical region. 
	
2.	
Social Media: This is a critical strategy wherein we acknowledge the downtime by proactively putting up a 
social media notification on all of the Bank’s handles. Typically, the post should also carry details about the issue in 
brief and the services that have been impacted as well as the ones that are working seamlessly.
	
3.	
Online Reputation Management (ORM): A gist of the press release is shared with the ORM team which 
then uses it as reference to respond to customer queries/escalations on social media, emails and telephonic 
conversations. 
	
4.	
WhatsApp/SMS: Considering customers are significantly more active in accessing information on 
their phones, we also make it point to communicate all critical information to customers through 
WhatsApp and SMS’. 
	
The strategies listed above are purely planned and executed basis the degree of impact and may not involve 
activating all four channels of communication every time. 
4. 	
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local 
laws? (Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey with regard 
to consumer satisfaction relating to the major products / services of the entity, significant locations of 
operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)
	
YES BANK provides customer with complete information about the Bank’s products including terms and 
conditions; schedule of charges applicable for various products/ services; channels through which services are 
rendered including branch lists / online channels; provision for applying to various products online; and the 
Bank’s grievance redressal mechanism available for customers
	
Yes. The Bank has a robust Customer Experience Framework wherein customer feedback is measured post 
their interaction with the Bank, across channels. The Bank’s Net Promoter score (NPS) is measured across channels 
like Branch Banking, Digital channels, Call Centers, Relationship Managers, amongst others, and customer insights, 
therein are shared with teams across the Bank.

the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the standalone financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder,

of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters

(NPA) which consists of Standard, Sub-standard, Doubtful 
and Loss and makes appropriate provisions.
Our audit approach included testing the design, operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit procedures 
in respect of income recognition, asset classification and 
provisioning pertaining to investments and advances. In particular:
•	
We have evaluated the Bank’s internal control system in 
adhering to the relevant RBI guidelines regarding income 
recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining 
to investments and advances;

Key Audit Matters
Auditor’s Response
Income Recognition and Asset Classification of Advances and Investments (IRAC) and Provisioning as per regulatory norms
The Bank, as per its governing framework, made the 
performing and non-performing advances provisions 
based on Management’s assessment of the degree 
of impairment of the advances subject to and guided 
by minimum provisioning levels prescribed under 
RBI guidelines.
The Classification, Provisioning and Write off of Advances 
including Investments is a Key Audit Matter as the Bank 
has significant credit risk exposure to a large number of 
borrowers across various sectors, products, industries 
and geographies and there is a high degree of complexity, 
uncertainty and judgment involved in recoverability 
of advances, nature of transactions and estimation of 
provisions thereon and identification of accounts to 
be written off.
•	
We have test checked advances to examine the validity of 
the recorded amounts, loan documentation, examined the 
statement of accounts, indicators of impairment, impairment 
provision for non-performing assets, and compliance with 
income recognition, asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to advances in terms of applicable RBI guidelines;
•	
We have selected restructured accounts on sample basis and 
tested their compliance with relevant RBI guidelines;
•	
For the selected non-performing advances, we assessed 
Management’s forecast and inputs of recoverable cash 
flows, borrower’s audited financial statements, valuation of 
underlying security and collaterals, estimation of recoverable 
amounts on default and other sources of repayment;
•	
Reviewed Bank’s policy including Standard Operating 
Procedures with respect to implementation of Regulatory 
package and Resolution framework (‘guidelines’) and 
tested samples to ascertain the implementation of those 
guidelines by the Bank.
Provisions for advances:
•	
Tested the Bank’s processes for making provision on advances 
for compliance with RBI regulations and internally laid down 
policies for provisioning;
•	
Tested the completeness and accuracy of data transferred 
from 
underlying 
source 
systems 
used 
for 
computing 
collective provision;
•	
We had undertaken the walkthrough for the automated 
E-NPA system and tested the core functionality for selected 
samples considering the audit universe.
•	
Validated the parameters used to calculate collective provisions 
with reference to IRAC norms, and Regulatory Package;
•	
Tested provision created for fraud accounts as at March 31, 
2023 as per the RBI circular;
•	
Re-performed, for a sample of retail and corporate portfolios, 
as part of our substantive audit procedures the calculation 
of provisions, to determine the accuracy of the same;

IT Systems and Controls over financial reporting
The Bank’s key financial accounting and reporting 
processes are highly dependent on Core Banking and 
Treasury Solutions and other supporting software and 
hardware controls. The volume of transactions processed 
and recorded is huge. Moreover, a transaction may be 
required to be recorded across multiple applications 
depending upon the process and each application has 
different rules and a different set of user access and 
authority matrix. These applications are interlinked using 
different technologies so that data transfer happens in real 
time or at a particular time of the day; in batches or at a 
transaction level and in an automated manner or manually. 
The Core Banking Solution (CBS) itself has many interfaces, 
such that there exists a risk that gaps in the IT control 
environment could result in the financial accounting and 
reporting records being materially misstated. The Bank 
has a process for identifying the applications where the 
controls are embedded. It also has a process to ensure 
that systems, processes and controls remain relevant 
and updated. The Bank’s IT control framework includes 
automated, 
semi-automated 
and 
manual 
controls 
designed to address identified risks. IT controls are stated 
in Entity Level Controls (ELC), IT General Controls (ITGC) 
and IT Application Controls (ITAC). Such controls contribute 
to risk mitigation of erroneous output data.
•	
We have planned, designed and carried out the desired audit 
procedures and sample checks, taking into consideration 
the IT systems of the Bank. As part of our IT controls testing, 
we have tested ITGC as well as ITAC for selected critical 
applications. The focus of testing of ITGCs was based on 
the various parameters such as Completeness, Validity, 
Identification/ Authentication, Authorization, Integrity and 
Accountability. On the other hand, focus of testing automated 
controls from applications was whether the controls prevent 
or detect unauthorized transactions and support financial 
objectives including completeness, accuracy, authorization 
and validity of transactions. The procedures adopted by 
us are, in our opinion, adequate to provide reasonable 
assurance on the adequacy of IT controls in place. The areas 
for improvement as and when noticed are communicated for 
suitable actions to the Bank as part of our audit. The corrective 
steps / alternate controls deployed by the Bank are tested 
on sample basis.
•	
In ITGC testing, on sample basis, we reviewed control areas 
such as User Management, Change Management, Systems 
Security, Cyber Security, Interface Testing, deployment of new 
applications, Incident Management, Physical & Environmental 
Security, Backup and Restoration, Business Continuity and 
Disaster Recovery, Service Level Agreement.
•	
For ITAC, we carried out on sample basis, compliance tests 
of system functionality in order to assess the accuracy of 
system calculations. We also carried out procedures such as 
validations and limit checks on data entered into applications, 
approvals, process dependencies, restriction on time period 
in which transactions may be recorded and GL mapping for 
financial accounting.
•	
We tested the control environment using various techniques 
such as inquiry, walkthroughs in live environment, testing 
in UAT environment, review of documentation / record / 
reports, observation and re-performance. We had taken 
adequate samples of instances for our tests considering the 
audit universe.

Key Audit Matters
Auditor’s Response
IT Systems and Controls over financial reporting
We have identified IT Controls Framework as a Key Audit 
Matter as the Bank’s business is highly dependent on 
technology, the IT environment is complex and the design 
and operating effectiveness of IT controls have a direct 
impact on its financial reporting process. Review of these 
controls allows us to provide assurance on the integrity 
and completeness of data processed through various 
IT applications which are used for the preparation of 
financial reports.
•	
Wherever deviations were noted either the same were 
explained to our satisfaction or we tested compensating 
controls and performed alternate procedures, where 
necessary, to draw comfort.
•	
In addition, we have also relied on IS audit conducted by 
internal audit department, and also the testing of Internal 
Financial Control conducted by the Operational Risk 
Management department of the Bank.
Recognition and Measurement of Deferred Tax Asset
The Bank has recognized a net deferred tax asset of 
` 89,412 million as at March 31, 2023, including net 
decrease of ` 2,431 million during the year.
Besides 
objective 
estimation, 
recognition 
and 
measurement of deferred tax asset is based on the 
judgment and numerous estimates regarding the 
availability and visibility of profits in the future and also 
considering probable impact of Covid-19 pandemic.
The 
amount 
of 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
recognized 
presumes availability and forecasting of profits over an 
extended period of time thus increasing uncertainty 
and the inherent risk of inappropriate recognition of 
the said asset.
Our audit procedures involved gaining an understanding of the 
applicable tax laws and relevant regulations applicable to the 
Bank. We performed the following audit procedures as part of 
our controls testing:
•	
Evaluation of the policies used for recognition and 
measurement of deferred tax assets in accordance with 
AS 22 Accounting for Taxes on Income;
•	
Assessed the probability of the availability of future taxable 
profits based on assumptions and other parameters used by 
the Management including the probable impact of Covid-19 
pandemic against which the Bank will be able to use this 
deferred tax asset in the future with reference to forecast 
as noted by the Board of Directors while adopting the 
standalone financial statements.
•	
Assessed the method for determining the Deferred Tax 
Asset with reference to applicable tax rates and tested the 
arithmetical accuracy.
Information other than the standalone financial 
statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the Other Information. The other 
information comprises the Management Discussion

(collectively called as “Other Information”) but does 
not include the standalone financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is 
expected to be made available to us after the date of 
this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the Other

and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends 
to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the bank has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
Management and Board of Director’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our Auditor’s Report to the 
related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our Auditor’s Report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
322
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current year and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements of YES 
BANK Limited (“the Bank”) as at March 31, 2023 in 
conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
standalone 
financial statements the criteria established by the 
Bank considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (‘the 
Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the Bank’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and 
the Standards on Auditing (‘the Standards’), issued by 
the ICAI and deemed to be, prescribed under section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls over financial reporting, both 
issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements 
Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report 
of even date on the standalone financial statements of YES BANK Limited 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Referred to in paragraph 3(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent 
Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of YES BANK Limited on the standalone financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023)
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements were 
established and maintained and whether such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the standalone 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s 
internal financial control with reference to financial 
statement includes those policies and procedures that
1)	
pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in 
reasonable 
detail, 
accurately 
and 
fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the Bank;
2)	
provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
standalone financial statements in accordance with 
325
Standalone
YES BANK LIMITED
Corporate Overview
Our Business In-Depth
Our Performance
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being 
made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the Bank; and
3)	
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the standalone 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls 
with 
Reference 
to 
Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
standalone 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to standalone financial statement may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank has maintained, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and such 
internal financial controls were operating effectively 
as at March 31, 2023, with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by the Bank considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note.

outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts, derivatives, guarantees, endorsements and other obligations are 
stated at the exchange rates notified by FEDAI corresponding to the balance sheet date.
Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations are 
translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss arising 
from exchange differences are accumulated in the Foreign Currency Translation Account until the disposal of the net 
investment in the non-integral foreign operations.
In accordance with the RBI clarification, the Bank does not recognise in the profit and loss account the proportionate 
exchange gains or losses held in the foreign currency translation reserve on repatriation of profits from 
overseas operations.
Currency future contracts are marked to market daily using settlement price on a trading day, which is the closing price 
of the respective future contracts on that day. While the daily settlement prices is computed on the basis of weighted 
average price of such contract, the final settlement price is taken as the RBI reference rate on the last trading day of

Staff, advised banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on the date of grant should be recognized as 
an expense for all instruments granted after the accounting period ending March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Bank 
changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked instruments 
granted after March 31, 2021. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using 
Black-Scholes model is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period.
Options granted till March 31, 2021, the Bank measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using

underlying stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock 
options) over the exercise price. The exercise price of the Bank’s stock option is the last closing price on the stock

projected unit credit method as per the requirement of AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, the determination is based on

future. Deferred tax assets in case of unabsorbed depreciation/ losses are recognized only if there is virtual certainty 
that such deferred tax asset can be realized against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets are recognized and 
reassessed at each balance sheet date based upon management’s judgement and appropriately adjusted to reflect

In light of the above, the Administrator, on behalf of the Bank, consequent to the invocation of Section 45 of the BR 
Act, and to protect the interest of the Bank and its depositors, was constrained to write down (` 84,150 million) two 
tranches of the Additional Tier 1 Bonds (“AT-1 Bonds”) issued in 2016 and 2017, in compliance with the contractual 
covenants and applicable RBI guidelines, on March 14, 2020.
Aggrieved by the said write down of AT-1 Bonds, AT-1 Bondholders filed various writ petition(s), civil suit(s), criminal 
and consumer complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds since 
2020. The same are pending adjudication, save and except the batch of writ petition(s) filed before the Hon’ble 
Bombay High Court and one writ petition before the Hon’ble Madras High Court (as mentioned below).
Judgment dated September 30, 2020 of the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“MHC”):
The RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations, insofar as it relates to issuance and write down of AT-1 Bonds, 
was challenged before the Division Bench of the Hon’ble MHC in the Writ Petition titled Piyush Bokaria Vs. Reserve Bank 
of India and Ors., (being W.P. (Civil) 12586 of 2020). The Hon’ble MHC vide its judgment dated September 30, 2020 
upheld the validity of the RBI Master Circular in relation to the AT-1 Bonds. Additionally, with respect to the aspect 
of writing down of AT-1 Bonds, the Hon’ble MHC observed that one of the features of AT-1 Bonds is that they can be 
written-down before the equity shares bear losses and considering that the Petitioners purchased the AT -1 Bonds in 
the secondary market, they cannot claim to be ignorant of the terms and conditions thereof. The Hon’ble MHC also 
noted the loss absorbency feature of the AT-1 Bonds and dismissed the Writ Petition.
Judgment dated January 20, 2023 of the Hon’ble Bombay High Court (“BHC”):
Multiple writ petition(s) were filed before the Hon’ble BHC challenging the write down of AT-1 Bonds and the stock 
exchange intimation dated March 14, 2020 made in relation to the write down. The Hon’ble BHC vide its judgment 
dated January 20, 2023 set aside the stock exchange intimation and decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 
Bonds (“Judgment”). At the request of the Bank, the Hon’ble BHC stayed the order for a period of 6 (six) weeks.
Proceedings before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”):
Aggrieved by the Judgment of the Hon’ble BHC, the Bank and the RBI filed separate Special Leave Petition(s) (“SLPs”) 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court challenging the Judgement of the Hon’ble BHC. On March 3, 2023, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court issued notice and extended the stay granted by the Hon’ble BHC, subject to the final orders of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court. The SLPs are pending hearing.
Further, the Central Government has also filed a separate SLP before the Hon’ble Supreme Court challenging the 
Judgement of the Hon’ble BHC.
Given that the write down of the AT-1 Bonds was in accordance with the relevant regulations and as RBI and Central 
Government (“relevant authorities” in terms of the RBI Master Circular) have also filed SLPs challenging the Judgement 
of Hon’ble BHC, the Bank has estimated that there should not be any material financial impact of the matter under 
litigation. Upon final verdict of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, financial impact, if any, on the results and/or other 
financial information shall be accounted for in future reporting periods.
Separately, Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) issued a Show Cause Notice dated October 28, 2020 
to the Bank and other noticee(s) (ex-employees of the Bank) alleging violation of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of 
Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. Thereafter, SEBI vide its order 
dated April 12, 2021 imposed penalty of ` 250 million on the Bank under Section 15 HA of Securities and Exchange 
Board of India Act, 1992 for the alleged mis-selling of AT-1 Bonds in the secondary market. SEBI also imposed penalties 
on other noticee(s). Aggrieved by the above-mentioned SEBI order, the Bank and other noticee(s) preferred separate 
Appeal(s) before the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (“SAT”). SAT heard the Appeal(s) and the effect 
and operation of the SEBI order dated April 12, 2021 has been stayed. The said Appeal(s) are pending final hearing.

# Sale of stressed loans to JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Private Limited
On July 13, 2022, the Bank had signed a binding term sheet with JCF ARC LLC and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction 
Private Limited (“JC Flowers ARC”) for a strategic partnership in relation to sale of identified stressed loans of the 
Bank aggregating to up to ` 480,000 million as at March 31, 2022. The Bank had used the bid of JC Flowers ARC 
as a base bid (“Base Bid”) to conduct a transparent bidding process on Swiss Challenge basis under the aegis of 
the Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021 dated September 24, 
2021 (‘the Master Direction’) for inviting challenger bids for sale of identified stressed loan portfolio. Pursuant to the 
conclusion of the Swiss Challenge process, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at their meeting held on September 20, 
2022, approved JC Flowers ARC as the winner of the Swiss Challenge process and proceeded towards negotiating 
definitive agreements.
On December 16, 2022, the Bank concluded the aforesaid assignment after adjusting recoveries between April 1, 
2022 to November 30, 2022. The gross value of exposures transferred to JC Flowers ARC was ` 437,157.89 million 
which included exposures worth ` 151,980.93 million earlier written-off by the Bank. The net book value (‘NBV’) of 
these exposures in the Bank’s books as on the date of assignment was ` 49,817.57 million and the final consideration 
received was ` 80,458.68 million under 15:85 cash and security receipts structure.
For stressed loans transferred to ARC for a consideration lower than the NBV at the time of transfer, the shortfall 
of ` 6,086.09 million to the Bank was debited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2023 
spread equally over the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The realized 
profit amounting to ` 5,113.81 million where the cash recovery was exceeding the net book value of stressed loans 
was credited to Profit and Loss Account in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For stressed loans where the 
consideration received was higher than that net book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is lower 
than the net book value, such excess amount of ` 31,613.38 million was not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account. 
The Bank has continued to carry forward the same as provision against these security receipts. In effect the Bank 
has reflected such sale in a manner that the value of security receipts is not higher than the net book value of the 
loans transferred to JC Flowers ARC. The same is being assessed for the provisioning requirements as per the extant 
RBI guidelines on each reporting date also taking into account the principle that there should be no provisioning 
arbitrage between the provisioning on Security Receipts vis-à-vis the provisioning requirements on the underlying 
exposure, had it stayed in the books.

17.5.19 Disclosures on risk exposure in derivatives
As per RBI Master circular DOR.ACC.REC.No.45/21.04.018/2021-22 dated August 30, 2021, the following disclosures 
are being made with respect to risk exposure in derivatives of the Bank:
a)	
Purpose: The Bank uses Derivatives including Forwards & swaps for various purposes including hedging its 
currency and interest rate risk in its balance sheet, customer offerings and proprietary trading. The management 
of these products and businesses is governed by Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Derivatives Policy, 
Derivatives Appropriate ness Policy, Hedging Policy and ALM policy.
b)	
Structure: The Board of Directors of the Bank have constituted a Board level sub-committee, the Risk Management 
Committee (‘RMC’) and delegated to it all functions and responsibilities relating to the risk management policy 
of the Bank and its supervision thereof.
c)	
As part of prudent business and risk management practice, the Bank has also instituted a comprehensive 
limit and control structure encompassing Value-at-Risk (VAR), Sensitivity, Greeks, Stop loss & credit limits for 
derivative transactions including suitability and appropriateness framework. The Bank has an internal reporting 
mechanism providing regular reports to the RMC as well as to the management of the Bank. Such a structure 
helps the Bank to monitor and mitigate market risk across FX and interest rates.
d)	
The Bank has an independent Middle Office and Market Risk functions, which are responsible for monitoring, 
measurement, and analysis of derivative related risks, among others. The Bank has a Credit Risk Management 
unit which is responsible for setting up counterparty limits and also a treasury operation unit which is responsible 
for managing operational aspects of derivatives including settlement of transactions. The Bank is subject to a 
concurrent audit for all treasury transactions, including derivatives transactions, a monthly report of which is 
periodically submitted to the Audit & Compliance Committee of the Bank.
e)	
In addition to the above, the Bank independently evaluates the potential credit exposure on account of all 
derivative transactions, wherein risk limits are specified separately for each product, in terms of both credit 
exposure and tenor. As mandated by the Credit Policy of the Bank, the Bank has instituted an approval structure 
for all treasury/derivative related credit exposures. Wherever necessary, appropriate credit covenants are 
stipulated as trigger events to call for collaterals or terminate transaction and contain the risks.
f)	
The Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts has been notified by the RBI through circular dated 
March 30, 2021. The Bank has computed capital adequacy as well as exposure on account of these contracts 
as per Current Exposure method considering each transaction as separate netting set on conservative basis. 
The Bank shall work progressively over the period on classification of multiple permissible transactions into a 
netting set which may result in reduction in capital requirement and exposure due to these transactions. There is 
no change in Current Exposure Method (CEM) computation for Non-Bilateral Counterparties & Quasi Central 
Counter Party (QCCP) trades.
g)	
The Bank reports all trading positions to the management on a daily basis. The Bank revalues its trading position 
on a daily basis for Management and Information System (‘MIS’) and control purposes and records the same in 
the books of accounts on a monthly basis.
h)	
For derivative contracts in the banking book designated as hedge, the Bank documents at the inception of the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, the risk management objective for 
undertaking the hedge and the ALCO monitors all outstanding hedges on a periodical basis. Further the Bank’s 
‘Hedging Policy’ has stipulated conditions to ensure that the Hedges entered into are effective.

$On December 16, 2022, the Bank concluded the aforesaid assignment after adjusting recoveries between April 1, 2022 to 
November 30, 2022. The gross value of exposures transferred to JC Flowers ARC was ` 437,157.89 million which included exposures 
worth ` 151,980.93 million earlier written-off by the Bank. The net book value (‘NBV’) of these exposures in the Bank’s books as on 
the date of assignment was ` 49,817.57 million and the final consideration received was ` 80,458.68 million under 15:85 cash and 
security receipts structure.
	
For stressed loans transferred to ARC for a consideration lower than the NBV at the time of transfer, the shortfall 
of ` 6,086.09 million to the Bank was debited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2023 
spread equally over the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The realized 
profit amounting to ` 5,113.81 million where the cash recovery was exceeding the net book value of stressed 
loans was credited to Profit and Loss Account in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For stressed loans where 
the consideration received was higher than that net book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is 
lower than the net book value, such excess amount of ` 31,613.38 million was not reversed in the Profit and Loss 
Account. The Bank has continued to carry forward the same as provision against these security receipts. In effect 
the Bank has reflected such sale in a manner that the value of security receipts is not higher than the net book 
value of the loans transferred to JC Flowers ARC. The same is being assessed for the provisioning requirements 
as per the extant RBI guidelines on each reporting date also taking into account the principle that there should be 
no provisioning arbitrage between the provisioning on Security Receipts vis-à-vis the provisioning requirements 
on the underlying exposure, had it stayed in the books.

The Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked 
instruments granted beginning from April 01, 2021. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the 
date of grant using Black-Scholes model and is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. As a result, 
‘Employees cost’ for the year ended March 31, 2023 is ` 216.26 million and ` 82.42 million for the year ended March 31, 
2022. The Bank has adopted the Fair Value method (based on Black- Scholes pricing model), for pricing and accounting 
of options for the year ended March 31, 2023. If the Bank had adopted the Fair Value for all the options granted till 
March 31, 2021, the net profit after tax would have been lower by ` 53.24 million (the net profit after tax would have 
been lower by ` 175.95 million in previous year), There will be no impact on the basic earnings per share and diluted 
earnings per share i.e. ` 0.27 per share (Previous year: ` 0.42 per share instead of ` 0.43 per share) due to the impact of 
the aforesaid mentioned difference between the Intrinsic Value of the Options and the Fair Value of the Options.
The following assumptions have been made for computation of the fair value of ESOP granted for the year ended 
March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022:

Variable Pay, where a certain proportion of Variable Pay (Cash and Non-Cash) is deferred over a period of time 
for the Senior Executives of the Bank. The Bank assesses through the Business Unit Head/ Risk/ Compliance/ 
Audit/ Finance function for any adverse outcomes in the case of organizational or business unit or individual 
level prior to the payment of the deferred portion.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Qualitative Disclosure:
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the key reforms adopted by RBI to develop a more resilient banking sector.
LCR indicates the bank’s ability to meet proportion of the Bank’s liquidity needs under a 30 day stress period as 
assessed based on regulatory guidelines with the High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) maintained by the Bank. As per 
the regulatory guidelines, Banks are required to maintain minimum LCR at 100% i.e. maintain HQLA of a minimum 
100% for Net Cash Outflows as assessed based on the regulatory guidelines.
The Bank has implemented robust process to compute and report the LCR in line with regulatory guidelines and is 
monitored at consolidated level. Further, the Bank also monitors its liquidity requirements in USD.
The Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz. Retail (which include deposits from individuals), 
Small Business Customers (those with deposits up to ` 7.5 crore) and Wholesale Customers to determine the cash 
outflows for LCR. Within Wholesale, deposits on account of Operational activity by the customers through clearing, 
custody, and cash management services of the Bank are classified as Operational Deposits. Non-Operational Deposits 
from wholesale customers are further segregated within Non-Financial Corporates and Others to compute the 
corresponding Cash Outflow for LCR. The Bank also includes other contractual funding including a portion of other 
liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30-day time frame in the cash outflows. These classifications, based 
on regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework. Expected derivative cash outflows and inflows from 
outstanding contracts are considered for computation of Net Cash Outflow. The Bank considers the other expected 
inflows in next 30 days as prescribed in the regulatory guidelines to compute the Net Cash Outflows for LCR.
HQLA maintained by the Bank primarily comprises of cash reserves in excess of required CRR, Government Securities 
i.e., Treasury Bills, dated securities issued by the Central & State Government along with eligible Corporate Bonds & 
Commercial Papers that qualify as Level 2 HQLA. Further, securities forming part of HQLA maintained by the Bank is 
well diversified across various marketable instruments, which shall provide the Bank adequate and timely liquidity to 
meet the Net Cash Outflow as & when required.
The Bank endeavors to meet the LCR requirement and adequacy of LCR remains a conscious strategy of the Bank. 
The Bank has placed stringent threshold as risk appetite for maintenance of LCR to maintain sufficient liquidity and 
compliance to LCR on an ongoing basis.
The Board of Directors of the Bank has empowered the Asset Liability Management Committee i.e. ALCO (Top 
Management Executive Committee) to monitor and strategize the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank within overall 
Board approved Strategic and Risk framework. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity 
view for the bank with the help of the economic analysis. ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments 
of the Bank to target good quality asset and liability profile to achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent 
with prudent liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs and meet the Bank’s profitability as well as Liquidity 
requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank. BSMG (Balance Sheet Management 
Group) of the Bank estimates daily liquidity requirement of the various business segments and manages the same 
on consolidated basis as per ALCO guidance.
The daily average LCR for the quarter ending March 31, 2023 is 120.12% (for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 was 
114.99 %), which is well above the prudential requirement of 100%

Qualitative Disclosure:
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) proposed reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity 
regulations with the objective of promoting a more resilient banking sector in the backdrop of global financial crisis 
in 2007. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was one of the important reform proposed in order to ensure resilience of 
the Banks over a longer term and stable liabilities to fund their business activities. NSFR was subsequently prescribed 
by the RBI to enhance resilience of the Indian Banking system.
NSFR ensures that the bank has sufficient stable funding available to fulfill the funding requirements by restricting 
the reliance on unstable short-term funding to finance potentially illiquid long-term assets. NSFR reduces long-term 
refinancing risk over longer-term time horizon (over 1 year) of the Bank by measuring the extent of stable sources of 
funds with the Bank to fund its long term assets.
Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is defined as amount of Available Stable Funding (ASF) to fulfil the amount of Required 
Stable Funding (RSF).
	
Available stable funding (ASF) is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over 1 year 
period. The amount of available stable funding is a function of the source and type of liability along with residual 
maturities of the various liabilities.
	
Required stable funding (RSF) is defined as the funding required for assets and off-balance sheet exposures over 
1 year period. The amount of required stable funding is a function of the underlying liquidity characteristics and 
residual maturities of the various assets.
NSFR was implemented w.e.f. October 01, 2021 by the RBI with stipulation of minimum NSFR maintenance at 100%.
The Bank has implemented robust process to compute and report the NSFR in line with regulatory guidelines and is 
monitored at consolidated level. The Bank endeavors to meet the NSFR requirement and adequacy of NSFR remains 
a conscious strategy of the Bank. The Bank has placed stringent threshold as risk appetite for maintenance of NSFR 
to maintain sufficient liquidity and compliance to NSFR on an ongoing basis.
The Board of Directors of the Bank have empowered Asset Liability Management Committee i.e. ALCO (Top 
Management Executive Committee) to monitor and strategize the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank within overall 
Board approved Strategic and Risk framework. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity 
view for the bank with the help of the economic analysis. ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments 
of the Bank to target good quality asset and liability profile to achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent 
with prudent liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs and meet the Bank’s profitability as well as Liquidity 
requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank. BSMG (Balance Sheet Management 
Group) of the Bank estimates daily liquidity requirement of the various business segments and manages the same 
on consolidated basis as per ALCO guidance.
NSFR as at March 31, 2023 is 109.95% (as at March 31, 2022 was 119.15%), which is well above the minimum regulatory 
requirement of 100%.

17.5.68	  Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure of Bank's Customer
The Bank has in place a policy on managing credit risk arising out of unhedged foreign currency exposures of its 
borrowers. The objective of this policy is to maximize the hedging on foreign currency exposures of borrowers by 
reviewing their foreign currency product portfolio and encouraging them to hedge the unhedged portion. In line with 
the policy, assessment of unhedged foreign currency exposure is a part of assessment of borrowers and is undertaken 
while proposing limits or at the review stage. Additionally, at the time of sanctioning limits for all clients, the Bank 
stipulates a limit on the unhedged foreign currency exposure of the client (as a % of total foreign currency exposure 
sanctioned by the Bank) after considering factors such as internal rating of the borrower, size, possibility of natural 
hedging, sophistication of borrower and maturity of borrower’s financial systems, relative size of unhedged foreign 
currency exposure with respect to total borrowings of the client, etc. Further, the Bank reviews the unhedged foreign 
currency exposure across its portfolio on a periodic basis. The Bank also maintains incremental provision and capital 
towards the unhedged foreign currency exposures of its borrowers in line with the extant RBI guidelines.
The Bank has maintained provision of ` 912.37 million (previous year of ` 850.90 million) and additional capital of 
` 2,876.74 million (previous year of ` 2,199.25 million) on account of Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure of its 
borrowers as at March 31, 2023.

17.5.78	 Description of Contingent Liabilities 
Sr. 
No.
Contingent 
Liabilities
Brief
1.
Claims against 
the Bank not 
acknowledged as 
debts
The Bank is a party to various legal and tax proceedings in the normal course of business. The Bank 
does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s 
financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.
2.
Liability on account 
of forward exchange 
and derivative 
contracts.
The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, currency 
swaps and interest rate swaps with interbank participants and customers. Forward exchange contracts 
are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. Currency swaps 
are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/principal in one currency against another, 
based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating 
interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments of such foreign exchange 
contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognized on the balance 
sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair 
value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The 
derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations 
in market rates or prices relative to their terms. The aggregate contractual or notional amount of 
derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are favorable or unfavorable 
and, thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly.
3.
Guarantees given on 
behalf of constituents, 
acceptances, 
endorsements and 
other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees on 
behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing of 
the customers of the Bank. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will 
make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.
4.
Other items for 
which the Bank is 
contingently liable
Purchase of securities pending settlement, capital commitments, amount deposited with RBI under 
Depositor Education Awareness Fund (DEAF), bill re-discounting, Foreign Exchange Contracts (Tom 
& Spot), Custodian operations, Undrawn partial credit enhancement facilities, When Issued (‘WI’) 
securities.

To the Members of

Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated

the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year 
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, including a summary of the significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Consolidated Financial 
Statements’/’Statements’).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based 
on the consideration of report of the other auditor on 
separate financial statements and on the other financial 
information of the subsidiary, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by 
the section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as 
well as the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) and circulars 
and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India, in 
the manner so required for banking companies and give 
a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of 
the Act, read with Companies (Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2021 as amended to the extent applicable, of the 
consolidated state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 
2023, and its consolidated profit, and its consolidated 
cash flows for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (‘SAs’) specified under Section 
143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs 
are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act, and the 
Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current year. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. We have determined the matters 
described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report:
Key Audit Matters
Auditor’s Response
Income Recognition and Asset Classification of Advances and Investments (IRAC) and Provisioning as per regulatory norms
Please refer to schedule 8 and schedule 9, read with relevant 
notes relating to provisions and contingencies, disclosures 
with regard to Non Performing Investments (NPI) and Asset 
Quality in respect of movement of Non-Performing Assets 
(NPAs) and related provisions respectively. 
As required under prudential norms issued by the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) in respect of income recognition, asset 
classification and provisioning pertaining to investments as 
well as those pertaining to advances, “Resolution framework 
for Covid-19 related Stress” (the “Resolution Framework”) 
issued by the RBI on August 06, 2020 and May 05, 2021 and 
relevant other circulars, notifications and directives issued 
by the RBI which were collectively considered by the Bank 
till March 31, 2023, classifies advances into performing 
and non-performing advances (NPA) which consists of 
Standard, Sub-standard, Doubtful and Loss and makes 
appropriate provisions.
Our audit approach included testing the design, operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit procedures 
in respect of income recognition, asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to investments and advances. In particular:
•	
We have evaluated the Bank’s internal control system in 
adhering to the relevant RBI guidelines regarding income 
recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to 
investments and advances;
•	
We have tested key IT systems/ applications used and their 
design and implementation as well as operational effectiveness 
of relevant controls, including involvement of manual process 
and manual controls in relation to income recognition, asset 
classification viz., standard, sub-standard, doubtful and loss 
with reference to their days-past-due (DPD) status (including 
consideration of non-financial parameters of NPA, including 
sufficiency of credits in working capital loans, restructuring 
guidelines, the Regulatory Package and Resolution framework) 
and provisioning pertaining to investments and advances;

Auditor’s Response
Income Recognition and Asset Classification of Advances and Investments (IRAC) and Provisioning as per regulatory norms
The Bank, as per its governing framework, made the 
performing and non-performing advances provisions based 
on Management’s assessment of the degree of impairment 
of the advances subject to and guided by minimum 
provisioning levels prescribed under RBI guidelines.
The Classification, Provisioning and Write off of Advances 
including Investments is a Key Audit Matter as the Bank 
has significant credit risk exposure to a large number of 
borrowers across various sectors, products, industries 
and geographies and there is a high degree of complexity, 
uncertainty and judgment involved in recoverability 
of advances, nature of transactions and estimation of 
provisions thereon and identification of accounts to 
be written off. 
•	
We have test checked advances to examine the validity of 
the recorded amounts, loan documentation, examined the 
statement of accounts, indicators of impairment, impairment 
provision for non-performing assets, and compliance with 
income recognition, asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to advances in terms of applicable RBI guidelines;
•	
We have selected restructured accounts on sample basis and 
tested their compliance with relevant RBI guidelines; 
•	
For the selected non-performing advances, we assessed 
Management’s forecast and inputs of recoverable cash flows, 
borrower’s audited financial statements, valuation of underlying 
security and collaterals, estimation of recoverable amounts on 
default and other sources of repayment;
•	
Reviewed Bank’s policy including Standard Operating Procedures 
with respect to implementation of Regulatory package and 
Resolution framework (‘guidelines’) and tested samples to 
ascertain the implementation of those guidelines by the Bank.
Provisions for advances:
•	
Tested the Bank’s processes for making provision on advances 
for compliance with RBI regulations and internally laid down 
policies for provisioning;
•	
Tested the completeness and accuracy of data transferred 
from 
underlying 
source 
systems 
used 
for 
computing 
collective provision;
•	
We had undertaken the walkthrough for the automated E-NPA 
system and tested the core functionality for selected sample 
considering the audit universe.
•	
Validated the parameters used to calculate collective provisions 
with reference to IRAC norms, and Regulatory Package;
•	
Tested provision created for fraud accounts as at March 31, 
2023 as per the RBI circular;
•	
Re-performed, for a sample of retail and corporate portfolios, 
as part of our substantive audit procedures the calculation 
of provisions, to determine the accuracy of the same;

IT Systems and Controls over financial reporting
The Bank’s key financial accounting and reporting processes 
are highly dependent on Core Banking and Treasury Solutions 
and other supporting software and hardware controls. 
The volume of transactions processed and recorded is huge. 
Moreover, a transaction may be required to be recorded 
across multiple applications depending upon the process 
and each application has different rules and a different 
set of user access and authority matrix. These applications 
are interlinked using different technologies so that data 
transfer happens in real time or at a particular time of the 
day; in batches or at a transaction level and in an automated 
manner or manually. The Core Banking Solution (CBS) itself 
has many interfaces, such that there exists a risk that gaps 
in the IT control environment could result in the financial 
accounting and reporting records being materially misstated. 
The Bank has a process for identifying the applications 
where the controls are embedded. It also has a process 
to ensure that systems, processes and controls remain 
relevant and updated. The Bank’s IT control framework 
includes automated, semi-automated and manual controls 
designed to address identified risks. IT controls are stated in 
Entity Level Controls (ELC), IT General Controls (ITGC) and IT 
Application Controls (ITAC). Such controls contribute to risk 
mitigation of erroneous output data. 
We have identified IT Controls Framework as a Key Audit 
Matter as the Bank’s business is highly dependent on 
technology, the IT environment is complex and the design and 
operating effectiveness of IT controls have a direct impact on 
its financial reporting process. Review of these controls allows 
us to provide assurance on the integrity and completeness 
of data processed through various IT applications which are 
used for the preparation of financial reports.
•	
We have planned, designed and carried out the desired audit 
procedures and sample checks, taking into consideration the IT 
systems of the Bank. As part of our IT controls testing, we have 
tested ITGC as well as ITAC for selected critical applications. 
The focus of testing of ITGCs was based on the various 
parameters such as Completeness, Validity, Identification/ 
Authentication, Authorization, Integrity and Accountability. 
On the other hand, focus of testing automated controls from 
applications was whether the controls prevent or detect 
unauthorized transactions and support financial objectives 
including completeness, accuracy, authorization and validity of 
transactions. The procedures adopted by us are, in our opinion, 
adequate to provide reasonable assurance on the adequacy of 
IT controls in place. The areas for improvement as and when 
noticed are communicated for suitable actions to the Bank 
as part of our audit. The corrective steps / alternate controls 
deployed by the Bank are tested on sample basis. 
•	
In ITGC testing, on sample basis, we reviewed control areas 
such as User Management, Change Management, Systems 
Security, Cyber Security, Interface Testing, deployment of new 
applications, Incident Management, Physical & Environmental 
Security, Backup and Restoration, Business Continuity and 
Disaster Recovery, Service Level Agreement. 
•	
For ITAC, we carried out on sample basis, compliance tests 
of system functionality in order to assess the accuracy of 
system calculations. We also carried out procedures such as 
validations and limit checks on data entered into applications, 
approvals, process dependencies, restriction on time period 
in which transactions may be recorded and GL mapping for 
financial accounting. 
•	
We tested the control environment using various techniques 
such as inquiry, walkthroughs in live environment, testing 
in UAT environment, review of documentation / record / 
reports, observation and re-performance. We had taken 
adequate samples of instances for our tests considering the 
audit universe.
•	
Wherever deviations were noted either the same were 
explained to our satisfaction or we tested compensating 
controls and performed alternate procedures, where necessary, 
to draw comfort.
•	
In addition, we have also relied on IS audit conducted by internal 
audit department, and also the testing of Internal Financial 
Control conducted by the Operational Risk Management 
department of the Bank.

Recognition and Measurement of Deferred Tax Asset
The Bank has recognized a net deferred tax asset of ` 89,412 
million as at March 31, 2023, including net decrease of 
` 2,431 million during the year. 
Besides objective estimation, recognition and measurement 
of deferred tax asset is based on the judgment and 
numerous estimates regarding the availability and visibility 
of profits in the future and also considering probable 
impact of Covid-19 pandemic. 
The amount of deferred tax assets recognized presumes 
availability and forecasting of profits over an extended 
period of time thus increasing uncertainty and the inherent 
risk of inappropriate recognition of the said asset.
Our audit procedures involved gaining an understanding of the 
applicable tax laws and relevant regulations applicable to the 
Bank. We performed the following audit procedures as part of our 
controls testing:
•	
Evaluation of the policies used for recognition and measurement 
of deferred tax assets in accordance with AS 22 Accounting for 
Taxes on Income;
•	
Assessed the probability of the availability of future taxable 
profits based on assumptions and other parameters used by 
the Management including the probable impact of Covid-19 
pandemic against which the Bank will be able to use this 
deferred tax asset in the future with reference to forecast as 
noted by the Board of Directors while adopting the consolidated 
financial statements. 
•	
Assessed the method for determining the Deferred Tax 
Asset with reference to applicable tax rates and tested the 
arithmetical accuracy.

The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the Other Information. The other 
information comprises the Management Discussion

Directors’ Report and the Pillar 3 Disclosures under the 
New Capital Adequacy Framework (Basel III disclosures) 
(collectively called as “Other Information”) but does 
not include the consolidated financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is 
expected to be made available to us after the date of 
this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the Other 
Information identified above when it becomes available 
and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information 
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the other information, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged 
with governance. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of 
the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give 
a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards specified 
under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies 
(Accounting Standard) Rules 2021, as amended to 
the extent applicable, provisions of Section 29 of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and 
guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) from 
time to time, as applicable to the Bank. The respective 
Board of Directors of the Company included in the 
Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act and the RBI Guidelines, for safeguarding of the 
assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
410

presentation of the consolidated financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which 
have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the management 
and Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors of the Companies 
included in the Group are responsible for assessing the 
ability of each company in the Group to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends 
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the Company 
included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Bank has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.	
•	
Evaluate 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements made by the 
Management and Board of Directors. 
•	
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
Management and Board of Director’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our Auditor’s Report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our Auditor’s Report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding 
the 
financial 
information 
of 
the 
entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the 
financial statements of such entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are 
the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
which have been audited by other auditors, such 
other auditors remain responsible for the direction,

•	
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us 
along with the consideration of audit reports of the 
other auditors referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of 
the Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Bank and such other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current year and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements of 
YES BANK Limited (“the Bank”) and its subsidiary 
company, which are companies incorporated in India 
as at March 31, 2023, in conjunction with our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for 
the year ended on that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective company’s management and Board 
of Directors are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements criteria established 
by the Bank and respective companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(‘the ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiary 
company, which are companies incorporated in 
Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report 
of even date on the consolidated financial statements of YES BANK Limited 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Referred to in paragraph 3(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent 
Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of YES BANK Limited on the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023)
India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards 
on Auditing (‘the Standards’), issued by the ICAI and 
deemed to be, prescribed under section 143(10) of 
the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls, both issued by the ICAI with reference 
to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements were established and maintained 
and whether such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor of

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A Bank's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A Bank’s internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statement includes 
those policies and procedures that 
1)	
pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in 
reasonable 
detail, 
accurately 
and 
fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the Bank; 
2)	
provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the Bank; and 
3)	
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to consolidated financial statement may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Holding Company (the Bank) and 
its subsidiary company, which is incorporated in India, 
have, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and such internal financial controls 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, with 
reference to consolidated financial statements criteria 
established by the Bank and its subsidiary company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note. 
Other Matter
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act 
on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements in so far as it relates to one 
subsidiary company, is based on the corresponding 
report of the auditor of this company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

17.2	Principles of Consolidation
The Bank has sold its entire stake in its wholly owned subsidiaries YES Asset Management (India) Limited and YES 
Trustee Limited on November 1, 2021. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include figures of these two 
subsidiaries till October 31, 2021. 
The Bank consolidates its subsidiaries in accordance with Accounting Standard (‘AS’) 21, Consolidated Financial 
Statements notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with Companies (Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2021 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to the extent applicable on a line-by-line basis by 
adding together the like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.
17.3	Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with requirements prescribed under the Third Schedule 
(Form A and Form B) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The accounting and reporting policies of the Group used 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
in India (Indian GAAP), the guidelines and clarifications issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time, 
the accounting standards notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 read together with Companies

liabilities) as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting 
period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The impact of any revision in these 
estimates is recognised prospectively from the period of change.
While India is emerging from COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which any new wave of COVID-19 will impact the 
Group's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, inter-alia including, the impacts of actions of 
governments and other authorities to contain its spread or mitigate its impact.

17.5.10 Employee benefits
Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)
The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares of the 
Group to its employees. The options granted to employees vest in a graded manner and these may be exercised by 
the employees within specified periods.
Measurement of the employee share-based payment plans is done in accordance with the Guidance Note on 
Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and 
SEBI (Securities & Exchange Board of India) Regulations, 2014. RBI, vide its clarification dated August 30, 2021 on 
Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control 
Function Staff, advised banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on the date of grant should be recognized 
as an expense for all instruments granted after the accounting period ending March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Group 
changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked instruments 
granted after March 31, 2021. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using 
Black-Scholes model is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. 
Options granted till March 31, 2021, the Group measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options 
using the intrinsic value method. Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair market price of 
the underlying stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock 
options) over the exercise price. The exercise price of the Bank’s stock option is the last closing price on the stock 
exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options and accordingly there is no compensation cost 
under the intrinsic value method. 
Compensated absences
The employees of the Group are entitled to carry forward a part of their unavailed/unutilized leave subject to a 
maximum limit. The employees cannot encash unavailed/unutilized leave. The Group provides for leave encashment 
/ compensated absences based on an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance Sheet date, which includes 
assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases, interest rates and leave utilisation.

Act. The Group accounts for the liability for future gratuity benefits using the projected unit cost method based on 
independent actuarial valuation.
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using the 
projected unit credit method as per the requirement of Accounting Standard-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, the determination 
is based on actuarial calculations, which include assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases 
and interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss account.

Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax comprises of the amount of tax for the period 
determined in accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 and the rules framed there under. Deferred taxes reflect 
the impact of timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the current year and reversal 
of timing differences of earlier years and carry forward losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of timing differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their

enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at the balance sheet date. The impact of changes in deferred tax assets 
and liabilities is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realized in 
future. Deferred tax assets in case of unabsorbed depreciation/ losses are recognized only if there is virtual certainty 
that such deferred tax asset can be realized against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets are recognized and 
reassessed at each balance sheet date based upon management’s judgement and appropriately adjusted to reflect 
the amount that is reasonably certain to be realised.

Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer 
probable that an outflow of resources would be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 
Bank or a present obligation that arises from past events that is not recognized because it is not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the consolidated 
financial statements.
Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. However, contingent assets are 
assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related 
income are recognized in the period in which the change occurs.

On July 13, 2022, the Bank had signed a binding term sheet with JCF ARC LLC and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction 
Private Limited (“JC Flowers ARC”) for a strategic partnership in relation to sale of identified stressed loans of the 
Bank aggregating to up to ` 480,000 million as at March 31, 2022. The Bank had used the bid of JC Flowers ARC 
as a base bid (“Base Bid”) to conduct a transparent bidding process on Swiss Challenge basis under the aegis of 
the Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021 dated September 24, 
2021 (‘the Master Direction’) for inviting challenger bids for sale of identified stressed loan portfolio. Pursuant to the 
conclusion of the Swiss Challenge process, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at their meeting held on September 20, 
2022, approved JC Flowers ARC as the winner of the Swiss Challenge process and proceeded towards negotiating 
definitive agreements.
On December 16, 2022, the Bank concluded the aforesaid assignment after adjusting recoveries between April 1, 
2022 to November 30, 2022. The gross value of exposures transferred to JC Flowers ARC was ` 437,157.89 million 
which included exposures worth ` 151,980.93 million earlier written-off by the Bank. The net book value (‘NBV’) of 
these exposures in the Bank’s books as on the date of assignment was ` 49,817.57 million and the final consideration 
received was ` 80,458.68 million under 15:85 cash and security receipts structure.
For stressed loans transferred to ARC for a consideration lower than the NBV at the time of transfer, the shortfall 
of ` 6,086.09 million to the Bank was debited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2023 
spread equally over the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The realized 
profit amounting to ` 5,113.81 million where the cash recovery was exceeding the net book value of stressed loans 
was credited to Profit and Loss Account in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For stressed loans where the 
consideration received was higher than that net book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is lower 
than the net book value, such excess amount of ` 31,613.38 million was not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account. 
The Bank has continued to carry forward the same as provision against these security receipts. In effect the Bank 
has reflected such sale in a manner that the value of security receipts is not higher than the net book value of the 
loans transferred to JC Flowers ARC. The same is being assessed for the provisioning requirements as per the extant 
RBI guidelines on each reporting date also taking into account the principle that there should be no provisioning 
arbitrage between the provisioning on Security Receipts vis-à-vis the provisioning requirements on the underlying 
exposure, had it stayed in the books.

The difference between weighted average number of equity shares outstanding between basic and diluted in the 
above mentioned disclosure is on account of outstanding ESOPs.
Basic earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing net profit for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings per 
equity share has been computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares options outstanding during the year, 
except where the results are anti-dilutive. The dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by 
the Bank. There is no impact of dilution on the profits in the current year and previous year.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
The Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked 
instruments granted beginning from April 01, 2021. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on 
the date of grant using Black-Scholes model and is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. As a 
result, ‘Employees cost’ for the year ended March 31, 2023 is ` 216.26 million and ` 82.42 million for the year ended 
March 31, 2022. The Bank has adopted the Fair Value method (based on Black- Scholes pricing model), for pricing and 
accounting of options for the year ended March 31, 2023. If the Bank had adopted the Fair Value for all the options 
granted till March 31, 2021, the net profit after tax would have been lower by ` 53.24 million (the net profit after tax 
would have been lower by ` 175.95 million in previous year), There will be no impact on the basic earnings per share 
and diluted earnings per share i.e. ` 0.27 per share (Previous year: ` 0.42 per share instead of ` 0.43 per share) due 
to the impact of the aforesaid mentioned difference between the Intrinsic Value of the Options and the Fair Value 
of the Options.
The following assumptions have been made for computation of the fair value of ESOP granted for the year ended 
March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022:

Write Down of AT1 Bonds
On March 5, 2020, Central Government in terms of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (“BR Act”) imposed moratorium 
on the Bank. Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 36ACA of the BR Act superseded the 
then Board of Directors and appointed an Administrator to manage the affairs of the Bank w.e.f. March 5, 2020. Subsequently 
on March 13, 2020, through the ‘YES BANK Limited Reconstruction Scheme, 2020’ (“the YES BANK Reconstruction Scheme”), the 
relevant authorities (i.e., Central Government in consultation with RBI) decided to “reconstitute” the Bank. Further, in terms of the 
YES BANK Reconstruction Scheme, the Administrator was to continue in office until the Board of Directors mentioned in the Yes 
Bank Reconstruction Scheme assumed office, i.e., on March 26, 2020. 
In light of the above, the Administrator, on behalf of the Bank, consequent to the invocation of Section 45 of the BR Act, and to 
protect the interest of the Bank and its depositors, was constrained to write down (` 84,150 million) two tranches of the Additional 
Tier 1 Bonds (“AT-1 Bonds”) issued in 2016 and 2017, in compliance with the contractual covenants and applicable RBI guidelines, 
on March 14, 2020.
Aggrieved by the said write down of AT-1 Bonds, AT-1 Bondholders filed various writ petition(s), civil suit(s), criminal and consumer 
complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds since 2020. The same are pending 
adjudication, save and except the batch of writ petition(s) filed before the Hon’ble Bombay High Court and one writ petition before 
the Madras High Court (as mentioned below).

Judgment dated September 30, 2020 of the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“MHC”):
The RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations, insofar as it relates to issuance and write down of AT-1 Bonds, was 
challenged before the Division Bench of the Hon’ble MHC in the Writ Petition titled Piyush Bokaria Vs. Reserve Bank of India and 
Ors., (being W.P. (Civil) 12586 of 2020). The Hon’ble MHC vide its judgment dated September 30, 2020 upheld the validity of the RBI 
Master Circular in relation to the AT-1 Bonds. Additionally, with respect to the aspect of writing down of AT-1 Bonds, the Hon’ble 
MHC observed that one of the features of AT-1 Bonds is that they can be written-down before the equity shares bear losses and 
considering that the Petitioners purchased the AT -1 Bonds in the secondary market, they cannot claim to be ignorant of the terms 
and conditions thereof. The Hon’ble MHC also noted the loss absorbency feature of the AT-1 Bonds and dismissed the Writ Petition.
Judgment dated January 20, 2023 of the Hon’ble Bombay High Court (“BHC”):
Multiple writ petition(s) were filed before the Hon’ble BHC challenging the write down of AT-1 Bonds and the stock exchange 
intimation dated March 14, 2020 made in relation to the write down. The Hon’ble BHC vide its judgment dated January 20, 2023 set 
aside the stock exchange intimation and decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds (“Judgment”). At the request of the Bank, 
the Hon’ble BHC stayed the order for a period of 6 (six) weeks.	
Proceedings before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”):
Aggrieved by the Judgment of the Hon’ble BHC, the Bank and the RBI filed separate Special Leave Petition(s) (“SLPs”) before the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court challenging the Judgement of the Hon’ble BHC. On March 3, 2023, the Hon’ble Supreme Court issued 
notice and extended the stay granted by the Hon’ble BHC, subject to the final orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The SLPs are 
pending hearing. Further, the Central Government has also filed a separate SLP before the Hon’ble Supreme Court challenging the 
Judgement of the Hon’ble BHC.
Given that the write down of the AT-1 Bonds was in accordance with the relevant regulations and as RBI and Central Government 
(“relevant authorities” in terms of the RBI Master Circular) have also filed SLPs challenging the Judgement of Hon’ble BHC, the Bank 
has estimated that there should not be any material financial impact of the matter under litigation. Upon final verdict of the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court, financial impact, if any, on the results and/or other financial information shall be accounted for in future reporting 
periods.
Separately, Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) issued a Show Cause Notice dated October 28, 2020 to the Bank and 
other noticee(s) (ex-employees of the Bank) alleging violation of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade 
Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. Thereafter, SEBI vide its order dated April 12, 2021 imposed penalty of ` 
250 million on the Bank under Section 15 HA of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 for the alleged mis-selling of AT-1 
Bonds in the secondary market. SEBI also imposed penalties on other noticee(s). Aggrieved by the above-mentioned SEBI order, the 
Bank and other noticee(s) preferred separate Appeal(s) before the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (“SAT”). SAT heard 
the Appeal(s) and the effect and operation of the SEBI order dated April 12, 2021 has been stayed. The said Appeal(s) are pending

17.6.22 Description of contingent liabilities
Sr. 
No.
Contingent Liabilities
Brief
1.
Claims against the Group 
not acknowledged as 
debts
The Group is a party to various legal and tax proceedings in the normal course of business. The 
Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.
2.
Liability on account of 
forward exchange and 
derivative contracts.
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, 
currency swaps and interest rate swaps with interbank participants and customers. Forward 
exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the 
contracted rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/
principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps 
are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts 
of financial instruments of such foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for 
comparison with instruments recognized on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the 
amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, 
do not indicate the Group’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become 
favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices 
relative to their terms. The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial 
instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are favorable or unfavorable and, thus the 
aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly.
3.
Guarantees given on 
behalf of constituents, 
acceptances, 
endorsements and other 
obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees 
on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit 
standing of the customers of the Bank. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances 
that the Bank will make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or 
performance obligations.
4.
Other items for which 
the Group is contingently 
liable
Purchase of securities pending settlement, capital commitments, amount deposited with RBI 
under Depositor Education Awareness Fund (DEAF), bill re-discounting, Foreign Exchange 
Contracts (Tom & Spot), Custodian operations, undrawn partial credit enhancement facilities, 
When Issued (WI) securities
