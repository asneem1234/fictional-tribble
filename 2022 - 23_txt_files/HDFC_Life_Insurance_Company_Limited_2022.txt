7.   Statement by director responsible for

highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements 
Dear Stakeholders,
Our commitment to ESG is integral to our long term sustainability strategy. Our focus reflects 
in improved scores and ratings: We scored 49 in the 2022 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability 
Assessment reflecting an improvement of 35 points over the last 3 years; our Sustainalytics 
rating was 19.5 indicating low risk of experiencing material financial impact arising from ESG 
factors; we have maintained our MSCI rating at ‘BBB’. 
We understand the importance of environmental stewardship and have implemented 
initiatives such as procurement and installation of energy efficient appliances (e.g. 
LEDs, star-rated appliances, etc.), sensor-based water taps, renewable energy sourcing, 
and waste recycling to minimize our ecological footprint. We have conducted a detailed 
assessment of our greenhouse gas emission (GHG) inventory and have articulated our Scope 
1, 2 and limited Scope 3 emissions. We have also disclosed our climate-related performance 
in accordance with the TCFD recommendations.
Our focus on social responsibility extends to our employees, customers, and the communities 
in which we operate. We have taken steps to ensure a safe and inclusive work environment, 
fostering diversity and equal opportunities for all. Our efforts to reduce gender bias have 
resulted in increased women representation across levels and currently stand at 26%. 
Furthermore, we actively engage with local communities through various CSR initiatives, 
including employee volunteering programs and partnerships that address their specific 
needs. 
High standards of corporate governance is a fundamental building block of our business. 
We are committed to transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct at all levels. Our Board 
of Directors comprises individuals with diverse expertise and experience, ensuring a 
balanced approach to decision making. We have implemented robust risk management 
frameworks, compliance procedures, and internal controls to safeguard the interests of our 
stakeholders.
We have also conducted Materiality Assessment as per the GRI Universal Standards during 
the financial year.
Looking Ahead: 
We remain committed to the ongoing integration of ESG considerations into our business 
operations, decision-making processes, and long-term strategy. By focusing on innovation, 
collaboration, and stakeholder engagement, we are confident that we will continue to make 
meaningful contributions to a sustainable future. We are grateful for the continued support 
and trust of our stakeholders as we navigate these ESG challenges. Your partnership enables 
us to pursue our vision of responsible and impactful business practices. We look forward to 
updating you on our progress.

 At HDFC Life, the health and safety of employees is of paramount importance. The endeavor is to foster a culture 
of wellness, where the safety and well-being of the workforce is prioritized. The Company essentially is in the 
business of providing insurance and the day-to-day functioning does not involve any potentially hazardous and/
or life threatening operations. However, less frequent and unlikely events such as fire breakouts in the building

related incidents and the impact it could have, the company periodically conducts fire safety and emergency 
preparedness training and mock drills across locations.
 
 
 To ensure the overall wellbeing of the employees, the company has introduced the Click2Wellness, FitbyBit 
Challenge and Walkathon initiatives. These programmes motivate and encourage employees to strike a balance 
between their health and professional life. These initiatives are extended to employees' families as well, for free. 
 
 
 With fast-paced, modern lifestyles characterized by sudden changes and uncertainty mental wellbeing is 
important. But breaking the stigma surrounding mental health can be tough, which is why the company has 
launched multiple campaigns and organized talk shows with celebrity speakers to initiate a dialogue on this 
sensitive subject. The company has driven a clear and strong message: It's okay to not be okay. The company’s 
mental wellbeing helpline reflects the commitment to this belief.

individual making the disclosure may need to provide a statement as part of the evidence required; in such a case, the 
organization will institute protection mechanism as highlighted above. The Company will make every possible attempt 
to support and protect employees who are part of the investigation team.

Anonymous Emails or Allegations 
The Company will maintain complete confidentiality and protect the interests of the Whistle blower at all times. 
While the Company will carry out an objective and unbiased investigation process to assess the veracity of the complaint 
received, it will desist individuals from sending any frivolous, biased and unsubstantiated complaints. The Company 
will encourage the whistleblower to identify themselves while registering a complaint. In case the Whistle blower 
chooses to remain anonymous, but provides specific and credible information, such as names of alleged perpetrators, 
location and type of incident, names of other personnel aware of the issue, specific evidence, amounts involved etc. 
supporting the complaint, then based on the assessment of the information/evidence provided, the Company will 
assess the information provided and may at its discretion consider an investigation into the complaint. The Company 
will investigate the complaint when reasonable evidence and/or details on the allegations made are received from the 
Whistleblower. If emails are unsubstantiated and in spite of requests no specific and credible information is provided 
but emails persist then the sender will not be considered a whistleblower under this policy and appropriate legal 
action may be initiated against the sender of such emails on grounds of inflicting harassment and mental agony to the 
recipients of the email.

 The Business Continuity Management team operates through a standardized methodology, in-line with industry 
leading practices. The team undertakes Business Impact Analysis (BIA) activity while evaluating the processes and 
based on the disruption of services customer, financial/non-financial and regulatory impact is assessed. Basis this 
analysis, Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of business critical services are identified, which defines time within which 
services need to be made available and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is defined which provides maximum targeted 
period in which data might be lost from a technology service due to an outage or major incident. The Business 
Continuity Management team draws inferences from these analyses and devises recovery strategies for stress 
scenarios such as technology unavailability, people unavailability and site unavailability to minimize potential business 
loss. Further, resumption plans are also drafted for the identified critical business functions to ensure the resumption 
of services at minimum operating levels in case of a disaster. Additionally, the team conducts periodic drills to ensure 
effectiveness of derived recovery strategies and focus on continually improving resumption techniques basis the 
leanings from such drills. The BCM plans are tested semi-annually or annually based on criticality of the function.
