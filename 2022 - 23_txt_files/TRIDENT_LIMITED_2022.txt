carbon footprint, innovating and adapting to sustainable alternatives, Global Branding and Expanding our capabilities

Favourable Government Policies
At Trident, we have gained a competitive 
advantage through our cost-efficient 
production methods. With competitive costs 
of labour, power and raw materials, we have 
been able to offer products at a competitive 
price point without compromising on 
quality.
To further enhance our production 
capabilities, we have leveraged the Textile 
Upgradation Fund (TUF) to access advanced 
technology. This has enabled us to improve 
our efficiency, quality, and capacity, allowing 
us to meet the growing market demand.
India’s textile industry is a significant 
player in the global market, backed by 
a strong raw material base and robust 
manufacturing capabilities across the value 
chain. The sector provides employment 
to an enormous workforce of 45 million 
people. The Government of India has been 
extending strong support to the industry 
through favourable policies, incentives, 
and schemes aimed at promoting growth 
and development. 
These measures have encouraged both 
domestic and foreign investment in the 
sector, driving Trident’s expansion and 
evolution. The government has also been 
proactive in addressing various challenges 
faced by the industry, such as infrastructure 
constraints and regulatory compliance. 
Overall, the government’s commitment to 
the textile sector has been instrumental 
in boosting the sector’s competitiveness 
and strengthening its position as a global 
manufacturing hub.
India has a large and youthful population, 
which provides a vast pool of skilled and 
talented workers. The country’s workforce 
is competitive, although the cost of labour 
has been increasing in recent years due to 
various factors such as inflation, increased 
demand, and regulatory changes. Despite 
these challenges, India’s workforce remains 
one of its key strengths, with a high level of 
education and technical expertise. With a 
growing emphasis on skill development and 
vocational training programmes, India’s 
workforce is expected to become even more 
competitive in the coming years, providing 
a significant advantage for businesses 
operating in the country.
India is the largest cotton producer, and 
the quality of Indian cotton is renowned 
for its longer staple and fine texture. 
This has resulted in a surplus of cotton 
that is available for export, making India 
a significant player in the global cotton 
market. With a vast production capacity, 
India is well-positioned to meet the demand 
for cotton in various industries. The surplus 
availability of high-quality cotton has also 
contributed to the growth of the textile 
industry in India. The textile sector is one 
of the largest employers in the country 
and plays a crucial role in the country’s 
economy. The availability of quality cotton 
has helped the industry to produce high-
quality textiles that cater to both domestic 
and international markets.
India’s stable democracy and proficiency 
in global languages make it a welcoming 
environment for international businesses. 
Our country has embraced evolving 
practices that align with multinational 
corporations (MNCs), demonstrating a 
willingness to adapt to global standards. 
This, in turn, has attracted many foreign 
companies to invest in India, leading to a 
rise in collaborations and joint ventures. 
The government of India has also been 
taking various initiatives to improve the 
ease of doing business, such as simplifying 
regulations and streamlining procedures.
These measures have resulted in significant 
improvements in India’s ranking in the 
World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business 
Index in recent years. Additionally, the 
government’s policies which are aimed 
at promoting foreign investment have 
led to increased participation from 
international players in various sectors, 
including textiles. As a result, the 
country has emerged as a hub for foreign 
investment and a preferred destination for 
global companies looking to expand their 
businesses.
Trident’s emphasis on maintaining high-
quality standards and traceability of origin 
has enabled it to achieve a lower variance 
in profitability. By adopting backward 
integration with yarn, the company has 
been able to hedge against raw material 
price fluctuations, ensuring consistent 
delivery of products. Moreover, Trident’s 
commitment to maintaining high-quality 
standards has helped it to maintain 
customer loyalty and brand reputation. 
With traceability of origin, the Company is 
able to provide customers with reliable and 
transparent information about the products 
they are purchasing, thereby enhancing 
customer trust. Overall, Trident’s emphasis 
on quality, consistency, and traceability has 
helped to create a sustainable business 
model that delivers long-term value to 
customers and stakeholders.
A strong focus on the ‘Make in India’ 
aims to promote local manufacturing 
and reduce the dependence on imports. 
We have established a robust domestic 
manufacturing presence, with state-of-
the-art production facilities in Punjab 
and Madhya Pradesh. This emphasis on 
local production has also enabled us to 
offer competitive pricing for our products, 
helping us to establish a strong foothold in 
both domestic and international markets.
In addition, we have taken advantage of 
different government schemes to enhance 
our exports, including the Merchandise 
Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), which 
provides incentives for exporters. We have 
also taken advantage of the Scheme for the 
Establishment of Mega Textile Parks, which 
provides financial assistance to set up 
large-scale textile manufacturing facilities.
Trident’s competitive cost of production, 
access to advanced technology through 
TUF, and commitment to sustainability 
have given a distinctive edge in the market. 
These factors have contributed to the 
growth and expansion, both nationally and 
internationally, and have enabled us to 
maintain our position as a leading industry 
player.

Water Management
At Trident, we recognize the crucial role 
that water plays as a natural resource 
and we are committed to its conservation. 
In order to achieve this, we have invested 
in state-of-the-art wastewater treatment 
facilities that utilize the latest technology 
and have the largest capacity in the 
world. This enables us to recover water 
from waste streams and recycle it back 
to our production units, minimizing our 
dependence on natural water resources. 
Energy management
Our Company recognizes the crucial role 
of energy conservation in mitigating the 
adverse impact of global warming and 
climate change. Therefore, we place a high 
priority on implementing energy-efficient 
practices across our operations. We have 
adopted various measures to reduce our 
carbon footprint and minimize our energy 
consumption.
Trident's efficient water management 
practices have resulted in an 
impressive 95% water recovery rate,

concentration of greenhouse gases that 
contribute to climate change. Additionally, 
trees release oxygen as a byproduct of 
photosynthesis, which helps improve air 
quality and help in reduction of emissions.
We are committed to making a positive societal impact through initiatives that focus on transforming the lives of individuals and 
communities. Our efforts are geared towards several important causes that are particularly close to our hearts. We are dedicated to 
improving access to education, empowering women, promoting healthcare, creating sustainable livelihoods, supporting de-addiction 
programmes, and reducing our carbon footprint.
Uplifting the differently-abled
We are committed to uplifting differently-
abled individuals through our initiatives 
at the Takshashila Academy. Through our 
short and long-term skill development 
programmes, we have impacted the lives 
of many young people with disabilities, 
equipping them with valuable skills for a 
brighter future. 
By providing sponsored education to 900+ 
students and supplying books to 10,000+ 
children, we ensure that differently-abled 
individuals have access to quality education 
and resources. Our aim is to empower them 
with the necessary tools and knowledge to 
overcome challenges and thrive in their 
personal and professional lives. 
Empowering farmers
At Trident, we have successfully motivated 
farmers to sell their wheat straw waste, 
instead of resorting to burning it in open 
fields. By creating awareness about the 
harmful effects of burning agricultural 
waste, we have encouraged farmers 
to adopt sustainable practices that not 
only benefit the environment, but also 
contribute to their own economic well-
being. Through village cluster adoption, we 
have reached out to 200 villages, engaging 
26,500+ hectares of land in this initiative. 
By providing the necessary inputs and 
support, we have empowered farmers to 
turn their agricultural waste into a valuable 
resource, unlocking new income streams 
and promoting a cleaner and healthier 
environment for all.
Women Empowerment
We are deeply committed to women 
empowerment and have made significant 
strides in this area. Through our health 
and hygiene initiatives, we have positively 
impacted the lives of women, promoted 
their well-being and enabled them to lead 
healthier lives. Additionally, our sewing 
centres in five villages have become hubs 
of empowerment, offering handicraft 
training to women and equipping them with 
valuable skills for self-sufficiency. Through 
our Hastkala initiative, we have reached 
out to 200+ families, providing them with 
sustainable livelihood opportunities and 
fostering economic independence.
Medical facilities
We are committed to provide medical 
facilities and healthcare services to our 
community. Through our Mega Medical 
Camps and Mobile dispensaries, we have 
been able to benefit individuals, ensuring 
they have access to essential medical care. 
Our Madhuban Hospital plays a vital role in 
delivering affordable healthcare services to 
more than 18,080 families, ensuring that 
quality medical care is accessible to all. 
Additionally, we have served 13,070 patients 
by providing specialized ophthalmologist 
services, prioritizing the well-being of our 
community’s vision health.

alternatives, reducing plastic waste 
and preserving our environment. Our 
commitment extends to improving 
sanitation practices, as we have 
constructed toilets for more than 2000 
individuals, discouraging open defecation 
and promoting hygiene. Moreover, by 
providing drinking water facilities to over 
18500 people, we prioritize their health 
and well-being, ensuring access to clean 
and safe water.

Trident Limited  |  Annual Report 2022-23
Corporate Overview
in 2024 because of policy interventions by major central banks 
and declining global oil prices. 
Non-fuel commodity prices are predicted to fall by an average 
of 6.3% in 2023 expecting to feed into the existing demand and 
creating more demand, contributing to the growth of the global 
economy.3 
Strong labour markets and robust wage growth may gradually 
strengthen consumer demand, while easing supply chain 
disruptions could help cool inflation and limit the need for 
further monetary tightening measures.
Indian economic review
Despite a grim global outlook, the Indian economy recorded a 
growth of 7.2%, reveals the NSO. Banks and the corporate sector 
both displayed healthy balance sheets, indicating an elevated 
credit demand. This recovery was considerably facilitated by the 
Central Government’s significant boost in capital expenditure.
Government initiatives, including the PM Gati Shakti - National 
Master Plan, the National Monetisation Plan (NMP) and the 
Production-Linked Incentive (PLI), are expected to foster 
economic growth, going forward. The Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) has also exercised prudent and proactive measures to 
ensure financial stability and address liquidity constraints. 
Private consumption in FY23 is projected to have clocked a 
growth rate of 7.7%. The surge in private consumption has also 
fuelled production activities, leading to higher capacity utilisation 
across various sectors.4
Outlook
Strong domestic demand, rising employment indicators, 
reducing inflationary pressures, and a high corporate sector 
debt profile augur well for the domestic economy’s growth 
in the years ahead. As the current account deficit is expected 
to decrease from the beginning of the year, it would provide a 
larger safety buffer for capital expenditures, the macroeconomic 
stability is predicted to further improve in FY23 providing the 
government more flexibility in managing unforeseen risks and 
more financial resources to cover unforeseen costs.5 The trends 
suggest that India's economy is on an upward trajectory, and the 
country is well-positioned to continue its growth despite global 
turbulence.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Global economic overview
The global economy faced numerous headwinds such as 
the food and energy crises in Europe, rising inflation, tight 
financial conditions, and rising commodity prices during FY23. 
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has exacerbated the 
problem, as has the resurgence of COVID-19 in China. Muted 
consumer demand and rising prices are affecting 2023 growth 
prospects. Policy paths in major economies may diverge, leading 
to US dollar appreciation and cross-border tensions. Energy and 
food price shocks may also increase inflationary pressures.
However, the IMF’s forecast indicates that EMDEs will grow at a 
5.3% rate in 2023, reflecting the fact that the region’s economic 
challenges are starting to subside. The aim of global central 
banks is to improve sentiment while continuously monitoring 
liquidity positions. 
The proper calibration of monetary policy, the outcome of the 
war in Ukraine, and the likelihood of additional supply-side 
shocks due to the pandemic, however, will have a significant 
impact on how the world economy grows.
Outlook
Advanced economies are expected to slow down in the upcoming 
fiscal, however, a fall in inflation following a peak in 2022 and 
adjustments to initial energy crisis are expected to cause the 
global economic growth of 2.9%1 in 2023. 
This would be led by emerging economies like China and India, 
which are anticipated to have stronger growth. It is predicted 
that worldwide inflation will decline from 6.6% in 2023 to 4.3%2

Textile industry overview 
Global textile market
Global trade, supply chain digitalisation, and the growth of 
e-commerce are among the key forces determining the market’s 
growth. However, it is important to note that recent shifts in the 
market dynamics have affected certain countries, particularly 
China. As the world’s leading textile exporter, China has 
experienced a decline in trade due to heightened concerns about 
cotton sourcing, with customers becoming more cautious. This 
shift in sentiment has prompted a reduced reliance on China, 
following the US embargo on Xinjiang cotton. Consequently, it 
has created a favourable environment for other nations such as 
India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam to capitalise on the situation 
by ramping up their production and expanding exports in the 
textiles and apparels sector.	
The global textile market grew from $573.22 billion in 2022 to 
$610.91 billion in 2023, at a CAGR of 6.6%, and is projected to 
reach $755.38 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 5.5%.6
India’s textile market
The textile sector is one of the largest employers in the nation, 
employing an estimated 45 million people directly, including a 
significant percentage of women and rural residents. The value 
chain of the textile industry is complex and extends from fibre 
through ready-to-wear clothing. With a sizeable raw material 
base and manufacturing strength across its value chain, it is also 
one of the largest in the world.
Looking at the potential of the industry, the Indian government 
has launched various programmes to support domestic textile 
producers. Under the broad objectives of several government 
policy programmes, including ‘Skill India’ and ‘Make in India’, 
the government is encouraging investment in this area, which 
will generate more employment, enterprises, and chances 
for skill development. The government has launched various 
schemes such as Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector 
(SAMARTH), Amended Technology Up-gradation Fund Scheme 
(ATUFS), Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, PM Mega 
Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA), Integrated 
Processing Development Scheme (IPDS) to increase capacity, 
investments and job opportunities in the industry. 7
To boost the productivity of the sector, the central government 
increased the budget allocation of ministry of textiles from H 
3,579.61 crores in the previous fiscal to H 4,389.34 crores in the 
current fiscal in the Union Budget 2023-24. It aims to increase 
coordination between farmers, the State, and industry for input 
supply, extension services, and market links. Additionally, to 
improve credit availability for capital expenditure in the industry, 
the budget proposed allocating H 900.0 crores for the Amended 
Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS) for 2023-24 as 
opposed to H 650.0 crores for 2022-23.9
Paper industry overview
Global paper industry
Put this first -The global paper industry encountered several 
challenges during FY23, including supply chain disruptions, 
declining consumer spending and reduced demand for paper 
products. The industry faced increased environmental scrutiny 
and regulations, leading to a shift towards more sustainable 
packaging alternatives and a decline in paper usage. Moreover, 
the rising costs of raw materials, such as wood pulp and energy, 
posed significant challenges for paper manufacturers, affecting 
their profitability. The global pulp and paper market is estimated 
to be $387.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 
3.5% to $477.7 billion from 2023 to 2028.
However,the surge in demand for paper in both developed and 
emerging nations’ chemical and industrial processing industries 
will result in long-term growth. In addition, the market is 
expected to be driven by the expansion of several end-user 
industries and the expanding markets for paper and pulp in 
packaging, particularly in emerging countries.
Indian paper industry
The paper market in India expanded at a CAGR of more than 
8% during 2022 to 2027. The entire paper market is made up 
of paperboard and industrial packaging, stationery, newspaper 
print and specialty paper. Paperboard and industrial packaging 
paper and paper stationery together provided about two-thirds 
of the market share of the overall paper market among all of 
these categories. During the forecast period, it is expected that 
the paperboard and industrial packaging paper and newspaper 
print markets would account for over 70% of the total paper

Risk Management-
RISKS
MITIGATION
Policy/regulatory risk
 
Changes in existing policies 
or introduction of new policies 
may impact the business of the 
Company
The Company’s management team diligently monitors 
policy regulations and strategically formulates plans that 
align with these guidelines. It enables the Company to stay 
abreast of any changes to the regulatory landscape and 
integrate compliance measures into its business strategy.
Foreign currency risk
D
Fluctuations 
in 
foreign 
currency 
may 
impact 
the 
international businesses of the 
Company.
By keeping a close eye on currency fluctuations, the 
Company adjusts its pricing strategies accordingly 
and mitigate the impact of any adverse exchange rate 
movements. Additionally, measured hedging in foreign 
currency is also a valuable tool for the Company to manage 
foreign exchange risk.
Raw material risk
Disruptions in the day-to-day 
operations of the Company 
due to unavailability or price 
change of raw materials like 
cotton and wheat.
The Company establishes and maintains robust and 
enduring vendor relationships to ensure the timely 
availability of raw materials. By forging strong ties with 
vendors, the Company secures access to the necessary raw 
materials they need to maintain production schedules and 
meet customer demand.
Import risk
Negative impact the Company 
may face due to availability 
of cheaper foreign goods, 
resulting in decreased demand 
and lower profit margins.
The competitive edge of the Company is based on utilising 
economies of scale, advanced technology, and strategic 
partnerships with stakeholders to provide competitive 
pricing on a global scale. It also leverages the latest 
technologies to optimise its operations, reduce costs, and 
enhance customer experience.
Human resources 
The Company always puts its people first and considers its 
human capital as its most valuable asset. To boost productivity, 
Trident aims to build a workplace that is safe, open, healthy, 
progressive, and inclusive. Effective and progressive HR 
policies are in place to help recruit, retain, and develop the best 
employees. Periodically, training and development programmes 
are offered to employees to groom future leaders.
Organisational capabilities 
These include Trident's collective knowledge, skills and 
experience that have been improved through constant 
investments in knowledge management and enhancement 
practices.
Internal control systems and adequacy 
The Company has implemented internal control systems for 
financial reporting that are well-suited to its size and industry. 
These systems are designed to enhance productivity and 
efficiency across all levels of the organisation while safeguarding 
Company assets. To ensure accuracy in financial reporting 
and provide reliable operational support, the Company has 
established rigorous procedures. 
An internal team and audit committee closely monitor 
business activities and promptly report any irregularities to the 
Management Board. Based on these observations, the Company 
develops strategies to identify, assess, and mitigate risks to 
ensure smooth and sustainable growth. These internal control 
systems are crucial for maintaining transparency, preventing 
fraud, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. 
Finally, by providing robust financial reporting and operational 
support, the Company enhances stakeholder confidence, attract 
investment, and achieve long-term success in the market.

Energy & 
Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Trident is dependent on fossil fuels 
as a source of energy. The Company is 
also dependent on heavy amount of water 
intake for paper and pulp manufacturing. 
Any disruption in the supply chain of 
traditional fuel will have direct and 
significant increase in the price and could 
adversely affect the Company’s operations 
and profitability. Secondly, as climate 
change is leading to more intense weather 
events such as- heat waves, droughts, 
extreme floods and cyclones, it can 
impact the water availability at extreme 
high temperatures, forest degradation, 
and also impact the supply chain during 
extreme weather events. These events 
can have direct impact on the Company’s 
value chain operations and could lead to a 
declining revenue.
Opportunity: The Company can adapt 
to innovate processes to achieve energy 
efficiency and reduce carbon footprint 
throughout the value chain. The Company 
can explore decarbonization opportunities 
through out the value chain and develop 
products which has low/zero emissions.
The Company has implemented 
ESG principles across the business 
functions and operations and have 
undertaken some key targets under 
the pillars of Energy, Nature, Waste, 
Packaging, Transportation, Product 
use and Enterprise. Trident has 
undertaken Science Based Targets 
to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions by 2031 and become a 
Net-Zero Company 2040. Some of 
the best practices implemented 
includes- 
replacing 
coal 
with 
biomass fuel, electricity transition 
from coal-based grid supply to 
renewable purchases and PPAs, 
water conservation and recycling 
and CAPEX investment in energy 
efficient equipment.
Positive

Positive
The Company has adopted 5Rs Practice- 
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Re-engineer 
and Redesign, within its operational 
boundary. 
The 
Company 
has 
also 
invested heavily in R&D and CAPEX 
for new products (increased recycled 
material 
input), 
efficient

plastic recycling through EPR, circular 
economy (Alternative Fuels) and utilizing 
waste polyesters in process (Alternative 
Raw Material), to improve the resource-
efficiency of the Company. The Company

Value, 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Trident recognises that value, ethics 
and compliance are essential for its 
reputation and trust in the international 
and national market and society. Some 
of the potential risks that needs to be 
addressed in those areas are- Ethical 
Conduct (unethical behaviour, bribery, 
conflict of interest, and corruption), supply 
chain compliance (supplier labor practice 
and compliance), Environment Impact 
(risk of improper waste disposal, excessive 
resource consumption and pollution), 
Employee 
and 
Social 
Responsibility 
(risks related to community relationship, 
stakeholder expectation and employee 
wellbeing). Trident understands the risk 
of legal or regulatory violations or ethical 
breaches can harm the Company’s image 
and reputation.
Opportunity:  By establishing itself as 
an ethical and compliant organization, 
Trident can differentiate itself from its 
competitors and build trust and loyalty 
with its customers, attract and retain 
talent who share the Company’s values and 
vision, minimize reputational risks, reduce 
environment impact, ensure compliance 
and build transparency across value chain.
The Company has established 
Code of Conduct that outlines the 
Company values and principles. 
Trident also has various policies and 
procedures to ensure compliance 
with the applicable regulations. 
Regular 
audits, 
trainings 
and 
surveys are conducted to monitor

Yes, the business of the Company is deep routed in an agro-based economy leading to farmer prosperity. The sourcing of raw 
material is done within the proximity of its manufacturing location, boosting the local economy and support community to 
increase per capita income. The code of conduct discourages child labour, unethical practices, and forced labours, for business 
associates as a strategy of sustainable sourcing. Apart from this, Trident is also engaged in sustainable packaging solutions. 
All the sourcing of raw materials for paper manufacturing are certified sustainable by Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The 
collection of material safety certificates, declarations and code of conduct is conducted for all supplier to ensure ethical sourcing. 
	
Controllable check points have been implemented within the sourcing system and has also implemented ‘annual supplier 
audit’ for critical material procurement to evaluate availability traces of hazardous materials among the supply. Through these 
procedures, the Company has achieved around 20% raw material procurement sustainable sourcing within our manufacturing 
units.
3. 	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a)

The Company does have mechanism to reduce waste generation, increase efforts in recycling and sustainable methods for waste 
disposal; and practice 5Rs Practice- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Re-engineer and Redesign. Trident aims to seek alternatives for 
plastic waste and focus on products to help reduce plastic waste littering. Extended Producer Responsibility initiative for plastic 
packaging has been undertaken by the Company through partnership with authorized recyclers. Under this initiative the Company 
has taken EPR targets and engaged in collection and recycling of plastic waste from municipal sources. The Company has also 
installed E-waste collection centres within office and operation premises to collect, segregate and recycle the waste through 
authorized recyclers with valid certifications. The Company has also integrated zero liquid discharge systems which removes 
release of hazardous liquid waste into the environment. The manufacturing facilities use biological plant for biodegradation of 
wastewater and recover the entire wastewater. To treat other waste such as food and paper, Trident has incorporated food waste 
and other biomass waste to generate electricity at one of the manufacturing locations, through biogas plant. The Company has 
launched an innovative product to support paper packaging through “Good Paper” campaign. The product has shown significant 
reduction in reducing water intensity and reduced consumption of raw material to manufacture the product. The Company has 
also aggressively incorporated utilization of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified papers which have less carbon and water 
footprint as compared to plastic packaging products.

The Company has identified key concerns raised through engagement with marginalized stakeholders of the society who are 
majorly lack of access to quality education among children, lack of healthcare facilities among weaker sections of the society, 
limitations to the means of skill development and livelihood generation among women and lack of means to cater to the problem 
of agricultural waste among poor/ landless small farmers. The Company has taken many initiatives to address the concerns 
namely:
	
Education- Trident is supporting more than 200 children, who do not have access to education, free of cost classes at a private 
school in Punjab. To provide basic infrastructure in schools the Company has provided Ceiling Fans, Water Coolers, RO Water 
Purifiers, Almirahs, Printers etc. to 5 schools and free books and notebooks were distributed among more than 2000 children in 
Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. Extra efforts were taken by Trident to renovate High School at Fateh Nagar, to improve the quality 
of education and has impacted more than 600 children. The renovation drive also covered senior secondary government school 
at Dhaula, to improve sanitation at education centre and constructed more than five common washrooms, impacting more than 
1200 children.
	
Health & Wellness: The Company has organized three blood donation camps wherein 180 units of Blood was donated by our 
members to the local government Medical Units. Trident also addresses the SDG goal – Access to Healthcare, by providing more 
than 5100+ free of cost OPD consultation through free health camps and through partnership with hospitals. In another similar 
drive, more than 7000 beneficiaries have been reported for free OPD consultation and medicines. The medical drive is also 
accompanied by donation to tribal areas and lesser privileged members of society by giving them clothes, blankets, shoes, books 
and other necessary supplies. More than 2000 direct beneficiaries are recorded through this drive during FY 22-23.
	
Women Empowerment: As a part of CSR activity, the Company had engaged with women in rural locations through skill 
development training programs in Sewing. The free of cost training program focuses on stitching and embroidery skills to help 
develop self-help groups. The impact was created among more than 90 women. Through self-help groups, the women of rural 
areas have now been able to generate 7 lakhs+ revenue through Stitching services.
	
The Parali Solution: This initiative was undertaken to reduce the emission through paddy residue burning. Through this initiative, 
the Company assisted farmers to manage paddy residue within their manufacturing units and replace coal with alternative 
biomass fuel.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Waste management practice- The Company has adopted 5Rs Practice framework to address waste generation, namely- Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle, Re-engineer, Redesign. We are a zero liquid discharge Company, creating an impact on environment by saving 
more than 6 million liters of fresh water every day. We have also implemented optimization systems to reduce the steam and 
power consumption. Furthermore, as an effort to eliminate dependency on tradition fuels, we have started utilizing agricultural 
waste for power generation, including the utilization of daily food waste and other waste to energy conversion. This also supports 
the farmer segment from our supplier base to increase the per capita income. Our power plants are equipped with latest multi-
fuel AFBC boilers which consumes wastes such as- ETP sludge, pet-coke, cotton dust, and other agro-wastes.
	
The zero liquid discharge units generate sodium sulphate as a byproduct, which was disposed of in secured landfills earlier due to 
poor-quality material. The Company has undertaken a circular economy strategy to eliminate landfill practices. The poor-quality 
waste generated have been diverted from landfills and purified, which then got converted as a raw material for washing power 
manufacturing. More than 180 tons of material have been diverted and is expected to increase to more than 540 tons annually.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of Trident Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone Ind AS financial 
statements of Trident Limited (“the Company”), which comprise 
the Balance Sheet as at  March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Cash 
Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the 
year then ended, and notes to the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information in which are included 
the financial statements/financial information of Trident Limited 
Employee Welfare Trust which have been audited by the other 
auditor for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration 
of report of the other auditor on separate financial statements 
and on the other financial information of the Trident Limited 
Employee Welfare Trust, the aforesaid standalone Ind AS financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give 
a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting 
Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as 
amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 
March 31, 2023, and its profit including the other comprehensive 
income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year 
ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) 
specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other 
auditor in terms of their report referred to in the other Matter 
section below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone 
Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended March 
31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report.
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Valuation of raw materials inventories (Refer note 2.1(J), 2.2 and 8 to the standalone Ind AS financial statements)
The Company’s raw materials inventories primarily comprises cotton 
and fibers, yarn, dyes and chemicals and agro based products. which 
amounts to Rs. 5,631.5 million as at March 31, 2023. Raw materials 
inventories are valued at cost and net realisable value, whichever is 
lower. Raw materials inventories held for use in the production of 
inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products 
in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above 
cost. However, when a decline in the price of raw materials indicates 
that the cost of the finished products exceeds net realisable value, the 
raw materials are written down to net realisable value. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all 
estimated costs of completion and cost necessary to make the sale.
Principal audit procedures performed
•	 Obtained understanding and evaluated the design and 
implementation of controls that the Company has established 
for determining the valuation of raw materials inventories 
and tested the operating effectiveness of such controls;
•	 Read and assessed the Company’s accounting policy with 
regard to valuation of raw materials inventories and its 
compliance with applicable accounting standards
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Company is carrying certain raw materials inventories whose 
present market value is lower than the purchase cost and the 
net realisable value of the finished goods in which they will be 
incorporated are expected to be sold below purchase cost.
As a result, the management has applied judgement in determining 
the appropriate valuation of raw materials inventories, based on 
the consumption analysis of raw materials inventories, current 
market trend and future expectation of consumption for these raw 
materials inventories.
•	 For selected samples: 
	
-	 tested the accuracy of the purchase cost of raw materials 
inventories by examining supporting documents such 
as vendor contract, purchase invoices and shipping 
documents.
	
-	 in connection with valuation of raw materials inventories 
at net realisable value, we understood, tested and 
evaluated the reasonableness of judgements i.e. current 
market price, utilisation/consumption pattern, expected 
sales applied by the management in determining the net 
realisable value.
	
-	 verified that raw materials inventories are valued as per 
Company’s policy i.e. at cost and net realisable value, 
whichever is lower. 
•	 Tested appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial 
statements in respect of write-down of raw materials 
inventories to net realisable value.
Other Information 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Company’s Annual report, but does not include 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, standalone Ind AS 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is 
materially inconsistent with the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these standalone Ind AS financial statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows 
and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the 
Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone Ind AS financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Trident Limited  |  Annual Report 2022-23
Financial Statements
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management. 
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the Company of which we are the 
independent auditors to express an opinion on the standalone 
Ind AS financial statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the 
financial statements of such entities or business activities 
included in the standalone Ind AS financial statements of 
which we are the independent auditors. For Trident Limited 
Employee Welfare Trust included in the standalone Ind AS 
financial statements, which have been audited by other auditor, 
such other auditor remains responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit carried out by them. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
We did not audit the financial statements/ and other financial 
information of Trident Limited Employee Welfare Trust included 
in the accompanying standalone Ind AS financial statements of 
the Company whose financial statements and other financial 
information reflect total assets of Rs. 514.8 million as at March 
31, 2023 and the total revenues of Rs. 436.5 million and net cash 
inflow of Rs. 33.7 million for the year ended on that date. The 
financial statements and other financial information of Trident 
Limited Employee Welfare Trust have been audited by the other 
auditor whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion 
in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included 
in respect of Trident Limited Employee Welfare Trust, is based 
solely on the report of such other auditor. 
Our opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements and 
our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements below 
is not modified in respect of this matter.

in our opinion, is reasonable having regard to the size 
of the Company and the nature of its assets. Pursuant

its operations. No discrepancies of 10% or more in the aggregate for each class of inventories were noticed on such physical

companies, firms, limited liability partnerships or any other parties during the year. The Company has not made any

Central Government under section 148(1) of the Companies 
Act, 2013 related to manufacture of products. We have

Annexure “2” to the Independent Auditor’s Report 
(Referred to in paragraph (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone Ind AS financial statements of Trident Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended on that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone Ind AS financial statements based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India(“ICAI”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
Ind AS financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 
“Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, as specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to these 
standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to these standalone Ind AS financial statements 
A company's internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone Ind AS financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements  includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone Ind AS financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and, the Company has, in all 
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone Ind AS 
financial statements were operating effectively as at March 
31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note

Notes to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

NOTE 1 - CORPORATE INFORMATION
Trident Limited (“the Company”) is a public company domiciled 
in India and incorporated on April 18, 1990 under the provisions 
of the Companies Act, 1956. The name of the Company was 
changed from Abhishek Industries Limited to Trident Limited 
on April 18, 2011. The equity shares of the Company are listed 
on two stock exchanges in India i.e. National Stock Exchange 
of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited (BSE). The Company is 
engaged in manufacturing, trading and selling of Textiles (Yarn, 
Terry Towels & Bedsheets) and Paper & Chemicals.
The registered office of the Company is situated at Sanghera, 
India. The principal activities of the Company are described in 
Note 40. These standalone Ind AS financial statements were 
approved for issuance by the Board of Directors of the Company 
in their meeting held on May 24, 2023.
NOTE 2.1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A.	
Statement of compliance
	
The standalone Ind AS financial statements of the 
Company have been prepared in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 
of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time 
to time) and presentation requirements of Division II of 
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (IND AS compliant 
Schedule III), to the extent applicable.
	
Basis of preparation and presentation
	
The standalone Ind AS financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention on accrual 
basis except for following assets and liabilities which have 
been measured at fair value:
	
1.	
Derivative financial instruments
	
2.	
Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial 
instruments in Note O)
	
3.	
Defined benefit plans - plan assets are measured at fair 
value
	
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except 
where a newly issued accounting standard is initially 
adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
	
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
	
The standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company 
are presented in Indian Rupee (‘INR’) and all values are 
rounded to the nearest million with one decimal place (INR 
000,000), except when otherwise indicated.
	
New and amended standards and interpretations
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standard) Amendment Rules 2022 dated 
March 23, 2022, to amend the following Ind AS which were 
effective from April 01, 2022:
	
(i)	
Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – 
Amendments to Ind AS 37
	
An onerous contract is a contract under which the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract (i.e., the costs that the company cannot avoid 
because it has the contract) exceed the economic benefits 
expected to be received under it.
	
The amendments specify that when assessing whether 
a contract is onerous or loss-making, an entity needs to 
include costs that relate directly to a contract to provide 
goods or services including both incremental costs (e.g., the 
costs of direct labour and materials) and an allocation of 
costs directly related to contract activities (e.g., depreciation 
of equipment used to fulfil the contract and costs of contract 
management and supervision). General and administrative 
costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded 
unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty 
under the contract.
	
(ii)	 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before 
Intended Use – Amendments to Ind AS 16
	
The amendments modified paragraph 17(e) of Ind AS 16 to 
clarify that excess of net sale proceeds of items produced 
over the cost of testing, if any, shall not be recognised in 
the profit or loss but deducted from the directly attributable 
costs considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant, 
and equipment.
	
(iii)	 Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments – Fees in the ’10 per 
cent’ test for derecognition of financial liabilities
	
The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes 
when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified 
financial liability are substantially different from the terms 
of the original financial liability. These fees include only 
those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, 
including fees paid or received by either the borrower or 
lender on the other’s behalf.
	
All aforesaid amendments had no impact on the standalone 
Ind AS financial statement of the Company for the year 
ended March 31, 2023.
	
Standards notified but not yet effective
	
Recent pronouncements Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
(“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the 
existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 
31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable 
from April 1, 2023, as below:
	
(i) Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind 
AS 8
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes 
in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors. It has also been clarified 
how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to 
develop accounting estimates.  The definition of a change in 
accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of 
accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting 
estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements 
that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities 
develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require 
items in financial statements to be measured in a way that 
involves measurement uncertainty.
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 April 2023 and apply to changes in 
accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates 
that occur on or after the start of that period. 
	
The amendments are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
	
(ii) Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind 
AS 1
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting 
policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the 
requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ 
accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their 
‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how 
entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions 
about accounting policy disclosures. Accounting policy 
information, together with other information, is material 
when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions 
of primary users of general purpose financial statements.
	
The amendments to Ind AS 1 are applicable for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. Consequential 
amendments have been made in Ind AS 107. 
	
The Company is currently revisiting its accounting policy 
information disclosures to ensure consistency with the 
amended requirements.
	
(iii) Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising 
from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition 
exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to 
transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible 
temporary differences.
	
The amendments should be applied to transactions that 
occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative 
period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the 
earliest comparative period presented, a deferred tax 
assets (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) 
and a deferred tax liability should also be recognised 
for all deductible and taxable temporary differences 
associated with leases and decommissioning obligations. 
Consequential amendments have been made in Ind AS 101. 
The amendments to Ind AS 12 are applicable for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023.
	
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the 
amendments on its financial statements.
B	
Revenue recognition
	
Sale of products
	
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods is transferred to the customer on 
satisfaction of performance obligations. The Performance 
obligations as per contracts with customers are fulfilled at 
the time of dispatch or delivery of goods depending upon the 
terms agreed with customer. .
	
The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal 
in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls 
the goods before transferring them to the customer.
	
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is 
measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable 
consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. 
The transaction price of goods sold is net of variable 
considerable on account of trade discounts and rebates 
offered by the Company as part of the contract.
	
Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns and 
allowances. The Company collects goods and services tax 
on behalf of the government and therefore, these are not 
economic benefits flowing to the Company. Hence, these are 
excluded from the revenue.
	
Variable consideration includes trade discounts, volume 
rebates and incentives, etc. The Company estimates the 
variable consideration with respect to above based on 
an analysis of accumulated historical experience. The 
Company adjusts estimate of revenue at the earlier of when 
the most likely amount of consideration expected to be 
received changes or when the consideration becomes fixed.
	
The revenue in respect of duty drawback and similar other 
export benefits (Refer Note C) is recognized on post export 
basis at the rate at which the entitlements accrue and is 
included in the ‘sale of products’.

Interest Income
	
For all debt instruments measured either at amortised 
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate 
(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the 
financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, 
to the gross carrying amount of the financial assets or to the 
amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected 
cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the 
financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, 
call and similar options) but does not consider the expected 
credit losses. Interest income is included in finance income 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Dividend income
	
Dividend on financial assets is recognised when the 
Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, 
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with 
the dividend will flow to the entity, the dividend does not 
represent a recovery of part of cost of the investment and 
the amount of dividend can be measured reliably.
	
Other income
	
Insurance claims are recognised when there exists no 
significant uncertainty with regards to the amounts to be 
realized and the ultimate collection thereof.
	
Contract balances - Trade receivables
	
A trade receivable is recognised if the amount of 
consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time 
is required before payment of the consideration is due). 
Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section - 
Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent 
measurement.
C	
Government grants/subsidies
	
Government grants are recognised where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all 
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant 
relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for 
which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the 
grant relates to an asset, the government grant related to 
assets is presented by deducting the grant in arriving at the 
carrying amount of the asset.
D	
Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs include interest and amortisation of 
ancillary costs incurred in relation to borrowings. Borrowing 
costs, allocated to and utilised for qualifying assets, 
pertaining to the period from commencement of activities 
relating to construction/development of the qualifying 
assets upto the date of capitalisation of such assets are 
added to the cost of the assets. Qualifying assets is one that 
necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for 
its intended use. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the 
borrowing costs.
	
Interest revenue earned on the temporary investment of 
specific borrowings for qualifying assets pending their 
expenditure, is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible 
for capitalisation.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the period in which they are incurred.
E	
Income taxes
	
Income tax expense comprises current income tax and 
deferred tax.
	
Current tax expense for the year is ascertained on the basis 
of assessable profits computed in accordance with the 
provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The tax rates and 
tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax assets 
are generally recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
	
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which 
the liability is settled or the assets realised, based on tax 
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
	
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items that 
are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax 
are also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity respectively. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a 
taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. 
The Company shall reflect the effect of uncertainty for each 
uncertain tax treatment by using either most likely method 
or expected value method, depending on which method 
predicts better resolution of the treatment.
	
The Company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
F	
Retirement and Employee benefits
	
The Company has schemes of employees benefits such as 
Provident fund, Gratuity and Compensated absences, which 
are dealt with as under:
	
Defined Contribution
	
Provident fund is the defined contribution scheme. The 
contribution to this scheme is charged to Statement of 
Profit and Loss of the year in which contribution to such 
scheme become due and when services are rendered 
by the employees. The Company has no obligation other 
than the contribution payable to the provident fund. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme for services received 
before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized 
as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution 
due for services received before the balance sheet date, 
then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent that the 
pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future 
payment or a cash refund.
	
Defined Benefit plan
	
Gratuity liability in respect of employees of the Company 
is covered through trusts’ gratuity schemes managed by 
Life Insurance Corporation of India, SBI Life Insurance 
Company Limited, Kotak Mahindra and Bajaj Allianz. The 
cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected 
unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried 
out at each balance sheet date by an independent valuer. 
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive 
income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and 
is not reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss. Past 
service cost is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in 
the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated 
by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period 
to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit 
costs are categorised as follows:
	
•	
service cost (including current service cost, past service 
cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements);
	
•	
net interest expense or income; and
	
•	
re-measurement
	
Short-term employee benefits
	
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits 
expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered 
by employees are recognised on an undiscounted accrual 
basis during the year when the employees render the 
services. These benefits include performance incentive 
and compensated absences which are expected to occur 
within twelve months after the end of the period in which 
the employee renders the related services.
	
Long-term employee benefits
	
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur 
within twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related service are recognised as a 
liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
as at the Balance Sheet date. The cost of providing benefits 
is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each Balance 
Sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they 
occur. The Company presents the entire leave liability as 
current liability, since it does not have an unconditional right 
to defer its settlement for 12 months after the reporting 
period.
G	
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)
	
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply 
of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are 
stated in the Balance Sheet at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). 
Freehold land is not depreciated and have been measured 
at fair value at the date of transition i.e. April 01, 2015 to Ind 
AS. The Company regards the fair value as deemed cost at 
the transition date.
	
Properties in the course of construction for production, 
supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any 
recognised impairment loss. Property, plant and equipment 
except freehold land acquired before the date of transition 
to Ind AS is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses if any. Freehold land 
acquired before the date of transition to Ind AS are carried 
at deemed cost being fair value as at the date of transition

to Ind AS. Cost comprises of its purchase price including 
non-refundable duties and taxes and excluding any trade 
discount and rebates and any directly attributable costs of 
bringing the asset to it working condition and location for its 
intended use. Cost also includes professional fees and, for 
qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance 
with the Company’s accounting policy (refer note 2.1 (D)). 
Such properties are classified to the appropriate categories 
of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready 
for intended use. Depreciation of these assets commences 
when the assets are ready for their intended use.
	
The Company reviews the estimated residual values 
and expected useful lives of assets at least annually. In 
particular, the Company considers the impact of health, 
safety and environmental legislation in its assessment of 
expected useful lives and estimated residual values.
	
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of PPE is 
capitalised only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with these will flow to the Company 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Such 
cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and 
equipment. When significant parts of plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company 
depreciates them separately based on their specific useful 
lives.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of the assets 
are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
asset is derecognized.
H	
Depreciation on tangible assets
	
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost (net of amount 
received towards government grant) of an asset, or other 
amount substituted for cost, less its estimated residual 
value.
	
Depreciation on tangible property, plant and equipment 
has been provided on the straight-line method as per the 
useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013 except in respect of the following categories 
of assets, in whose case the life of the assets has been 
assessed as under based on technical advice, taking 
into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage 
of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past

When parts of an item of Property, plant and equipment 
have different useful life, they are accounted for as separate 
items (Major components) and are depreciated over the 
useful life of part or the parent asset to which it relates, 
whichever is lower.
	
When significant spare parts, stand-by equipment and 
servicing equipment have useful life of more than one 
period, they are accounted for as separate items and are 
depreciated over the useful life of such item or the parent 
asset to which it relates, whichever is lower.
I	
Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight 
line basis over the estimated useful economic life. The 
estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed 
at the end of each reporting period.
	
Development expenditures on an individual project are 
recognised as an intangible asset when the Company can 
demonstrate:
	
•	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale
	
•	
Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to 
use or sell the asset
	
•	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits
	
•	
The availability of resources to complete the asset
	
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during 
development
	
Following initial recognition of the development expenditure 
as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development 
is complete and the asset is available for use. Amortisation 
expense is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset.
	
Intangible assets are amortised on the straight-line method 
as per the useful life assessed based on expected future 
benefit, taking into account the nature of the asset and the 
estimated usage of the asset:
As per 
management 
estimate
SAP ECC 6 licences
– 10 years
SAP Hana licences
– 5 years
Other softwares and Websites
– 5 years
	
During the period of development, the asset is tested for 
impairment annually.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., at 
the date the recipient obtains control) or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition of the asset 
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. when the asset is 
derecognised.
J	
Inventories
	
Raw materials, work in progress, finished goods, process 
waste and stores and spares are valued at cost and net 
realisable value, whichever is lower. Raw materials 
inventories held for use in the production of inventories are 
not written down below cost if the finished products in which 
they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above 
cost. However, when a decline in the price of raw materials 
indicates that the cost of the finished products exceeds net 
realisable value, the raw materials are written down to 
net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated 
costs of completion and cost necessary to make the sale. 
The basis of determining cost for various categories of 
inventories is as follows:
	
–	
Raw materials: moving weighted average cost *- Cost 
includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition.
	
–	
Work in progress: cost of raw materials plus conversion 
cost depending upon the stage of completion. Cost is 
determined on a moving weighted average basis except 
for work-in-progress inventory of towel and sheeting 
divisions for which cost is determined on a monthly 
weighted average basis.
	
-	
Stock-in-trade (acquired for trading) - Cost is 
determined on a moving weighted average basis.
	
–	
Finished goods (including stock in transit): cost of 
raw materials plus conversion cost and packing cost. 
Cost is determined on a moving weighted average 
basis except for finished goods inventory of towel and 
sheeting divisions for which cost is determined on a 
monthly weighted average basis.
	
–	
Process waste is valued at net realisable value.
	
–	
Stores and spares: moving weighted average cost - 
Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition.
	
	
* Includes by products which is valued at net realisable value
K	
Impairment of Non Financial Assets
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) 
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The 
recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups 
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account, if available, 
and if no such transactions can be identified an appropriate 
valuation model is used.
	
The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed 
budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared 
separately for each of the Company’s CGU’s to which the 
individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of five years. For 
longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and 
applied to projected future cash flows after the fifth year.

Impairment losses, including impairment on inventories, 
are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that previously recognized 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have 
decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates 
the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously 
recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has 
been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, 
nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal 
is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
L	
Segment reporting
	
The Company identifies primary segments based on the 
dominant source, nature of risks and returns and the 
internal organisation and management structure. The 
operating segments are the segments for which separate 
financial information is available and for which operating 
profit/loss amounts are evaluated regularly by the chief 
operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate 
resources and in assessing performance.
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker. Chief Operating Decision Maker review 
the performance of the Company according to the nature 
of products manufactured with each segment representing 
a strategic business unit that offers different products and 
serves different markets. The analysis of geographical 
segments is based on the locations of customers.
M	
Leases
	
The Company assesses at contract inception whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for 
a period of time in exchange for consideration.
	
Company as a lessee
	
The Company applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
	
i)	
Right of use assets
	
	
The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost 
of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease 
liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives 
of the assets, as follows:
•	
Leasehold land
30 to 99 years
•	
Office premises and guest houses
5 to 20 years
•	
Factory premises (including plant & 
equipment)
10 years
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the 
Company at the end of the lease term or the cost 
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation 
is calculated using the estimated useful life of the 
asset.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section (K) 
Impairment of non-financial assets.
	
ii)	
Lease liabilities
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments are fixed payments.
	
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at 
the lease commencement date because the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest 
and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured 
if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a 
change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future 
payments resulting from a change in an index or rate 
used to determine such lease payments) or a change in 
the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying 
asset.
	
	
The Company’s lease liabilities are disclosed separately 
in the balance sheet (see Note 41).
	
iii)	 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
	
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases except in case 
of lease contracts with related parties since there 
exist economic incentive for the Company to continue 
using the leased premises for a period longer than 
the 11 months and considering the contract is with 
the related parties, it does not foresee non-renewal 
of the lease term for future periods, thus basis the 
substance and economics of the arrangements, 
management believes that under Ind AS 116, the 
lease terms in the arrangements with related parties 
have been determined considering the period for 
which management has an economic incentive to 
use the leased asset (i.e. reasonable certain to use 
the asset for the said period of economic incentive). 
Such assessment of incremental period is based on 
management assessment of various factors including 
the remaining useful life of the asset as on the date of 
transition. The management has assessed period of 
arrangements with related parties as 10 years as at 
April 01, 2019. Lease payments on short-term leases 
and leases of low-value assets are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
Company as a lessor
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are 
classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating 
lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating 
and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease 
term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents 
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are 
earned.
N	
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
	
Provisions
	
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made. Provisions are determined based on 
the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date and measured using the present value 
of cash flows estimated to settle the present obligations 
(when the effect of time value of money is material). These 
are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates.
	
Onerous contracts
	
If the Company has a contract that is onerous, the present 
obligation under the contract is recognised and measured 
as a provision. However, before a separate provision for an 
onerous contract is established, the Company recognises 
any impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated 
to that contract.
	
An onerous contract is a contract under which the 
unavoidable costs (i.e., the costs that the Company cannot 
avoid because it has the contract) of meeting the obligations 
under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to 
be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract 
reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which 
is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation 
or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.
	
Contingent liabilities
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from 
past events and the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 
enterprise. Contingent liabilities are disclosed by way of 
note to the standalone Ind AS financial statements.
	
Contingent Assets
	
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past 
events the existence of which will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise.
	
Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements.
O	
Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
	
(a)	 Financial assets
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair 
value through profit or loss.
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments 
of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI 
test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at 
fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs 
that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial 
asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at 
fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Purchases or sales of 
financial assets that require delivery of assets within a 
time frame established by regulation or convention in 
the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on 
the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Trade receivables that 
do not contain a significant financing component are 
measured transaction price.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends 
on the Company’s business model for managing the 
asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. For 
the purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in four categories:
	
	
–	
Financial 
assets 
at 
amortised 
cost 
(debt 
instruments)
	
	
–	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
	
	
–	
Financial assets designated at fair value through 
OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); 
and
	
	
–	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
	
	
A ’financial asset’ is measured at the amortised cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
	
	
a)	
The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
b)	
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is 
included in finance income in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Financial assets at FVTOCI (debt instrument)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both 
of the following criteria are met:
	
	
a)	
The objective of the business model is achieved 
both by collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling the financial assets, and
	
	
b)	
The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category 
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date 
at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in 
the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the 
Company recognizes interest income, impairment 
losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of 
the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI 
debt instrument is reported as interest income using 
the EIR method.
	
	
Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI 
(equity instruments)
	
	
In the case of equity instruments which are not held for 
trading and where the Company has taken irrevocable 
election to present the subsequent changes in fair 
value in other comprehensive income, these elected 
investments are initially measured at fair value plus 
transaction costs and subsequently, they are measured 
at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes 
in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the ‘Equity instruments through 
other comprehensive income’ under the head ‘Other 
Equity’. The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified 
to profit or loss on disposal of the investments. The 
Company makes such election on an instrument -by-
instrument basis.
	
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument 
as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in 
OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI 
to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of 
investment. However, the Company may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
A financial asset is held for trading if:
	
	
•	
it has been acquired principally for the purpose of 
selling it in the near term; or
	
	
•	
on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of 
identified financial instruments that the Company 
manages together and has a recent actual pattern 
of short-term profit-taking; or
	
	
•	
it is a derivative that is not designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument or a financial guarantee.
	
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never 
recycled to Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends 
are recognised as other income in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the right of payment has been 
established, except when the Company benefits from 
such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the 
financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded 
in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL (equity instruments)
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
are carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value with net 
changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
In case of equity instruments which are held for trading 
are initially measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs and subsequently, they are measured at fair value 
with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
This category includes derivative instruments and 
listed equity investments which the Company had not 
irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI. 
Dividends on listed equity investments are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right of 
payment has been established.
	
	
Investment in Subsidiaries and Associates
	
	
Investment in Subsidiaries and Associates is carried at 
deemed cost in the separate financial statements.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised when:
	
	
–	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
	
	
–	
The Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the 
Company has transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
The Company applies the expected credit loss model 
for recognising impairment loss on financial assets 
measured at amortised cost, debt instruments at 
FVTOCI, trade receivables and other contractual rights 
to receive cash or other financial asset.
	
	
Expected credit losses are the weighted average 
of credit losses with the respective risks of default 
occurring as the weights. Credit loss is the difference 
between all contractual cash flows that are due to the 
Company in accordance with the contract and all the 
cash flows that the Company expects to receive (i.e. 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective 
interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest 
rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired 
financial assets). The Company estimates cash flows 
by considering all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call 
and similar options) through the expected life of that 
financial instrument.
	
	
The Company measures the loss allowance for a 
financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime 
expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial 
instrument has increased significantly since initial 
recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument 
has not increased significantly since initial recognition, 
the Company measures the loss allowance for that 
financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month 
expected credit losses. 12-month expected credit 
losses are portion of the life-time expected credit 
losses and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls that 
will result if default occurs within the 12 months after 
the reporting date and thus, are not cash shortfalls that 
are predicted over the next 12 months.
	
	
For trade receivables, the Company follows “simplified 
approach for recognition of impairment loss. The 
application of simplified approach does not require the 
Company to track changes in credit risk.
	
	
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected 
credit loss allowance for trade receivables, the 
Company has used a practical expedient as permitted 
under Ind AS 109. This expected credit loss allowance is 
computed based on a provision matrix which takes into

(b)	 Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as 
appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and 
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Company’s financial liabilities 
include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings 
including derivative financial instruments.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL) include financial liabilities held for trading and 
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as 
held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose 
of repurchasing in the near term. This category also 
includes derivative financial instruments entered into 
by the Company that are not designated as hedging 
instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind 
AS 109 ‘Financial instruments’.
	
	
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (Loans and 
borrowings)
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated 
by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part 
of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This category 
generally applies to borrowings.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by 
another financial liability from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
P	
Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net 
profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year.
	
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit 
or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during 
the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
	
Treasury shares are reduced while computing basic and 
diluted earnings per share.
Q	
Operating cycle
	
Based on the nature of products/activities of the Company 
and the normal time between acquisition of assets and their 
realisation in cash or cash equivalents, the Company has 
determined its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose 
of classification of its assets and liabilities as current and 
non-current.
R	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such 
as foreign currency forward contracts and option currency 
contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks arising from 
highly probable forecast transactions. The counterparty for 
these contracts is generally a bank.
	
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
	
This category has derivative assets or liabilities which are 
not designated as hedges.
	
Although the Company believes that these derivatives 
constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may 
not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109. Any 
derivative that is either not designated a hedge, or is so 
designated but is ineffective, is recognized on balance sheet 
and measured initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, derivatives are re-measured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value being recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Derivatives are carried as financial assets 
when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities 
when the fair value is negative.
	
Hedge Accounting
	
The derivatives that are designated as hedging instrument 
under Ind AS 109 to mitigate risk arising out of foreign 
currency transactions are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges. The Company enters into hedging instruments 
in accordance with policies as approved by the Board of 
Directors with written principles which is consistent with 
the risk management strategy of the Company.
	
The hedge instruments are designated and documented as 
hedges at the inception of the contract. The effectiveness of 
hedge instruments is assessed and measured at inception 
and on an ongoing basis.
	
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair 
value of the derivative is recognized in OCI, e.g., cash flow 
hedging reserve and accumulated in the cash flow hedging 
reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value 
of the derivative is recognized immediately in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. The amount accumulated is retained in 
cash flow hedge reserve and reclassified to profit or loss in 
the same period or periods during which the hedged item 
affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. Under fair value 
hedge, the change in the fair value of a hedging instrument 
is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The 
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to 
the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of 
the hedged item and is also recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the hedging instrument is terminated 
or exercised prior to its maturity/ contractual term, 
the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the 
hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve 
until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging 
reserve is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss 
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. 
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve 
is reclassified immediately in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
S	
Fair Value Measurement
	
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value 
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption that the 
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
	
–	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
	
–	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair value, maximising the 
use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the standalone Ind AS financial statements 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:
	
-Level 1- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
-Level 2-Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
	
-Level 3-Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
standalone Ind AS financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the 
end of each reporting period.

The Company’s management determines the policies and 
procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such 
as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets 
measured at fair value, and for non-recurring measurement, 
such as assets held for disposal in discontinued operation.
	
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant 
assets, such as properties and unquoted financial assets, 
and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration, 
if any.
	
At each reporting date, the management analyses the 
movements in the values of assets and liabilities which 
are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per 
the Company’s accounting policies. For this analysis, the 
management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest 
valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation 
computation to contracts and other relevant documents.
	
The management, in conjunction with the Company’s 
external valuers, also compares the change in the fair value 
of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to 
determine whether the change is reasonable.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability 
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other 
fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.
T	
Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less, that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in value.
U	
Dividend to equity holders of the Company
	
The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity 
holders of the Company when the distribution is authorised 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the 
Company. As per the corporate laws in India a distribution 
is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders, 
However, Board of Directors of a company may declare 
interim dividend during any financial year out of the surplus 
in Statement of Profit and Loss and out of the profits of the 
financial year in which such interim dividend is sought to be 
declared. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in 
equity.
V	
Foreign exchange gains and losses
	
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is INR. 
Exchange differences are dealt with as follows:
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange 
rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of 
transaction. Monetary items denominated in a foreign 
currency are reported at the closing rate as at the date of 
balance sheet. Non-monetary items, which are carried at 
fair value denominated in foreign currency, are reported 
at the exchange rate that existed when such values were 
determined, otherwise on historical exchange rate that 
existed on the date of transaction.
	
The exchange difference arising on the settlement of 
monetary items or on reporting these items at rates different 
from the rates at which these were initially recorded/
reported in previous financial statements are recognized as 
income/expense in the period in which they arise. Further, 
where foreign currency liabilities have been incurred 
in connection with property, plant and equipment, the 
exchange differences arising on reinstatement, settlement 
thereof during the construction period are adjusted in the 
cost of the concerned property, plant and equipment to the 
extent of exchange differences arising from foreign currency 
borrowings are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs 
in accordance of para 6 (e) as per Ind AS 23.
W	
Treasury shares
	
The Company has created an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
for providing share-based payment to its employees. The 
Company uses EBT as a vehicle for distributing shares to 
employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Scheme 
2020. The EBT buys shares of the Company from the market, 
for giving shares to employees. The Company treats EBT as 
its extension and shares held by EBT are treated as treasury 
shares.
	
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury 
shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from other 
equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on 
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s 
own equity instruments. Treasury shares are reduced while 
computing basic and diluted earnings per share.
	
The Company transfers the excess of exercise price over the 
cost of acquisition of treasury shares, net of tax, by EBT to 
General Reserve.
X	
Share-based Payments
	
Employees (including senior executives) of the Company 
receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services as consideration for 
equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).
	
Equity-settled transactions
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair 
value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate 
valuation model. Further details are given in Note 43.
	
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense.
	
Service and non-market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within 
the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to 
an award, but without an associated service requirement, 
are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting 
conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and 
lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there 
are also service and/or performance conditions.
	
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest because non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met. Where awards include a 
market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the 
minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair value of 
the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms 
of the award are met. An additional expense, measured 
as at the date of modification, is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-
based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by 
the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of 
the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss.
NOTE 2.2 - KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION 
UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the 
management of the Company is required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the areas of estimation uncertainty and critical 
judgements that the management has made in the process 
of applying the Company’s accounting policies and that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
standalone Ind AS financial statements: -
Useful lives of Intangible assets
The intangible assets are amortised over the estimated useful 
life. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of 
any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective 
basis.
Useful lives of depreciable tangible assets
Management reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at 
each reporting date. As at March 31, 2023 management assessed 
that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets 
to the Company. Further, there is no significant change in the 
useful lives as compared to previous year.
Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-employment 
benefits and the present value of such obligation are determined 
using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making 
various assumptions that may differ from actual developments 
in the future. These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension 
increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation 
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly 
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are 
reviewed at each reporting date.
Fair value measurement of Land
Fair value of the Company’s land as at April 1, 2015 has 
been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out as on 
the respective date by an independent valuer not related to 
the Company. The fair value was derived using the market 
comparable approach based on recent market prices without any 
significant adjustments being made to the market observable 
data. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest 
and best use of the properties is their current use.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash 
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based 
on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at

arm’s length, for similar assets or observable market prices less 
incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use 
calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived 
from the budget for determined period and do not include 
restructuring activities that the Company is not yet committed 
to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s 
performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount 
is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model as well 
as the expected future cash-inflows, the growth rate used for 
extrapolation purposes and the impact of general economic 
environment (including competitors).
Leases - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate
The Company cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit 
in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate 
(IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest 
that the Company would have to pay to borrow over a similar 
term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain 
an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the 
Company ‘would have to pay’, which requires estimation when 
no observable rates are available or when they need to be 
adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The 
Company estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as 
market interest rates) when available.
Leases - Estimating the period of lease contracts with related 
parties
In case of lease contracts with related parties, there exist 
economic incentive for the Company to continue using the 
leased premises for a period longer than the 11 months. 
The period of expected lease in these cases is a matter of 
estimation by the management. The estimate of lease period 
impacts the recognition of ROU asset, lease liability and its 
impact of Statement of Profit and Loss. The lease terms in 
the arrangements with related parties have been determined 
considering the period for which management has an economic 
incentive to use the leased asset (i.e. reasonably certain to 
use the asset for the said period of economic incentive). Such 
assessment of incremental period is based on management 
assessment of various factors including the remaining useful 
life of the asset as on the date of transition. The management 
has assessed period of arrangements with related parties as 
higher of lease period mentioned in the agreement or 10 years 
as at April 01, 2019.
Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and 
termination options – Company as lessee
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable 
term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option 
to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or 
any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is 
reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Company has several lease contracts that include extension 
and termination options. The Company applies judgement in 
evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to 
exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it 
considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive 
for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the 
commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term 
if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that 
is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to 
exercise the option to renew or to terminate.
Valuation of raw materials inventories
At each reporting date, the management applies judgement 
in determining the appropriate valuation of raw materials 
inventories, based on the consumption analysis of raw materials 
inventories, current market trend and future expectation 
of consumption for these raw materials inventories. These 
judgements are reviewed and adjusted regularly in the light 
of market driven changes, past experience and internally 
generated information.

Defined benefit plans
Gratuity scheme
The Company has a defined gratuity plan (funded) and the Gratuity plan is governed by The Payment of Gratuity Act 1972 (“Act”).
Under the Act, employees who have completed five years of service are entitled for gratuity benefit of 15 days salary for each
completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months. The amount of benefit depends on respective employee’s salary, 
the years of employment and retirement age of the employee and the gratuity benefit is payable on termination/retirement of the 
employee. There is no maximum limit for the payment of gratuity benefit. The present value of obligation is determined based on 
an actuarial valuation as at the reporting date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The fund has the form of an irrevocable trust and it is governed by Board of Trustees. The Board of trustees is responsible for the 
administration of the plan assets and for the definition of investment strategy. The scheme is funded with qualifying insurance
policies. The Company is contributing to trusts towards the payment of premium of such gratuity schemes

(VII)	Actuarial risks
	
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed 
below:
	
	
Interest rate risk
	
	
The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined 
benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
	
Salary Inflation risk
	
	
Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.
	
	
Demographic risk
	
	
This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, withdrawal, disability 
and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and depends upon 
the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals because 
in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to a long 
service employee.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been 
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in 
calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the standalone Ind AS financial statements.

The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumption 
occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

NOTE 40 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
I	
Segment accounting policies:
a.
Product and Services from which reportable segment derive their revenues (Primary Business Segments)
Upto the previous year, the Company had identified two business segments namely Textiles (Yarn, Towel, Bedsheets) and
Paper and Chemical. During the current year, the Board of Directors has reviewed the Textiles Segment and considering the
nature and class of product included therein, has decided to present Yarn, Towel and Bedsheets as three separate business
segments instead of one Textiles business segment on the basis that such segmentation would be more useful to users of
the Company’s financial statements in terms of the requirements of Ind AS 108.
Accordingly, due to change in composition of reportable segments, as stated above, the corresponding items of segment
information for previous year have been restated and presented in these standalone Ind AS financial statements. The
Company has identified the following business segments which comprises of:
–
Yarn
–
Towel
–
Bedsheets
–
Paper and Chemicals
b.
Geographical segments (secondary business segments)
The geographical segments considered and reviewed by Chief Operating Decision Maker for disclosure are based on markets, 
broadly as under:
India
USA
Rest of the world
c.
Segment accounting policies
Segment accounting policies: In addition to the significant accounting policies applicable to the business segment as set out
in note 2, the accounting policies in relation to segment accounting are as under:
i.
Segment assets and liabilities:
Segment assets include all operating assets used by a segment and consist principally of cash, debtors, inventories, right 
of use assets and property, plant and equipment including capital work in progress, net of allowances and provisions,
which are reported as direct offset in the balance sheet. Segment liabilities include all operating liabilities and consist
principally of creditors and accrued liabilities.
ii	
Segment revenue and expenses:
Joint revenue and expenses of segments are allocated amongst them on reasonable basis. All other segment revenue 
and expenses are directly attributable to the segments.
iii	
Inter segment sales:
Inter segment sales are accounted for at cost plus appropriate margin (transfer price) and are eliminated in consolidation.
iv	
Segment results :
Segment results represent the profit before tax earned by each segment without allocation of central administration 
costs, other non operating income as well as finance costs. Operating profit amounts are evaluated regularly by the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

liabilities.
The Company had total cash outflows for leases of Rs. 65.1 million (previous year: Rs. 56.6 million). There are no future cash outflows 
relating to leases that have not yet commenced.
There are no leases having variable lease payments. The Company has not entered into any residual value contracts during the year. 
There are no sale and leaseback transactions during the year.
Extension and termination options are included in a number of leases. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of 
managing the assets used in the Company’s operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only 
by the Company and not by the respective lessor.
Payments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. The Company did not have any leases impacted by Covid-19 
related rent concession amendment.

NOTE 43 - EMPLOYEES‘ STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Board of Directors and the Shareholders of the Company have approved a Scheme called as “Trident Limited Employee Stock 
Options Scheme – 2020 (“ ESOS Scheme“) and “Trident Limited Employee Stock Purchase Scheme – 2020“ (“ ESPS Scheme“) in their 
meeting held on July 9, 2020 and May 16, 2020 respectively. Pursuant to the ESOS Scheme, the Company has constituted Trident 
Limited Employees Welfare Trust (‘Trust’) to acquire, hold and allocate/transfer equity shares of the Company to eligible employees 
(as defined in the ESOS and ESPS scheme) from time to time on the terms and conditions specified under the ESOS Scheme and ESPS 
Scheme.
The said trust had purchased, during the financial year 2020-21, Company’s equity shares aggregated to 100,000,000 equity shares 
from the secondary open market at cost of Rs. 7.50 per share for which the Company had given loan to trust amounting to Rs. 751.0 
million. The financial statements of the Trust have been included in the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company in 
accordance with the requirements of Ind AS and cost of such treasury shares has been presented as a deduction in other equity. Such 
number of equity shares (which are lying with trust) have been reduced while computing basic and diluted earnings per share.
(A)	 Trident Employees Stock Options Scheme, 2020
	
The Company had granted 66,00,000 stock options under the ESOS Scheme on November 12, 2022. Each option granted and 
vested under the Scheme shall entitle to the holder to acquire 1 equity share of Re. 1 each.

The management assessed that fair value of trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, other current 
financial assets (except derivative financial assets), short term borrowings, trade payables and other current financial liabilities 
(except derivative financial liabilities) approximate their carrying amounts largely due to short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Fair value hierarchy
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below
Level 1: ‘Quoted prices in an active market: This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are measured by reference to 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: ‘Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable. This level of hierarchy include Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and mutual funds.
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

NOTE 45 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Contd..)
Financial Risk Management Framework
The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and 
other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal 
financial assets include trade and other receivables, receivables from government authorities, security deposits and cash 
and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Company also holds investments and enters in to derivative 
transactions.
The Company’s corporate treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international 
financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Company through internal risk 
reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, 
interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The 
Company does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Chief financial officer reports quarterly to the Board of Directors of the Company for monitoring risks and reviewing policies 
implemented to mitigate risk exposures.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises when a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations to pay resulting in financial loss to the Company. 
The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where 
appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Company has also taken export credit insurance 
for mitigation of export credit risk for certain parties.
The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to Rs. 2,720.2 
million and Rs. 5,285.3 million as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Trade receivables consist of a large number 
of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. Credit risk has always been managed by the Company 
through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the 
Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business and by way of taking credit insurance against export receivables.
The following table gives details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from top one customer and top five customers 
(excluding incentives):

*Revenue from top customer amounting to Rs. 7,808.4 million (Previous year Rs. 10,900.9 million) pertains to segment in USA market
Credit Risk Exposure
The Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected loss allowance for trade receivables based on historical 
credit loss experience and adjustments for forward looking information
For Trade receivables ageing refer note 58
The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances for the year ended March 31, 2023 was Rs. 6.9 million 
(Previous year Rs.7.3 million).

(i)	
Liquidity risk management
	
	
The Company’s objective is to maintain optimum levels of liquidity to meet its cash and collateral requirements at all times.
	
	
The Chief Financial Officer of the Company is responsible for liquidity risk management and the Company has established 
an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company’s short, medium and long-term 
funding and liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate reserves, banking 
facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the 
maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Chief Financial Officer reports the same to the Board of Directors on 
quarterly basis.”
	
(ii)	 Maturities of financial liabilities
	
	
The following tables detail the Company’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with 
agreed repayment periods. The amount disclosed in the tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual

Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises two types of risk: currency risk and interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market 
risk includes loan and borrowings, lease liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The objective of market risk management 
is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Company uses 
derivatives to manage market risks. Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. 
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board of Directors and Risk Management Committee.
	
There has been no significant changes to the Company’s exposure to market risk or the methods in which they are managed or 
measured.
	
Currency Risk
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations arise. The Company’s exposure to currency risk relates primarily to the Company’s operating activities when 
transactions are denominated in a different currency from the Company’s functional currency.
	
The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 12 month 
period for hedges of forecasted sales.

For the year ended March 31, 2023, every 1 percent depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate against USD, might have 
affected the Company’s incremental margins (profit as a percentage to revenue) approximately by 0.43%. The Company’s exposure 
to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
	
Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s 
debt obligations with floating interest rates. The borrowings (excluding non convertible debentures) as at March 31, 2023 is 
Rs. 13,491.1 million (previous year Rs. 14,770.1 million) which are interest bearing and interest rates are variable.
	
Interest rate sensitivity
	
For the year ended March 31, 2023, every 1 percentage increase/decrease in weighted average bank interest rate might have 
affected the Company’s incremental margins (profit as a percentage to revenue) approximately by 0.23% (previous year 0.15%).
	
Price risk
	
The Company’s investments in other funds are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of 
the investment securities. The Company manages the price risk through diversification and by placing limits on individual and 
total equity instruments. Reports on the portfolio are submitted to the Company’s senior management on a regular basis. 
	
At the reporting date, the exposure in other funds is Rs.3.7 million (previous year Rs. 9.8 million). A decrease or increase in NAV 
of 5% could have an impact of approximately of Rs.0.2 million (previous year Rs. 0.5 million) on the profit or loss.

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
The Company uses forward currency contracts and option currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Derivative 
contracts not designated by management as hedging instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value on each reporting date. Such contracts are 
entered into for periods consistent with exposure of the underlying transactions.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments
The Company enters into hedging instruments in accordance with policies as approved by the Board of Directors with written 
principles which is consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.
Cash flow hedges
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges of forecasted hedged items in US 
dollar and Euro. These forecast transactions are highly probable.
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency sales and changes in foreign 
exchange forward rates.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is as follows:

The critical terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable forecast sale 
transactions. As a result, no hedge ineffectiveness arises requiring recognition through profit or loss.
The cash flow hedges of the forecasted sale transactions during the year ended March 31, 2023 were assessed to be highly 
effective and unrealised loss of Rs. 13.9 million (Previous year Rs. 119.9 million, with a deferred tax charge of Rs. 3.5

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of Trident Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS 
Financial Statements
Opinion	
We have audited the accompanying consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements of Trident Limited (”the Parent Company” including 
Trident Employee Welfare Trust) and its subsidiaries, (the  Parent 
Company and its subsidiaries  together  referred  to  as “the 
Group”) and the Group’s share of profit in its  associate comprising 
of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at  31st March 2023, and 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other 
Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 
and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the 
year then ended, and notes to the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred 
to as “the consolidated Ind AS financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration 
of reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements 
and on the other financial information of Trident Limited 
Employee Welfare Trust and subsidiaries, referred to in the 
Other Matters section below, the aforesaid consolidated Ind 
AS financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting 
Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as 
amended (‘Ind AS’), and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group 
and its associate as at 31 March  2023, and their consolidated 
profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their 
consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes in equity 
for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) 
specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS financial 
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group and its associate in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence 
obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred 
to in the sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Other Matters section 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. 
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements for the financial 
year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key audit 
matters to be communicated in our report.
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Valuation of raw materials inventories (Refer note 2.1(L), 2.2 and 8 to the consolidated Ind AS financial statements)
The Group’s raw materials inventories primarily comprises cotton 
and fibers, yarn, dyes and chemicals and agro based products. 
which amounts to H 5,631.5 million as at March 31, 2023. Raw 
materials inventories are valued at cost and net realisable value, 
whichever is lower. Raw materials inventories held for use in the 
production of inventories are not written down below cost if the 
finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected 
to be sold at or above cost. However, when a decline in the price 
of raw materials indicates that the cost of the finished products 
exceeds net realisable value, the raw materials are written 
down to net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of 
completion and cost necessary to make the sale.
Principal audit procedures performed
•	 Obtained understanding and evaluated the design and 
implementation of controls that the Group has established for 
determining the valuation of raw materials inventories and 
tested the operating effectiveness of such controls;
•	 Read and assessed the Group’s accounting policy with regard 
to valuation of raw materials inventories and its compliance 
with applicable accounting standards

Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Group is carrying certain raw materials inventories whose 
present market value is lower than the purchase cost and the 
net realisable value of the finished goods in which they will be 
incorporated are expected to be sold below purchase cost.
As a result, the management has applied judgement in 
determining the appropriate valuation of raw materials 
inventories, based on the consumption analysis of raw materials 
inventories, current market trend and future expectation of 
consumption for these raw materials inventories.
•	
For selected samples: 
	
-	 tested the accuracy of the purchase cost of raw materials 
inventories by examining supporting documents such 
as vendor contract, purchase invoices and shipping 
documents.
	
-	 in connection with valuation of raw materials inventories 
at net realisable value, we understood, tested and 
evaluated the reasonableness of judgements i.e. current 
market price, utilisation/consumption pattern, expected 
sales applied by the management in determining the net 
realisable value.
	
-	 verified that raw materials inventories are valued as 
per Group’s policy i.e. at cost and net realisable value, 
whichever is lower. 
•	 Tested appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial 
statements in respect of write-down of raw materials 
inventories to net realisable value.
Other Information
•	
The Parent Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Parent Company’s Annual 
Report, but does not include the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements, standalone Ind AS financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
•	
Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not  express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
•	
In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of 
our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
Other information so far as it relates to the subsidiaries, is 
traced from their financial statements audited by the other 
auditors. 
•	
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements
The Parent Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the matters stated in section  134(5) of the  Act with  respect 
to  the  preparation  and presentation of  these  consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of 
the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial 
performance 
including 
other 
comprehensive 
income, 
consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of 
changes in equity of the Group including its Associate and in 
accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors 
of the companies included in the Group and of its associate are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the 
assets of their respective entities for preventing and detecting 
frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application 
of  appropriate accounting policies;  making  judgments  and 
estimates  that  are  reasonable  and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the  consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements by the Directors of the 
Parent Company, as aforesaid. 
In preparing the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, the 
respective Management of the companies included in the Group 
and of its associate are responsible for assessing the  ability of 
the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of 
Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and of its associate are also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of their respective entities. 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Parent Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its 
associate to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group and its associate to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group and its associate of which we 
are the independent auditors to express an opinion on the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit 
of the financial statements of such entities included in the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements of which we are 
the independent auditors. For the other entities included in 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, which have 
been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Parent Company and such other entities included in the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.
Other Matters
(a)	 We did not audit the financial statements and other financial 
information of Trident Limited Employee Welfare Trust 
included in the accompanying consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements of the Group whose financial statements and 
other financial information reflect total assets of H 514.8 
million as at March 31, 2023 and the total revenues of 
H 436.5 million and net cash inflow of H 33.7 million for the 
year ended on that date. The financial statements and other 
financial information of Trident Limited Employee Welfare

relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect 
of Trident Limited Employee Welfare Trust, is based solely

information, in respect of 5 subsidiaries, whose financial

have been audited by other auditors, which financial 
statements, other financial information and auditor’s 
reports have been furnished to us by the management. Our 
opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, in 
so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included 
in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in terms 
of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it

Trident Limited  |  Annual Report 2022-23
Financial Statements
Annexure 1 to the Independent Auditor’s Report 
(Referred to in paragraph (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements of Trident Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Parent Company”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, 
we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements  of the Parent Company 
and its subsidiaries (the Parent Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as “the Group”) which are companies 
incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent Company and 
its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the respective Companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (ICAI)”. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Parent 
Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiary 
companies, which are incorporated in India, in terms of their 
reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial control 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.
Opinion
In  our opinion to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of 
the reports of the other auditors referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, the Parent Company and, its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have 
maintained, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements  and such internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated Ind AS financial statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the respective 
companies considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

NOTE 1 - CORPORATE INFORMATION
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements comprise financial 
statements of Trident Limited (the Parent Company), its 
subsidiaries (the Parent Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as "the Group") and its associate for the year ended 
March 31, 2023. The Parent Company is a public company 
domiciled in India and incorporated on April 18, 1990 under 
the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. The name of the 
Parent Company was changed from Abhishek Industries Limited 
to Trident Limited on April 18, 2011. The equity shares of the 
Parent Company are listed on two stock exchanges in India i.e. 
National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited 
(BSE). The Group and its associate is engaged in manufacturing, 
trading and selling of Textiles (Yarn, Terry Towels & Bedsheets), 
Paper & Chemicals.
The registered office of the Parent Company is situated at Sanghera, 
India. The principal activities of the Group and its associate 
are described in Note 40. These consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements were approved for issuance by the Board of Directors of 
the Parent Company in their meeting held on May 24, 2023.
NOTE 2.1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A 	
 Statement of compliance
	
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the Group 
and its associate have been prepared in accordance with 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards ) Rules, 2015 (as 
amended from time to time) and presentation requirements 
of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (IND 
AS compliant Schedule III), to the extent applicable.
	
Basis of preparation and presentation
	
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention on accrual 
basis except for following assets and liabilities which have 
been measured at fair value:
	
1. 	 Derivative financial instruments
	
2. 	 Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial 
instruments in Note Q)
	
3. 	 Defined benefit plans - plan assets are measured at 
fair value
	
	
Accounting policies have been consistently applied 
except where a newly issued accounting standard is 
initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting 
standard requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
	
	
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
	
	
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the 
Group and its associate are presented in Indian Rupee 
(INR) and all values are rounded to the nearest million 
with one decimal place (INR. 000,000), except when 
otherwise indicated.
	
	
New and amended standards and interpretations
	
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standard) Amendment Rules 2022 
dated March 23, 2022, to amend the following Ind AS 
which were effective from April 01, 2022:
	
	
(i)	
Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract 
– Amendments to Ind AS 37
	
	
	
An onerous contract is a contract under which 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations 
under the contract (i.e., the costs that the company 
cannot avoid because it has the contract) exceed 
the economic benefits expected to be received 
under it.
	
	
	
The amendments specify that when assessing 
whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, an 
entity needs to include costs that relate directly to a 
contract to provide goods or services including both 
incremental costs (e.g., the costs of direct labour 
and materials) and an allocation of costs directly 
related to contract activities (e.g., depreciation of 
equipment used to fulfil the contract and costs of 
contract management and supervision). General 
and administrative costs do not relate directly to a 
contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly 
chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.
	
	
(ii)	 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before 
Intended Use – Amendments to Ind AS 16
	
	
	
The amendments modified paragraph 17(e) of Ind AS 
16 to clarify that excess of net sale proceeds of items 
produced over the cost of testing, if any, shall not be 
recognised in the profit or loss but deducted from 
the directly attributable costs considered as part of 
cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment.
	
	
(iii)	 Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments – Fees in the 
’10 per cent’ test for derecognition of financial 
liabilities
	
	
	
The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity 
includes when assessing whether the terms of a 
new or modified financial liability are substantially 
different from the terms of the original financial 
liability. These fees include only those paid or 
received between the borrower and the lender, 
including fees paid or received by either the 
borrower or lender on the other’s behalf.
	
	
	
All aforesaid amendments had no impact on the 
standalone Ind AS financial statement of the Group 
for the year ended March 31, 2023.
	
	
Standards notified but not yet effective
	
	
Recent pronouncements Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
(“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the 
existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On 
March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment 
Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:
	
	
(i)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments 
to Ind AS 8
	
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes in accounting estimates and changes 
in accounting policies and the correction of 
errors. It has also been clarified how entities use 
measurement techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates.  The  definition of a change 
in accounting estimates has been replaced with a 
definition of accounting estimates. Under the new 
definition, accounting estimates are “monetary 
amounts in financial statements that are subject 
to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop 
accounting estimates if accounting policies require 
items in financial statements to be measured in a 
way that involves measurement uncertainty.
	
	
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023 and apply 
to changes in accounting policies and changes in 
accounting estimates that occur on or after the 
start of that period. 
	
	
	
The amendments are not expected to have 
a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements. 
	
	
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments 
to Ind AS 1
	
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ 
accounting policies and adding guidance on how 
entities apply the concept of materiality in making 
decisions about accounting policy disclosures. 
Accounting policy information, together with other 
information, is material when it can reasonably be 
expected to influence decisions of primary users of 
general purpose financial statements.
	
	
	
The amendments to Ind AS 1 are applicable for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. 
Consequential amendments have been made in 
Ind AS 107. 
	
	
	
The Group is currently revisiting its accounting 
policy 
information 
disclosures 
to 
ensure 
consistency with the amended requirements.
	
	
(iii)	 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities 
arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments 
to Ind AS 12
	
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that 
it no longer applies to transactions that give 
rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences.
	
	
	
The amendments should be applied to transactions 
that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest 
comparative period presented. In addition, at 
the beginning of the earliest comparative period 
presented, a deferred tax asset (provided that 
sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred 
tax liability should also be recognised for all 
deductible and taxable temporary differences 
associated with leases and decommissioning 
obligations. Consequential amendments have 
been made in Ind AS 101.  The amendments to Ind 
AS 12 are applicable for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 April 2023.
	
	
	
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the 
amendments on its financial statements.
B	
Principles of Consolidation
	
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements incorporate 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the Parent 
Company and its subsidiaries and associate. Control is 
achieved when the Company:
 
• 	
has power over the investee;
 
• 	
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee; and
 
• 	
has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

(All amounts In Rs. Million, unless otherwise stated)					
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee 
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one 
or more of the three elements of control listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of 
an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights 
are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not 
the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give 
it power, including:
• 	
the size of the Company's holding of voting rights relative to 
the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;
• 	
potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote 
holders or other parties;
• 	
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• 	
any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the 
Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the 
relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, 
including voting patterns at previous shareholders' meetings.
	
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company 
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the 
Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income 
and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss from the date the Company gains control until the 
date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
	
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to 
the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income 
of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company 
and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in 
the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
	
Necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with the Group's accounting policies.
	
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses, and cash flows relating to transactions between 
members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
	
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of 
subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss, Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity and Balance Sheet respectively.
	
The Ind AS financial statements of the subsidiary companies 
used in the consolidation are based on the audited financial 
statements which have been drawn upto the same reporting 
date as that of the Company i.e. March 31, 2023.
C	
Investment in associate
	
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in 
the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control over those policies.
	
The results and assets and liabilities of associate are 
incorporated in these consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements using the equity method of accounting, except 
when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified 
as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in 
accordance with Ind AS 105. Under the equity method, an 
investment in an associate is initially recognised in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter 
to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income of the associate. Distributions 
received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of 
the investment. When the Group's share of losses of an 
associate exceeds the Group's interest in that associate 
(which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, 
form part of the Group's net investment in the associate), 
the Group discontinues recognising its share of further 
losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent 
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the associate.
	
An investment in an associate is accounted for using 
the equity method from the date on which the investee 
becomes an associate. On acquisition of the investment in 
an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over 
the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as 
goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of 
the investment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the 
cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised 
directly in equity as capital reserve in the period in which the 
investment is acquired.
	
After application of the equity method of accounting, the 
Group determines whether there is any objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the net investment in 
an associate and that event (or events) has an impact on the 
estimated future cash flows from the net investment that 
can be reliably estimated. If there exists such an objective 
evidence of impairment, then it is necessary to recognise 
impairment loss with respect to the Group’s investment in 
an associate.
	
After application of the equity method, the Group determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on 
its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the 
Group determines whether there is objective evidence that 
the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such 
evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
associate and their carrying value, and then recognises the 
loss as ‘Share of (loss) of an associate’ in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
The Group discontinues the use of the equity method from 
the date when the investment ceases to be an associate, or 
when the investment is classified as held for sale. When the 
Group retains an interest in the former associate and the 
retained interest is a financial asset, the Group measures 
the retained interest at fair value at that date and the fair 
value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition in 
accordance with Ind AS 109. The difference between the 
carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity 
method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained 
interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest 
in the associate is included in the determination of the gain 
or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group 
accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the 
same basis as would be required if that associate had directly 
disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a 
gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income by that associate would be reclassified to profit 
or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, 
the Group reclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit 
or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the equity 
method is discontinued.
	
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate 
but the Group continues to use the equity method, the Group 
reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss 
that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive 
income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if 
that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the 
disposal of the related assets or liabilities.
	
When a group entity transacts with an associate of the 
Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions 
with the associate is recognised in the Group’s consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements only to the extent of interests in 
the associate that are not related to the Group.
	
The Ind AS financial statements of the associate company 
used in the consolidation are based on the unaudited 
financial statements for the period from April 1, 2022 to 
November 30, 2022 (also refer note 52).
D	
Revenue recognition
	
Sale of products
	
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods is transferred to the customer on 
satisfaction of performance obligations. The Performance 
obligations as per contracts with customers are fulfilled at 
the time of dispatch or delivery of goods depending upon the 
terms agreed with customer. .
	
The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in 
its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the 
goods before transferring them to the customer.
	
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is 
measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable 
consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. 
The transaction price of goods sold is net of variable 
considerable on account of trade discounts and rebates 
offered by the Group as part of the contract.
	
Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns and 
allowances. The Group collects goods and services tax 
on behalf of the government and therefore, these are not 
economic benefits flowing to the Group. Hence, these are 
excluded from the revenue.
	
Variable consideration includes trade discounts, volume 
rebates and incentives, etc. The Group and its associates 
estimates the variable consideration with respect to above 
based on an analysis of accumulated historical experience. 
The Group and its associates adjusts estimate of revenue at 
the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration 
expected to be received changes or when the consideration 
becomes fixed.
	
The revenue in respect of duty drawback and similar other 
export benefits (Refer Note E) is recognized on post export 
basis at the rate at which the entitlements accrue and is 
included in the 'sale of products'.
	
Interest Income
	
For all debt instruments measured either at amortised 
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate 
(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the 
financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, 
to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the 
amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the group and its associate estimates 
the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual 
terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, 
extension, call and similar options) but does not consider 
the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in 
finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Dividend income
	
Dividend on financial assets is recognised when the Group’s 
right to receive the dividends is established, it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will

Other income
	
Insurance claims are recognised when there exists no 
significant uncertainty with regards to the amounts to be 
realized and the ultimate collection thereof.
	
Contract balances - Trade receivables
	
A trade receivable is recognised if the amount of 
consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time 
is required before payment of the consideration is due). 
Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section - 
Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent 
measurement.
E	
Government grants/subsidies
	
Government grants are recognised where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all 
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant 
relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for 
which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the 
grant relates to an asset, the government grant related to 
asset is presented by deducting the grant in arriving at the 
carrying amount of the asset.
F	
Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs include interest and amortisation of 
ancillary costs incurred in relation to borrowings. Borrowing 
costs, allocated to and utilised for qualifying assets, 
pertaining to the period from commencement of activities 
relating to construction/development of the qualifying asset 
upto the date of capitalisation of such asset are added to the 
cost of the assets. Qualifying asset is one that necessarily 
takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended 
use. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences 
to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing 
costs.
	
Interest revenue earned on the temporary investment of 
specific borrowings for qualifying assets pending their 
expenditure, is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible 
for capitalisation.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the period in which they are incurred.
G	
Income taxes
	
Income tax expense comprises current income tax and 
deferred tax.
	
Current tax expense for the year is ascertained on the basis 
of assessable profits computed in accordance with the 
provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The tax rates and 
tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which those deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
	
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the 
liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates 
(and tax law) as that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
	
Current and deferred tax are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax 
are also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity respectively. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a 
taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. 
The Group shall reflect the effect of uncertainty for each 
uncertain tax treatment by using either most likely method 
or expected value method, depending on which method 
predicts better resolution of the treatment.
	
The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the 
deferred taxes assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
H	
Retirement and Employee benefits
	
The Group and its associate have schemes of employees 
benefits such as Provident fund, Gratuity and Compensated 
absences, which are dealt with as under:
	
Defined Contribution
	
Provident fund is the defined contribution scheme. The 
contribution to this scheme is charged to Statement of 
Profit and Loss of the year in which contribution to such 
scheme become due and when services are rendered by the 
employees. The Group and its associate have no obligation 
other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. If 
the contribution payable to the scheme for services received 
before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recogniszed 
as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If 
the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due 
for services received before the balance sheet date, then 
excess is recogniszed as an asset to the extent that the 
pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future 
payment or a cash refund.
	
Defined Benefit plan
	
Gratuity liability in respect of employees of the Group and 
its associate is covered through trusts’ group gratuity 
schemes managed by Life Insurance Corporation of India, 
SBI Life Insurance Company Limited, Kotak Mahindra and 
Bajaj Allianz. The cost of providing benefits is determined 
using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date by 
an independent valuer. Remeasurement gains and losses 
are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period 
in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained 
earnings and is not reclassified to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. Past service cost is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net 
interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the 
beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or 
asset. Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
	
• 	
service cost (including current service cost, past service 
cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements);
	
• 	
net interest expense or income; and
	
•	
re-measurement
	
Short-term employee benefits
	
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits 
expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered 
by employees are recognised on an undiscounted accrual 
basis during the year when the employees render the 
services. These benefits include performance incentive 
and compensated absences which are expected to occur 
within twelve months after the end of the period in which 
the employee renders the related services.
	
Long-term employee benefits
	
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur 
within twelve months after the end of the period in which the 
employee renders the related service are recognised as a 
liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
as at the Balance Sheet date. The cost of providing benefits 
is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each Balance 
Sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which 
they occur. The Group and its associate present the entire 
leave liability as current liability, since it does not have an 
unconditional right to defer its settlement for 12 months 
after the reporting period.
I	
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)
	
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply 
of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are 
stated in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). 
Freehold land is not depreciated and have been measured 
at fair value at the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. April 1, 
2015. The Group regards the fair value as deemed cost at 
the transition date.
	
Properties in the course of construction for production, 
supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any 
recognised impairment loss. Property, plant and equipment 
except freehold land acquired before the date of transition 
to Ind AS is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Freehold land 
acquired before the date of transition to Ind AS are carried 
at deemed cost being fair value as at the date of transition 
to Ind AS. Cost comprises of its purchase price including 
non-refundable duties and taxes and excluding any trade 
discount and rebates and any directly attributable costs of 
bringing the asset to it working condition and location for its 
intended use. Cost also includes professional fees and, for 
qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy (refer note 2.1 (F)). Such 
properties are classified to the appropriate categories of 
property, plant and equipment when completed and ready 
for intended use. Depreciation of these assets commences 
when the assets are ready for their intended use.
	
The Group reviews the estimated residual values and 
expected useful lives of assets at least annually. In 
particular, the Group considers the impact of health, safety 
and environmental legislation in its assessment of expected 
useful lives and estimated residual values.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of PPE is 
capitalised only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. Such cost includes 
the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment. When 
significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be 
replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately 
based on their specific useful lives.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of the assets 
are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recogniszed in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
asset is derecogniszed.

Depreciation on tangible assets
	
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost (net of amount

amount substituted for cost, less its estimated residual value.
	
Depreciation on tangible property, plant and equipment 
has been provided on the straight-line method as per the 
useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013 except in respect of the following categories 
of assets, in whose case the life of the assets has been 
assessed as under based on technical advice, taking

servicing equipment have useful life of more than one 
period, they are accounted for as separate items and are

K	
Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortiszation and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life. 
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period.
	
Development expenditures on an individual project are 
recognised as an intangible asset when the Group and its 
associate can demonstrate:
	
• 	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale
	
• 	
Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to 
use or sell the asset
	
• 	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits
	
• 	
The availability of resources to complete the asset
	
• 	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during 
development
	
	
Following initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins 
when development is complete and the asset is available 
for use. Amortisation expense is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss unless such expenditure 
forms part of carrying value of another asset.
	
	
Intangible assets are amortised on the straight-line 
method as per the useful life assessed based on 
expected future benefit, taking into account the nature 
of the asset and the estimated usage of the asset:

An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., 
at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
when the asset is derecognised.
L	
Inventories
	
Raw materials, work in progress, finished goods, process 
waste, stock in trade and stores and spares are valued 
at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower. Net 
realizable value represents the estimated selling price for 
inventories less all estimated costs of completion and cost 
necessary to make the sale. The basis of determining cost 
for various categories of inventories is as follows:
	
-	
Raw materials: moving weighted average cost *- Cost 
includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition.
	
-	
Work in progress: cost of raw materials plus conversion 
cost depending upon the stage of completion. Cost is 
determined on a moving weighted average basis except 
for work-in-progress inventory of towel and sheeting 
divisions for which cost is determined on a monthly 
weighted average basis
	
-	
Stock-in-trade (acquired for trading) - Cost is 
determined on a moving weighted average basis.
	
-	
Finished goods (including stock in transit): cost of 
raw materials plus conversion cost and packing cost. 
Cost is determined on a moving weighted average 
basis except for finished goods inventory of towel and 
sheeting divisions for which cost is determined on a 
monthly weighted average basis.
	
-	
Process waste is valued at net realizable value
	
-	
Stock in trade: weighted average cost - Cost includes 
cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition.
	
-	
Stores and spares: moving weighted average cost - 
Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition.
	
*Includes by products which is valued at net realizable value
M	
Impairment of Non Financial Assets
	
The Group and its associate assess at each reporting date 
whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing 
for an asset is required, the Group and its associate estimate 
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
(CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 
The recoverable amount is determined for an individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that 
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups 
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account, if available, 
and if no such transactions can be identified an appropriate 
valuation model is used.
	
The Group and its associate base its impairment calculation 
on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are 
prepared separately for each of the Group’s and its associate’ 
CGU’s to which the individual assets are allocated. These 
budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period 
of five years. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to projected future cash flows after 
the fifth year.
	
Impairment losses, including impairment on inventories, 
are recogniszed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that previously recogniszed 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have 
decreased. If such indication exists, the Group and its 
associate estimate the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. 
A previously recogniszed impairment loss is reversed only 
if there has been a change in the assumptions used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recogniszed. The reversal is limited 
so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed

N	
Segment reporting
The Group and its associate identify primary segments 
based on the dominant source, nature of risks and returns 
and the internal organisation and management structure. 
The operating segments are the segments for which 
separate financial information is available and for which 
operating profit/loss amounts are evaluated regularly by the 
chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate 
resources and in assessing performance.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker. Chief Operating Decision Maker review 
the performance of the Group and its associate according 
to the nature of products manufactured with each segment 
representing a strategic business unit that offers different 
products and serves different markets. The analysis 
of geographical segments is based on the locations of 
customers.
O	
Leases
The Group and its associate assess at contract inception 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group and its associate apply a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for short-
term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group 
and its associate recognise lease liabilities to make lease 
payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to 
use the underlying assets.
i)
Right of use assets
The Group and its associate recognise right-of-use 
assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the 
date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-
use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost 
of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease 
liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives 
of the assets, as follows:
•
Leasehold land                                     30 to 99 years
•
Office premises and guest houses     5 to 20 years
•
 Factory premises (including plant & equipment) 10 years
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group 
and its associate at the end of the lease term or the cost 
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is 
calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section (M) 
Impairment of non-financial assets.
ii)
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group and 
its associate recognise lease liabilities measured at the 
present value of lease payments to be made over the 
lease term. The lease payments are fixed payments.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Group and its associate use their incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement date 
because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not 
readily determinable. After the commencement date, 
the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect 
the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease 
payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of 
lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, 
a change in the lease term, a change in the lease 
payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting 
from a change in an index or rate used to determine 
such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of 
an option to purchase the underlying asset.
The Group’s lease liabilities are disclosed separately in 
the balance sheet (see Note 41).
iii)
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Group and its associate applyies the short-term 
lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases 
except in case of lease contracts with related parties 
since there exist is an economic incentive for the 
Group and its associate to continue using the leased 
premises for a period longer than the 11 months and 
considering the contract is with the related parties, 
it does not foreseeand non-renewal of the lease 
term for future periods is not foreseen, thus basis 
the substance and economics of the arrangements, 
management believes that under Ind AS 116, the 
lease terms in the arrangements with related parties 
have been determined considering the period for 
which management has an economic incentive to 
use the leased asset (i.e. reasonably certain to use 
the asset for the said period of economic incentive). 
Such assessment of incremental period is based on 
management assessment of various factors including 
the remaining useful life of the asset as on the date of 
transition. The management has assessed period of 
arrangements with related parties as 10 years as at 
April 01, 2019. Lease payments on short-term leases 
and leases of low-value assets are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group and its associate do not 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. 
Rental income from operating lease is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging 
an operating lease are added to the carrying amount 
of the leased asset and recognised over the lease 
term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent 
rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which 
they are earned.
P	
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
	
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group and its associate 
have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation in respect 
of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are 
determined based on the best estimate required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date and measured 
using the present value of cash flows estimated to settle the 
present obligations (when the effect of time value of money 
is material). These are reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Onerous contracts
If the Group and its associate has a contract that is onerous, 
the present obligation under the contract is recognised 
and measured as a provision. However, before a separate 
provision for an onerous contract is established, the Group 
and its associate recognises any impairment loss that has 
occurred on assets dedicated to that contract.
An onerous contract is a contract under which the 
unavoidable costs (i.e., the costs that the Group and its 
associate cannot avoid because it has the contract) of 
meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it. The 
unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost 
of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of 
fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from 
failure to fulfil it.
Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from 
past events and the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 
enterprise. Contingent liabilities are disclosed by way of 
note to the financial statements.
Contingent Assets
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise.
Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements.
Q	
Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
(a) 	 Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair 
value through profit or loss.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments 
of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI 
test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial 
assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified 
and measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value 
through profit or loss are expensed in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Purchases or sales of financial assets that 
require delivery of assets within a time frame established

(All amounts In Rs. Million, unless otherwise stated)					
by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular 
way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., 
the date that the Group and its associate commit to 
purchase or sell the asset. Trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component are measured 
transaction price.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends 
on the Group’s and its associate’s business model for 
managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics 
of the asset. For the purposes of subsequent 
measurement, financial assets are classified in four 
categories:
	
	
- 	
Financial 
assets 
at 
amortised 
cost 
(debt 
instruments) ;
	
	
- 	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);
	
	
- 	
Financial assets designated at fair value through 
OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses 
upon derecognition (equity instruments); and
	
	
- 	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
	
	
a) 	 The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
b) 	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is 
included in finance income in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Financial assets at FVTOCI (debt instrument)
	
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both 
of the following criteria are met:
	
	
a) 	 The objective of the business model is achieved 
both by collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling the financial assets, and
	
	
b) 	 The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category 
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date 
at fair value. Fair value movements are recogniszed in 
the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the 
Group and its associate recognize interest income, 
impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange 
gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On 
derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the 
equity to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest 
earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is 
reported as interest income using the EIR method.
	
	
Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI 
(equity instruments)
	
	
In the case of equity instruments which are not held 
for trading and where the Group and its associate have 
taken irrevocable election to present the subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, 
these elected investments are initially measured at 
fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently, 
they are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the ‘Equity 
instruments through other comprehensive income’ 
under the head 'Other Equity'. The cumulative gain 
or loss is not reclassified to Statement of Profit and 
Loss on disposal of the investments. The Group and its 
associate make such election on an instrument -by-
instrument basis.
	
	
If the Group and its associate decide to classify an equity 
instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on 
the instrument, excluding dividends, are recogniszed 
in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from 
OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of 
investment. However, the Group and its associate may 
transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
A financial asset is held for trading if:
	
	
• 	
it has been acquired principally for the purpose of 
selling it in the near term; or
	
	
• 	
on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of 
identified financial instruments that the Group and 
its associate manage together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
	
	
• 	
it is a derivative that is not designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument or a financial guarantee.
	
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never 
recycled to Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends 
are recognised as other income in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the right of payment has been 
established, except when the Group benefits from such 
proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. 
Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI 
are not subject to impairment assessment.
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL (equity instruments)
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net 
changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
In case of equity instruments which are held for trading 
are initially measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs and subsequently, they are measured at fair value 
with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
This category includes derivative instruments and 
listed equity investments which the Group had not 
irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI. 
Dividends on listed equity investments are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right of 
payment has been established.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised when:
	
	
- 	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
	
	
- 	
The Group and its associate have transferred their 
rights to receive cash flows from the asset or have 
assumed an obligation to pay the received cash 
flows in full without material delay to a third party 
under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either 
(a) the Group and its associate have transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
or (b) the Group and its associate have neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but have transferred 
control of the asset.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
The Group and its associate apply the expected credit 
loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial 
assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments 
at FVTOCI, trade receivables and other contractual 
rights to receive cash or other financial asset.
	
	
Expected credit losses are the weighted average 
of credit losses with the respective risks of default 
occurring as the weights. Credit loss is the difference 
between all contractual cash flows that are due to 
the Group and its associate in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the Group and its 
associate expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), 
discounted at the original effective interest rate (or 
credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased 
or originated credit-impaired financial assets). The 
Group and its associate estimate cash flows by 
considering all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call 
and similar options) through the expected life of that 
financial instrument.
	
	
The Group and its associate measure the loss allowance 
for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the 
lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on 
that financial instrument has increased significantly 
since initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial 
instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Group and its associate measure the 
loss allowance for that financial instrument at an 
amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. 
12-month expected credit losses are portion of the life-
time expected credit losses and represent the lifetime 
cash shortfalls that will result if default occurs within 
the 12 months after the reporting date and thus, are 
not cash shortfalls that are predicted over the next 
12 months.
	
	
For trade receivables, the Group and its associate follow 
"simplified approach for recognition of impairment 
loss. The application of simplified approach does not 
require the Group to track changes in credit risk.
	
	
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected 
credit loss allowance for trade receivables, the Group 
and its associate have used a practical expedient as 
permitted under Ind AS 109. This expected credit 
loss allowance is computed based on a provision 
matrix which takes into account historical credit 
loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking 
information.
	
(b) 	 Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or

loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as 
appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and 
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Group’s and its associate’s 
financial liabilities include trade and other payables, 
loans and borrowings including derivative financial 
instruments.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL) include financial liabilities held for trading and 
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as 
held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose 
of repurchasing in the near term. This category also 
includes derivative financial instruments entered into 
by the Group and its associate that are not designated 
as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as 
defined by Ind AS 109 ‘Financial instruments’.
	
	
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (Loans and 
borrowings)
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated 
by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part 
of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This category 
generally applies to borrowings.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by 
another financial liability from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
R	
Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net 
profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year.
	
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit 
or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during 
the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
	
Treasury shares are reduced while computing basic and 
diluted earnings per share.
S	
Operating cycle
	
Based on the nature of products/activities of the Group and 
the normal time between acquisition of assets and their 
realisation in cash or cash equivalents, the Group and its 
associate have determined its operating cycle as 12 months 
for the purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities 
as current and non-current.
T	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
The Group and its associate use derivative financial 
instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts 
and option currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency 
risks arising from highly probable forecast transactions. 
The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank.
	
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
	
This category has derivative assets or liabilities which are 
not designated as hedges.
	
Although, the Group and its associate believes that these 
derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, 
they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109. 
Any derivative that is either not designated a hedge, or is so 
designated but is ineffective, is recogniszed on balance sheet 
and measured initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, derivatives are re-measured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value being recogniszed in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Derivatives are carried as financial assets 
when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities 
when the fair value is negative.
	
Hedge Accounting
	
The derivatives that are designated as hedging instrument 
under Ind AS 109 to mitigate risk arising out of foreign 
currency transactions are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges. The Group and its associate enter into hedging 
instruments in accordance with policies as approved by 
the Board of Directors with written principles which is 
consistent with the risk management strategy of the Group 
and its associate.
	
The hedge instruments are designated and documented as 
hedges at the inception of the contract. The effectiveness of 
hedge instruments is assessed and measured at inception 
and on an ongoing basis.
	
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair 
value of the derivative is recogniszed in OCI, e.g., cash flow 
hedging reserve and accumulated in the cash flow hedging 
reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of 
the derivative is recogniszed immediately in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. The amount accumulated is retained in 
cash flow hedge reserve and reclassified to profit or loss in 
the same period or periods during which the hedged item 
affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. Under fair value 
hedge, the change in the fair value of a hedging instrument 
is recogniszed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The 
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to 
the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of 
the hedged item and is also recogniszed in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the hedging instrument is terminated 
or exercised prior to its maturity/ contractual term, 
the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recogniszed in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the 
hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve 
until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative 
gain or loss previously recogniszed in the cash flow hedging 
reserve is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss 
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. 
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve 
is reclassified immediately in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
U	
Fair Value Measurement
	
The Group and its associate measure financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives at fair value at each reporting date. Fair 
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption that the 
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
	
- In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
	
- In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group and its associate.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Group and its associate use valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair value, maximising the 
use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
- Level 2-Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable.

- Level 3-Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Group and its associate determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) 
at the end of each reporting period.
	
The Group’s and its associate’s management determines 
the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments and unquoted 
financial assets measured at fair value, and for non-
recurring measurement, such as assets held for disposal in 
discontinued operation.
	
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant 
assets, such as properties and unquoted financial assets, 
and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration, 
if any.
	
At each reporting date, the management analyses the 
movements in the values of assets and liabilities which 
are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per 
the Group’s and its associate accounting policies. For 
this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs 
applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information 
in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant 
documents.
	
The management, in conjunction with the Group’s and its 
associate’s external valuers, also compares the change in 
the fair value of each asset and liability with relevant external 
sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group and its 
associate have determined classes of assets and liabilities 
on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.
	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other 
fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.
V	
Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less, that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in value.
W	
Dividend to equity holders of the Parent Company
	
The Parent Company recognises a liability to pay dividend to 
equity holders of the Parent Company when the distribution 
is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Parent Company. As per the corporate 
laws in India a distribution is authorised when it is approved 
by the shareholders. However, Board of Directors of a 
company may declare interim dividend during any financial 
year out of the surplus in Statement of Profit and Loss and 
out of the profits of the financial year in which such interim 
dividend is sought to be declared. A corresponding amount 
is recognised directly in equity. The dividend on the shares 
held by the affiliates of the associate has been recognised 
as investment in associate with corresponding increase in 
other equity.
X	
Foreign exchange gains and losses
	
The Group’s and its associate functional and reporting 
currency is INR. Exchange differences are dealt with as 
follows:
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange 
rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of 
transaction. Monetary items denominated in a foreign 
currency are reported at the closing rate as at the date of 
balance sheet. Non-monetary items, which are carried at 
fair value denominated in foreign currency, are reported 
at the exchange rate that existed when such values were 
determined, otherwise on historical exchange rate that 
existed on the date of transaction.
	
The exchange difference arising on the settlement of 
monetary items or on reporting these items at rates different 
from the rates at which these were initially recorded/
reported in previous financial statements are recogniszed as 
income/expense in the period in which they arise. Further, 
where foreign currency liabilities have been incurred 
in connection with property, plant and equipment, the 
exchange differences arising on reinstatement, settlement 
thereof during the construction period are adjusted in the 
cost of the concerned property, plant and equipment to the 
extent of exchange differences arising from foreign currency 
borrowings are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs 
in accordance of para 6 (e) as per Ind AS 23.
Y	
Treasury shares
	
The Parent Company has created an Employee Benefit Trust 
(EBT) for providing share-based payment to its employees. 
The Parent Company uses EBT as a vehicle for distributing 
shares to employees under the Employee Stock Purchase 
Scheme 2020. The EBT buys shares of the Parent Company 
from the market, for giving shares to employees. The Parent 
Company treats EBT as its extension and shares held by 
EBT are treated as treasury shares.
	
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury 
shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from other 
equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own 
equity instruments. Treasury shares are reduced while 
computing basic and diluted earnings per share.
	
The Group transfers the excess of exercise price over the 
cost of acquisition of treasury shares, net of tax, by EBT to 
General Reserve.
Z	
Share-based Payments
	
Employees (including senior executives) of the group 
receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services as consideration for 
equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).
	
Equity-settled transactions
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by 
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model. Further details are given in 
Note 43.
	
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense.
	
Service and non-market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the group’s best estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
Market performance conditions are reflected within the 
grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an 
award, but without an associated service requirement, 
are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting 
conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and 
lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there 
are also service and/or performance conditions.
	
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest because non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met. Where awards include a 
market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the 
minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair value of 
the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms 
of the award are met. An additional expense, measured 
as at the date of modification, is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-

NOTE

KEY 
SOURCES 
OF 
ESTIMATION 
UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group and its associate accounting 
policies, the management of the Group and its associate is 
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other 
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the areas of estimation uncertainty and critical 
judgements that the management has made in the process of 
applying the Group’s and its associate’s accounting policies and 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements:-
Useful lives of Intangible assets
The intangible assets are amortised over the estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed 
at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes 
in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Useful lives of depreciable tangible assets
Management reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at 
each reporting date. As at March 31, 2023 management assessed 
that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets 
to the Group and its associate. Further, there is no significant 
change in the useful lives as compared to previous year.
Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-employment 
benefits and the present value of such obligation are determined

using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making 
various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future 
salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due 
to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, 
a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these 
assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Fair value measurement of Land
Fair value of the Group's land as at April 1, 2015 has been arrived 
at on the basis of a valuation carried out as on the respective 
date by an independent valuer not related to the Group and 
its associate. The fair value was derived using the market 
comparable approach based on recent market prices without any 
significant adjustments being made to the market observable 
data. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest 
and best use of the properties is their current use.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash 
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based 
on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted 
at arm’s length, for similar assets or observable market prices 
less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in 
use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are 
derived from the budget for the determined period and do not 
include restructuring activities that the Group and its associate 
are not yet committed to or significant future investments that 
will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. 
The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for 
the DCF model as well as the expected future cash-inflows, the 
growth rate used for extrapolation purposes and the impact of 
general economic environment (including competitors).
Leases - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate
The Group and its associate cannot readily determine the interest 
rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental 
borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the 
rate of interest that the Group and its associate would have to 
pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the 
funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-
of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore 
reflects what the Group and its associate ‘would have to pay’, which 
requires estimation when no observable rates are available or 
when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions 
of the lease. The Group and its associate estimate the IBR using 
observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available.
Leases - Estimating the period of lease contracts with related 
parties
In case of lease contracts with related parties, there exist 
economic incentive for the Group and its associate to continue 
using the leased premises for a period longer than the 11 
months. The period of expected lease in these cases is a matter 
of estimation by the management. The estimate of lease period 
impacts the recognition of ROU asset, lease liability and its 
impact of Statement of Profit and Loss. The lease terms in 
the arrangements with related parties have been determined 
considering the period for which management has an economic 
incentive to use the leased asset (i.e. reasonably certain to use the 
asset for the said period of economic incentive). Such assessment 
of incremental period is based on management assessment of 
various factors including the remaining useful life of the asset as 
on the date of transition. The management has assessed period 
of arrangements with related parties as higher of lease period 
mentioned in the agreement or 10 years as at April 01, 2019.
Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and 
termination options – Group as lessee
The Group and its associate determines the lease term as the 
non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods 
covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain 
to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group and its associate have several lease contracts that 
include extension and termination options. The Group and its 
associate apply judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably 
certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or 
terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that 
create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal 
or termination. After the commencement date, the Group and its 
associate reassess the lease term if there is a significant event 
or change in circumstances that is within their control and affect 
their ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or 
to terminate.
Valuation of raw materials inventories
At each reporting date, the management applies judgement 
in determining the appropriate valuation of raw materials 
inventories, based on the consumption analysis of raw materials 
inventories, current market trend and future expectation 
of consumption for these raw materials inventories. These 
judgements are reviewed and adjusted regularly in the light 
of market driven changes, past experience and internally 
generated information.

Defined benefit plans
	
Gratuity scheme
	
The Group has a defined gratuity plan (Funded) and the Gratuity plan is governed by The Payment of Gratuity Act 1972 (“Act”). 
Under the Act, employees who have completed five years of service are entitled for gratuity benefit of 15 days salary for each 
completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months. The amount of benefit depends on respective employee’s salary, 
the years of employment and retirement age of the employee and the gratuity benefit is payable on termination/retirement of the 
employee. There is no maximum limit for the payment of gratuity benefit. The present value of obligation is determined based on 
an actuarial valuation as at the reporting date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
	
The fund has the form of an irrevocable trust and it is governed by Board of Trustees. The Board of trustees is responsible for the 
administration of the plan assets and for the definition of investment strategy. The scheme is funded with qualifying insurance 
policies. The Group is contributing to trusts towards the payment of premium of such gratuity schemes.

(VII) Actuarial risks
	
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: 
	
	
Interest rate risk
	
	
The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined 
benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
	
Salary Inflation risk
	
	
Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.
	
	
Demographic risk
	
	
This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, withdrawal, disability 
and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and depends upon 
the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals because 
in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to a long 
service employee.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual changes in the defined benefit obligations as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumption may be correlated.
	
	
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been 
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in 
calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the standalone Ind AS financial statements.
	
	
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.
	
	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumption 
occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023	 	
	
	
	
(All amounts In Rs. Million, unless otherwise stated)	 	
	
	
	
NOTE 39 -	 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES (Contd..)
 	
* Balance is less than Rs 0.1 million, accordingly appearing as Nil. 
NOTE 40 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
I	
Segment accounting policies:
	
a.	
Product and Services from which reportable segment derive their revenues (Primary Business Segments)
	
	
Upto the previous year, the Group had identified two business segments namely Textiles (Yarn, Towel, Bedsheets) and Paper 
and chemicals. During the current year, the Board of Directors has reviewed the Textiles Segment and considering the 
nature and class of product included therein, has decided to present Yarn, Towel and Bedsheets as three separate business 
segments instead of one Textiles business segment on the basis that such segmentation would be more useful to users of 
the Group’s financial statements in terms of the requirements of Ind AS 108. 
	
	
Accordingly, due to change in composition of reportable segments, as stated above, the corresponding items of segment 
information for previous year has been restated and presented in these consolidated Ind AS financial statements.. The Group 
has identified the following business segments which comprises of:
	
	
-	
Yarn
	
	
-	
Towel
	
	
-	
Bedsheets
	
	
-	
Paper and Chemical 
	
b.	
Geographical segments (Secondary Business Segments)
	
	
The geographical segments considered and reviewed by Chief Operating Decision Maker for disclosure are based on markets, 
broadly as under:
	
	
India
	
	
USA	
	
	
Rest of the world
	
c.	
Segment accounting policies
	
	
Segment accounting policies: In addition to the significant accounting policies applicable to the business segment as set out 
in note 2,  the accounting policies in relation to segment accounting are as under:
	
	
i.	
Segment assets and liabilities:	
	
	
	
Segment assets include all operating assets used by a segment and consist principally of cash, debtors, inventories, right 
of use assets and Property, Plant and Equipment including capital work in progress, net of allowances and provisions, 
which are reported as direct offset in the balance sheet. Segment liabilities include all operating liabilities and consist 
principally of creditors and accrued liabilities.
	
	
ii	
Segment revenue and expenses:
	
	
	
Joint revenue and expenses of segments are allocated amongst them on reasonable basis. All other segment revenue 
and expenses are directly attributable to the segments.
	
	
iii	
Inter segment sales: 
	
	
	
Inter segment sales are accounted for at cost plus appropriate margin (transfer price) and are eliminated in consolidation.
	
	
iv	
Segment results :	
	
	
	
Segment results represent the profit before tax earned by each segment without allocation of central administration 
costs, other non operating income as well as finance costs. Operating profit amounts are evaluated regularly by the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

NOTE 41 - LEASES
The Group has lease contracts for various land, office premises, guest houses and factory premises (including plant and 
equipment).  Leases of office premises, guest houses and factory premises (including plant and equipment) generally have 
lease terms ranging from 11 months to 20 years and leases of lands generally have lease terms between 30-99 years.  The 
Group’s obligations under its leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets. Generally, the Group is restricted from 
assigning and subleasing the leased assets. There are several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. 
The Group also has certain leases of office premises and guest houses with lease terms of 12 months or less. The Group applies the 
‘short-term lease’ recognition exemptions for these leases.

Extension and termination options are included in a number of  leases. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of 
managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by 
the Company and not by the respective lessor.							
Payments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.The Group did not have any leases impacted by Covid-19 related 
rent concession amendment.

NOTE 43 -EMPLOYEES' STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Board of Directors and the Shareholders of the Parent Company have approved a Scheme called as “Trident Limited Employee 
Stock Options Scheme – 2020 (“ ESOS Scheme“) and “Trident Limited Employee Stock Purchase Scheme – 2020“ (“ ESPS Scheme“) in 
their meeting held on July 9, 2020 and May 16, 2020 respectively. Pursuant to the ESOS Scheme, the Parent Company has constituted 
TridentLimited Employees Welfare Trust (‘Trust’) to acquire, hold and allocate/transfer equity shares of the Parent Company to eligible 
employees (as defined in the ESOS and ESPS scheme) from time to time on the terms and conditions specified under the ESOS 
Scheme and ESPS Scheme.
The said trust had purchased, during the financial year 2020-21, Parent Company’s equity shares aggregated to 100,000,000 equity 
shares from the secondary open market at cost of Rs. 7.50 per share for which the Company had given loan to trust amounting to Rs. 
751.0 million. The financial statements of the Trust have been included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the Group 
in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS and cost of such treasury shares has been presented as a deduction in other equity. 
Such number of equity shares (which are lying with trust) have been reduced while computing basic and diluted earnings per share.
(A)	 Trident Employees Stock Options Scheme, 2020
The Parent Company had granted 66,00,000 stock options under the ESOS Scheme on November 12, 2022. Each option granted 
and vested under the Scheme shall entitle to the holder to acquire 1 equity share of Re. 1 each.

18,293,707 shares and proceeds from transfer of shares has been utilised for the repayment of loan to the Parent Company.
	
Based on approval of NRC, for remaining 62,328,640 Equity Shares, the Parent Company is seeking approval of shareholders of 
the Parent Company for implementation of Trident Limited General Employee Benefits Scheme – 2023 by transferring remaining 
shares from Trident Limited Employee Stock Purchase Scheme – 2020 to Trident Limited General Employee Benefits Scheme – 
2023 . The Parent Company has also obtained expert opinion on compliance in this regard.

* Investment in note 4 (a) represents investments in equity shares of associate which are carried at cost and hence were not required to be disclosed as per Ind AS 
107 “Financial Instruments Disclosures”. Hence, the same have been excluded from the above table.
The management assessed that fair value of trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, other current financial 
assets (except derivative financial assets), short term borrowings, trade payables and other current financial liabilities (except 
derivative financial liabilities) approximate their carrying amounts largely due to short-term maturities of these instruments.	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Fair value hierarchy
	
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to 
Level 3, as described below
	
Level 1: Quoted prices in an active market: This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. This level 
of hierarchy include Group’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and mutual funds.
	
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

Financial Risk Management Framework
	
The Group's principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and other 
payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group's principal financial assets 
include trade and other receivables, receivables from government authorities, security deposits and cash and cash equivalents 
that derive directly from its operations. The Group also holds investments and enters in to derivative transactions.
	
The Group's corporate treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international 
financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports 
which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, interest rate 
risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
	
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The 
Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
	
The Chief financial officer reports quarterly to the Board of Directors of the Group for monitoring risks and reviewing policies 
implemented to mitigate risk exposures.		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Credit risk
	
Credit risk arises when a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations to pay resulting in financial loss to the Group. The 
Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy  counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, 
as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group has also taken export credit insurance for mitigation 
of export credit risk for certain parties.
	
The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to  Rs. 2,765.4 
million and Rs. 5,252.6 million as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Trade receivables consist of a large number 
of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. Credit risk has always been managed by the Group 
through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the 
Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business and by way of taking letter of credit, credit insurance against export 
receivables.	
	
The following table gives details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from top one customer and top five customers 
(excluding incentives):

Credit Risk Exposure
	
The Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected loss allowance for trade receivables based on historical 
credit loss experience and adjustments for forward looking information

In case of its non-current financial assets i.e. other Incentive receivables from Government authorities, the Group has computed 
the expected loss allowance based on its expection of time period involved in realisation of cash flows, The allowance for lifetime 
expected credit loss on non-current financial assets is Rs. Nil (Previous year Rs. Nil) . The following is the movement in the 
expected credit loss allowance.
	
For Trade receivables ageing refer note 57
	
The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances for the year ended March 31, 2023 was Rs. 13 million 
(Previous year Rs. 7.3 million).
	
Liquidity risk
	
(i)	
Liquidity risk management
	
	
The Group's objective is to maintain optimum levels of liquidity to meet its cash and collateral requirements at all times.
	
	
The Chief Financial Officer of the Parent Company is responsible for liquidity risk management and the Group has established 
an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term 
funding and liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed by adequate reserves, banking facilities and 
reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity 
profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Chief Financial Officer of the Parent Company reports the same to the Board of 
Directors on quarterly basis.
	
(ii)	 Maturities of financial liabilities
	
	
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed 
repayment periods. The amount disclosed in the tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual cash 
flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both 
interest and principal cash flows.

Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises two types of risk: currency risk and interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk 
includes loan and borrowings, lease liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Group uses derivatives 
to manage market risks. Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. All such 
transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board of Directors and Risk Management Committee.	
	
There has been no significant changes to the Group’s exposure to market risk or the methods in which they are managed or 
measured.

Currency Risk
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations arise. The Group's exposure to currency risk relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities and borrowings 
when transactions are denominated in a different currency from the Company's functional currency.
	
The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 12 month 
period for hedges of forecasted sales.
	
Foreign currency rate sensitivity
	
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the 
reporting period are as follows.

Of the above foreign currency exposures, the following exposures are not hedged by a derivative.
	
For the year ended March 31, 2023, every 1 percent depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate against USD, might have 
affected the Group's incremental margins (profit as a percentage to revenue) approximately by 0.44%. The Group's exposure to 
foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
NOTE 45 - Financial Instruments (Contd..)
	
Foreign Currency Sensitivity
	
Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s debt 
obligations with floating interest rates. The borrowings (excluding non convertible debentures) as at March 31, 2023 is Rs 13,491.1 
million (previous year Rs. 14,770.1 million) which are interest bearing and interest rates are variable.
	
Interest rate sensitivity
	
For the year ended March 31, 2023, every 1 percentage increase/decrease in weighted average bank interest rate might have 
affected the Group's incremental margins (profit as a percentage to revenue) approximately by 0.23% (previous year 0.15%).	
	
Price risk
	
The Group’s investments in other funds are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of 
the investment securities. The Group manages the price risk through diversification and by placing limits on individual and total 
equity instruments. Reports on the portfolio are submitted to the Group’s senior management on a regular basis.
	
At the reporting date, the exposure in other funds is Rs. 3.7 million (previous year Rs. 9.8 million). A decrease or increase in NAV 
of 5% could have an impact of approximately of Rs. 0.2 million (previous year Rs. 0.5 million) on the profit or loss.
	
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
	
The Parent Company uses forward currency contracts and option currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Derivative 
contracts not designated by management as hedging instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value on each reporting date. Such contracts are 
entered into for periods consistent with exposure of the underlying transactions.
	
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments
	
The Parent Company enters into hedging instruments in accordance with policies as approved by the Board of Directors with 
written principles which is consistent with the risk management strategy of the Parent Company.
	
Cash flow hedges
	
Foreign currency risk
	
Foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges of forecasted hedged items in US 
dollar and Euro. These forecast transactions are highly probable.
	
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency sales and changes in foreign 
exchange forward rates.
	
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is as follows:

The critical terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable forecast sale 
transactions. As a result, no hedge ineffectiveness arises requiring recognition through profit or loss.
	
The cash flow hedges of the forecasted sale transactions during the year ended 31 March 2023 were assessed to be highly 
effective and unrealised loss of Rs. 13.9 million (Previous year Rs. 119.9 million, with a deferred tax charge of Rs. 3.5 million 
(Previous year Rs. 30.2 million) relating to the hedging instruments, is included in other comprehensive income.
