Climate Risk
Crop Failure
Risk
It has direct impact on the 
business. Borrowers are 
unable to repay the loan 
amount due to natural 
hazards like flood, draught, 
irregular rainfall etc.
There are targets for banks 
for the priority sector. Hence 
these risks cannot be 
eliminated. However, with 
proper product composition, 
portfolio mix, geographic 
diversification, support from 
the government, risk can be 
mitigated to certain extend.
Negative
2
Climate Change
Credit Risk
Risk
Credit Risk due to climate 
change can emerge from 
exposures to units having 
high carbon emission, units 
following technologies 
which fails to shift and 
comply with ESG guidelines. 
Further collapse of real 
estate prices due to natural 
hazards will have serious 
impact leading to higher 
LGD when impairment 
happens.
As a policy matter, to 
reduce the greenhouse 
effect, the Bank does 
not finance borrowers 
for setting up new units 
producing/consuming 
Ozone Depleting Substances 
(ODS) and small/medium 
scale units engaged 
in the manufacturing 
of aerosol units using 
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)

Climate Risk Change 
– Market Risk
Risk
Reduction in financial 
asset values including the 
potential to trigger large, 
sudden and negative price 
adjustments where climate 
risk is not yet incorporated 
into prices.
Climate risk could also 
lead to a breakdown in 
correlation between assets 
or a change in market 
liquidity for particular 
assets, undermining risk 
management assumptions.
As part of addressing 
climate related financial risk, 
Bank has enhanced stress 
testing methodologies to 
assess the likely impact on 
Bank’s NII and CRAR.
Bank has also adopted 
computation of Pillar 2 
capital towards climate 
related financial risks and 
the same is incorporated in 
Bank’s ICAAP Policy. 
Negative

Climate Risk Change 
– Liquidity Risk
Risk
Bank’s access to stable 
sources of funding could 
be reduced as market 
conditions change. Climate 
risk drivers may cause 
Bank’s counterparties to 
draw down on deposits and 
credit lines.
Govt of India directives 
indicate that sovereign 
green bonds will be 
eligible for SLR and repo 
transactions and are 
tradable. These measures 
will help to maintain liquidity 
and enable trading of 
these bonds. Bank can 
participate in Green bond 
issues and mitigate the risk 
of liquidity and erosion in its 
market value as the trading 
volumes build up going 
forward.
Negative.
Opportunity Facilitating Bank's to garner 
Green Deposits which shall 
be used to finance nine 
specified sectors as per RBI 
recent directives.
The RBI regulated entities 
have been told to put in 
place a comprehensive 
Board-approved policy on 
green deposits, laying down 
all aspects in detail for the 
issuance and allocation 
of such deposits. The 
same shall support Bank 
in addressing liquidity 
concerns to a certain extent. 
The same will be taken up in 
due course.
