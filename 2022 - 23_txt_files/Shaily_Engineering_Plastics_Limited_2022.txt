Once the wastewater is treated at Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and is recycled, it serves specific purposes within the plant 
premises. The treated water used for two purposes mainly:
Gardening: The recycled water is used for the development and maintenance of green areas within the plant premises. This 
includes watering plants in the gardens and promoting a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to green landscaping.
Flushing: After undergoing necessary treatment, the treated water is also used for flushing purposes. This ensures that treated 
water from the STP is effectively utilized, minimizing the need for additional freshwater resources for flushing toilets and other 
sanitation facilities within the plant.
