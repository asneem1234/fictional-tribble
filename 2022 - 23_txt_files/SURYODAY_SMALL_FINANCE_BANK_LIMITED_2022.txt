Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement 
of this disclosure)
ESG with for a clearer, transparent and deeper connect.
The more we delve on ESG, the more it becomes clear that this path is not a 
question of choice, but an integral part of our existence. However small or 
miniscule the immediate results might seem, as a responsible entity and an 
active participant in the financial ecosystem, we are embarking on this journey. 
We are committed to taking steps that will help address the issues faced (as it 
relates to climate change, for example) and to making significant progress for a 
better tomorrow. 
We have taken certain initial steps such as digitization of processes in an effort 
to eliminate the use of paper, encouraging the use of sustainable glass bottles 
instead of plastic bottles, etc.
We are in the process of establishing a formal structure, charter and policies to 
integrate ESG aspects into our mainstream activities not just as compliances 
accomplished, but to ingrain the principles in the way we conduct our operations.

Health Interventions with focus on women and adolescent girls “Spandan” 
• • • Key focus areas are anemia , reproductive and menstrual health, seasonal 
infections, eye care and Osteoporosis. Tie up with Public Health Centers 
for medicine distribution for ailments identified during health check ups On 
menstrual health - low cost Sanitary napkins made available to the community 
by creating a distribution network.
Despite of several government initiatives and programs many low- income 
households are still not aware about their basic health parameters and this is 
very crucial for them. Many low- income households work as informal workers 
and daily wage earners – ill health means loss of income and sometimes 
are even forced to take loans to meet daily expenses – these further pushes 
them to cycle of poverty. Hence, along with the Financial Education program 
embedding health awareness is essential. This has a direct impact on their 
financial condition. 
The program aims to improve access to information on health and 
linkages to services that will give people more control over their own 
health and wellbeing.
