We serve the low-income and underserved segments of the population in India, primarily in rural and semi-
urban areas, providing micro loans to support income-generation activities that empower individuals and 
communities. Our borrowers under the Joint Liability Group (JLG) products are all women and they often lack 
access to traditional banking services. These small loans help women entrepreneurs dream of a better life 
for their families and themselves while giving a steady drift to help them soar higher in their entrepreneurial 
flight. Our loans have a one-to-two-year tenure and are provided for purposes like agriculture, handlooms & 
handicrafts, cattle raring, cottage industries & micro entrepreneurial ventures like tailoring, grocery stores 
etc., education and healthcare.

1
Climate 
Change & 
environmental 
sustainability
Opportunity Embracing sustainable solutions and 
conducting awareness sessions to educate 
individuals about their carbon footprint may 
conserve natural resources and yield cost 
savings. Additionally, the organization may 
extend support to critical social issues such 
as education promotion. One of the ways in 
which Spandana may contribute to improving 
livelihoods is through promotion of Solar energy. 
Small solar appliances like solar lights, cook 
stoves etc., empower women by providing 
clean and reliable and non-pollutive appliances. 
It may enhance their lives through improved 
lighting, communication, and connectivity.
NA
Positive: Spandana 
has the potential to 
contribute significantly to 
sustainability by financing 
green initiatives, promoting 
sustainable business 
practices, conducting 
impact assessments, 
providing sustainability-
focused financial 
education, and fostering 
collaboration with relevant 
stakeholders.
2
Financial 
literacy
Opportunity Financial literacy is crucial as it enables 
informed decision-making, responsible 
borrowing, business development, economic 
empowerment, risk management, and stronger 
client-provider relationships. It equips clients 
with the knowledge to manage their finances 
effectively, make informed investment choices, 
and avoid over-indebtedness. Financially 
literate clients can develop essential financial 
management skills, run businesses more 
efficiently, and work towards long-term 
success. They understand the importance of 
saving, investing, and building assets, leading 
to economic stability and improved livelihoods. 
Financial literacy helps clients assess and 
manage financial risks, protecting them from 
fraudulent practices and predatory lending. 
Moreover, it fosters better communication, 
trust, and satisfaction between microfinancing 
companies and clients. In summary, financial 
literacy is vital for microfinancing companies 
as it empowers clients, promotes responsible 
practices, and strengthens the overall 
microfinance ecosystem.
NA
Positive:
- The company actively 
engages in social 
initiatives, gaining 
valuable insights into 
the realities faced by the 
broader community.
- By offering financial 
literacy programs, the 
company supports and 
empowers marginalized 
individuals.
- The company contributes 
to inclusive wealth 
creation, benefiting a 
wide range of people 
predominantly from the 
bottom of the societal 
pyramid.
3
Community & 
social impact
Opportunity Spandana has steadfastly embraced its 
commitment to upholding Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) principles since its 
inception. Primary focus has been recognizing 
and aiding individuals and communities 
who are vulnerable, disadvantaged, or 
marginalized. By undertaking diverse CSR 
initiatives, the company strives to conceive 
and execute projects that actively contribute 
to the betterment of these underprivileged and 
marginalized sections of society. In pursuit of 
our mission to be one of the most significant 
microfinance service providers in the country 
by offering a range of financial and non-
financial products and services to low-income 
households and individuals to improve their 
quality of life, we constantly endeavor to deliver 
quality services at the doorstep of our clients 
by maintaining highest levels of transparency 
and integrity. In the process we strive to be a 
responsive corporate citizen in the community 
we serve. It is therefore a conscious strategy to 
design and implement various programs that 
leave a lasting impact on the society.
NA
Positive: Our unwavering 
commitment lies in 
effecting meaningful 
change in the lives of 
the marginalized and 
vulnerable, with supporting 
CSR initiatives serving as 
another strong pillar of 
this endeavor. Through 
active engagement in these 
endeavors, our objective 
is to generate a positive 
influence and contribute 
to the advancement of 
society’s well-being.

We analyze customer complaints/interactions to improve our services. This analysis not only identifies the underlying

risks in consultation with its relevant stakeholders. Additionally, the Company acknowledges that it is in a learning 
phase regarding various evolving aspects, making stakeholder interactions crucial. To gain a deeper understanding 
of stakeholder expectations, the Company actively seeks engagement with consultants and experts in the field. 
These interactions prove valuable in aligning the Company’s practices with stakeholder expectations and driving 
continuous improvement. Our business model involves regular client interactions through our empowered field force,

loan products and client-centric approach, we endeavor to strengthen the socio-economic wellbeing of low-income 
households by providing finance that is sustainable for the borrowers and helps improve livelihoods. We have initiated

have successfully become self-employed. In addition, we have also provided financial and digital literacy training 
to more than 50,000 women during the year. We constantly endeavor to deliver quality services to our clients and 
remunerative returns to our Investors by maintaining highest levels of transparency and integrity. In the process we 
strive to be a responsive corporate citizen in the community we serve. It is therefore a conscious strategy to design 
and implement various programs making a lasting impact on the society.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
We are committed to minimizing waste and maximizing our recycling efforts. Though minimal, our waste streams 
primarily consist of food waste, paper waste, plastic waste, and e-waste. In our efforts to curb the generation of plastic 
waste, we actively encourage our employees to utilize glass/metal bottles at our office premises, thereby reducing 
the number of discarded plastic bottles. Furthermore, we encourage use of biodegradable plastic garbage bags for 
the collection and disposal of both dry and wet waste.
To reduce paper consumption, we are digitizing our processes, significantly reducing our reliance on paper. Ongoing 
initiatives focus on further minimizing paper usage across all our offices. Additionally, we have discontinued the use 
of paper-based office stationery, except for essential items.
As part of our e-waste management strategy, we responsibly handle a wide range of electronic waste, including 
computers, servers, scanners, UPSs, batteries, air conditioners, and other relevant equipment. We will ensure the 
proper disposal of such e-waste materials through registered and authorized e-waste vendors.

The company implements measures such as installing low-consumption and energy-efficient fixtures, 
employing sensor taps.
2
The company replaced plastic water bottles with glass or steel bottles.
3
Additionally, the company emphasizes more on digitalization to minimize paper waste.
The company’s implementation of measures such as installing low-consumption and energy-efficient fixtures, as well 
as employing sensor taps, brings several benefits. Firstly, it helps the company reduce its overall energy consumption 
and contribute to environmental sustainability. By using energy-efficient fixtures, the company can minimize its 
carbon footprint, aligning with sustainable practices.
Our encouragement to employees to replace plastic water bottles with glass or steel bottles also yields multiple 
advantages. It significantly reduces plastic waste and contributes to environmental conservation. Additionally, using 
glass or steel bottles can be a cost-effective solution in the long run, as they can be reused multiple times, reducing 
the need for constant repurchasing of single-use plastic bottles.
Moreover, adopting the use of a digital portal, such as FIMO enables  the company to minimize paper waste. This not 
only reduces the environmental impact associated with paper production & transportation but also streamlines internal 
processes and enhances operational efficiency. Digital portals allow for faster and more accurate data management, 
reducing the reliance on physical paperwork and facilitating smooth information flow within the company.
Overall, these environmentally conscious measures benefit the company by lowering operational costs, improving 
sustainability practices, and promoting efficient workflows. By reducing energy consumption, minimizing plastic 
waste, and embracing digital solutions, the company can be an environmentally responsible organization.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
Spandana Sphoorty has implemented a robust disaster recovery and business continuity plan to ensure preparedness 
in the face of unforeseen events. The plan incorporates multiple strategies to maintain operations during disruptions. 
One strategy involves utilizing branches as alternative sites, which allows the company to continue serving its 
customers even if the main office or certain locations are affected by a disaster. Another important aspect of the 
plan is enabling work-from-home arrangements. This flexibility ensures that employees can continue their work 
remotely, minimizing downtime and maintaining productivity during critical situations. By leveraging technology and 
providing the necessary infrastructure and tools, Spandana Sphoorty ensures that essential functions can continue 
seamlessly, regardless of physical office accessibility. Additionally, the company has implemented an IT disaster 
recovery site, which serves as a dedicated facility to restore and resume IT operations in the event of a system failure 
or disruption. This redundancy ensures that vital systems and data can be quickly recovered, enabling the company to 
continue its operations with minimal interruption. To validate the effectiveness of the disaster recovery and business 
continuity plan, Spandana Sphoorty conducts regular testing. These tests are performed as and when required 
and involve comprehensive evaluations to identify potential weaknesses or areas of improvement. The results and 
findings from these tests are reviewed and presented to the IT Strategy Committee, allowing for ongoing refinement 
and enhancement of the plan. By establishing a comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plan, 
Spandana Sphoorty proactively mitigates the impact of potential disruptions. This preparedness not only safeguards 
the company’s operations but also ensures uninterrupted services to its customers. The regular testing, review, and 
presentations to the IT Strategy Committee further strengthen the plan’s effectiveness, enabling Spandana Sphoorty 
to swiftly recover from any adverse situations and maintain its commitment to delivering reliable financial services. 
Spandana also has in place a non-IT BCP plan which counters issues like flood, fire or any other natural disaster in the 
branch area, curfew in the branch area, closure of the branch by an administrative action, software interruption, staff
