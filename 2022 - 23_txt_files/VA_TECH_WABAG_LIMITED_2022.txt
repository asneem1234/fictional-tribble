Renewable 
energy
O
Use of renewable energy 
and 
conservation 
of 
energy is the need of the 
hour.
Over 97% of the total 
power requirement of 
WABAG’s headquarters 
in Chennai is derived 
from 
wind 
energy, 
thereby bringing down 
energy cost by 10% 
as well as becoming a 
part of green energy 
compliant corporate.
WABAG has installed 
solar 
energy 
based 
lighting equipment for 
its MRPL plant so that 
renewable 
energy 
is 
used, by using special 
membranes in the said 
plant for RO section 
which consumes much 
lower 
energy. 
This 
saves 
energy 
and 
also 
contributes 
to 
environment 
protection 
from emission of carbon.
We stand true to our 
presence in a sunrise 
sector. 
We 
executed 
a 
Sewage 
Treatment 
Plant (STP) in Sanliurfa, 
Turkey 
wherein 
the 
sludge drying component 
was powered by solar 
energy.
-
Positive: 
Saves
