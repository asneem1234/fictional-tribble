1
Enhancing 
availability of 
product 
Opportunity
A significant proportion of patients 
in numerous low and middle-income 
countries encounter financial 
limitations when attempting to obtain 
affordable medicines.
As a pharmaceutical company, 
we prioritize making life-saving 
medicines accessible, available, 
and affordable for patients. Also, 
due to our role in society, we are 
uniquely positioned to reduce health 
disparities, and enable improved 
health outcomes.
We are committed to serve 1.5 billion 
patients by 2030 and bring at least three 
innovative solutions to improve standard of 
treatment every year from 2027. We plan to 
achieve this by launching more innovative 
drugs and expanding our product portfolio, 
increasing our go-to-market through diverse 
collaborations and licensing arrangements, 
and through greater presence in public 
health. We are partnering with multilateral and 
donor agencies to address the global disease 
burden, neglected tropical diseases, and 
emergency disease areas. We remain deeply 
committed to taking a holistic approach 
to healthcare, running several innovative 
programmes, offering one-of-its-kind patient 
care and disease management initiatives that 
service patients digitally or through hybrid 
means. We also participate in strengthening 
public health delivery systems through the 
training and capacity building of health 
workers and local stakeholders.
Positive
2
Regulatory 
compliance
Opportunity, 
Risk
Regulatory guidelines and 
requirements heavily regulate the 
manufacturing of our products, 
including manufacturing quality 
standards. Periodic inspections are 
conducted on our manufacturing 
sites, and if the regulatory and 
quality standards and systems are 
not found adequate, it could result in 
observations. This might impact our 
ability to meet patient demand and 
generate value for our stakeholders.
•	
We are fully dedicated to quality and 
have robust quality processes and 
systems in place at our developmental 
and manufacturing facilities to ensure 
that every product is safe and of high 
quality.
•	
We have integrated “Quality by Design” 
to build quality into all processes and 
use quality tools to minimize process 
risks.
•	
We continue to spend significant 
time, money and effort in the areas of 
production and quality testing to help 
ensure full compliance with cGMP 
regulations.
•	
We leverage information technology 
to digitize and enhance our quality 
assurance and quality control processes.
•	
Our suppliers are subjected to 
periodic evaluation processes that 
prioritize quality parameters and 
ensure compliance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practice requirements.
•	
We are continuously focused on 
improving our quality culture across the 
organization.
Negative
3
Pharmaco 
vigilance (PV)
Risk
The increase in digital central trials 
and accelerated speed to market 
of medicines and drugs amplifies 
the need for better drug quality and 
prevention of adverse side effects.
•	
We have a mature system in place to 
continuously monitor the benefit-risk 
profile of our products to ensure benefits 
overweigh the product-related safety 
risks for patients.
•	
We maintain compliance with region / 
country-specific legislative requirements.
•	
All our employees also receive basic 
training in PV on a periodic basis.

Water 
management 
Waste 
Management 
Risk
The potential risks to water and 
sanitation services posed by 
climate change include damage to 
infrastructure, leading to the loss of 
services, and deterioration in water 
quality – impacts that all increase 
risks to health. Water is a critical 
input into the manufacturing of 
medicines, used as a raw material 
in the production, processing and 
formulation of APIs, intermediates 
and finished pharmaceutical 
products (FPP), in the preparation 
of solvents and reagents, and for 
cleaning (e.g. washing and rinsing).
Water risks are assessed as part of an 
established enterprise risk management 
framework periodically. We conducted 
thorough water risk and evaluation studies in 
at all of our watersheds to identify alternative 
rich water resources. Our water management 
strategy involves key focus areas including 
water efficiency and optimization, identifying 
alternate water sources for water security, 
and creating freshwater potential beyond 
the fence. This year, we achieved our goal 
of turning into a water positive company. We 
have waste management systems in place at 
all our facilities.
Negative
5
Energy and 
emissions 
management 
Risk
The close relationship between 
health and climate is undeniable, 
as illustrated by the consequences 
of extreme weather events on food 
security, the harmful air pollution 
resulting from wildfires, and the rising 
prevalence of infectious diseases. 
As a pharmaceutical company, 
the bulk of direct emissions come 
from running boilers and indirect 
emissions from purchased electricity 
for both industrial and domestic 
purposes.
•	
We have an opportunity to reduce GHG 
emissions from our manufacturing, 
operations and facilities and we 
announced our commitment to lead 
the energy transition with a goal to be 
100% powered by renewable sources by 
2030, and are committed to be a carbon 
neutral company in our direct operations 
by 2030. 
•	
Our key levers to reducing GHG 
emissions include energy productivity 
improvements, fuel substitution, 
green building design, and carbon 
sequestration with meaningful 
investments in afforestation and 
sustainable agriculture. 
Negative
6
Talent attraction 
and retention 
Risk
Ability to attract and retain the 
right technical talent with differing 
skill sets is a difficult challenge 
to address. The industry is highly 
knowledge-driven and technology 
based, and heavily reliant on 
specialist individuals well versed with 
state-of-the-art technology. 
We use people analytics to measure 
employee performance, identify current skill 
gaps, and flight risks to improve retention. 
We actively address and resolve structural 
talent gaps by providing long-term reskilling 
and upskilling opportunities to our workforce, 
including digital learning initiatives. We 
embed strategic workforce planning into 
our operations strategy. The benefits of 
this initiative are multifaceted e.g., fostering 
internal mobility for well-suited roles, 
enhancing people productivity and containing 
staff costs.

Promoting 
diversity and 
inclusion
Opportunity
We fully appreciate the significance 
of diversity to our organization, as 
it fosters the introduction of new 
perspectives, diverse experiences, 
novel concepts, and inventive 
approaches that can provide 
sustainable value creation for our 
stakeholders over the long term. It 
is our steadfast effort to promote 
inclusiveness through concerted 
interventions across different 
dimensions of business and embrace 
their distinctiveness. 
•	
Over the last year, concerted 
interventions to increase gender 
diversity across different dimensions 
of hiring, sensitization, communication 
and policy revamp helped in increasing 
women diversity to 18% globally. 
•	
We are also working to increase the 
representation of women across roles 
and teams, exploring new entry level 
routes such as apprentice hiring and 
actively recruiting women for STEM 
roles. 
•	
Through our flagship female leadership 
development programme Chrysalis, 
mentoring initiatives, representation in 
external forums and coaching programs, 
we are invested in career development 
for women leaders. 
•	
In close partnership with Dr. Reddy’s 
Foundation, we increased the 
representation of people with disabilities 
representation by 50%, introducing 
a focused internship program to 
acclimatize and absorb PwD employees 
into the workforce, while also sensitizing 
hiring managers and recruitment teams 
on infrastructure and support required to 
enable them to deliver on their job
Positive
8
Combating 
counterfeit 
medicines 
Risk
Our industry has been increasingly 
challenged by the vulnerability 
of distribution channels to illegal 
counterfeiting and the presence of 
counterfeit products in a growing 
number of markets and over the 
internet. Third parties may illegally 
distribute and sell counterfeit 
versions of our products, which do 
not meet the rigorous manufacturing 
and testing standards that our 
products undergo. Counterfeit 
products are frequently unsafe or 
ineffective and can be potentially 
life-threatening.
We are proactively investing in aggregation 
along with serialization in geographies such 
as USA, Russia, Uzbekistan, EU, and worked 
closely with the Government of India for the 
implementation of DGFT+. A comprehensive 
set of measures have helped us establish 
a robust system that enables us to track 
and trace our medicines from the point of 
manufacture to the point of dispensing.
Negative
9
Health 
education 
and disease 
prevention 
Opportunity
Health education empowers people 
to increase control over their health. 
Disease prevention is important to 
minimize the burden of diseases 
and associated risk factors. Primary 
prevention avoids the manifestation 
of a disease, and secondary 
prevention (early detection) improves 
the chances for positive health 
outcomes.
Through DRFHE (Dr. Reddy's Foundation 
for Health Education), we are contributing 
to health systems strengthening by sharing 
our expertise to increase patient awareness, 
and training and upskilling healthcare 
providers. Though CHIP (Community Health 
Intervention Programme), we are providing 
door-step primary healthcare services to rural 
communities, including increasing awareness 
on health, hygiene and disease management 
practices. Our patient counselling initiatives 
betaInstitut, betaCare, and betaWissen in 
Germany offer socio-legal and psychosocial 
information for physicians, pharmacists, 
patients and their family members.

Technology & 
Digitalization
Opportunity
Digital innovation has the potential 
to improve drug development, 
make products and services 
more personalized, physicians 
and patients more engaged and 
empowered, decisions and product 
evidence more data driven, business 
processes less expensive and more 
optimized, and supply chain more 
transparent and efficient. 
The opportunity of transformation exists 
across the value chain and possibilities 
range from portfolio selection with analytics-
based insights, to drug development within

MECHANISMS TO PREVENT ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THE COMPLAINANT IN DISCRIMINATION AND 
HARASSMENT CASES 
	
Dr. Reddy’s policy on Ombudsperson as well as Non-retaliation also supports the Company values and “Speak Up” 
culture by taking proactive steps to ensure that employees who raise concerns in good faith are protected and supported 
in the workplace, as appropriate. To protect the interest of complainant, Dr. Reddy’s follows a strict non-retaliation 
policy, where any retaliation against an employee who in good faith raises concerns or who assists in an investigation of 
suspected wrongdoing, is not tolerated. Non-retaliation policy is applicable to all employees (including, but not limited to, 
all current and past employees, contract workers, part-time or temporary workforce) and third parties of the Company. A 
concern of potential retaliation can be raised through multiple reporting channels that are available and promoted across 
the organisation.
