Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk Perspective:
Fluctuations 
in 
energy 
prices can directly impact 
SMIL's 
operating 
costs. 
Dependence 
on 
non-
renewable 
energy 
sources 
can lead to vulnerability in 
the face of price volatility. 
Global energy supply chain 
disruptions, 
geopolitical 
tensions, or natural disasters 
can aff ect the availability 
and cost of energy resources, 
impacting SMIL's production 
and distribution processes. 
Governments worldwide are 
implementing stricter energy-
related regulations to address 
climate change and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Non-compliance with these 
regulations can result in fines 
and legal liabilities for SMIL.
Energy management involves 
the 
strategic 
planning, 
monitoring, and optimization 
of energy use throughout the 
Company's operations.
The Company has adopted 
renewable 
energy 
sources 
including solar and wind 
power. 
The Company has installed 
automatic sensors for cutting 
off  the electricity of heavy 
motors and machinery when 
not in use.
To ensure conservation of 
energy, the Company has 
adopted 
energy 
eff icient 
equipment.
The 
Company 
aims 
to 
improve the environmental 
performance 
by 
adopting 
cleaner production methods. 
Positive 
Financial 
Implications:
Implementing 
energy-
eff icient technologies and 
practices can result in lower 
utility bills and decreased 
energy-related 
expenses, 
positively impacting SMIL's 
bottom line.  As energy costs 
continue to rise, companies 
with 
eff icient 
energy 
management strategies can 
gain a competitive edge by 
off ering 
cost-competitive 
products and services. Attract 
environmentally 
conscious 
consumers and investors, 
positively influencing SMIL's 
brand value and market 
position.

(Indicate positive or

Opportunity Perspective:
Implementing 
energy-
eff icient technologies, process 
optimizations, and renewable 
energy solutions can lead to 
significant cost savings in the 
long run. Streamlining energy 
consumption can optimize 
production processes, reduce 
downtime, 
and 
increase 
overall productivity. Shift ing 
to renewable energy sources 
and adopting energy-eff icient 
practices aligns with SMIL’s 
commitment to sustainability, 
enhancing 
its 
reputation 
among 
environmentally 
conscious 
customers, 
investors, and stakeholders.
It promotes the use of energy 
eff icient 
and 
environment 
friendly technologies and use 
of renewable energy.
Negative 
Financial 
Implications:
Failing to address energy 
ineff iciencies may lead to 
higher operating expenses 
and decreased profitability. 
Non-compliance with energy-
related regulations can result 
in 
fines, 
penalties, 
and 
potential damage to SMIL’s 
reputation.

Physical 
impacts 
of climate 
change
Risk
Risk perspective
The 
physical 
impacts 
of 
climate 
change 
present 
significant risks to Sharda 
Motor 
Industries 
Limited 
(SMIL) and the automotive 
industry. 
Climate 
change 
refers 
to 
long-term 
changes 
in 
global or regional climate 
patterns, 
which 
have 
significant implications for 
businesses, 
communities, 
and ecosystems. The physical 
impacts of climate change 
can 
directly 
aff ect 
SMIL's 
operations, facilities, supply 
chains, and overall business 
continuity.
These 
risks 
include 
disruptions to operations and 
supply chains due to extreme 
weather 
events, 
potential 
shortages of critical resources 
like water, rising energy costs 
to comply with emissions 
regulations and vulnerability 
of 
infrastructure. 
Climate 
change-induced 
shift s 
in 
consumer preferences and 
liability issues further add to 
the risks.
The Company is managing 
these risks by identifying 
and assessing the specific 
climate-related 
risks 
to 
SMIL's operations, facilities, 
and supply chain locations. 
Investing in climate-resilient 
infrastructure designs that 
can 
withstand 
extreme 
weather events and changing 
climate conditions.
Diversifying 
Suppliers 
and 
Transportation 
Routes 
by 
reducing reliance on single 
suppliers 
or 
transportation 
routes that may be vulnerable 
to climate-related disruptions. 
And 
implementing 
water 
conservation measures and 
exploring water recycling and 
reuse strategies to ensure 
water resilience. The Company 
is 
focused 
on 
addressing 
climate change challenges and 
build resilience.
For example, the Company 
has made several eff orts to 
minimize its environmental 
impact and has shift ed to 
alternative sources of energy, 
through adoption of solar and 
wind power. The Company 
ensures 
responsible 
and 
sustainable business conduct 
throughout its value chain. 
Furthermore, the Company

Waste and 
Hazardous 
material 
management
Risk and 
opportunity
Risk perspective: Improper 
waste handling and disposal 
can lead to environmental 
degradation, 
resulting 
in 
regulatory 
fines 
and 
reputational 
loss 
for 
the 
Company.  
Furthermore, 
waste 
management 
can 
be 
costly, 
particularly 
if 
the 
organisation is required to 
establish new systems and 
technologies in order to meet 
environmental 
standards. 
Inadequate 
handling 
of 
hazardous materials can lead 
to workplace accidents and 
health risks for employees, 
resulting in potential liability 
and 
increased 
workers' 
compensation costs. Improper 
disposal or accidental release 
of 
hazardous 
materials 
can lead to environmental 
contamination, 
impacting 
nearby 
ecosystems 
and 
communities and potentially 
resulting in legal and financial 
liabilities. Compliance with 
strict regulations regarding 
the storage, handling, and 
disposal 
of 
hazardous 
materials 
is 
essential 
to 
avoid penalties and legal 
consequences. 
Opportunity 
perspective: 
By minimising waste disposal 
costs and optimising resource 
utilisation, 
eff ective 
waste 
management 
practices 
can result in cost savings. 
Recycling waste can also 
lead to more cost-eff ective 
industrial 
processes 
and 
demonstrate 
environmental 
care. 
Adequate 
waste 
management 
may 
also 
help 
the 
organisation 
in 
meeting 
environmental 
standards 
while 
fostering 
great connections with the 
surrounding community.
The Company ensures waste 
management through proper 
disposal 
and 
recycling 
methods and is compliant 
with various environmental 
regulations.
The 
Company 
aims 
for 
optimum utilisation of natural 
and manmade resources and 
sustainability of resources by 
reducing, reusing, recycling, 
and managing waste.
The 
Company 
regularly 
assess waste and hazardous 
material 
management 
processes, 
identifying 
areas for improvement and 
adopting more sustainable 
practices and follow best 
practices for handling, storing, 
and disposing of hazardous 
materials, ensuring employee 
safety 
and 
environmental 
protection.
Negative 
financial 
implications:
Poor 
waste 
management 
practices 
can 
lead 
to 
increased costs, fines, and 
legal penalties. In addition, 
waste 
management 
has 
negative cost implication due 
to the implementation of new 
systems 
and 
technologies 
to 
meet 
environmental 
regulations. This can result in 
short-term financial impacts 
such as increased capital 
expenditure.
Accidents 
related 
to 
hazardous 
materials 
can 
lead to medical expenses, 
worker 
downtime, 
and 
potential 
legal 
claims, 
aff ecting SMIL's operational 
costs. If hazardous materials 
cause 
environmental 
contamination, 
SMIL 
may 
incur 
substantial 
costs 
for 
environmental 
remediation and restoration.
Positive 
financial 
implications:
Eff ective waste management 
practices can lead to a 
reduction in the amount 
of waste generated, which 
can help to lower the cost 
of 
waste 
disposal 
and 
transportation. 
Furthermore, 
good 
waste 
management 
can 
lead 
to 
better 
raw 
material 
eff iciency because waste can 
be recovered or reused in 
manufacturing 
operations. 
This can result in cost savings 
from the procurement of 
new raw materials. Finally, 
eff icient waste management 
practices can help minimize 
the threat of legal and 
adverse publicity connected 
with incorrect disposal of 
waste, which can have serious 
financial consequences.

value 
chain 
partners. This commitment 
to sustainability extends to 
sourcing processes, wherein 
the 
Company 
endeavors 
to procure materials and 
resources responsibly, with 
a keen focus on minimizing 
environmental harm.
Negative 
financial

and 
improved 
resource 
utilization. 
A 
responsible 
supply chain reduces the 
risk of non-compliance, legal 
issues, and supply chain 
disruptions, 
preventing 
potential financial losses. 
Emphasizing 
responsible 
supply chain practices can 
make SMIL more appealing 
to customers and investors 
seeking environmentally and 
socially conscious partners.

10. Health and safety management system: 
a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, what is the coverage of such a system?
 
Yes, with an extensive health and safety management system, we aim to reduce workplace accidents 
and enhance our employees' and workers' mental and physical well-being. To provide a safe working 
environment, risk assessments of all our facilities and operations are conducted on a regular basis, 
along with necessary evaluations and inspections. Along with fire prevention and first aid training, 
we provide all our employees and workers with safety training and awareness sessions on safety 
manuals. The health, safety, and well-being of our employees and workers is always our first priority. 
Based on the  directives of the Government of India, we have put in place a strong protocol for 
ensuring workplace safety, including the wearing of face masks, sanitization, and social distancing 
standards, during the pandemic and we shall continue to improve it further.
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity? 
 
The potential hazards are identified through analyzing past incidents, regular inspections and worker 
incident reporting. Once the hazards are identified, an in-depth risk evaluation is done to assess the 
level of exposure, probability of incident occurrence, and likelihood of recurrence. Control measures 
102
are then implemented accordingly to mitigate and minimize such hazards. We believe that this is an 
ongoing process and ensure that appropriate training is given to employees and workers to be able 
to eff iciently use the control measures.
c.  Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. 
 
Yes, the Company has established clear procedures for workers to report any safety-related incidents 
or hazards. If workers identify any concerns, they can promptly communicate them to their respective 
plant heads. Following this, the plant heads collaborate with department heads to swift ly implement 
appropriate measures. These measures ensure that workers can eliminate or minimize their 
exposure to health and safety risks, reinforcing our commitment to a secure working environment. 
Additionally, the Company actively encourages its workers to bring forth hazards and address their 
concerns in central department safety meetings and safety committee meetings, fostering a culture 
of open communication and collective responsibility for workplace safety.
d.  Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services? 
 
Yes, our employees and workers are provided access to comprehensive non-occupational medical 
and healthcare services. Within our factories and premises, we ensure immediate access to first aid 
facilities, including regular visits from a doctor. As part of our commitment to employee welfare, 
we off er a group mediclaim policy for all employees. This policy covers a wide spectrum of medical 
needs, demonstrating our dedication to safeguarding their well-being. Additionally, for our workers, 
we have implemented the Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) program to ensure they 
receive comprehensive medical and healthcare services.
 
To further nurture the health and wellness of our workforce, we promote a range of wellness 
initiatives. These encompass regular health check-ups, health screenings, and preventive measures, 
ensuring that our employees are equipped with the tools they need to maintain their well-being.
 
In our unwavering pursuit of ensuring accessible medical services, we have gone the extra mile. We 
have partnered with local healthcare providers. These clinics off er a diverse array of non-occupational 
healthcare services, ranging from general medical consultations to preventive care, vaccinations, 
and treatment for common illnesses and injuries. These clinics are also poised to arrange referrals 
to specialists or hospitals if any further medical attention is required. This comprehensive approach 
underlines our commitment to prioritizing the health and well-being of our valued employees and 
workers.

9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
 
Our Company complies with CPCB/SPCB approved standards for air pollutants, eff luent quality and 
discharge, and solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal. We strictly adhere to all applicable 
environmental regulations and guidelines while disposal of waste. Our waste management strategy 
focuses on three main areas- waste reduction, recycling and reuse, and responsible disposal. We 
prioritize reduction at the source by optimizing our manufacturing processes and adopting responsible 
manufacturing principles. This helps our Company minimize material waste and reduces the overall 
generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. 
 
Our Company actively promotes recycling and reuse of material wherever possible. By segregating waste 
streams, we ensure that recyclable materials are sent to appropriate recycling facilities. Scrap/waste 
raw materials generated during our manufacturing process are not recycled on-site and are instead 
transferred to recycling plants. 
 
We follow a comprehensive approach to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products 
and processes such as hazardous waste management, controlled use of hazardous chemicals, employee 
training, and are slowly transitioning towards training our vendors/suppliers to shift  towards few green 
procurement practices such as minimal packaging needs when required and improved recycling ability.

Delivering exceptional customer service is becoming more and more crucial to propel advancement

we ensure that each patron has the means to avail themselves of this system. 
 
Active interaction with our consumer provides us with the opportunity to adapt and innovate our 
products as per their complaints and feedback through gaining insights into changing needs, preferences 
and emerging market trends. We consider the inputs from all our B2B (Business-to-Business) customers 
through a comprehensive complaint management system and active communication channels such as 
e-mails, in-person meetings and telecommunication and provide tailored solutions not only to resolve 
concerns but also prevent future recurrence. Our Company is devoted to resolving our clients’ concerns 
in a fair, quick, and eff icient way while enhancing their experience and achieving overall operational 
excellence.

No) If available, provide a web-link of the policy. 
 
Yes. As data protection is increasingly becoming an essential element of day-to-day activities for 
companies of every scale and across all industries. A robust data protection strategy helps safeguard 
digital resources and information from detrimental internal and external risks. We have a comprehensive 
IT security system in place that adheres to legislative directives on information and cyber security and is 
based on industry best practices. 
 
Our organization provides standard grade IT infrastructure with regular preventive and corrective 
maintenance. Our IT policy’s goal is to develop standards and recommendations for the safe, productive, 
optimal, and proper usage of our Company's IT infrastructure. Our IT policy is intended to secure the 
organization's network and resources from incursion by viruses, malware, spyware, and illegal network 
access. Firewalls are used in our firm to protect against hackers, anti-virus, anti-spam, AV definition, 
intrusion prevention, IPS definition, and web filtering. Our IT department oversees, develops and 
administers an infrastructure that allows for the continuous and secure distribution of information within 
the firm, to partners, and to others via the Internet.
 
As part of this design, we have developed methods for scanning our information and data to prevent 
the propagation of viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and other executable objects that could compromise 
the system and network's security. Emails that are discovered to be contaminated with a virus, worm, 
or Trojan horse, or that include another executable item that could constitute a security risk, are not 
transmitted to the user. If the malicious email cannot be cleansed, it is taken from the delivery system 
and evaluated by the network and security administrator.
