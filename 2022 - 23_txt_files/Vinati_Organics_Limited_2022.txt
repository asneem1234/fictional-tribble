manufacturing 
processes 
on 
environment 
and 
ecosystem, 
it 
becomes 
imperative to take steps 
towards 
making 
overall 
business operations, climate 
resilient. Additionally, risk 
of 
sustaining 
company 
reputation in the global 
market demands attention.
The Company recognizes 
the urgent need to align 
business 
practices 
and 
operation with global climate 
change commitments and 
committed to reduce its 
climate impacts. Company’s 
manufacturing facilities are 
ISO 14001 (EMS) and ISO 
45001 (OHSAS) certified,

making 
operations 
safe, 
sustainable and pollution 
free.

implications from investment 
for implementing climate 
actions as identified by the 
organizations.
Positive impact in long-
run due to climate change 
management 
and 
lower 
operational expenditure.
2.
Energy 
Management
Risk
Energy generations through 
non-renewable 
resources 
results 
in 
release 
of 
harmful emissions in the 
atmosphere and is a direct 
contributor to greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
Major 
energy 
demand 
of 
the 
company processes is met 
through coal, resulting in 
high risk of managing the 
energy demand.
The 
Company 
has 
embarked on their journey 
to ensure efficient use 
of natural resources for 
reduced consumption of 
fossil fuels. It employs 
co-generation 
system 
for 
energy 
production 
providing

through renewable energy. 
The Company is also in the 
process of commissioning 
another solar plant of 11.25 
MW during FY 2024.
Negative financial
implication due to required 
investment for renewable 
energy sources.
Positive impact in long-run 
due to energy security 
and 
lower 
operational 
expenditure.

Materials
Risk
Company 
uses 
Toluene, 
Propylene, Methyl Tert Butyl 
Ether, Acrylonitrile, water, 
coal, as major raw materials/
resources. Hence, these 
have a direct impact and 
results in natural resource 
depletion. Risk arising due 
to climate change can affect 
the Company’s supply chain 
and business.

sustainable 
procurement 
policy which emphasizes 
on purchasing goods and 
services 
with 
minimum 
strain on natural resources. 
Further 
the 
company 
plans to adopt circularity 
measures
