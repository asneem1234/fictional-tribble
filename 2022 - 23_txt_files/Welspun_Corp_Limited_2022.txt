Health 
and safety 
practices
To ensure a comprehensive assessment of our workplace, we have implemented multiple evaluation 
methods for the fiscal year FY ‘23, including:
Internal Audits: Certified Internal Auditors conduct internal audits every six months to assess our 
adherence to safety standards and protocols.
External Audit: Accredited 3rd party audit firm M/s LRQA successfully completed Focus Audits and 
Certificate Renewal Audits, providing an external perspective on our workplace safety practices.
Monthly Management Audit: Each month, a thorough safety audit is conducted by the respective 
Plant Head, HSE Head, other functional Heads, Safety Champions, and the Plant team. This monthly 
review allows for consistent monitoring and identification of any areas that require improvement.
Apex Committee Member’s Plant Visit: Members of the Apex Committee visit our plants with the 
specific objective of identifying any gaps in workplace management. This helps in addressing 
potential issues and implementing necessary measures to enhance safety protocols.
By conducting these diverse assessments, we strive to maintain a proactive approach to workplace 
safety, continuously improve our safety measures, and provide a secure working environment for 
all employees.

Working 
Conditions
The assessment of working conditions encompasses the entire premises, which includes all 
operational and production activities, health and hygiene facilities, administrative and office 
buildings, the canteen, Gurukul building, and the store. This comprehensive evaluation ensures 
that all aspects of our facilities are thoroughly examined to promote a safe and conducive working 
environment for our employees.
15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) 
and on significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working 
conditions.
We have established an Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) team that is dedicated to ensuring a safe and 
secure working environment. This team plays a crucial role in proactively identifying potential safety-related 
risks and hazards within our operations. They conduct regular assessments, inspections, and evaluations to 
identify areas of concern and take necessary measures to address them promptly.
The EHS team works closely with various departments and employees at all levels of the organization to 
gather information and feedback regarding safety issues. They analyze data, conduct risk assessments, and 
develop appropriate strategies to mitigate risks and enhance safety measures. They also provide guidance 
and training to employees on best practices, safety protocols, and the proper use of safety equipment.
Additionally, the EHS team stays updated on relevant regulations, industry standards, and emerging safety 
practices to ensure our organization remains compliant and adopts the most effective safety measures. 
Their efforts are vital in creating a safety-conscious culture and promoting a work environment where every 
individual feels safe, protected, and empowered to raise any safety concerns.
By appointing an EHS team, we demonstrate our commitment to maintaining a high standard of safety and 
risk management throughout our operations, prioritizing the well-being of our employees and stakeholders.

 Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
Independent practitioner’s limited assurance report on Identified 
Sustainability Indicators in Welspun Corp Limited’s Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report
To the Board of Directors of Welspun Corp Limited 
We have undertaken to perform a limited assurance engagement for Welspun Corp Limited (‘WCL’)  (the 
‘Company’) vide our Engagement Letter dated May 16, 2023, in respect of the agreed indicators /parameters listed 
below (the “Identified Sustainability Indicators”). These parameters are as included in the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2023. The reporting boundary for 
BRSR is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A of the BRSR, with exceptions, if any, been disclosed as a note 
under the respective questions under BRSR.
IDENTIFIED SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
The Identified Sustainability Indicators for the year ended March 31, 2023 are summarised in Appendix 1 
to this report.
Our limited assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2023 information only and 
we have not performed any procedures with respect to comparative previous year information i.e. year ended 
March 31, 2o22 reported in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the year ended March 31, 
2023 and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.
CRITERIA
The criteria used by Welspun Corp Limited is Guidance note for BRSR format.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
The Company’s Management is responsible for engagement with stakeholders, content and presentation 
of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report in accordance with the Criteria mentioned above. 
This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and measurement of Identified Sustainability 
Indicators, which are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
indicators allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities. In addition, Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions 
of different gases.
OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) and Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1 “Quality Management for Firms that Perform 
Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements” and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality management including documented policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
OUR RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Indicators based 
on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance 
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’, International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3410 ‘Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’, issued by the International Auditing 
and Assurance Standards Board. These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain 
limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Indicators are free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use 
of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Indicators, assessing the risks of 
material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Indicators whether due to fraud or error, responding to 
the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Indicators.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation 
to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
• 
Obtained an understanding of the identified sustainability indicators and related disclosures.
• 
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and /or

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in 
extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we 
performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion
