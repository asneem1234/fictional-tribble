The Company designs and develops high-performance and cost-effective wireline and wireless equipment that are primarily used to build 
fixed and mobile broadband networks. Our products have a huge positive impact on society by enabling telecom service providers to bridge 
the rapidly growing “digital divide” by servicing billions of poor, bottom-of-pyramid consumers in rural and remote areas who would otherwise 
have been bereft of broadband connectivity for access to modern education, employment, healthcare and financial services. Moreover, the 
availability of high-speed broadband also has a positive environmental impact by allowing users to cut carbon emissions by teleworking, video 
conferencing, remote healthcare consultations,  e-commerce, online banking, smart metering and other applications that reduce both road and 
air travel. 
As a responsible product company, we give due consideration to environmental issues like global warming, climate change etc. and our 
products are designed accordingly. As a global supplier of telecom equipment; our products are qualified in various countries including US & 
Europe to meet strict environmental, emission norms. While selecting components we attempt to choose energy efficient chip sets which 
consume less power and design our products to minimize the total carbon footprint. In addition, we have designed some of our customer 
premise devices, especially those which can potentially be deployed in remote areas with power constraints, to support solar powering.  Hence, 
nearly 100% of our R&D and capex investments help improve environmental and social impacts.
