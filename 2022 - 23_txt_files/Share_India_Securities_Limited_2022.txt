Transparency in product and service offerings 
is crucial for an online trading platform. It builds 
trust among clients, promotes fair and informed 
decision-making, and fosters a level playing field. 
Transparent disclosure of fees, charges, and 
terms helps clients understand the true costs 
of investing. Clear information about investment 
options, risks, and performance enables clients 
to make well-informed choices. Additionally, 
transparent reporting on execution quality 
and order handling practices ensures fairness 
and minimizes conflicts of interest. Ultimately, 
transparency enhances the platform's reputation, 
attracts and retains clients, and contributes to a 
healthy and trustworthy trading environment. 
Policies are in place to ensure 
Share India’s objectives in operating 
as 
a 
transparent 
organization. 
The Company aims at inculcating 
appropriate procedures and actions

components to human health.
The Company has engaged certified

PRINCIPLE 4 BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF AND BE RESPONSIVE TO ALL ITS 
STAKEHOLDERS
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
In the dynamic landscape of online share market trading and investing platforms, successful companies understand the 
critical role that stakeholders play in their growth and success. Stakeholders play a vital role in shaping the direction, 
reputation, and growth of the company.
	
The stakeholder identification process for Share India involves identifying internal stakeholders (employees, management, 
shareholders), industry stakeholders (Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, Depositories), customers and users (FIIs, 
HNIs, Retail Investors), business partners (Authorized Persons, Franchisee & Distribution Partners besides software and 
hardware vendors), community and public stakeholders (local communities, advocacy groups), and government and 
regulatory bodies. For any online share market trading and investing platform company, identifying stakeholders and 
actively engaging with them is crucial for long-term success and is essential for building trust, delivering value, thereby 
sustaining a competitive edge.
	
The next step includes analysing their influence, impact, and dependence on the company, prioritizing their engagement, 
and developing effective communication strategies to meet their needs and expectations. Regular evaluation and 
adaptation of strategies ensure ongoing stakeholder management and relationship building.
	
A proactive and inclusive stakeholder identification process is an ongoing effort that requires continuous evaluation, 
adaptation, and a commitment to meeting the evolving needs of stakeholders in the ever-changing landscape of online 
share market trading and investing. Therefore, implementing a comprehensive stakeholder identification process is 
essential to identify, analyse, and prioritize the various individuals and groups who have a significant interest in or influence 
over the company’s operations.
