Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications) 
1 
GHG Emissions 
Risk 
SEL understands that automotive parts 
manufacturing is a high-emission 
activity and is responsible for its 
emissions. The Company recognises 
the expectations of its stakeholders and 
has taken steps to evaluate its GHG 
emissions. The Company is cognizant 
that customers may demand 
commitments to reduce greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions or impose conditions 
GHG emissions can be mitigated by: 
1. Conducting energy audits and 
identifying areas of energy reduction  
2.  Increased sourcing of renewable 
energy. In the current financial year, 
49% energy was from renewable 
sources 
Negative financial implications 
could result in the form of capital 
expenditure or increase of 
renewable energy procurement 
and/or offsets in light of emission 
caps imposed by regulation.  
 
7 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  
related to emissions for conducting 
business. Investors focussed on 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) criteria may only invest in 
companies that meet their GHG 
reduction targets. Companies in the 
automotive industry may be required to 
implement emission reduction 
programmes due to India’s current and 
future climate commitments. The 
Government may also establish 
stringent targets and is in the process of 
creating a carbon trading market. 
Failure to mitigate GHG emissions 
could lead to the loss of potential 
customers, disinterest from specific 
groups of investors and increased costs 
to comply with regulatory 
requirements.  
2 
Waste 
Management 
Risk/Opportunity 
Improper hazardous waste 
management by waste management 
contractors presents risks to land, water 
bodies, flora and fauna. Waste 
recycling through the adoption of 
circular economy principles could 
present a potential opportunity for SEL 
and lead to a decrease in waste 
generation.  
Ensuring hazardous waste is handled and 
disposed by only authorized contractors of 
the State Pollution Control Board and 
follow circular economy initiatives to 
reduce scrap during production.       
Negative financial implications 
could result in the form of capital 
expenditure for recycling of 
discarded scrap steel. 
3 
Energy 
management 
Opportunity 
SEL’s manufacturing process requires 
a significant amount of energy and 
saving energy not only contributes to 
financial performance but also helps 
the Company reach its emissions 
reduction targets.  
 
Conducting energy audits and identifying 
areas of energy reduction and implementing 
suitable measures for the same. 
Negative financial implications 
could result in capital expenditure 
for the implementation of energy 
reduction initiatives.  
Positive implications for the 
Company’s business could result 
from initiatives taken around 
energy management that attract 
customers aligned with 
sustainable businesses.  
8 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  
4 
Product 
Responsibility 
Risk 
The rapidly evolving electric vehicles 
(EV) market would create demand for 
newer components, while many of the 
existing components used in internal 
combustion engines (ICE) would 
decrease in demand. New products 
could also necessitate advanced tooling 
and machining methods to meet quality 
specifications.  
Increase focus on manufacturing of EV 
products. Ensuring product traceability as 
per customer guidelines. 
Negative financial implications on 
the business could arise from 
failure to promptly consider 
innovation in the industry. 
5 
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety (OH&S) 
Risk 
OH&S directly affects individuals and 
the local community and has the 
potential to cause disruptions in 
operations. Risks to employees and 
workers arise in the form of physical 
hazards, chemical exposure, vehicle 
movement, ergonomic strain, 
respiratory risks and noise exposure. 
Risks to employees, workers and 
neighbouring community is largely due 
to fire and explosion hazards.  
SEL has taken various measures to mitigate 
OH&S risks including:  
1. Adoption of organisation wide Integrated 
Policy on environmental health, safety and 
quality management system  
2. Trainings, internal audits for all SOPs on 
operational health and safety  
3. Maintenance of HIRA (Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment)  
4. All plants are certified for ISO 45001- 
2018  
5. Periodical medical checkup for all 
employees and workers  
6. Monitoring of environmental parameters 
as per PCB standards  
Negative financial implications 
could arise from impacts on 
business reputation. Employee 
morale and performance could 
also be impacted by an unhealthy 
or unsafe work environment and 
contribute to negative business 
performance. 
6 
Diversity, 
Equity, Inclusion 
(DEI) 
Opportunity 
DEI present significant opportunities 
for SEL to foster a more inclusive and 
equitable workplace, strengthen 
employee engagement, improve 
customer satisfaction and build a 
positive brand reputation.  
The Company is consciously working to 
improve female employee strength in 
different roles across the organisation.  
 
Positive financial implications in 
the form of a more talented and 
motivated workforce. 
7 
Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
Risk 
Ethical and social responsibility risks 
in the supply chain include issues, such 
as labour rights violations, human 
rights abuses, child labour or unsafe 
working conditions within supplier 
facilities. SEL is making efforts to 
ensure sustainable practices throughout 
SEL has taken various measures to mitigate 
risks arising in the supply chain including:  
1. Adopting policies for responsible 
sourcing namely, Supplier Responsible 
Sourcing of Natural RM Policy, Sustainable 
Procurement Policy and the Company’s 
principles to enhance sustainability 
Negative financial implications 
could arise from impacts on 
business reputation.

sourcing of raw materials, waste 
management and compliance with 
environmental regulation. Non-
compliance can result in reputational 
damage and potential legal 
consequences.  
 
performance in the supply chain and SEL’s 
policy on Conflict Minerals  
2. SEL’s suppliers are required to sign 
commitments to the aforementioned policies 
(except SEL’s policy on Conflict Materials)  
3. System and sustainability assessments are 
conducted before onboarding suppliers  
8 
Information 
Security 
Risk 
Risks arise from being a target of 
cyberattacks, including ransomware, 
malware and phishing attempts. These 
could lead to the exploitation of 
vulnerabilities in networks or software, 
to gain unauthorised access to the 
company’s sensitive data or disrupt 
critical systems.  
Data breaches can occur due to 
external attacks, insider threats or 
inadequate security measures, leading 
to unauthorised access, theft or 
exposure of confidential information.  
SEL has deployed and implemented various 
technical tools and controls to mitigate 
Information Security risks including but not 
limited to: 
1. End Point and Servers Protection: 
CrowdStrike Falcon Complete 
(EDR) – Protection against 
Ransomware, Malware etc. 
2. Network Perimeter: UTP (Unified 
Threat Protection) – Protection 
against external threat / intruders 
3. Device Control – includes 
Bluetooth, External USB Drive, 
Card Readers etc. 
4. External Sharing Control for 
accessing OneDrive, Sharepoint 
5. Email Protection – Microsoft EOP 
(Exchange Online Protection), 
Email Phishing etc. 
 
Negative financial implication 
arising from brand reputation of 
the Company.  
9 
Ethics & 
Compliance 
Risk 
Business ethics encompasses various 
aspects such as corporate governance, 
employee behaviour, labour relations, 
customer relationships and supply 
chain practices. Failing to uphold 
ethical standards in these areas can 
expose the organization to various 
risks, including legal, reputational, 
financial and market-related risks. 
With the growing importance of 
To mitigate business ethics risks, several 
measures are implemented, including the 
establishment of a Code of Conduct for the 
Board of Directors, Independent Directors, 
Senior Management and Employees. 
Additionally, policies addressing anti-
corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering are put in place. A whistle-
blower policy is also implemented to 
encourage the reporting of unethical 
Negative financial implication 
may include the loss of customers 
or market share, financial losses 
resulting from legal liabilities, due 
to business ethics-related issues.

(ESG) themes, governance-related 
issues are receiving attention from 
potential investors and major 
customers. This necessitates the 
implementation of robust systems and 
processes to effectively manage and 
address business ethics-related 
concerns. 
behaviour. These policies are supported by 
awareness trainings and systems for 
addressing grievances and resolving ethical 
concerns.  
10 
Transparency & 
Disclosure 
Risk/Opportunity 
Risks related to transparency and 
disclosure are present in the timely 
communication of regulatory and 
stakeholder-oriented disclosures. 
Failure to disclose the Company’s 
financial and ESG-related information 
in a transparent manner could lead to 
reputational risks and negative 
perceptions from stakeholders. 
Opportunities are present in factually 
correct, transparent and timely 
disclosures. An increase in publishing 
climate-related disclosures presents an 
opportunity for SEL to build trust and 
reputation with all stakeholders. 
To mitigate risks related to transparency and 
disclosure, Sansera has published its first 
BRSR for FY2022-23 and is also planning a 
standalone sustainability report.   
Both positive and negative 
financial implications arising from 
the brand reputation of the

SEL has implemented a Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) system for identifying workplace 
hazards, 
undertaking 
risk 
assessments, 
implementing 
necessary controls as per the level of risk and eliminating or 
minimising the identified risks. 
 
SEL identifies all the potential work-related incidents through 
the hazard identification process and conducts a 
likelihood assessment to estimate the frequency or probability 
of occurrence. 
 
Risk reduction measures are implemented to prevent incidents 
(reduce the likelihood of their occurrence) or control 
incidents (limit the extent and duration of a hazardous event) 
and mitigate the adverse effects or consequences. 
In addition to this, the Company has prepared an Emergency 
Preparedness Plan, a Mock Drill Record Evaluation 
Checklist, a Risk assessment and OCP - Operation control 
procedure/Standards to minimise work-related hazards, 
among others. 
 
SEL ensures HIRA for all activities and products and conducts 
HIRA studies on an annual basis or as and when required.

A system is available for near miss reporting, reportable and 
non-reportable accidents. The incidents are reported using 
respective formats to the Plant EHS Officer who in turn reports 
to the Plant head and maintenance team. Corrective measures, 
if any are then identified and implemented by Plant EHS and 
maintenance team. 
To mitigate work-related hazards, the company conducts 
emergency mock drills and safety drills as well as engages in 
capacity building and awareness sessions to equip its 
employees and workers with safety protocols and risk 
management steps.

On November 24, 2022, during a usual 
operation, the trimming operator was using 
the machine simultaneously with the hot 
padding loader. The hot padding loader was 
responsible for removing the cut pieces 
from the piercing area. Unfortunately, the 
trimming operator accidentally pressed the 
button, leading to an injury on their right-
hand fingers and palm. 
Root Cause:  
1. Miscommunication between trimming 
operator and hot padding loader 
2. The hot padding loader cleared the 
pierced 
cut 
piece, 
which 
was 
the 
responsibility of the trimming operator, 
without notifying them beforehand 
 
Actions taken thereafter:  
1. Light curtain sensors installed. 
2. Awareness training was given to the 
workers to adhere and follow the standard 
operating procedure

grievance in writing to the Department Head 
and HR department in the event of his/her 
Supervisor failing to resolve the grievance 
within a week from the date of representation or 
if he/she is not satisfied with the decision of the 
Supervisor. 
 
The employee is allowed to approach the 
management through the HR department, only 
if the grievance is not resolved by the 
Department Head and HR department. 
Preferably the employee will be expected to 
provide prior information to their Supervisor 
about their intent. The HR department will 
always be available in facilitating and resolving 
grievances.  
 
The management will look into the grievance 
with due expedition and the decision made 
thereof would be given in writing to the 
aggrieved employee within 5 working days 
time.

If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved, 
the Head HR, will invite the employee to a 
further meeting with a third party or external 
consultant who has not been involved in the 
grievance procedure so far. The decision made 
thereof would be given in writing to the
