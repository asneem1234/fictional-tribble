Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
Chairman’s message
Over the last four decades, TCL has journeyed consistently towards sustainability in all aspects of its businesses. This 
was driven initially by circumstances and costs; as we saw the results this became the mantra within the company.
Eventually, in the last 20 years it has become a corepart of our DNA.
Each step and initiative has helped us towards greener manufacturing, a lower impact on our environment and on 
the communities around us, improved business sustainability and living in harmony with the local communities and 
stakeholders.
1.	
A lower Energy footprint, lower Greenhouse gas emissions:
	
We have been able to reduce our energy consumption in our main plant at Ranipet from the grid and all fuel usage 
dramatically; today over 93% of all our energy use in the site is from internal process waste heat, recaptured, 
converted to steam & power to run all operations including manufacturing of Petrochemicals, Food Ingredients 
and Fine Chemicals, Utilities, administration and all support services within the complex.
	
These technologies and learnings of energy capture from the process and recycle are now being implemented 
in our new investment at Dahej in western India and in our Petrochemical & Food Ingredients – Fine Chemicals 
investment in the US.
	
We estimate that over 90% of all our energy consumption (heat & power) globally will use only recycled energy 
including for admin, offices and all support services. Less than 10% will be from bought out energy from the 
electric grids or fossil fuel usage. Our target is to reduce this further. We have been fortunate that we have 
significant amount of heat generated from our main processes; we have learnt and implemented how to 
reduce our manufacturing energy use and how to recover from every energy source however small, within our 
manufacturing complexes.
2.	
Consumptions of Raw materials and inputs:
	
When we started the company in 1976 the yield in our main product (Phthalic Anhydride - PA), ” was below 
benchmark levels.  Today, in both our sites producing this product we have been able to improve this by about 
20%. This is similarly so in all our other products Maleic Anhydride, Food Ingredients, Fine & Speciality Chemicals 
where we have managed improvements of 7 – 18% in input efficiencies after all losses. These improvements do 
not include recoveries from waste described below.
3.	
Recovery & synthesis of valuable by-products (Food Ingredients from our process effluents):
	
Our main product in India (PA) produces about 4.5% and more of chemical by-products typically Maleic Anhydride, 
Benzoic acid, etc. Globally most companies incinerate these and let out CO2; a minority wash these out from 
the off gases and bio-treat them, again producing CO2 and methane emissions. In 1985, when we were building 
our second train in south India, we decided to recover these and convert them to valuable Fine Chemicals.. 
The same technology is under implementation at our facility and investment in western India and was also 
implemented in Malaysia 20 years ago. 
4.	
Reducing Water consumption
	
In 1976-78 when we started first with the manufacture of one petrochemical (PA), we were consuming about 
163 M3/ tonof water. Over the years we have constantly strived and have drastically brought down the water 
consumption by 95%

Chemicals Ltd.

5.	
Reducing waste water and going to Zero Discharge
	
Having recovered almost all the chemicals to produce Fine Chemicals and having reduced our water consumption 
by over 95% it was easy for us to aim for Zero Discharge. By 2007, this major initiative, involving complete 
treatment and recycle of all waters back to the process enabled us to become one of the first Zero Discharge 
chemical sites in India and globally. This system is also being continuously upgraded with the latest technology 
available.
6.	
Safety & Health
	
All manufacturing plants and petrochemical plants in particular demand a high level of safety and health protection 
for our staff, our contractors and our many partners. Since 2000, we have steadily improved our safety and 
health performance, as we learnt from other companies, our global customers and from our consultants. We 
have reached a good level of safety and health protection both in manufacturing operations, allied functions like 
R&D and in construction of new plants. 
7.	
Organizational Sustainability
	
From its early days, TCL was forced to build and train its own technical and commercial workforce. We had built 
a highly technology intensive, highly automated petrochemical company in the then remote - underdeveloped 
area lacking technical schools, engineering& technical manpower. Poor living conditions and connectivity made 
it impossible to attract and train competent staff to operate &manage such complex facilities. By 1980, we 
developed our own model where we setup a training program. 
	
This program continues and provides us with a young team regenerated regularly and managed & guided by 
more experienced staff. We are extremely proud of our staff and TCL alumni and they in turn are very proud that 
they belong to this select group. Many of our middle and senior management have started as trainees.
8.	
Living in harmony with the community
	
The above initiatives of a zero wastewater discharge, water use reduction and scrubbing out of all chemicals so 
that our off gases are completely clean, safe and free of smell has helped us develop a close rapport with the 
communities around us.
	
As a part of the core culture of our founders and organizations, in 1983,we initiated, supported& managed in-
depth programs in women’s empowerment and rural health care projects in and around Ranipet, where we have 
our main plant. These are operated by a separate trust, The Thirumalai Charity Trust (TCT). Since then TCT has 
grown in these 4 decades as an independent and large organization which continues its work with rural women, 
rural health care and education.
	
In line with the philosophy of our founders, the hospital and school projects serve the rural and the economically 
challenged communities along with the well-educated and developed communities that have grown here. This 
guarantees good quality.
	
All these programs are actively supported by TCL, the other companies in the group and many other donors. 
We consider these initiatives a key part of our DNA and our management and staff are deeply involved in these; 
however, they are managed as completely independent entities with their own management and operational 
teams and goals.
	
To continue the momentum, TCL will embark on a journey towards sustainability aligning with the national and 
international goals. TCL will implement processes with continuous improvements across multiple dimensions of 
the Environment, social and governance frame works. Warmly, 
Warmly,
Mr. R. Parthasarathy

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE
	
This procedure covers the identification of potential accident and emergency situations and the response plan for 
them.
	
Responsibility: Head – Safety.
	
Reference: ISO 14001:2015 – Clause 8.2 – Emergency preparedness and response ISO 45001:2018 – Clause 8.2 - 
Emergency preparedness and response
	
Identification: The emergency situations are identified based on a detailed analysis of all the activities and products 
handled in this Organization and their environmental aspects and types of occurrences. The following incidents have 
been identified as potential emergency situations requiring an action plan
	
1. Major fire 2. Release of inflammable liquid 3. Explosion 4. Natural Calamities 5. Structural collapse / Bomb threat 6. 
Uncontrolled leakage of hazardous chemicals 7. Deluge of untreated effluent or of high-pressure steam. Hence, each 
one of them or a combination of them can be an emergency situation.
Applicability
The emergency situations may occur in any one of the following locations:
	
Factory premises at SIPCOT, RANIPET
 Receiving terminal at Walaja Road Railway Station, Ammoor, and
 Storage Installation at Royapuram, Chennai, near Chennai Port
An emergency preparedness and contingency plan has been drawn for each of these three locations. These plans include 
all the actions identified to contain the situation. The Head – Safety in consultation with the Heads of Terminals and Heads 
of production, prepares the plans, which are checked and approved by the management representative. The action plans 
are available with Heads of terminals and Head Safety.
Testing: Periodic emergency preparedness and response drills are conducted without any prior notice by the Head – Safety 
with permission from Head- Works. The mock drills are conducted for each of the identified emergency situations and 
observations are recorded. The mock up drills are also conducted as tabletop drills for easy understanding and improvement.
Head- Safety keeps a schedule of the mock up drills for the field as well as for table top.
Review: The emergency preparedness and response plans are reviewed based on the observations recorded by Head – 
Safety  during mock drills and actual emergency situations. Revisions are made if any gaps are identified.
Disaster recovery systems for SAP servers available and regular daily backup are taken.
