Business Responsibility  & Sustainability Report
India Power Corporation Limited (the Company) is one of India’s leading smart-holistic-sustainable power utilities, operating 
in India’s only parallel licensee distribution area- Asansol-Raniganj. The century old Company dates its roots back to 1919 
when India was still under the British Raj. One of the core values of the Company’s operational functions is ‘sustainability’ 
which was ingrained from the moment the Company received its power distribution license in 1935. Over the passage of 
time, India Power witnessed gargantuan changes in the political, social and business scenarios of the industry; the most 
impactful one being the Indian Independence. The Company has been exposed to British management, public sector 
administration and now, private leadership. The legacy of a power utility to survive and expand for 104 years can be attributed 
to its continuous pursuit of excellence in business, environment protection and social sustainability.
The Company transformed and adapted to the changing dynamics of the industry by strengthening its distribution 
network, imbibing disruptive technologies and innovations, dipping its foot in green technology and practicing community 
development.
The initial distribution model was aimed at the coal mines and industries, which later expanded to cater to the needs of 
the railways and the commercial market and eventually, ventured to address the needs of the low tension (LT) domestic 
segment. The Company continues to maintain a T&D loss of 3% which is the lowest in the country and has been achieved 
by continuously upgrading technical parameters. The Company has transformed itself into a digital organisation with 
continuous adoption of smart meters, implementation of SCADA for controlling industrial processes, a GIS equipped sub-
station etc. Taking the logistical expertise one step ahead, The Company will install, operate and maintain 3.5 lakh smart 
meters in the cities of Ujjain and Indore.
The future of power industry is green and the Company has ventured into green initiatives with complete gusto. Out of the 
total 220 MW of Company’s power procurement, 40 per cent is green energy which the Company plans to expand to 50 per 
cent over the year. The Company also has a separate wing that deals in renewable energy, under which; it produces wind 
energy in the states of Gujarat and solar energy in Asansol.
The Company gives earnest attention to social and community development in its license area. The corporate philosophy of 
the Company has an unique culture comprising of 3Ds – Discipline, Dedication and Devotion which transcends beyond work 
and is also reflected in the ‘act of giving back’. For the Company, social sustainability is equivalent to business sustainability 
and the Company considers its duty to aid in the development of the community and the stakeholders of where it operates. 
This has led to the development of several signature projects aimed at the benefits of the marginalised communities; such 
as, Medha – scholarships to promote girl child education, Ananya – to identify and award women achievers, Karigari Mela 
– to promote cultural heritage, Swastha Samriddhi – to promote health and hygiene, #giftgreen to promote green initiatives 
and more. The robust social sustainability enterprises are a part of the business module because most of the projects are 
implemented internally as Company does not believe in outsourcing its responsibility to the society.
The Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR) is provided in lieu of Business Responsibility Report (BRR) 
published in earlier years and is aligned with the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBCs), issued by 
the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in March 2019 and is in accordance with clause (f) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 
34 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended from time to time (Listing Regulations). The Company’s Business Performance and Impacts are disclosed based 
on the 9 Principles as mentioned in the NGRBCs.

The Company reaches proactively to the Team members, Managers and the HODs and follows a process driven 
approach to prevent any adverse consequences due to pending Employee grievances /complaints. In addition to formal 
and informal methods, lag indicators like Employee Productivity, Grievances, Safety and Employee Attrition rates are 
also used to gauge employee support climate.
Employee Grievances are captured online through HRMS and offline through various other open forums. Data from 
these sources are collated, analyzed and necessary actions are initiated and executed effectively. Voluntary exit of 
employees and analysis of the reasons for exit provide indicators regarding Employee’s dissatisfaction. Even though 
absenteeism is negligible, it is tracked. Various data on HR indicators are used to assess and improve employee 
engagement. Corrective steps taken are like counselling the reporting managers, facilitation in providing better 
infrastructure and support etc.
For our workmen Grievance register is maintained at Asansol. There are regular meetings Leadership Team wherein 
the issues and grievances are addressed by the team. Union Management meetings happens periodically. Grievances 
of workman and union are resolved jointly by the Union Leaders and the Management representatives.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
In Power Generation Sector- Hazardous and toxic chemicals are Sulphuric Acid and Caustic Soda - which are used for 
treatment of water for boiler uses. Since we have adopted Zero Discharge Plant, hazardous and toxic chemicals use 
is minimum.
For Distribution: Only transformer oil is used for transformers and the same is being filtrated regularly. Once their life 
cycle gets completed, same is disposed through authorised vendors for re-cycling.
