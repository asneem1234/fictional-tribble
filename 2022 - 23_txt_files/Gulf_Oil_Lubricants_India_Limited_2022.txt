Water and 
Effluents
Risk & 
Opportunity
Water is an important natural resource for 
our business. Effective water management 
and conservation efforts help in saving cost 
and ensure smooth business operation. 
Effluent water often contains contaminants 
and if the discharge of effluent water is not 
properly controlled or treated then it poses 
several risks for the environment. Zero liquid 
discharge from plants minimise all such risks.
We have taken significant steps to 
ensure responsible management of 
wastewater by implementing efficient 
wastewater treatment systems. Both 
plants are equipped with zero liquid 
discharge (ZLD) facilities. These ZLD 
plants are designed to effectively treat 
and process wastewater, leaving no 
liquid discharge behind. Instead, the 
treated wastewater is either reused 
within the facility or undergoes further 
treatment.
Positive
Waste 
management 
and 
Circularity
Risk
Improper disposal of lubricant waste can 
contaminate water, land, and seawater with 
harmful chemicals, impacting ecosystems 
and human health. Non-compliance 
with waste management regulations 
poses risks to the organisation. Proper 
waste management is crucial to prevent 
environmental and legal consequences, 
emphasising the need for responsible 
disposal, recycling, and compliance with 
regulations.
We have robust waste management 
practices adopting the 3R principle - 
Reduce, Recycle & Reuse Principle. We 
also onboarded a waste management 
agency to collect waste on its behalf 
to comply with Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) Regulation.

Risk

Climate change pose both risk and

climate change also offers opportunities for 
Gulf Oil to develop sustainable products.

Human capital development plays a vital role

Occupational 
Health and 
safety
Risk and 
opportunity
Occupational Health and Safety can be 
viewed as a risk management strategy 
aimed at mitigating and minimising work 
environment-related risks. Occupational 
health and safety pose hazard risks, 
human risk, legal and compliance risks and 
reputational risks.
Gulf Oil has a robust Health & Safety 
management system and process 
in place. The Company identifies 
and mitigates risks through Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment  
(HIRA) and aspect impact study. 
Additionally, the company places 
great importance on employee 
training, conducting regular and 
frequent sessions to educate and 
update employees on health and 
safety measures. By investing in 
comprehensive training programs, 
Gulf Oil equips its workforce with the 
necessary knowledge and skills to 
prioritise and maintain a safe working 
environment. This proactive approach 
to health and safety not only safeguards 
employees from potential hazards but 
also reinforces our commitment to their 
well-being.

Both of the company's manufacturing plants are equipped with an advanced Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system, 
ensuring that no liquid waste is discharged from the facilities. The sewage water generated within the plants 
undergoes a comprehensive treatment process in the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Once treated, the water is 
efficiently utilised for various purposes such as landscaping and toilet flushing, minimising the need for freshwater 
consumption. This not only ensures compliance with effluent discharge regulations but also minimises the impact on 
local water resources by optimising the reuse and recycling of treated water within the plants.

A. 	 Gulf Oil has set up AdBlue® manufacturing facility at both Silvassa and Chennai Plants with capacity of 12,000 
KL and 18000 KL per annum respectively. Gulf AdBlue® was designed to meet the ever-evolving needs of 
customers. AdBlue® is premium quality automotive technical grade aqueous urea solution conforming to ISO 
22241-1. AdBlue® provides significant environment benefits by reducing hazardous NOx from gases emitted by 
vehicles. Use of AdBlue® is compulsory for all medium and heavy-duty BS-VI diesel vehicles.
	
B.	
8 diesel-based forklifts have been replaced with battery-based forklifts which reduced the emissions (due to 
diesel-based forklifts) by 70%.
	
C.	
Gulf Oil converted thermopacs to run on Piped Natural Gas (PNG) instead of High-Speed Diesel (HSD). This
