Suprajit Engineering Limited
Enabling a world in motion
MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR AND GROUP CEO
We are a global supplier of engineered products and sub-systems serving the customers. We utilize our engineering and material 
expertise, propriety technology, manufacturing skill, distribution ﬂexibility & marketing power to deliver products and services of value 
to our customers. We are committed to responsible Sustainable development in the procurement process by contributing to 
environmental protection, enhancing sustainability performance and eliminate environmental, social and ﬁnancial risks. As we approach 
the end of the reporting period, I wanted to take a moment to share my thoughts on our recently compiled Business Sustainability and 
Responsibility (BRSR) report.
First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to all the team members who have contributed to the creation and completion of the 
BRSR report. Your dedication and hard work in gathering, analyzing, and presenting the data and information have been instrumental in 
producing a comprehensive and insightful document. 
Our BRSR report is not just a requirement; it reﬂects our commitment to sustainable and responsible business practices. It showcases our 
eﬀorts in areas such as environmental stewardship, social responsibility, ethical conduct, and corporate governance. It provides a 
transparent view of our impact on the environment, society, and stakeholders, highlighting both our achievements and areas where we 
can improve. 
I would like to acknowledge the progress we have made in integrating sustainability into our business operations. Our initiatives to 
reduce waste, conserve resources, promote employee well-being, and engage with local communities have yielded positive results. The 
report demonstrates our commitment to creating long-term value while minimizing any negative impact we may have. However, the 
BRSR report also serves as a roadmap for continuous improvement. It identiﬁes areas where we can further enhance our sustainability 
eﬀorts and address any gaps or challenges, we may face. Sustainability is not a one-time endeavor but an ongoing commitment. Each of 
us has a role to play in integrating sustainable practices into our daily work and decision- making processes. By embracing sustainability 
as a core value, we can build a more resilient, responsible, and successful organization. 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is our main means to directly contribute to the sustainable development of communities. We have 
been participating in community work in the areas of education, healthcare and rural development.  
I invite all team members to share their ideas, suggestions, and concerns regarding our sustainability journey. Your input is invaluable as 
we continue to reﬁne our strategies and set ambitious yet achievable goals. 
Let us remain committed to our sustainability goals, driven by the belief that responsible business practices not only beneﬁt our 
organization but also contribute to a better world for future generations. Together, we can create a lasting impact and be a catalyst for 
positive change in our industry. Finally, I want to express my appreciation to all stakeholders who have supported and guided us in our 
sustainability endeavors. Our customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, and communities play a vital role in shaping our 
sustainability journey, and we value your collaboration and partnership.
Best regards, 
Mohan NS
