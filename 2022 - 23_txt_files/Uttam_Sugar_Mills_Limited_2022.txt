1
Raw Material
Sourcing
Risk
Sugar industry is an 
agro based industry 
and 
its 
main 
raw 
material is sugarcane. 
In any year, if there 
is 
a 
shortfall 
in 
sugarcane production 
on account of adverse 
climatic 
conditions, 
the amount of sugar 
produced 
by 
the 
sugar mills is affected 
adversely. Apart from 
climatic 
conditions, 
the sugar cane crop 
may also be impacted 
by the occurrence of 
crop disease. Proper 
water 
management 
through 
irrigation 
during the formative 
stage of the cane is 
critical to the sucrose 
content and overall 
quality of the cane. 
In case the quality /
quantity of cane is 
affected by any of 
the 
aforementioned 
conditions, 
we 
may not be able to 
optimally utilize our 
crushing 
capacity. 
This will directly affect 
our profitability. 
We 
always 
make 
sure 
that sugarcane is sourced 
on time. When the sugar 
season begins we source 
best quality of sugar cane 
for 
which 
we 
conduct 
training of farmers. When 
the 
season 
of 
harvest 
begins we procure the 
sugarcane on time.
Out 
of 
our 
four 
manufacturing units three 
is located in the state of 
Uttar Pradesh and one 
is in Uttarakhand. All the 
units have been located 
at the places where risk 
associated with sugar cane 
sourcing is minimum.
Negative
In case of poor procurement 
of sugar cane, financials 
of the company can be 
impacted. 
Inefficient 
procurement practices in 
raw materials can lead to 
higher procurement costs 
and affect profit margins.

Water 
Management
Risk
Water being a finite 
resource will pose a 
risk to the operations 
of our business.
Uttam Sugar Mills Limited 
has implemented several 
measures to mitigate the 
risks associated with water 
management.
The company has taken 
various measures to reduce 
water consumption in the 
manufacturing process of 
Sugar. 
The Company has also im-
plemented rainwater har-
vesting systems to store 
rainwater for use in its 
manufacturing process.
Negative
Penal provisions can be 
imposed on the Company 
in case where any rule or 
norm as mandated  by 
Central and State Pol-
lution Control Boards is 
breached.
5
Waste
Management
Opportunity
Sustainable 
waste 
management practic-
es and recycling can 
improve environmen-
tal performance and 
reduce 
dependency 
on virgin raw materi-
als, while also poten-
tially increasing finan-
cial returns.
Better our waste seg-
regation 
and 
collection 
processes to improve the 
efficiency of the process.
Positive:
Uttam’s efforts are chan-
nelized towards low waste 
generation in their opera-
tions so that cost can be 
reduced and efficiency can 
be increased.
Further, 
proper 
waste 
management can lead to 
increased efficiency in the 
use of raw materials, as 
waste can be recycled or 
reused in production pro-
cesses. 
6
Consumer 
Welfare
Opportunity
To 
distinguish 
our-
selves 
as 
market 
leaders and most the 
preferred 
consumer 
brand.
Uttam 
has 
established 
strong market connects 
and build legacy brands 
that ensure consumer wel-
fare is ensured.
Positive
Goodwill amongst con-
sumers will convert into 
product sales.

Health &
Safety
Risk
This can lead to de-
creased productivity. 
Health and safety risks 
can result in employee 
injuries and illness im-
pacting 
productivity 
and increase in other 
related 
cost.Hazard-
ous operations, em-
ployee safety is crucial.
Many efforts and initiatives 
have been put in place to 
ensure employee health 
and safety. We always pro-
vide our employees with 
safety gear and equipment 
to make sure they are safe.
Neutral 
Any cost put towards em-
ployee health and safety 
will yield positive results in 
the long term.
8
Climate Risk
Risk
Climate Change can 
have adverse impact 
on our business and 
not having a correct 
strategy or its right 
implementation 
will 
severely 
affect 
the 
business continuity.
Though, we do not have 
any mitigation measures 
to tackle climate change 
related risk. However, we 
make sure that our pro-
duction process is not 
hampered, 
and 
timely 
production and delivery of 
products is ensured.

itability of the company.

The production of Sugar from Sugarcane is an eco-friendly virtuous cycle. All the by-products generated during 
the manufacturing process are to be productively utilised viz. bagasse is utilised for power generation; molasses 
is utilised to produce distillery products and other wastes generated like press mud and ash generated from 
incineration boilers are utilised for manufacture of organic manure. The Company has also issued guidelines to 
every units of the Company on the waste management to monitor performance for each unit  on a regular basis.

1.
Use 
of 
released 
emissions to operate 
distillery unit
Latest emission control technology (ESP) is installed 
along with boiler.
To reduce ambient air pollution caused by 
suspended particulate matter, we added wet 
scrubbers (benchmark below 150 PPM and target 
below 100 PPM).
Saving in fuel and ground 
water extraction and reducing 
in emission.
Environmental 
innovation, 
employee awareness building, 
reduced

technology 
adoption.
2.
Effluent Management
MEE is installed to concentrate the distillery 
effluents and generate slop which is being used as 
supplementary fuel in boiler.
Effluent generated in plant treated by ETP plant by 
achieving all parameters as per CPCB guidelines 
and treated water is being used for irrigation.

USML invested in advance equipment and 
technology to conserve electricity and use it 
judiciously. As a long-term hedge, the organization 
has 
generated 
proprietary

2022-23 , the USML consumed 307.78 lakhs units 
within its system and sold 312.69 lakhs units to 
the state electricity grid. USML also switched from 
using incandescent lights to LEDs in order to save 
more energy.
We have sold 49945220 kwh in Fy 2021-22 and
