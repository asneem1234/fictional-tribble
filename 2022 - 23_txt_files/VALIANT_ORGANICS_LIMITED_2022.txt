1
Increased 
temperature 
and heat waves
Risk
Increase in temperature and 
prolonged heat waves may 
create unsafe environment 
and cause health & safety risks 
for the workforce
The company is also looking 
at building shed to reduce

Water Scarcity
Risk
Water scarcity & less rainfall/
droughts might impact the 
production processes as water 
is one of the main resources 
consumed by the company.
All plant locations are located 
in industrial zones where 
water is provided by the 
Government so the risk is 
minimized. Additionally, all 
plant location have water 
storing facilities to maintain 
reserves upto a weeks' worth 
of water requirement in case 
of extreme emergency.
Negative
3
New 
environment-
friendly 
products
Opportunity
There is growing demand 
for products free of 'forever 
chemicals'. 
Regulatory 
landscape is also evolving 
globally 
to 
reduce 
the 
amount of chemicals used in 
various business sectors like 
agriculture, pharmaceuticals, 
food, etc. Such increasing 
focus on sustainability and 
increasing preference for such 
'greener' products - represents 
an area of increasing market 
opportunity for us.

Phenol, PNCB & ONCB) are procured from multinationals with their own sustainability targets & initiatives thereby 
(indirectly) contributing to the Company’s own sustainable sourcing process.
Requirements of various Indian and global chemical standards/regulations are also included in various standard 
operating procedures and protocols for onboarding suppliers. Utmost care is taken to ensure that products conform

Only government accredited suppliers are chosen for waste management activities to ensure strictest level of 
compliance.

STATUTORY REPORT
FINANCIAL SECTION
Annual Report 2022-23 - 117
Focus on effective waste management is an important aspect of the company operations. The Company ensures the 
sustainability of resources by reducing, reusing, recycling and managing waste. It has embraced the “3-R” (Reduce, 
Reuse and Recycle) philosophy leading to minimisation of waste in line with legal requirements and industry best 
practice. The Company continuously implements newer processes and technologies to reduce the amount of waste 
generated through the processes. During the FY, the Company has installed a diffuser system for bio reaction purposes 
to allow additional water from the production process to pass through to convert to steam for subsequent usage in 
the plant operations. A study is also being undertaken to achieve reduction in the quantity of solid waste generated 
as by-product of the production processes.
In 5 of the 6 manufacturing locations, the company has implemented a ZLD policy. SCARA system is also used for 
automatic segregation of water for primary treatment. All waste water and hazardous waste from the process is 
treated before reusing or disposing.
Strict protocols are in place to ensure that the hazardous waste generated as part of the production process is 
disposed as per the guidelines of respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB). The company only works with 
designated waste recyclers to help with collection, recycling, and disposal. GPS system is used and detailed logs and 
records are maintained for traceability and tracking from plant premises to landfill sites.

elevators, wheel chair ramps, etc. depending on the business requirements.

age, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, or any other category protected by applicable law.
