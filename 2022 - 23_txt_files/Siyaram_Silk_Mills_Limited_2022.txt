Product 
design & 
lifecycle 
management
Opportunity
Given the fact that textile 
is a resource intensive 
industry, manufacturing 
of sustainable products 
becomes very important 
from an environment and 
societal point of view. 
Textile lifecycle assessment 
and design sustainability 
are important to ascertain 
and reduce the negative 
environmental impacts 
throughout the textile 
life cycle. A transition 
to circular economy is 
the need of the hour, to 
reduce use of resources 
and waste and better 
capture the value of 
underutilized and landfilled 
or incinerated clothes.
The Company manufactures 
products which by their nature 
are environment friendly. We have 
an in-house R & D Department 
which carries out activities such as 
product and quality improvement, 
development of new designs, new 
products, cost control and energy 
conservation. All these initiatives 
help us to attain sustainability in the 
products we manufacture.
Positive:-  
Increase in 
revenues due 
to increasing 
demand for 
more sustainable 
products
-	
R&D and 
innovation 
leading to 
launch of 
new blends 
and designs
2
Customer 
centricity
Opportunity
Customers being the key 
pillars of any company, 
it is important to keep 
customer-centricity at the 
core of the business and 
ensure that it is followed 
both in thinking and 
practice.
At Siyaram, all our initiatives, 
strategies, and plans are framed with 
the ideology of having a satisfied 
and happy customer. We work 
rigorously to translate customer 
feedback into our portfolio. This 
involves producing high-demand 
products and launching modern 
designs that suits the taste and 
preferences of our customer’s 
wardrobes. We continue to be 
squarely focused on providing the 
best clothing experience to the 
customer.
Positive:
- Satisfied 
customers can 
lead to repeat 
purchase, 
thereby 
increasing 
revenues
- New product 
development as 
per customer 
demands
- Increase 
in brand 
reputation
3
Sustainable 
sourcing
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Integration of social, 
ethical and environmental 
performance factors into 
the process of selecting 
suppliers is critical for 
a textile manufacturing 
company.
The Company endeavours to focus 
on protection of environment, 
stakeholders interest and cost 
effectiveness while procuring any 
raw material or goods. We are 
consistently trying to incorporate 
sustainability in our raw material 
procurement. For example, Siyaram 
is one of the leading players in 
Polyviscose within India. 
Positive:
- Cost efficiencies 
due to usage 
of lesser raw 
materials, 
recycled input 
materials, 
and flexible 
production

While most competitors use cotton 
as a primary raw material, Siyaram 
uses Polyviscose as a substitute raw 
material, which is less expensive 
and more durable than cotton. 
Alternative materials also help 
mitigate risks arising from rising 
commodity prices and shortage 
of conventional raw materials like 
cotton.
We also encourage local 
procurement of goods and services 
around our plants proximity 
and region. Several community 
development and training initiatives 
are regularly conducted by the 
Individual plant’s HR team in order 
to educate the local vendors, 
improve their capability, enhance 
their skills, raise their scope for 
employment and their standard of 
living.
- Increase in 
revenues due 
to increasing 
demand from 
customers 
for more 
sustainable 
products
Negative:
- Short-term 
business 
disruptions 
on account 
of shift from 
conventional to 
sustainable raw 
materials
4
Energy 
management
Risk/ 
Opportunity
The textile industry is 
one of the major energy 
consuming industries. 
The need of energy 
management has assumed 
paramount importance 
due to the rapid growth 
of process industries 
causing substantial energy 
consumptions in textile 
operations. Therefore, 
process optimizations and 
replacing conventional 
technology with the latest 
methods will lead to 
considerable savings in 
terms of time, money and 
energy efficiency.
The Company is committed to 
environmental sustainability and 
working towards reduction and 
optimal utilization of energy by 
incorporating new techniques and 
innovative ideas. Various green 
energy and greening initiatives 
like installing Solar Energy project 
at Tarapur, Silvassa and Daman 
and tree plantations have been 
undertaken across locations along 
with other initiatives like waste heat 
recovery, VFDs on various machines, 
replacement of tube light with LED 
and high efficiency motor.
Positive:
Energy efficiency 
and cost savings 
in the longer run, 
leading to more 
profitability
Negative:
Cost of transition 
to newer 
technologies in 
the short term

Water and 
wastewater 
management
Risk
The textile industry has 
a huge dependency on 
water, right from cotton 
cultivation to dyeing and 
finishing processes. The 
produced wastewater has 
to be cleaned from, fat, 
oil, colour and other 
chemicals, which are 
used during the several 
production steps. 
Therefore, planning, 
developing, distributing 
and managing the 
optimum use of water is 
especially important for 
a textile manufacturing 
company.
The Company on a continuous basis 
takes several measures to conserve 
water. We have installed RO systems 
for reuse of effluent water. All the 
chemical and dyes dispensing 
systems are automated. We have 
also installed CETPs in some plant 
locations for proper discharge of 
effluents.
Negative:
- Business 
disruption 
due to non-
availability of 
requisite quality 
of water
- Cost 
implications 
due to rising 
water prices
- Reputational 
implications 
due to 
improper 
treatment and 
discharge of 
waste water
- Fines and 
penalties on 
account of non-
adherence to 
water pollution 
regulations
6
Climate 
change 
strategy
Risk
Climate change is 
increasingly being 
recognized as an 
universal issue, with 
broad implications on 
any company’s business 
and its ability to create 
value for its stakeholders. 
Due to its complex 
supply chain and energy-
intensive production, the 
textile industry generates 
nearly 10% of world GHG 
emissions. Therefore, 
a large-scale systemic 
change is needed for the 
industry to limit global 
warming to 1.5 °C above 
pre-Industrial Revolution 
levels. Hence, we consider 
climate risk as one of the 
important material issue.
We are taking concerted efforts in 
anticipating the adverse effects of 
climate change to our business & 
operations and taking appropriate 
actions to mitigate the different 
implications of climate change and 
other ESG-related factors across all 
our business operations.
Negative:
- Costs of 
transition to a 
lower-carbon 
economy
- Business 
disruption due 
to extreme 
weather 
events, such 
as cyclones, 
hurricanes, 
heat or cold 
waves, or floods 
and resultant 
revenue impact

Supply chain 
management
Risk/ 
Opportunity
The Textile Industry 
is characterized by a 
complex production 
network which spans many 
businesses and crosses 
national and international 
boundaries. Therefore, 
management of ESG risks 
within a company’s supply 
chain and addressing 
issues associated with 
environmental and social 
externalities created by 
suppliers through their 
operational activities is 
important for supply chain 
sustainability.
We evaluate our suppliers and 
vendors on environmental 
responsibility, human rights, labour 
practices, and ethics and corruption, 
along with the required quality 
standards to ensure the highest 
standards in material procurement.
This proactive approach strengthens 
supply chain resilience, promotes 
responsible supplier relationship and 
mitigates any adverse impacts on 
the environment and society.
Positive:
ESG-compliant 
suppliers to 
drive resource 
efficiencies 
across the value 
chain
Negative:
-  Short-term 
business 
disruptions 
on account of 
non-compliant 
suppliers
-  Cost 
implications
Z
Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
As the textile industry is a 
labour-oriented industry, 
unsafe practices can 
affect the well-being of 
workers and their families. 
Therefore it is important to 
lay down and scrupulously 
comply with the safety 
procedures and protocols 
to prevent any potential 
hazards.
We have implemented an 
occupational health and safety 
management system and framed 
a Safety, Health & Environment 
(SHE) policy which lays down clear 
safety protocols and instructions to 
be followed across all plants, by all 
employees. We also provide regular 
safety trainings for employees and 
conduct safety assessments of 
plants.
Negative:
An unsafe and 
unhealthy work 
environment 
impact the 
physical and 
mental health 
of employees/ 
workers, 
consequently 
impacting 
productivity, 
which in turn 
affects the 
company’s ability 
to fulfil demand, 
cater to customer 
requirements and 
grow revenues.
9
Digitalization
Opportunity
Digitalisation helps to 
automate and streamline 
business process by 
reducing errors and 
therefore improves 
efficiency and accuracy.
The Company can 
understand and meet the 
needs of customers in a 
better way by leveraging 
customer data and 
insights, personalise their 
offerings and improve 
customer experience.
As part of our digitalisation initiative 
we have implemented a customer 
collection system, which enable 
customer view their outstanding 
invoices in real time and allow 
instant payment through the system 
itself. This facilitates auto posting 
in Siyaram SAP system thereby 
enabling us to eliminate the manual 
reconciliation process.
Positive
Cost efficiency 
due to 
automation and 
elimination of 
manual efforts.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG -related challenges, targets, and achievements
	
The textile industry continues to be one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions and biodiversity loss among all industrial sectors. In FY2023, the global economic headwinds in terms of 
marketplace unpredictability, global volatility in commodities, surging prices for crude, and a challenging logistics environment caused a great deal of uncertainty to the integrated supply chain 
affecting most of the commodities and especially metals, plastics and paper for the company. While Covid-19 and related disruptions in the last few years brought to fore the importance of a 
skilled workforce, shortage of skilled labour and managing our relationship with the workforce emerged as key social dimensions of ESG for the company, along with continued focus on customer 
satisfaction and community relations.
	
The Company has for more than 4 decades been conducting its business activities in a responsible manner. Our values, ethics, and governance have always paramount to us, and profitability is 
the by-product of it. In FY2023, we commenced our journey to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles into its business and took steps to strengthen our commitments 
towards sustainability as our contribution, we complied with our designated corporate social responsibility, ensured business sustainability, and kept our business ethical and transparent. We 
undertook a baseline assessment of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and set internal targets of reducing the same through several measures, including changes to our infrastructure and 
implementing new technologies such as increasing our renewable energy consumption through more solar rooftop installations. We also conducted an ESG materiality assessment to identify 
topics material to the company and sector to help us outline our priorities for the future and devise a roadmap to achieve the targets set.
	
Going forward, the company plans to take further strides on its journey towards a more sustainable business by continuing to undertake various initiatives like integrating ESG risks into our 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, building aspirational goals of becoming carbon neutral and water positive for our operations, investing in products and processes that are energy 
efficient, promoting products and services that help in lowering environmental impact, partnering with waste recyclers and supporting communities. The Company and its employees and workers 
will further their commitment to improving the quality of life of the communities they serve, to adhere to the principle of providing quality products, and to enhance the health, safety and 
environmental impacts of the products and services throughout their life cycles. The Company has for the purpose framed policies for climate change, Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) and 
will continue to ensure proper implementation across all its plants and employees. The Company strives to provide employees and business associates a congenial working environment and will 
remain committed to continue its fair business practices to its labour, human capital and to the customers and the community.
