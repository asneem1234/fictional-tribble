Dear Sir/ Madam,

We would like to inform you that while filing the XBRL, we were not able to mention some information exactly in the 
manner that we had mentioned in the PDF document. The main reasons for the same are given hereunder: 
 
1. At certain places XBRL accepts only mentioning of numbers, whereas instead of providing the information

document. 
2. The XBRL accepts only one NIC code, whereas in the PDF document, we have referred to two NIC codes 
that are applicable. 
3. There is an inter-segment elimination adjustment shown in our PDF document, however, there is no 
provision in the XBRL to reflect the same. 
 
In view of the above, for the following Principles / Questions, we would request you to refer our response as stated

BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Statement from the Chair of the ESG & Diversity Equity Inclusion Committee (“ESG & DEI Committee”)
Dear Stakeholders,
We are delighted to present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) for the financial year April 1, 2022 to March 
31, 2023 (“FY23”). We engaged Ernst & Young Associates LLP (“EY”), as a third party to perform an independent limited assurance of our 
BRSR. The independent assurance statement by EY is also enclosed as part of the Annual Report.
HCLTech has undergone significant changes during FY23. We launched a new brand identity and we published our new purpose statement 
– “To bring together the best of technology and our people to supercharge progress”. The mantra of supercharging progress guides how 
we accelerate digital transformation for our clients, advances the aspirations of our people, contributes toward a more sustainable planet 
and works toward equitable and sustainable communities. The disclosures we present in our BRSR, reflect our HCLTech purpose.
The environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) & diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) committee of the board met on four occasions 
in FY23 when HCLTech’s steady progress across these dimensions was reviewed. The key dimensions of our progress against our 
targets, have also been validated by external third-party recognitions. Some of the highlights are outlined below:
•	
MSCI has rated HCLTech as an ESG ‘Leader’ in the software and services industry. This year, HCLTech has been recognized as a 
leader with an “AA” rating, a significant move up from last year’s “A” rating. 
•	
The S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2023 has recognized HCLTech as an ‘Industry Mover’. The Yearbook lists leading companies 
that have demonstrated sustainable business practices in their operations.
• 	
HCLTech has also been included in Sustainalytics’ 2023 Top-Rated ESG companies list in the Software and Services Industry 
segment and in the Asia Pacific Region. 
The progress achieved would not be possible without the appropriate focused execution and resource allocation of the initiatives and 
projects by the respective teams involved.
Each quarter, the committee presented its review on outcomes and relevant milestones to the board. During FY’23, in response to the 
recommendations of the committee, HCLTech has implemented an internal audit system covering all ESG disclosures. The outcome of 
the audit was reviewed by the Audit Committee of the board. 
A separate sustainability report for FY’23 will also be published to give more details on the sustainability strategy implementation and the 
performance against the commitment and goals that have been outlined by HCLTech. 
We will be eager to have your feedback on the BRSR disclosures and the sustainability report and look forward to hearing from you.

the engagement is channelised inside the organization and ensures that the stakeholder gets the right feedback or resolution as the 
case may be. Internal Stakeholders of the Company include employees, senior leaders, managers, Board of Directors, members 
of HCL Foundation. External stakeholders include customers, investors, regulatory bodies, vendors, service providers and media. 
The stakeholder engagement exercise has helped the Company’s ESG focus areas in line with its underlying philosophy of Act, 
Pact & Impact. Stakeholder engagement is a critical aspect of HCLTech’s ESG strategy. Stakeholder engagement at HCLTech is a 
continuous process and helps us gauge and address the expectations of our stakeholders.

responsible IT asset management. Training sessions and awareness campaigns were organized to promote proper recycling 
and data wiping before disposal.
■	
Performance Monitoring and Reporting: Ensured regular monitoring and reporting on IT waste metrics, such as the quantity 
of electronic waste generated, stored and recycling rates, to track progress and identify areas for improvement. 
• 	
Paper – With the aim of reducing paper consumption, initiatives like printer pin deployment, printer on alternate floors, setting 
up maximum printing limit, double side printing and reduction in font size are encouraged. These measures have resulted in 
significant conservation of paper.

Independent Assurance Statement
The Management and Board of Directors  
HCL Technologies Limited
Noida (Uttar Pradesh), India
Scope 
We have been engaged by HCL Technologies Limited to perform Independent Limited assurance, as defined by International Standards 
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000), hereafter referred to as the engagement, to report on HCL Technologies Limited BRSR 
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report) Report (the “Subject Matter”) for the period from 1st April 2022 to 31st March 2023.  
Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance 
procedures on the remaining information included in the Report, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information.
Criteria applied by HCL Technologies Limited
In preparing the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) FY 23, HCL Technologies Limited applied Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) BRSR guidelines. As a result, the subject matter information may not be suitable for another purpose.
HCL Technologies Limited Responsibilities  
HCL Technologies Limited management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) FY 23 in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and 
maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records, and making estimates relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such 
that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
EY’s Responsibilities   
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter based on the evidence we have obtained.  
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’). The terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with HCL Technologies Limited. 
The Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures

Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  
Description of procedures performed   
Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to 
obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide 
a reasonable level of assurance.  
Although we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, 
our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls 
or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.  
A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) FY 23 and related information and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.
