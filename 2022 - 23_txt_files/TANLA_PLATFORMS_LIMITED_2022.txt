9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
 
We are committed to environmental sustainability and has implemented an e-waste policy to address the growing problem of 
electronic waste. As an environmentally conscious organization, we actively practice e-waste recycling and disposal through 
authorized recyclers to minimize adverse effects. We emphasize the importance of recycling in preserving ecological balance, 
reducing landfills, and conserving resources. By recycling e-waste, the organization aims to save energy, prevent pollution, and 
contribute to a greener environment. We also encourage employees to follow the policy by handing over electronic products 
only to authorized recyclers. Overall, the focus of our e-waste policy is on promoting responsible e-waste management 
practices. 
 
As part of our policy, we practice waste segregation directly at each of our office sites. This segregation involves categorizing 
waste into paper waste, plastic waste, food waste, batteries, and e-waste. Non-hazardous solid waste is then responsibly 
handed over to the municipal corporation corresponding to each office location. Furthermore, any e-waste and battery waste 
generated is carefully transferred to authorized vendors for proper recycling.
