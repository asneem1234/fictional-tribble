Message from the Chairman and Managing Director
Making bold strides in innovation 
and stringent capital allocation
Dear Shareholders,
It has always been a pleasure for me to share my thoughts 
with you at the culmination of an exciting and productive 
year. The last couple of years have been challenging 
and uncertain. While we remain optimistic about better 
prospects, I hope all of you and your loved ones are safe and 
well. This comprehensive report not only reflects our efforts 
to make the company more sustainable throughout the 
year, but also outlines our approach for “Going Sustainable, 
Growing Bigger” for the years to come.
If we talk about the automotive sector, it is undergoing an 
unprecedented transformation that will undoubtedly have 
a far-reaching impact on both the industry and its users. 
Across the world, several countries are pursuing zero-
emission targets, resulting in the greener, safer and lighter 
vehicles. Governments have set specific timelines to phase 
out internal combustion engine vehicles and the demand for 
zero-emission vehicles is being fuelled by renewable energy 
sources, government policies, subsidies and tax rebates. 
Advanced engineering in making vehicle autonomous is 
resulting in electronic content increase in the vehicles. These 
trends, along with supply chain constraints and the ongoing 
war in Ukraine, pose challenges as well as opportunity to the 
global automotive industry.
There is a change in consumer preferences towards greener 
& safer vehicles. In stable economies such as the U.S.A., 
Europe and Japan, factors such as inflation are driving the 
demand for clean and energy-efficient vehicles. However, 
in dynamic markets, including China and recently India, 
factors such as rapid urbanisation and the rise of a young 
and influential middle class in the workforce have led to 
a shift in preferences towards sporty SUVs rather than 
passenger cars. Additionally, two-wheelers, which are 
primarily associated with leisure and sporting activities in 
advanced economies, continue to dominate as the primary 
mode of transportation in India.
Notwithstanding transient challenges, companies 
that have invested in extensive product development 
capabilities and state-of-the-art manufacturing systems 
will clearly emerge as winners in an industry that is rapidly 
consolidating and unfolding new opportunities.
INDUSTRY SNAPSHOT
ANALYSING THE MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
In my last letter, I spoke at length about the VUCA 
environment, a world characterised by Volatility, 
Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity. Reflecting on 
the year gone by, it is evident that we have continued 
to navigate this VUCA environment, attempting various 
strategies to steer our businesses with varying degrees 
of success. The interplay of geopolitical events and the 
posturing of global economic and military powers have 
Varroc is future ready 
and well positioned 
to address the 
technological shift due 
to change in customer 
requirement, new 
trends and government 
regulations. 
substantially influenced our decision making, prompting 
most of us to become more nimble and agile. 
The world, which has long acknowledged India as a crucial 
market, is now beginning to accept that we have a larger 
role to play in determining the world order. Today India 
is occupying a key position in the world. As per recent 
report by world bank where they have emphasized that 
India is one of the fastest growing economies of the world 
and is poised to continue on this path, with aspirations to 
reach high middle-income status by 2047, the centenary 
of Indian independence.
12
Despite the challenging global environment, we 
completed the transaction of divesting our 4 wheeler 
lighting business in Europe and America which we started 
a year before.  Moreover, the remaining business outside 
India is getting integrated with the Indian Business under 
our “One Varroc” principle.
During the fiscal year under review, we improved 
our financial performance. This reflects our ability to 
outperform the market and showcase our efforts to 
continue to demonstrate resilient performance amid 
global headwinds going ahead.
Our revenue from continued operations has grown by 
17.4%, standing at H68,631 million in FY23. Our EBITDA 
stood at H5,986 million, up from H3,892 million in FY22. 
I would like to share that one of the key indicators 
of our operational success is the improvement in our 
EBITDA margin, which was 8.7% during FY23, marking a 
substantial increase of 210 basis points compared to last 
year. Our PAT was H388 million in FY23, as against a loss of 
H783 million in FY22.
Our robust performance and financial stability have been 
recognised by India Ratings and Research. They rated us 
with IND A+ rating with a stable outlook. This external 
validation further instils confidence in our stakeholders 
and reflects our sound business practices and financial 
management. In addition, our efforts to bolster our R&D 
capabilities are bearing fruit. We filed 15 patents from the 
Group during FY23.
We also commercialized products developed by our R&D 
like EFI for ICE vehicles and various products like traction 
motors, traction controllers, TCU, DC-DC convertor etc for EV 
vehicles. New order win have been very strong in FY 2023 
and we won business from 7 prominent EV customers. All of 
this will help us to grow better than the Industry in coming 
years.
LOOKING BACK ON THE YEAR GONE BY
Sustainability lies at the heart of Varroc's ethos. For 
us, integrating sustainability into our operations is not 
just an ethical imperative but a strategic necessity. Our 
dedication to sustainability enables us to create value for 
our stakeholders, enhance our competitiveness, and build a 
resilient future for Varroc and the communities we serve. 
During the fiscal year, we formalised our ESG & 
Sustainability framework. At Varroc, our ESG & 
Sustainability vision is to co-create a sustainable value for 
our stakeholders through innovative research, engineering 
& manufacturing of environmentally sustainable products 
for mobility sector through environment friendly operations 
aligning with our corporate vision to ‘Create safe, smart, 
and sustainable future mobility solutions for everyone’. 
MAKING SUSTAINABILITY OUR PRIORITY
WAY FORWARD
Varroc is future ready and well positioned to address the 
technological shift due to change in customer requirements, 
new trends and government regulation.
As one of the leading automotive suppliers, we are 
constantly evolving and developing futuristic products 
that position us at the forefront of the automotive 
sector’s transformation.  The automotive industry relies 
substantially on research and development. In the 
upcoming years, as the auto ancillary companies becomes 
increasingly attuned to global technological trends, we 
will continue to invest in our core competencies, build 
effective supply chains and world-class manufacturing 
systems and sharpen our technological and management 
capabilities. This will not only help us stay ahead of the 
technology curve, but also lead to our long-term growth 
and development. 
Moreover, we will focus on profitable revenue growth 
driven by sustainable improvement in contribution margin, 
controlling the cost and higher utilisation of the capacity. Free 
cash flow generation and prudent redeployment of capital 
to ensure compounding of value is where the organisation is 
putting all its efforts. Our endeavour remains strengthening 
our customer relationships, as this will position us as a reliable 
systems supplier for leading two wheelers, commercial and 
passenger vehicle manufacturers.
On a concluding note, I would like to take this opportunity 
to extend my sincere gratitude to all our esteemed 
shareholders and partners for the trust they have reposed 
on us. It is their cooperation that has pushed us to raise the 
bar for ourselves while doing what we do best. I am looking 
forward to an exciting year ahead.
Warm regards,
Tarang Jain
Chairman and Managing Director

Message from the
Group Chief Financial Officer
Our aim is to create a very 
good compounding story 
for the investors through 
a combination of growth, 
internal efficiency, FCF 
generation and prudent 
capital deployment.
Dear Shareholders,
Our Company had to face lot of turbulence 
during the last three years due to multiple 
waves of pandemic, chips shortages, geo-
political and associated economic challenges. 
However, management took some bold 
decisions at the right time and exited the 
4-wheeler lighting business in Europe and 
America to stem the losses. Though the cash 
inflow from this divestment was much lower 
than the initial expectations, it enabled our 
Company to prevent further deterioration in its 
financial health.
During the fiscal year 2022-23, our ongoing 
operations registered a revenue of H68,631 
million with an impressive 17.4% growth as 
compared to the previous year. Our EBITDA 
surged to H5,986 million (or 8.7%) from H3,892 
million (or 6.6%) in FY 2021-22 and PAT was 
at H388 million in comparison to a loss of H783 
million in FY 2021-22. 
As the GCFO, I see tremendous opportunity 
for value creation in the coming years as we 
continue to focus more on revenue growth 
and internal efficiencies. I would like to present 
an overview of how we would like to embark 
on this journey towards improved financial 
performance and value creation. We have 
already made free cashflow (FCF) as the 
cornerstone of our performance measurement 
across businesses. We understand that it is 
the consistent growth in free cash flows which 
drives growth in shareholder value.
Our approach is to reap the benefits of 
operating leverage at every stage so that 
the growth in profits is higher than growth in 
revenue as depicted below:
14
organization nimbler. Obviously, all these efforts 
require quality human resources at various levels in the 
organization. We are currently recruiting experienced 
and high-quality human resources in various functions. 
We will also be exploring inorganic opportunities in the 
coming years once our balance sheet is strengthened 
and the internal efficiencies and process improvements 
are realized.
In short, our aim is to create a very good compounding 
story for the investors through a combination of growth, 
internal efficiencies, FCF generation and prudent capital 
deployment.
I am cautiously optimistic about the future as we have 
many opportunities than challenges. The execution of 
our strategy will take time and we may see some ups 
and downs in the coming quarters. But we are clear 
about the path for the long-term and our management 
team will leave no stone unturned towards flawless 
execution. 
In closing, I would like to thank all the internal and 
external stakeholders for their confidence in us during 
the tough times and look forward to their continued 
support. I also extend my appreciation to our personnel 
for their dedication and hard work. 
Best regards,
K. MAHENDRA KUMAR 
GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
For the next couple of years, our objective is to drive 
improvements so that operating leverage works at each 
level to make our bottom-line grow much faster than the 
topline through the multiplier effect.
We are redefining our business model in such a way that 
the revenue growth is accompanied by a strong return 
on incremental invested capital (ROIIC). We are also 
going to work on various opportunities to improve our 
contribution margins through cost reductions in existing 
operations in areas like sourcing, energy, logistics and 
other elements of conversion costs. We currently source 
about 13% of energy from renewable sources. We intend 
to take it to more than 50% in the coming years.
We will also be exploring structural changes to optimize 
our fixed costs and reduce the break-even levels across 
businesses. 
As most of our production facilities have significant 
levels of free capacity, we are expecting that the capex 
spending in the near-term is going to be significantly 
less than depreciation. With enough opportunities to 
drive working capital efficiencies, we are expecting our 
FCF to grow faster than profits. 
Our current net debt levels are at 2.1x of consolidated 
EBITDA and our aim is to reduce it to 1x of EBITDA in the 
coming years with the help of strong FCF generation. 
With interest cost currently taking up to 3% of revenue, 
we see significant opportunity to improve our profits 
through debt reduction.
In addition, we will also be working on strengthening 
internal processes and structure to make the

KHAM RIVER ECO RESTORATION PROJECT
RIVERFRONT DEVELOPMENT SPORTS PARK, 
BABUL GROVE AND GRAMPANI AREAS
The rivers of India play a crucial role in the country's 
economy, culture, and daily life. They provide water for 
irrigation, transportation for goods and people, and are a 
source of hydropower. Additionally, the rivers hold religious 
and spiritual significance for many communities, with 
rituals and festivals often taking place along their banks. 
As part of our endeavour to contribute to the UNSDG 
Goal 6, which aims to ensure availability and sustainable 
management of water and sanitation for all, , we 
implemented a comprehensive initiative that involved 
not only cleaning the river, but also beautifying the river 
through sapling plantation and stone pitching on the 
banks. The initiative also gained widespread media traction 
with over 100 news articles featuring it. This project aligns 
with our overarching goal of sustaining the ecological 
balance and protecting biodiversity.
At Varroc, we have undertaken various riverfront 
development initiatives that has transformed these areas 
into remarkable recreational spaces. Previously plagued 
by open sewage and litter, these areas have undergone 
a stellar transition, becoming a clean and green heaven 
for the community. With careful planning and meticulous 
execution, we have created natural environment with 
under-tree seating elements, lush plantations and well-
defined walking pathways. Water bodies adorned with 
blooming lotuses add a touch of serenity and natural 
beauty. 
In addition, we have incorporated numerous seating spaces 
throughout the area, providing ample opportunities for 
relaxation and enjoyment. Recognising the importance of 
fitness and well-being, we have also built an open gym. To 
cater to the younger generation, dedicated children’s play 
areas have been constructed, ensuring a safe and engaging 
space for them to have fun. These projects reflect our 
commitment to creating spaces that promote recreation, 
serenity and a sense of community. 
The availability of water ponds and fishes has 
served as an excellent microhabitat for flora 
and faunal species (including birds) and the 
overall ecosystem has improved.

for stone-pitching the river, further 
enhancing the river’s aesthetics and 
ensuring its long-term stability.

conduct grooming workshops for 
students. These workshops focus 
on various aspects of personal 
development and include work-
related activities such as Quality 
Week, Safety Week, Technical Expert

technical topics. These initiatives not 
only enhance their knowledge, but 
also instil a sense of confidence and 
competence in them.
Realising the significance of co-
curricular activities, throughout 
the academic year, we celebrated 
key national events such as 
Independence Day, Teacher's Day,

HEALTH AND WELFARE
SPORTS
BLOOD DONATION CAMP
As Varroc, we realise the significance of investing in 
health and welfare as part of our CSR initiatives. This 
commitment is rooted in our core values and the desire 
to make a meaningful impact on our local communities 
and the society at large. By prioritising the holistic 
well-being of the underprivileged, we demonstrate our 
dedication to build stronger communities.
Sports participation has been associated with a range of 
positive developmental indicators, including improved 
self-esteem, emotional regulation, problem-solving 
abilities, goal attainment, social skills and academic 
performance. 
Hence, we prioritise creating a space where 
underprivileged children can utilise their energy and 
passion through sports, diverting them from unhealthy 
practices as outlets for negative emotions. By engaging 
in sports, these children develop essential skills such 
as communication, problem-solving and self-discipline, 
learn the value of teamwork and develop sports ethics. 
By involving children in sports activities, we aim to 
promote their holistic development and provide them 
with opportunities for personal growth.
Celebrating our esteemed Chairman and Managing 
Director, Mr. Tarang Jain's birthday, we organised 
a ‘Blood Donation Drive’ on March 21, 2023, held 
across our corporate office, Plant VII (Valve and 
Forging), and R&D centre within our premises. 
Through the unwavering support of all involved, we 
made a remarkable contribution to a noble cause 
by giving the gift of life through blood donations, 
touching the lives of as many as 103 children.
This noble endeavour not only brought hope 
and relief to those in need but also fostered a 
profound sense of unity and compassion within 
our organisation. By uniting for the cause and 
participating in the blood donation camp, we 
demonstrated our collective commitment to creating 
a meaningful impact in society, reflecting the true 
spirit of benevolence and camaraderie at its best.

Management Discussion and Analysis
1.	 Economic overview
1.1.	Global Economy overview
	
The world economy continues to be stressed on 
account of geopolitical tensions, the lingering effect of 
the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. 
Although the global economy began to show signs 
of improvement in early 2023, recent banking sector 
volatility and high prices have clouded the long-term 
development outlook. The risks are somewhat tilted 
downwards due to high debt levels and geopolitical 
tensions.
	
The pandemic had barely receded when the war 
in Ukraine erupted in February 2022, causing prices 
of food, fuel, and fertilisers to soar. Inflation rates 
accelerated, prompting central banks in advanced 
countries to tighten monetary policies. Developing 
countries, especially in South Asia, faced economic 
stress as weaker currencies and rising import prices 
took its toll.
	
In the latter half of 2022, there was some relief 
for governments and households as commodity 
prices peaked and then declined. However, some 
commodities, such as crude oil prices, remained 
above pre-pandemic levels. For countries dependent 
on imports paid in dollars, a global slowdown led by 
the US offers relief as commodity prices, US interest 
rates and the value of dollar continues to recede.
	
As 2023 dawned, China opened its borders, reversing 
its Zero-Covid policy. A warm winter spared households 
from a significant increase in fuel prices, raising hopes 
that the Eurozone economies would narrowly avoid 
a recession. In the US, the headline inflation rate 
declined, with policy rates set to rise more slowly, and 
bond yields coming down. This led to faint hopes of 
the US avoiding a recession altogether, barring any 
unexpected financial system stress
	
With lower chances of a downturn in advanced 
economies 
and 
the 
resumption 
of 
economic 
activity, export-dependent developing economies 
42
are expected to rebound. However, countries that 
heavily rely on importing essential commodities face 
some concern. Crude oil prices have begun to climb 
in anticipation of higher-than-earlier forecasted 
demand, and wage negotiations are leading to 
upward revisions on either side of the Atlantic.
	
The economic downturn is primarily concentrated in 
advanced economies such as the Eurozone and the 
UK. China is bouncing back quickly after reopening 
its economy, and the supply chain disruptions are 
winding down. The world economy is expected to 
recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's 
conflict with Ukraine. The monetary policies of central 
banks are expected to be successful, leading to a 
decrease in global inflation. Many emerging market 
and developing economies, including India, are 
advancing rapidly, and growth rates are expected to 
increase significantly this year.
	
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and 
other geopolitical factors, there are signs of a gradual 
economic recovery. Emerging market and developing 
economies are leading the way with strong growth rates, 
and inflation is expected to decrease in the coming years.
	
Outlook
	
The International Monetary Fund's forecast suggests 
that global growth will decline from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% 
in 2023 before stabilizing at 3.0% until 2024. Advanced 
economies are expected to see a resurgence in growth 
in 2024, following a decline in 2022 and 2023. While the 
rate of global inflation is expected to decline from 8.7% 
in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023 and 5.2% in 2024, the decline may 
be slower than initially anticipated. Despite this, there 
are positive indicators of a slow but steady recovery 
from the pandemic and supply-chain disruptions. 
China's recovery is particularly notable, and emerging 
markets and developing economies are also making 
strides in the right direction. The success of fiscal and 
monetary policy action to promote economic growth 
will be crucial in determining the economic trajectory. 
While central banks worldwide have been tightening 
monetary policy, it remains unclear whether these 
actions will be successful in reducing inflation and 
promoting sustainable growth. Fiscal measures will be 
crucial, particularly in supporting those impacted by 
the pandemic in their businesses and personal lives.1

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
1.2.	Indian Economic Overview
	
Against a backdrop of global uncertainties, India 
maintained its positive trajectory and ranked among 
the fastest growing major economies in the world. 
The economy is expected to grow at 7.2% for the 
year ending March 2023, following an 9.1% growth in 
the previous financial year2. Consumer price rise has 
slowed considerably, with the annual inflation rate 
below 6%. Wholesale prices are rising at below 5%, and 
the export of goods and services is up 16% compared 
to the same period in 2021-22.
	
Despite high oil prices causing the merchandise trade 
deficit to balloon, concerns over the current account 
deficit and its financing have eased. Foreign exchange 
reserve levels are comfortable, and external debt is 
low. The Indian economy's fundamentals are sound as 
it enters its Amrit-Kaal, the 25-year journey towards its 
centenary as a modern, independent nation.
	
Outlook
	
Inflation in India is projected to be lower for FY24, in 
comparison to FY23, and it is expected to remain in 
the range of 5.0-6.0%. With a surge in demand for 
non-IT and IT services after the pandemic, India is 
anticipated to gain market share in these sectors. The 
self-reliant India programme, Aatmanirbhar Bharat, 
and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme is 
expected to support the country's economic growth 
by enhancing domestic production and the global 
competitiveness of Indian businesses. The country's 
macroeconomic 
stability, 
coupled 
with 
these 
initiatives, will create new job opportunities, fostering 
long-term economic growth.

India has reduced its dependence on imports 
through localised production, making it an 
attractive option for companies looking to tap 
into the Indian market.
	
•	
India’s cost advantage, with costs 10-25% lower 
than Europe and Latin America, further contributes 
to its growth.
	
Role in the Global Value Chain
	
•	
India allows 100% FDI through the automatic route, 
making it easy for foreign players to invest in the 
country.
	
•	
The presence of auto design centres, automotive 
training institutes, special auto parks, and virtual 
SEZs for auto components gives India an edge in 
the global value chain.
	
Geographic Proximity
	
•	
The geographic proximity of key automotive 
manufacturing 
countries, 
including 
ASEAN 
countries and South Korea, creates significant 
opportunities for Indian auto ancillary players.
	
•	
Asia is emerging as a growing market due to 
its cost competitiveness, rising incomes, rapid 
urbanisation, improved infrastructure, and scope 
for greater vehicle penetration.
46
	
Trade Policy
	
Trade policy in India is favourable, with nominal 
restrictions on import-export, making it an attractive 
destination for businesses.
	
The Indian Foreign Trade Policy 2023 proposes a 
number of new programmes, including a one-time 
amnesty programme for exporters to finish up any 
outstanding authorizations and begin again. The Status 
Holder Scheme and the Towns of Export Excellence 
Scheme both promote the recognition of new towns 
and exporters, respectively.

Technology Imports in last three year – Nil 
	
To ensure Varroc’s competency in the global 
automotive market, the R&D process is frequently 
evaluated and updated. EBU R&D has already 
introduced Auto SPICE-L2 and agile development in 
software development. The introduction of “Design 
for Six Sigma” (DFSS) and “DMAIC” as part of the 
development process is also bearing fruit now. We 
have trained 40% of engineers, and 12 of them are 
Green Belt certified and one is Black Belt certified. 
This methodology is also implemented in the product 
development process.
	
FY 2022-23 also saw a significant shortage of 
semiconductor devices, resulting in the need for 
design changes in many products using alternate 
components and testing. The R&D scaled up to 
do faster design changes and testing to meet the 
production demands. 
	
We also integrated PV lighting into EBU R&D after the 
Varroc Lighting System dis-investments. 30-60-90 plans 
were in place to integrate the PV lighting team. The 
team is very well integrated and has started working 
with CoCs on all the customer’s projects. 
	
FY22-23, We have also started implementing PLM for 
product development. Phase-1 of the PLM will be 
68
completed by Oct-23. This is also a great initiative 
towards bringing discipline and quality to the product 
development process.      
	
Advance Engineering
	
EBU & Lighting R&D have also invested significantly 
in advance engineering, focusing on future product

2 are completed. Work is on for 3rd phase activities 
with full vigour.
	
With the obsolescence of ICEs, specifically in 2 wheelers 
& last mile segment, the threat is direct & immediate 
to the engine valves business. Keeping this in mind, the 
upcoming Tech Centre has been envisioned to extend 
MBU’s portfolio for PVs, CVs, HCVs, & EV segments. We 
have critically inscribed the below product offerings:
	
Some of targeted commodities are:
	
●	
Planetary Gears (future products; high Gear ratios)
	
●	
Driveline & steering components (remains in EVs)
	
●	
Differential Gears (integral part of drivetrain; 
remains in EVs)  
	
●	
High end precision gearing (Industrial applications 
with stringent torque & NVH)
	
●	
Forged & Machine parts (non-Auto, Hyd. & 
industrial usage)
	
MBU R&D – Going forward
	
Transmission be it for torque transfer or motion control 
have to undergo bulk of life-threatening challenges 
viz. high reduction ratios (10+), quieter i.e. stringent 
NVH , Compactness i.e. more torque per gram or unit 
cross section, wide range of rapidly changing RPMs 
are to mention few. 
	
Recently @ R&D MBU conceptualized Tech Centre @ 
Waluj VEL7; Proto cell, Fixturing & tooling validation 
setup & technical support centre along with captive 
standard room, DG set & compressor have been 
installed & started working.

Non-Executive Directors within the overall limits 
specified in the Shareholder Resolution.
	
	
Meeting of Independent Directors:

Regulation 25(3) of the Listing Regulations, for 
the Financial Year 2022-23, the Independent 
Directors held a separate meeting on August 12, 
2022 without the attendance of non-independent

Financial 
Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report 
To the Members of Varroc Engineering Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Qualified Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of Varroc Engineering Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2023, 
the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the statement of 
Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement 
and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, except for 
the possible effects of the matter described in the “Basis 
of Qualified Opinion” section of our report, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company 
as at March 31, 2023, its loss including other comprehensive 
income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the 
year ended on that date. 
Basis for Qualified Opinion
We draw attention to Note 52 to the standalone financial 
statements regarding the sale of VLS Business.  As more 
fully described in the said note, there is disagreement 
between the parties on the final adjustments against 
agreed consideration and both the parties have agreed 
to negotiate to reach an agreement.  Pending conclusion 
of these negotiations, we are unable to comment on the 
impact of the same on the net loss and financial position 
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023.
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described 
in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance 
with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the financial year 
ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.  In addition to the matter described in the ‘Basis 
for Qualified Opinion’ section, we have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report. For each matter below, 
our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone 
financial statements section of our report, including in 
relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included 
the performance of procedures designed to respond to 
our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements. The results of our 
audit procedures, including the procedures performed 
to address the matters below, provide the basis for our 
qualified audit opinion on the accompanying standalone 
financial statements.
148
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
De-recognition of trade receivables under factoring arrangements (as described in note 12 of the standalone financial 
statements)
The 
Company 
enters 
into 
non-recourse 
factoring 
arrangements for its trade receivables with various banks/
financial institutions.
As at March 31, 2023, the Company derecognised 
trade receivables amounting to Rs. 1,000.00 million.  The 
Company derecognizes the receivables from its books if it 
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset (i.e. receivables).
The assessment of derecognition of trade receivables 
under the factoring arrangements is complex and requires 
judgement.
Accordingly, this has been identified as a key audit matter 
in our audit of the standalone financial statements
The audit procedures performed by us included the 
following:
•	
Evaluated the assessment made by management 
in respect of transfer of substantially all risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial assets under the 
factoring contracts;
•	
Read samples of factoring contracts to understand 
the terms and assessed if they qualify as non-recourse 
agreements and further assessed the accounting 
as per the requirements of Ind AS 109, “Financial 
Instruments”;
•	
Assessed the disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
relevant 
accounting standard requirements.
Testing of compliance with Debt covenants (as described in note 21 of the standalone financial statements)
The total borrowings of the Company as at March 31, 2023 
was Rs.16,459.83 million.
The Company has availed various long-term borrowings. 
These borrowings have loan covenants with respect to 
debt-equity, debt service coverage, etc. non-compliance 
of which gives right to the lender to demand immediate 
repayment of the loan and/or penal interest.
We identified this as a key audit matter in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements considering the quantum 
of borrowings and the significant implications in case of 
non-compliance with debt covenants.
The audit procedures performed by us included the 
following:
•	
Evaluated the Company’s assessment and workings 
for compliance with the relevant debt covenants as 
applicable to various borrowings of the Company;
•	
We tested the underlying calculations used in the 
Company’s assessment of debt covenants for a 
sample of loan contracts;
•	
In case of non-compliance with any of the debt 
covenants, we read the covenant waiver letters from 
lenders where available.  In the absence of waiver 
letters, we assessed the consequent reclassification of 
the respective borrowing from non-current to current.
•	
We assessed the disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements for compliance with the relevant 
accounting standard requirements.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Other Information 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information.  The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual report, but does not include the 
standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether such other information 
is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Annual report, if we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to those charged with 
governance.
Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these standalone financial statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act 
read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance 
of 
adequate 
accounting 
records 
in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of the Company and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the standalone financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In 
preparing 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
150
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical 
requirements 
regarding 
independence, 
and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure 1 
referred to in paragraph 1 under the heading “Report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements” of our report of even date
Re: Varroc Engineering Limited (the “Company”)
In terms of the information and explanations sought by us and given by the Company and the books of account and 
records examined by us in the normal course of audit and to the best of our knowledge and belief, we state that:
(i)	 (a)	 (A)	 The Company has maintained proper records showing full particulars, including quantitative details and 
situation of Property, Plant and Equipment.
    	 	
(B)	 The Company has maintained proper records showing full particulars of intangible assets.
	
(b)	 Property, Plant and Equipment were physically verified by the management in the previous year in accordance 
with a planned programme of verifying them once in three years which in our opinion is reasonable having regard 
to the size of the Company and the nature of its assets. No material discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
	
(c)	 The title deeds of all the immovable properties (other than properties where the Company is the lessee and the 
lease agreements are duly executed in favour of the lessee) are held in the name of the Company.
	
(d)	 The Company has not revalued its Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of use assets) or intangible 
assets during the year ended March 31, 2023 since the Company follows cost model for measurement after 
recognition of Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets.
	
(e)	 There are no proceedings initiated or are pending against the Company for holding any benami property under 
the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 and rules made thereunder.
(ii)	 (a)	 The inventory has been physically verified by the management during the year except for inventories lying with 
third parties. In our opinion, the frequency of verification by the management is reasonable and the coverage 
and procedure for such verification is appropriate. Discrepancies of 10% or more in aggregate for each class of 
inventory were not noticed in respect of such physical verification. Inventories lying with third parties have been 
confirmed by them as at or near year end and discrepancies of 10% or more in aggregate for each class of

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
ANNEXURE 2
TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF VARROC ENGINEERING LIMTED 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements of Varroc Engineering 
Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction 
with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to these 
standalone financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements was established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to these 
standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to these standalone financial statements.
Meaning 
of 
Internal 
Financial 
Controls 
With 
Reference to these Standalone Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial 
statements 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
160
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
With Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
including 
the 
possibility 
of 
collusion 
or 
improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements 
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note issued by the ICAI.

2	
Summary of significant accounting policies
	
This note provides a list of the significant accounting 
policies adopted in the preparation of these 
standalone financial statements. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
	
Basis of Preparation
	
(i) 	 Compliance with Ind AS
	
	
These financial statements comply in all material 
aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (the Act) [Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015] and other relevant 
provisions of the Act.
	
	
All amounts included in these financial statements 
are reported in Million of Indian rupees (H In Million) 
except earnings per share data and unless stated 
otherwise.
	
	
All amounts in the financial statements have been 
rounded off to the nearest million or decimal 
thereof.
	
(ii)	 Use of estimates and assumptions
	
	
The preparation of the Financial Statements 
requires the management to make certain 
judgments, estimates and assumptions. It also 
requires the management to exercise judgement 
in the process of applying the accounting policies. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement 
or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the financial 
statements are disclosed in Note 2A.
	
(iii)	 Historical cost convention
	
	
The financial statements have been prepared on 
a historical cost basis, except for the following:
	
	
• 	
certain financial assets and liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) that are measured at 
fair value; and
	
	
• 	
defined benefit plans, plan assets measured 
at fair value;
	
(iv)	 Current/non-current classification:
	
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as 
current or non current as per the company's 
operating cycle and other criteria set out in 
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based 
on the nature of products and the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the 
Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 
12 months for the purpose of current/non-current 
classification of assets and liabilities.
A)	 Property, plant and equipment
	
Tangible assets
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other 
items of property, plant and equipment are stated 
at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Company and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any 
component accounted for as a separate asset is 
derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the 
reporting period in which they are incurred.
	
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and 
residual value
	
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate their cost, net of their residual 
values, over their estimated useful lives or, in the case 
of certain leased furniture, fittings and equipment, the 
shorter lease term as follows:
• 	
Factory buildings
30 years
• 	
Office buildings
60 years
• 	
Plant and machinery
• 	
Plant and machinery, factory 
equipment, tools & electrical 
installation and fittings
8-12 years
• 	
Moulds                                                   
2-7 years
• 	
Computers                                                 
3-6 years
• 	
Vehicles                                                      
2-5 years
• 	
Furniture and fixtures                              
5-10 years
• 	
Office equipment
2-5 years
	
The useful lives have been determined based on 
technical evaluation done by the management's 
expert which are different than those specified by 
Schedule II to the Companies Act; 2013, in order to 
reflect the actual usage of the assets. The residual 
values are not more than 5% of the original cost of the 
asset.
	
The 
asset’s 
carrying 
amount 
is 
written 
down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount.
	
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are 
included in profit or loss within other gains/(losses).
	
Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated impairment loss, if any.
	
The present value of the expected cost for 
the decommissioning of an asset after its use 
is included in the cost of the respective asset if 
the recognition criteria for a provision are met. 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate
	
Investment properties
	
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or 
for capital appreciation or both, and that is not 
occupied by the Company, is classified as investment 
property. Investment property is measured initially at 
its cost, including related transaction costs and where 
applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure 
is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when 
incurred. When part of an investment property is 
replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised.
	
Investment properties are depreciated using the 
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. 
Investment properties generally have a useful life 
of 30-50 years. The useful life has been determined 
based on technical evaluation performed by the 
management’s expert.
	
Investment 
properties 
are 
derecognised 
either 
when they have been disposed of or when they 
are permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit 
or loss in the period of derecognition.
	
Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured 
on 
initial 
recognition 
at 
cost. 
Following 
initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less 
168
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
any accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, 
excluding capitalised development costs, are not 
capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in 
profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is 
incurred.
	
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life of the asset are 
considered to modify the amortisation period or 
method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is 
derecognised.
	
(i) 	 Computer software
	
	
Software is amortised over a period of 3 years.
	
(ii) 	 Technical know how
	
	
Expenditure on acquiring technical know-how 
(including income tax and R & D Cess) is capitalised 
and amortised over a period of six years. 
	
(iii) Non compete fee
	
	
Non compete fee paid is capitalised and 
amortised over a period of 5 years.
	
(iv) Intellectual Property Right
	
	
Intellectual property right pertains to amount paid 
to acquire right to use technology for engine 
components which has been capitalised and 
amortised over a period of 10 years.
	
(v) Research and development
	
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred. 
Development expenditures on an individual 
project are recognised as an intangible asset 
when the Company can demonstrate:
	
	
-	
The technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that the asset will be 
available for use or sale
	
	
 - 	
Its intention to complete and its ability and 
intention to use or sell the asset
	
	
-	
How the asset will generate future economic 
benefits
	
	
- 	
The availability of resources to complete the 
asset
	
	
- 	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development
	
	
Development costs previously recognised as 
an expense are not  recognised as an asset 
in a subsequent period. During the period of 
development, the asset is tested for impairment 
annually.
B)	 Investments in subsidiaries/joint venture
	
The Company accounts for its investments in 
subsidiaries/joint venture at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses (if any) in its separate financial 
statements. Investments accounted for at cost 
are accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 105, 
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, when they are classified as held for sale
C)	 Leases
	
The Company assesses at contract inception whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration.
	
Company as a Lessee
	
The Company applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
169
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease 
payments and right-of-use assets representing the 
right to use the underlying assets.
	
(i)	 Right of use asset
	
	
The Company recognises right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the 
date the underlying asset is available for use). 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less 
any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets 
includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, 
initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date less 
any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets, as follows:
	
	
• 	
Land and building : 3 to 15 years
	
	
• 	
Plant and machinery : 3 to 15 years
	
	
• 	
Motor vehicles and other equipment : 3 to 5 years
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the 
Company at the end of the lease term or the 
cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, 
depreciation is calculated using the estimated 
useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets 
are also subject to impairment. Refer to the 
accounting policies in section (D) Impairment of 
non-financial assets.
	
(ii)	 Lease liabilities
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the 
Company recognises lease liabilities measured at 
the present value of lease payments to be made 
over the lease term. The lease payments include 
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed 
payments) less any lease incentives receivable, 
variable lease payments that depend on an 
index or a rate, and amounts expected to be 
paid under residual value guarantees. The lease 
payments also include the exercise price of 
a purchase option reasonably certain to be 
exercised by the Company and payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease 
term reflects the Company exercising the option 
to terminate. Variable lease payments that do 
not depend on an index or a rate are recognised 
as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce 
inventories) in the period in which the event 
or condition that triggers the payment occurs. 
In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Company uses its incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement date 
because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not 
readily determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased 
to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced 
for the lease payments made. In addition, the 
carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if 
there is a modification, a change in the lease term, 
a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes 
to future payments resulting from a change in 
an index or rate used to determine such lease 
payments) or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset."
	
(iii)	 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
	
The Company applies the short-term lease 
recognition exemption to its short-term leases 
of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from 
the commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option). It also applies the lease of 
low-value assets recognition exemption to leases 
of office equipment that are considered to be 
low value. Lease payments on short-term leases 
and leases of low value assets are recognised 
as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term.
	
	
Company as a Lessor
	
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an asset are classified as operating 
leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on 
a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging 
an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset and recognised over 
170
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the 
period in which they are earned.
D)	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, 
whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. 
An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable 
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or 
group of assets. When the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs 
of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into 
account. If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. These 
calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or 
other available fair value indicators.
	
The Company bases its impairment calculation on 
detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which 
are prepared separately for each of the Company's 
CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. 
These budgets and forecast calculations generally 
cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-
term growth rate is calculated and applied to project 
future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash 
flow projections beyond periods covered by the most 
recent budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates 
cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or 
declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an 
increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth 
rate does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, or country or countries 
in which the entity operates, or for the market in which 
the asset is used.
	
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including 
impairment on inventories, are recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested 
for impairment annually as at the year end at the 
CGU level, as appropriate, and when circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired."
E)	
Borrowing costs
	
General and specific borrowing costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during 
the period of time that is required to complete and 
prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying 
assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment 
income 
earned 
on 
the 
temporary 
investment of specific borrowings pending their 
expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the 
borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
	
Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in 
which they are incurred.
F)	
Inventories
	
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value
	
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for as follows:
	
a)	 Raw materials, Stores and spare-parts, Loose 
tools and Packing materials: cost includes cost of 
purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. 
Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
	
b)	 Finished goods and work in progress: cost 
includes cost of direct materials and labour and 
a proportion of manufacturing overheads based 
on the normal operating capacity, but excluding 
borrowing costs. Cost is determined on weighted 
average basis.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
171
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
c)	 Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less estimated 
costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
	
d)	 Duties and other taxes (other than those 
subsequently recoverable by the entity from the 
taxing authorities) are included in the value of 
inventory.
G)	 Government grants
	
Grants from the government are recognised at their 
fair value where there is a reasonable assurance 
that the grant will be received and the Company will 
comply with all attached conditions.
	
Government grants relating to income are deferred and 
recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary 
to match them with the costs that they are intended to 
compensate and presented within other income.
	
Government grants relating to purchase of property, 
plant and equipment are included in current and non-
current liabilities as deferred income and are credited to 
profit or loss on straight-line basis over the expected lives 
of the related assets and presented within other income.
H)	 Revenue Recognition
	
Revenue from contracts with customers
	
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods or services are transferred 
to the customer at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the Company expects to be 
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The 
Company has generally concluded that it is the principal 
in its revenue arrangements because it typically 
controls the goods or services before transferring them 
to the customer. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net 
of goods and service tax (GST).
	
Sale of goods
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point 
in time when control of the goods is transferred to 
the customer, generally on delivery of the goods. The 
normal credit term is 30 to 120 days upon delivery.
	
The Company considers whether there are other 
promises in the contract that are separate performance 
obligations to which a portion of the transaction 
price 
needs 
to 
be 
allocated 
(e.g.,warranties). 
In determining the transaction price for the sale 
of goods, the Company considers the effects of 
variable consideration, the existence of significant 
financing components, noncash consideration, and 
consideration payable to the customer (if any).
	
Variable consideration
	
If the consideration in a contract includes a 
variable amount (like volume rebates/incentives, 
cash discounts etc.), the Company estimates the 
amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in 
exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. 
The variable consideration is estimated at contract 
inception and constrained until it is highly probable 
that a significant revenue reversal in the amount 
of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur 
when the associated uncertainty with the variable 
consideration is subsequently resolved. The estimate 
of variable consideration for expected future volume 
rebates/incentives, cash discounts etc. are made on 
the most likely amount method. Revenue is disclosed 
net of such amounts.
	
Significant financing component
	
Generally, the Company receives short-term advances 
from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind 
AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised 
amount of consideration for the effects of a significant 
financing component if it expects, at contract 
inception, that the period between the transfer of the 
promised good or service to the customer and when 
the customer pays for that good or service will be one 
year or less.
	
Warranty obligations
	
The Company typically provides warranties for general 
repairs of defects as per terms of the contract with 
customers, These assurance-type warranties are 
accounted for under Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Refer to the 
accounting policy on warranty provisions in section (L) 
Provisions.
172
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
Sale of services
	
Income from services is recognised on the basis 
of time/work completed as per contract with the 
customers. The Company collects goods and service 
tax  (GST) on behalf of the government and, therefore, 
it is not an economic benefit flowing to the Company. 
Hence, it is excluded from revenue.
	
Contract balances
	
Trade receivables
	
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an 
amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., 
only the passage of time is required before payment of 
the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policy, 
refer note Q - Financial instruments – Financial assets at 
amortised cost.
	
Contract assets
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange 
for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the 
Company performs by transferring goods or services to 
a customer before the customer pays consideration or 
before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised 
for the earned consideration that is conditional.
	
Contract liabilities
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods 
to a customer for which the Company has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Company transfers goods or services to the 
customer, a contract liability is recognised when the 
payment is made. Contract liabilities are recognised 
as revenue when the Company performs under the 
contract.
	
Refund liabilities
	
A refund liability is the obligation to refund some or all 
the consideration received (or receivable) from the 
customer and is measured at the amount the Company 
ultimately expects it will have to return to the customer. 
The Company updates its estimates of refund liabilities 
(and the corresponding change in the transaction 
price) at the end of each reporting period.
	
Wind/solar power generation
	
Income from the wind / solar power generation is 
recognised when earned on the basis of contractual 
arrangements with the buyers.
	
Export Incentives
	
Income from duty drawback and export incentives is 
recognised on an accrual basis.
I)	
Foreign currency translation
	
The Company's financial statements are presented in 
INR, which is also the functional currency.
	
Transactions and balances
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded 
by the Company at their respective functional 
currency spot rates at the date the transaction first 
qualifies for recognition.
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
	
Foreign exchange differences regarded as an 
adjustment to borrowing costs are presented in the 
statement of profit and loss, within finance costs. All 
other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented 
in the statement of profit and loss on a net basis within 
other gains/(losses).
	
Exchange 
differences 
arising 
on 
settlement 
or 
translation of monetary items are recognized in 
profit or loss with the exception of the following: 
Exchange 
differences 
arising 
on 
monetary 
items that are designated as part of the hedge 
of the Company's net investment of a foreign 
operation. These are recognized in OCI until the 
net investment is disposed of, at which time, the 
cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
173
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange 
differences on those monetary items are also recorded 
in OCI.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value is 
determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of 
non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated 
in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on 
the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation 
differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is 
recognized in OCI or profit or loss are also recognized 
in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
J)	
Employee benefits
	
(i) 	 Short-term obligations
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-
monetary benefits that are expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related service 
are recognized in respect of employees’ services 
up to the end of the reporting period and are 
measured at the amounts expected to be paid 
when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit obligations 
in the balance sheet.
	
(ii) 	 Other long-term employee benefit obligations
	
	
The liabilities for earned leaves are not expected 
to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end 
of the period in which the employees render the 
related service. They are therefore measured as 
the present value of expected future payments 
to be made in respect of services provided 
by employees up to the end of the reporting 
period using the projected unit credit method. 
The benefits are discounted using the market 
yields at the end of the reporting period that 
have terms approximating to the terms of the 
related obligation. Remeasurements as a result of 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in profit or loss. 
The obligations are presented as current liabilities 
in the balance sheet if the entity does not have 
an unconditional right to defer settlement for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period, 
regardless of when the actual settlement is 
expected to occur.
	
(iii)	 Post-employment obligations
	
	
The Company operates the following  post-
employment schemes:
	
	
(a) 	defined benefit plans such as gratuity and
	
	
(b) 	defined contribution plans such as provident 
fund
	
	
Gratuity obligations
	
	
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet 
in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method.
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
denominated in INR is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by reference to 
market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
government bonds that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation. 
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net balance of the defined 
benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. 
This cost is included in employee benefit expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in which 
they occur, directly in other comprehensive 
income. They are included in retained earnings 
in the statement of changes in equity and in the 
balance sheet.
174
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
	
Changes in the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments 
or curtailments are recognised immediately in 
profit or loss as past service cost.
	
	
Defined contribution plans
	
	
The Company makes contributions to funds for 
certain employees to the regulatory authorities. 
The Company has no further payment obligations 
once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are accounted for as defined 
contribution plans and the contributions are 
recognised as employee benefit expense when 
an employee renders the related service. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the 
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the 
future payments is available.
	
(iv) Bonus plans
	
	
The Company recognises a liability and an 
expense for bonuses. The Company recognises 
a provision where contractually obliged or where 
there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation.
	
(v) 	Termination benefits
	
	
Termination 
benefits 
are 
payable 
when 
employment is terminated by the company before 
the normal retirement date, or when an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange 
for these benefits. The Company recognises 
termination benefits at the earlier of the following 
dates: (a) when the Company can no longer 
withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when 
the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that 
is within the scope of Ind AS 37 and involves the 
payment of terminations benefits. In the case of an 
offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, 
the termination benefits are measured based on 
the number of employees expected to accept the 
offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after 
the end of the reporting period are discounted to 
present value.
K)	 Income tax
	
Current tax
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities.
	
Current income tax relating to items recognized 
outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income or in equity). 
Current tax items are recognized in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
	
- 	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
	
-  In respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated 
with 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, when the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences 
can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
175
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised, except:
	
-  When the deferred tax asset relating to the 
deductible temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
	
- 	
In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated 
with 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred 
tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that the temporary differences will 
reverse in the foreseeable future0 and taxable 
profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised
	
	
Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is 
charged to the statement of profit and loss as 
current tax for the year. The deferred tax asset is 
recognised for MAT credit available only to the 
extent that it is probable that the concerned 
company will pay normal income tax during the 
specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT 
credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the 
year in which the company recognizes MAT credit 
as an asset, it is created by way of credit to the 
statement of profit and loss and shown as part 
of deferred tax asset. The Company reviews the 
“MAT credit entitlement” asset at each reporting 
date and writes down the asset to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that it will pay normal tax 
during the specified period.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are 
recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax 
asset to be recovered
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on 
tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit 
or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity).
	
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the 
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and 
the same taxation authority.
L)	
Provisions
	
General
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. When the 
Company expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, 
the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, 
but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
The expense relating to a provision is presented in the 
statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognized as 
a finance cost.
	
Warranty provisions
	
Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognized 
when the product is sold or service provided to the 
customer. Initial recognition is based on historical 
experience. The initial estimate of warranty-related 
costs is revised annually

Onerous contracts
	
If the Company has a contract that is onerous, the 
present obligation under the contract is recognised 
and measured as a provision. 
M)	 Earnings Per Share
	
(i) 	 Basic earnings per share
	
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by 
dividing the profit attributable to owners of the 
Company by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the reporting 
period. The weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the  period and for all 
periods presented is adjusted for events, such 
as bonus shares, other than the conversion of 
potential equity shares that have changed the 
number of equity shares outstanding, without a 
corresponding change in resources.
	
(ii) 	 Diluted earnings per share
	
	
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used 
in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take into account:
	
	
• 	
the after income tax effect of interest and 
other financing costs associated with dilutive 
potential equity shares, and
	
	
• 	
the weighted average number of additional 
equity 
shares 
that 
would 
have 
been 
outstanding assuming the conversion of all 
dilutive potential equity shares.
	
	
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed 
converted 
as 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive 
potential 
equity 
shares 
are 
determined 
independently 
for 
each 
period 
presented. 
The number of equity shares and potentially 
dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively 
for all period presented for any share splits and 
bonus shares issues including for changes effected 
prior to the authorization for issue of the financial 
statements by the Board of Directors.
N)	 Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent  in  the balance sheet 
comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.For the purpose of the statement of 
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash 
and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered 
an integral part of the Company's cash management. 
Bank overdraft are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities in the Balance sheet.
O)	  Dividends
	
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend 
declared, being appropriately authorised and no 
longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the 
end of the reporting period but not distributed at the 
end of the reporting period.
P)	 Segment reporting
	
In accordance with paragraph 4 of notified Ind 
AS 108 "Operating segments", the Company has 
disclosed segment information only on the basis of the 
consolidated financial statements.
Q)	 Financial Instruments
	
Financial Assets
	
Initial Recognition and measurement
	
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair 
value through profit or loss.
	
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition 
depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash 
flow characteristics and the company’s business 
model for managing them. With the exception of 
trade receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component or for which the company has 
applied the practical expedient, the company initially 
measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the 
case of a financial asset not at fair value through 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
177
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that 
do not contain a significant financing component 
or for which the company has applied the practical 
expedient are measured at the transaction price 
determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the accounting 
policies for Revenue from contracts with customers.
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments 
of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI 
test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial 
assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective 
of the business model.
	
The company’s business model for managing financial 
assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in 
order to generate cash flows. The business model 
determines whether cash flows will result from collecting 
contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, 
or both. Financial assets classified and measured at 
amortised cost are held within a business model with 
the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows while financial assets classified 
and measured at fair value through OCI are held 
within a business model with the objective of both 
holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular 
way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the company commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in four categories:
	
- 	
Financial 
assets 
at 
amortised 
cost 
(debt 
instruments)
	
- 	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
	
- 	
Financial assets designated at fair value through 
OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)
	
- 	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortized cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
	
(a) 	The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
(b) 	Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
This category is the most relevant to the Company. 
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of EIR. The EIR amortization is included in 
finance costs/income in the Statement of Profit or Loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are recognized in 
the statement of profit or loss. This category generally 
applies to trade and other receivables.
	
Debt instruments at FVTOCI
	
A 'debt instrument' is classified as at the FVTOCI if both 
of the following criteria are met:
	
(a) 	The objective of the business model is achieved 
both by collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling the financial assets, and
	
(b) 	The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI 
category are measured initially as well as at each 
reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements 
are recognized in the other comprehensive 
178
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
income (OCI). However, the Company recognizes 
interest income, impairment losses and reversals 
and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L. 
On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to P&L. Interest earned whilst 
holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as 
interest income under EIR method.
	
	
Debt instruments at FVTPL
	
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the 
criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVTOCI is classified as FVTPL.
	
	
In 
addition, 
the 
Company 
may 
elect 
to 
designate a debt instrument, which otherwise 
meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at 
FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if 
doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement 
or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 
'accounting mismatch'). The Company has not 
designated any debt instruments as at FVTPL.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognized in P&L.
	
	
Equity investments
	
	
All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 
are measured at fair value. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading and contingent 
consideration recognized by an acquirer in 
a business combination to which Ind-AS 103 
applies are classified as at FVTPL. For all other 
equity instruments, the Company may make 
an irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive income subsequent changes 
in the fair value. The Company makes such an 
election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This 
classification is made on initial recognition and is 
irrevocable.
	
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity 
instrument at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes 
on the instrument, excluding dividends, are 
recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the 
amounts from OCI to P&L, even on the sale of the 
investment. However, the Company may transfer 
the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognized in P&L.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of 
a financial asset or part of a company of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. 
removed from the Company balance sheet) when:
	
	
-	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
	
	
-	
The Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset or has 
assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a ""pass-through"" 
arrangement; and either (a) the company 
has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
	
When the Company has transferred its rights 
to receive cash flows from an asset or has 
entered into a pass-through arrangement, it 
evaluates if and to what extent it has retained 
the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor 
transferred control of the asset, the Company 
continues to recognize the transferred asset 
to the extent of the Company continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Company 
also recognizes an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated liability 
are measured on a basis that reflects the 
rights and obligations that the Company has 
retained.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
179
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form 
of a guarantee over the transferred asset is 
measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the Company 
could be required to repay.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Company 
applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for 
measurement and recognition of impairment loss 
on the following financial assets and credit risk 
exposure:-
	
	
(a) 	Financial assets that are debt instruments, and 
are measured at amortized cost e.g. loans, 
debt securities, deposits, trade receivables 
and bank balance
	
	
(b) Financial assets that are debt instruments and 
are measured at FVTOCI
	
	
(c) 	Lease receivables
	
	
(d) Trade receivables or any contractual right to 
receive cash or another financial asset
	
	
(e)	 Loan commitments which are not measured 
as at FVTPL
	
	
(f) Financial guarantee contracts which are not 
measured as at FVTPL
	
	
The Company follows 'simplified approach' for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on:
	
	
-	
Trade receivables
	
	
-	
All lease receivables
	
	
The application of simplified approach does 
not require the Company to track changes 
in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Company determines 
that whether there has been a significant increase 
in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit 
risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL 
is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if 
credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL 
is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality 
of the instrument improves such that there is no 
longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing 
impairment loss allowance based on 12-month 
ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected 
life of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL 
is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from 
default events on a financial instrument that are 
possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
	
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual 
cash flows that are due to the company is in 
accordance with the contract and all the cash 
flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all cash 
shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. When 
estimating the cash flows, an entity is required to 
consider:
 
	
	
-	
All contractual terms of the financial instrument 
(including prepayment, extension, call and 
similar options) over the expected life of the 
financial instrument. However, in rare cases 
when the expected life of the financial 
instrument cannot be estimated reliably, then 
the entity is required to use the remaining 
contractual term of the financial instrument.
	
	
-	
Cash flows from the sale of the collateral 
held or other credit enhancements that are 
integral to the contractual terms.
	
	
As a practical expedient, the Company uses a 
provision matrix to determine impairment loss 
allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The 
provision matrix is based on its historically observed 
default rates over the expected life of the trade 
receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the historical 
observed default rates are updated and changes in 
the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
180
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized as 
income/expense in the statement of profit and 
loss (P&L). This amount is reflected under the head 
'other expenses' in the P&L. The balance sheet 
presentation for various financial instruments is 
described below:
	
	
Financial assets measured at amortized cost, 
contract assets and lease receivables:
	
	
ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e. as an integral 
part of the measurement of those assets in the 
balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net 
carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Company does not reduce impairment 
allowance from the gross carrying amount.
	
	
Loan commitments and financial guarantee 
contracts: ECL is presented as a provision in the 
balance sheet i.e. as a liability.
	
	
Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since 
financial assets are already reflected at fair value, 
impairment allowance is not further reduced from 
its value. Rather, ECL amount is presented as 
'accumulated impairment amount' in the OCI.
	
	
For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment 
loss, the Company combines financial instruments 
on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics 
with the objective of facilitating an analysis 
that is designed to enable significant increases 
in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis. 
The Company does not have any purchased or 
originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, 
i.e., financial assets which are credit impaired on 
purchase/origination.
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial 
liabilities 
are 
classified, 
at 
initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. 
All 
financial 
liabilities 
are 
recognized 
initially at fair value and, in the case of 
loans 
and 
borrowings 
and 
payables, 
net 
of 
directly 
attributable 
transaction 
costs. 
The Company's financial liabilities include trade 
and other payables, loans and borrowings 
including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee 
contracts and derivative financial instruments."
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends 
on their classification, as described below:
	
	
- 	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading 
and financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading 
if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing 
in the near term. This category also includes 
derivative financial instruments entered into by 
the company that are not designated as hedging 
instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
Ind-AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives 
are also classified as held for trading unless they 
are designated as effective hedging instruments. 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognized in the profit or loss.
	
	
Financial 
liabilities 
designated 
upon 
initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or loss are 
designated at the initial date of recognition, and 
only if the criteria in Ind-AS 109 are satisfied. For 
liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/
losses attributable to changes in own credit risk 
are recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not 
subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the 
company may transfer the cumulative gain or 
loss within equity. All other changes in fair value 
of such liability are recognized in the statement 
of profit or loss. The Company has not designated 
any financial liability as at fair value through profit 
and loss.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
181
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
	
Loans and borrowings
	
	
This is the category most relevant to the Company. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost using the effective interest rate ( 
EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognized in 
profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized 
as well as through the EIR amortization process. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The 
EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the 
statement of profit or loss. This category generally 
applies to interest bearing loans and borrowings.
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the 
Company are those contracts that require a 
payment to be made to reimburse the holder for 
a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails 
to make a payment when due in accordance 
with the terms of the debt instrument. Financial 
guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a 
liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured 
at the higher of the amount of loss allowance 
determined as per the impairment requirements 
of Ind-AS 109 and the amount recognized less 
cumulative amortization.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognized when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires when an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Embedded Derivatives
	
	
If the hybrid contract contains a host that 
is a financial asset within the scope of Ind-
AS 109, the company does not separate 
embedded 
derivatives. 
Rather, 
it 
applies 
the 
classification 
requirements 
contained 
in Ind-AS 109 to the entire hybrid contract. 
Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts 
are accounted for as separate derivatives 
and recorded at fair value if their economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to 
those of the host contracts and the host contracts 
are not held for trading or designated at fair value 
through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives 
are measured at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognized in profit or loss, unless designated 
as effective hedging instruments. Reassessment 
only occurs if there is either a change in 
the terms of the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows that would otherwise 
be required or a reclassification of a financial 
asset out of the fair value through profit or loss. 
Embedded derivatives closely related to the host 
contracts are not separated.
	
	
Embedded foreign currency derivatives
	
	
Embedded foreign currency derivatives are not 
separated from the host contract if they are 
closely related. Such embedded derivatives are 
closely related to the host contract, if the host 
contract is not leveraged, does not contain any 
option feature and requires payments in one of 
the following currencies:
	
	
-	
the functional currency of any substantial 
party to that contract,
	
	
-	
the currency in which the price of the related 
good or service that is acquired or delivered 
is routinely denominated in commercial 
transactions around the world,
	
	
-	
a currency that is commonly used in contracts 
to purchase or sell non-financial items in 
the economic environment in which the 
transaction takes place (i.e. relatively liquid 
and stable currency)
182
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
	
	
Foreign currency embedded derivatives which 
do not meet the above criteria are separated 
and the derivative is accounted for at fair value 
through profit and loss. The Company currently 
does not have any such derivatives which are not 
closely related.
	
	
Fair value measurement
	
	
The Company measures financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance 
sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the 
liability takes place either:
  	
	
- 	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, 
or
	
	
- 	
In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or 
liability
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Company. The fair 
value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their economic 
best interest.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability 
to generate economic benefits by using the asset 
in its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair 
value, maximizing the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable 
inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorized within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
	
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the 
fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
	
This note summarizes accounting policy for fair 
value. Other fair value related disclosures are 
given in the relevant notes.

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
	
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward currency contracts and interest 
rate swaps, to hedge its foreign currency risks and 
interest rate risks, respectively. Such derivative 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
183
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
financial instruments are initially recognized at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive and as 
financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
	
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or 
loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow 
hedges, which is recognized in OCI and later 
reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item 
affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment 
if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset 
or non-financial liability.
	
	
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are 
classified as:
	
	
1) 	 Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to 
changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or 
liability or an unrecognized firm commitment
	
	
2) 	 Cash 
flow 
hedges 
when 
hedging 
the 
exposure to variability in cash flows that 
is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognized asset or liability 
or a highly probable forecast transaction or 
the foreign currency risk in an unrecognized 
firm commitment
	
	
3) 	 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign 
operation
	
	
	
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the 
Company formally designates and documents 
the hedge relationship to which the Company 
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the 
risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. The documentation 
includes the Company's risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking hedge, 
the hedging/ economic relationship, the 
hedged item or transaction, the nature of the 
risk being hedged, hedge ratio and how the 
entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in 
the hedging instrument's fair value in offsetting 
the exposure to changes in the hedged 
item's fair value or cash flows attributable to 
the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected 
to be highly effective in achieving offsetting 
changes in fair value or cash flows and are 
assessed on an ongoing basis to determine 
that they actually have been highly effective 
throughout the financial reporting periods for 
which they were designated.
	
	
	
Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for, as described 
below:
	
	
	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument is recognized in OCI 
in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any 
ineffective portion is recognized immediately 
in the statement of profit or loss.
	
	
	
The Company uses derivative contracts as 
hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk 
in forecast transactions and firm commitments. 
The ineffective portion relating to foreign 
currency contracts is recognized in finance 
costs.
	
	
	
Amounts recognized as OCI are transferred 
to profit or loss when the hedged transaction 
affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged 
financial income or financial expense is 
recognized or when a forecast sale occurs. 
When the hedged item is the cost of a non-
financial asset or non-financial liability, the 
amounts recognized as OCI are transferred to 
the initial carrying amount of the non-financial 
asset or liability.
	
	
	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement 
or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), 
or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or 
when the hedge no longer meets the criteria 
for 
hedge 
accounting, 
any 
cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognized in OCI 
remains separately in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs or the foreign currency firm 
commitment is met.
	
	
Reclassification of financial assets and liabilities
	
	
The 
Company 
determines 
classification 
of 
financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. 
After initial recognition, no reclassification is made 
for financial assets which are equity instruments 
and financial liabilities.

For financial assets which are debt instruments, a 
reclassification is made only if there is a change 
in the business model for managing those assets. 
Changes to the business model are expected to 
be infrequent.
	
	
The Company senior management determines 
changes in the business model as result of external 
or internal changes which are significant to the 
company operations. Such changes are evident 
to external parties. A change in the business 
model occurs when the company either begins or

the operations.
	
	
If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it 
applies the reclassification prospectively from the 
reclassification date which is the first day of the 
immediately next reporting period following the 
change in business model. The Company does 
not restate any previously recognized gains, losses 
(including impairment gains or losses) or interest.
	
	
The following table shows various reclassifications 
and how they are accounted for:
R)	 Contingent liabilities
	
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where 
there is a possible obligation that arises from past 
events and the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Company or a present obligation 
that arises from the past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the 
amount cannot be made.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
Note 2A: Significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
	
	
The preparation of the Company’s financial 
statements 
requires 
management 
to 
make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, 
liabilities and the accompanying disclosures, and 
the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty 
about these assumptions and estimates could result 
in outcomes that require a material adjustment to 
the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in 
future periods.
	
	
Judgements
	
	
In the process of applying the Company’s 
accounting policies, following are significant 
judgements made by the management:
	
	
1) 	 De-recognition of trade receivables under 
factoring arrangements
	
	
	
The 
Company 
enters 
into 
non-recourse 
factoring arrangements for its trade receivables 
with various banks/financial institutions. The 
Company derecognizes the receivables from 
its books if it transfers substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the financial 
asset (i.e. receivables). The assessment of 
de-recognition of trade receivables under 
the factoring arrangements is complex and 
requires judgement.
	
	
Estimates and assumptions
	
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty at 
the reporting date, that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are described below. The 
Company based its assumptions and estimates 
on parameters available when the financial 
statements were prepared. Existing circumstances 
and assumptions about future developments, 
however, may change due to market changes or 
circumstances arising that are beyond the control 
of the Company. Such changes are reflected in 
the assumptions when they occur.
	
	
	
1) 	 Defined benefit plans
	
	
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity 
plan and the present value of the gratuity 
obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuation. An actuarial valuation involves 
making various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination 
of 
the 
discount 
rate, 
future 
salary 
increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and 
its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Further details about gratuity obligation 
are given in Note 42.
	
	
	
2) 	 Deferred taxes
	
	
	
	
At each reporting date, the Company 
assesses whether the realization of future 
tax 
benefits 
is 
sufficiently 
probable 
to 
recognize/carry 
forward 
deferred 
tax assets (including MAT credits). This 
assessment requires the use of significant 
estimates/assumptions with respect to 
assessment of future taxable income. 
The recorded amount of total deferred 
tax assets could change if estimates of 
projected future taxable income change 
or if changes in current tax regulations are 
enacted. (Refer note 24 for details)
	
	
	
3) 	 Provision for warranty
	
	
	
	
Warranties are provided for a specified 
period of time. The estimated liability 
for warranties is recorded when the 
products are sold. These estimates are 
established using historical information 
on the nature, frequency and average 
cost of warranty claims and our estimates 
regarding 
possible 
future 
incidence 
based on actions on product failures. 
Determination of warranty liability is based 
on the estimated frequency and amount 
of future claims, which are inherently 
uncertain. Actual claims incurred in the 
future may differ from the management's 
original estimates, which may materially 
affect warranty expenses.

103/4, Maswad, GIDC Expansion Estate, Halol-II, 
Dist. Panchmahal, Gujarat – 389 350
4) Covenant non-compliance
	
Bank loans contain certain debt covenants relating 
to limitation on indebtedness, debt-equity ratio, 
net borrowings to EBITDA ratio and debt service 
coverage ratio. Some of the debt covenants in 
respect of non-current borrowings of H 3,033.14 
million were not complied as at March 31, 2023. The 
Company has received waiver letter subsequent 
to year-end from one lender agreeing not to 
demand repayment as a consequence of such 
breaches. For rest of the facilities, non-current loans 
of H 2,381.23 million have been reclassified as current. 
The asset cover in respect of the Non-Convertible 
Debentures of the Company as on March 31, 
2023 is 1.21 times of the total due amount which 
is greater than the requirement of 1.1 times of 
the 
said 
Secured 
Non-Convertible 
Debentures. 
 
The management does not expect any material 
impact on the financial statements/cash flows due to 
the above.

Revenue from contracts with customers include revenue from finished goods, tooling, engineering services and  Job 
work.	
	
	
	
	
Finished goods / tooling / engineering services	
	
	
	
	
For the sale of finished goods the performance obligation is generally satisfied upon its delivery or as per the terms of 
the customer contract  and payment is generally due within 30 to 120 days from delivery. 
	
For sale of toolings, the performance obligation is considered satisfied on billing after approval of the part(s) by 
the customer. The Company generally receives advance for toolings contracts ranging from 30 % to 50% of the 
contracted price. The revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
	
Product development/engineering services are considered as related to sale of parts rather than a separate 
performance obligation. As a result, revenue from engineering services is recognised over the period of production 
from the date of start of production. Costs incurred in respect of providing engineering services are recognised as 
intangible assets and amortised over the period of production from the date of start of production. Payments received 
from customers in respect of product development/engineering services are presented as contract liabilities.
	
For supply of engineering services to group companies, performance obligation is generally satisfied on the basis of 
time/work completed as per the contract with the group companies and payment is generally due within 30-60 days.
	
The Company provides normal warranty provisions on some of its products sold, in line with the industry practice. 
The Company  considers that the contractual promise made to the customer in the form of warranties for the parts 
supplied does not meet the definition of separate performance obligation as it does not give rise to additional service
	
Job work revenue is recognised when the work is completed and billed to customer.

Defined benefit plan (Gratuity)	
	
The Company provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Employees who 
are in continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount of gratuity payable on retirement/
termination is the employees last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance per month computed proportionately 
for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Company 
makes contributions to recognised funds in India. The Company does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target 
level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimations of expected gratuity payments.

sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of 
defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of reporting period) has been 
applied while calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet. The methods and types of

RISK EXPOSURE AND ASSET LIABILITY MATCHING
	
Provision of a defined benefit scheme poses certain risks, some of which are detailed here under as companies take 
on uncertain long-term obligations to make future benefit payments.
	
1)	 Liability Risks
	
	
Asset-Liability mismatch risk-
	
	
Risk which arises if there is a mismatch in the duration of the assets relative to the liabilities. By matching duration 
with the defined benefit liabilities, the Company is successfully able to neutralize valuation swings caused by 
interest rate movements. Hence, companies are encouraged to adopt asset-liability management.
	
	
Discount rate risk-	
	
	
	
	
	
Variations in the discount rate used to compute the present value of the liabilities may seem small, but in practice 
can have a significant impact on the defined benefit liabilities.
	
	
Future salary escalation and inflation risk -	
	
	
	
	
	
Since price inflation and salary growth are linked economically, they are combined for disclosure purposes. Rising 
salaries will often result in higher future defined benefit payments resulting in a higher present value of liabilities 
especially unexpected salary increases provided at management’s discretion may lead to uncertainties in 
estimating this increasing risk.
	
2)	 Asset risks	
	
	
	
	
	
All plan assets are maintained in a trust fund managed by a public sector insurer viz. LIC of India. LIC has a 
sovereign guarantee and has been providing consistent and competitive returns over the years.
	
	
The Company has opted for a traditional fund wherein all assets are invested primarily in risk averse markets. 
The Company has no control over the management of funds but this option provides a high level of safety for 
the total corpus. A single account is maintained for both the investment and claim settlement and hence 100% 
liquidity is ensured. Also, interest rate and inflation risk are taken care of

(ii)	  Valuation technique used to determine fair value	
	
	
	
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments included in 
the above tables:	
	
	
	
	
	
 - 	
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit 
ratings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps are valued using valuation techniques, which 
employs the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward 
pricing model, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality 
counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency 
basis spread between the respective currencies, interest rate curves etc. The changes in counterparty credit risk 
had no material effect on financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit and loss.
	
	
Commentary	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The carrying amounts of trade receivables, loans, other financial assets, cash and bank balances, trade payables/
acceptances and other financial liabilities are considered to be the same as their fair values due to their short-term nature. 
The fair values of non-current financial assets and non-current financial liabilities also approximate their carrying values. 
The borrowings which are at floating rate of interest, fair values as at March 31, 2023 approximate their carrying values.
	
	
For financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to the fair 
values.

Note 4
Note 44 : 	 Financial risk management
The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other 
payables, and financial guarantee contracts. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s 
operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include loans, 
trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Company also 
enters into derivative transactions.
The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior management oversees the 
management of these risks. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams 
that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in derivatives for 
speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks, which are summarised below:
Market Risk	 	
	
	
	
	
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk such as equity 
232
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
price risk and commodity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, receivables, 
payables, deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.
a) 	 Foreign currency risk
	
The Company operates internationally and the business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently, the 
Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sale and purchase of goods and services, mainly in the 
North America and Europe . The exchange rate between the rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially 
in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Company’s operations 
are affected positively/adversely as the rupee appreciates /depreciates against these currencies. The Company 
evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign exchange forward 
contracts, interest and principal swaps and options to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign 
currency exposures. The Company follows established risk management policies, to hedge forecasted cash flows 
denominated in foreign currency. The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure.

iii)	 Sensitivity
	
For the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, every 5% percentage point appreciation/depreciation in 
the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and U.S. Dollar, would have affected the Company’s incremental 
operating margins by approximately H 12.82 million and H 3.56 million respectively. And for Euro, every 5% 
percentage point appreciation/depreciation in the exchange rate would have affected the Company’s 
incremental operating margin by approximately H 691.11 million, previous year H 13.81 million The sensitivity 
for net exposure in  JPY and in other currencies does not have material impact to Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Sensitivity analysis is computed based on the changes in the receivables and payables in foreign currency upon 
conversion into functional currency, due to exchange rate fluctuations between the previous reporting period and 
the current reporting period.
b) 	 Interest rate risk		
	
	
	
	
	
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of change in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates 
primarily to the Company’s long term debt obligations with floating interest rates.	
	
Interest rate sensitivity
	
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on exposure to interest rate. For floating rate liabilities, 
analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding 
for the whole year. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit before tax is affected through the 
impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:

C) 	 Other price risk
	
The Company does not have material investments in equity securities other than investments in its subsidiaries. Hence, 
equity price risk is considered to be low. Further, the Company’s operating activities require the ongoing purchase 
of various commodities for manufacture of automotive parts. However, the movement is commodity prices are 
substantially adjusted through price differences as per customer contracts and hence commodity price risk for the 
Company is also considered to be low.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Credit risk management		
	
	
	
	
	
	
Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or 
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities 
(primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, 
234
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Company only deals with parties which have 
good credit rating/worthiness given by external rating agencies or based on the Company’s internal assessment.
	
Trade receivables	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Customer credit risk is managed by the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer 
credit risk management. Further, Company’s customers includes marquee OEMs and Tier I companies, having long 
standing relationship with the Company. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and reconciled. 
At March 31, 2023, receivable from Company’s top 5 customers accounted for approximately 42.61 % (March 31, 
2022: 43.99%) of all the receivables outstanding. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an 
individual basis based on historical data. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying

agreed under the SPA was Eur 69.5 million (subject to closing adjustments as provided under the SPA) and accordingly the

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
As per the terms of the SPA, a specific ‘Adjustment Escrow’ has been provided for the Final Closing Statement and the 
Final Closing Adjustment Statement to be prepared as of Closure Date i.e. Oct 6, 2022. The Buyer had a period of 90 
working days from the closing date to come up with the same duly supported by requisite information/documentation.
The Buyer submitted the final adjustments in the month of February 2023 but failed to provide the necessary supporting 
details to enable the Sellers to understand these adjustments. Hence, Sellers sent a Dispute Notice in accordance with 
the SPA disputing the proposed adjustments. Pursuant to the amendment to SPA dated May 12, 2023, both parties 
have mutually agreed to attempt the resolution of their disagreements in accordance with the provisions of the SPA. 
Considering the disagreement between the parties and the negotiations with the Buyer are under progress, the  effect of 
the proposed adjustments cannot be ascertained for recognition in the standalone financial statements as of March 31, 
2023, and accordingly the loss recognised for the year ended March 31, 2023 is based on the initial agreed equity value 
of Eur 69.5 million as explained above.

Formulae for calculation of ratios are as follows:	
(i) 	 Current ratio = [ Current Assets / Current Liabilities ]	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(ii) 	 Debt-Equity Ratio = [ Total Debt / Total Equity ]	
(iii) 	Debt service coverage ratio = [ (Earning before Interest Tax & Depreciation & amortization and exceptional items)/
(Interest Expense + Principal repayments of long term loan made during the period) ]
(iv) 	Return on Equity ratio = [(Net Profits after taxes – Preference Dividend/(Average Shareholder’s Equity)]
(v) 	 Inventory Turnover ratio= [(cost of goods sold)/(Average Inventory)]
(vi) 	Trade Receivable Turnover Ratio = [(Revenue from Operation)/(Average Trade receivable)]	
(vii) 	Trade Payable Turnover Ratio = [ (Purchases)/(Average Trade payable)]
(viii) Net Capital Turnover Ratio = [( Net Annual Sales )/( Average Working Capital)]
(ix) 	Net Profit ratio = [ (Net Profit after taxes)/ (Revenue from Operation)]
(x) 	 Return on Capital Employed = [( Earning Before Interest and taxes (EBIT))/( Capital employed)]
(xi) 	Return on Investment = [(Income generated from invested funds in bank FDs and mutual funds)/ (Average invested 
funds in bank FDs and mutual funds)]	
(xii) 	Capital Employed = Tangible Net worth + Total Debt + Deferred Tax Liability
(xiii) Working capital = (Current assets - Current liabilities)	
Commentary
A) 	 Decrease in Current ratio is due to impairment of loan receivable & gurantee commission receivable from Related Party.
B) 	 Increase in Debt equity ratio is due to increase in borrowings raised during the year and and decrease in equity due 
to losses.
C) 	 Decrease in the ratio is due to losses in the current year as compared to profit in the previous year.
D) 	 Decrease in the ratio is mainly due to impairment provision of loan, interest & guarantee to related party and 
impairment of investment in subsidiaries.
E) 	 Decrease in the return on capital employed primarily due to impairment provision on investment/loan to subsidiary 
during the year.	
F) 	 Increase in ratio mainly due increase in revenue as compared to previous year.
G) 	 Decrease in Net capital turnover ratio is mainly on account of increase in current borrowings and Inter corporate 
deposits

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Independent Auditor’s Report 
To the Members of Varroc Engineering Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Qualified Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements of Varroc Engineering Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”), its 
subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as “the Group”) and its joint ventures 
comprising of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 
March 31, 2023, the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss, including Other Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, 
and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to 
as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based on 
the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate 
financial statements and on the other financial information 
of the subsidiaries and joint ventures, except for the possible 
effects of the matters described in the “Basis of Qualified 
Opinion” section of our report, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner 
so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group and joint 
ventures as at March 31, 2023, their consolidated loss 
including other comprehensive income, their consolidated 
cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Qualified Opinion
We draw attention to Note 51 to the consolidated financial 
statements regarding the sale of VLS Business.  As more 
fully described in the said note, there is disagreement 
between the parties on the final adjustments against 
agreed consideration and both the parties have agreed 
to negotiate to reach an agreement.  Pending conclusion 
of these negotiations, we are unable to comment on the 
impact of the same on the consolidated loss and financial 
position as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023.
As disclosed in Note 50 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the financial results and other financial 
information for the year ended March 31, 2023 in respect 
of Varroc TYC Corporation BVI (“China JV”), a joint venture 
accounted for under the equity method, considered for 
the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements, is unaudited. Hence we are unable to 
determine the possible impact of Group's share of profit/
loss from China JV on the consolidated profit/loss before 
tax, profit/loss after tax, total comprehensive income and 
earnings per share for the year ended March 31, 2023 and 
Group’s share of net assets of China JV on the investment 
in China JV as at March 31, 2023.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in 
the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group and joint ventures in accordance 
with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year 
ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. In addition to the matters described in the ‘Basis 
for Qualified Opinion’ section, we have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report.  For each matter below, 
our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context. 
258
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements section of our report, including in 
relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included 
the performance of procedures designed to respond 
to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements. The results of 
audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors 
of components not audited by us, as reported by them 
in their audit reports furnished to us by the management, 
including those procedures performed to address the 
matters below, provide the basis for our qualified audit 
opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Testing of compliance with Debt covenants (as described in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements)
The total borrowings of the Group as at March 31, 2023 was 
J 16,349.98 million.
These borrowings have loan covenants with respect to 
debt-equity, debt service coverage, etc. non-compliance 
of which gives right to the lender to demand immediate 
repayment and/or penal interest.
We identified this as a key audit matter in our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements considering the 
quantum of borrowings and the significant implications in 
case of non-compliance with debt covenants
The audit procedures performed by us included the 
following:
•	
Evaluated the Group’s assessment and workings for 
compliance with the relevant debt covenants as 
applicable to various borrowings in the Group;
•	
Tested the underlying calculations used in the Group’s 
assessment of debt covenants for a sample of loan 
contracts.
•	
In case of non-compliance with any of the debt 
covenants, read the covenants waivers from lenders 
where available.  In the absence of waivers, assessed 
the consequent reclassification of the respective 
borrowing from non-current to current.
•	
Assessed the disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
relevant 
accounting standard requirements.
De-recognition of trade receivables under factoring arrangements (as described in note 2A (4) of the consolidated 
financial statements)
The Group enters into non-recourse factoring arrangements 
for its trade receivables with various banks/financial institutions.
As at March 31, 2023, the group derecognized trade 
receivables amounting to J 1,472.90 million. The Group 
derecognizes the receivables from its books if it transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
financial asset (i.e. receivables).
The assessment of derecognition of trade receivables 
under the factoring arrangements is complex and requires 
significant judgement.
Accordingly, this has been identified as a key audit matter 
in our audit of the consolidated financial statements.  
The audit procedures performed by us included the 
following:
•	
Evaluated the assessment made by management in 
respect of transfer of substantially all risks and rewards 
of ownership of the financial asset under the factoring 
contracts;
•	
Read a sample of factoring contracts to understand 
the terms and assessed if they qualify as non-recourse 
arrangements and further assessed if the accounting 
is as per the requirements of Ind AS 109, “Financial 
Instruments”;
•	
Assessed the disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
relevant 
accounting standard requirements.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Other Information 
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual report but does not 
include the consolidated financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The Annual report is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditor's report. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether such other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
When we read the Annual report, if we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance. 
Responsibilities 
of 
Management 
for 
the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows 
and consolidated statement of changes in equity of 
the Group including its joint ventures in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind 
AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors 
of the companies included in the Group and of its joint 
ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and 
of its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which 
have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for 
assessing the ability of their respective companies to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its joint ventures are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process 
of their respective companies.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
260
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company has adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group and its joint ventures to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures 
to cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
•	
Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the Group and its joint 
ventures of which we are the independent auditors 
and whose financial information we have audited, 
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the 
financial statements of such entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors. For the other entities included 
in the consolidated financial statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical 
requirements 
regarding 
independence, 
and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
(a)	 We did not audit the financial statements and other 
financial information, in respect of 4 subsidiaries, part 
of continuing operations whose financial statements 
(without giving effect of elimination of intra-group 
transactions) include total assets of J 6,696.76 million 
as at March 31, 2023, and total revenues of J 7,481.79 
million and net cash inflow of J 268.15 million for the 
year ended on that date. These financial statement 
and other financial information have been audited 
by other auditors, which financial statements, other 
financial information and auditor’s reports have been 
furnished to us by the management. The consolidated 
financial statements also include the Group’s share of 
net profit of J 16.21 million for the year ended March 
31, 2023, as considered in the consolidated financial 
statements, in respect of 1 joint ventures, whose 
financial statements, other financial information have 
been audited by other auditors and whose reports 
have been furnished to us by the Management. Our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so 
far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included 
in respect of these subsidiaries and joint ventures, 
and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
261
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid 
subsidiaries and joint ventures, is based solely on the 
reports of such other auditors.
	
Certain of these subsidiaries are located outside 
India whose financial statements and other financial 
information have been prepared in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in their 
respective countries and which have been audited 
by other auditors under generally accepted auditing 
standards applicable in their respective countries. 
The Holding Company’s management has converted 
the financial statements of such subsidiaries located 
outside India from accounting principles generally 
accepted in their respective countries to accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. We have 
audited these conversion adjustments made by 
the Holding Company’s management. Our opinion 
in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of 
such subsidiaries located outside India is based 
on the report of other auditors and the conversion 
adjustments prepared by the management of the 
Holding Company and audited by us.
(b)	 The accompanying consolidated financial statements 
include unaudited financial statements and other 
unaudited financial information in respect of 2 subsidiaries, 
whose 
financial 
statements 
and 
other 
financial 
information (without giving effect of elimination of intra-
group transactions) reflect total assets of J 911.40 million 
as at March 31, 2023, and total revenues of J 798.66 million 
and net cash inflows of J 1.08 million for the year ended 
on that date. These unaudited financial statements 
and other unaudited financial information have been 
furnished to us by the management. The consolidated 
financial statements also include the Group’s share of net 
profit of J 37.07 million for the year ended March 31, 2023, 
as considered in the consolidated financial statements, 
in respect of 2 joint ventures, whose financial statements, 
other financial information has not been audited and 
whose unaudited financial statements, other unaudited 
financial information have been furnished to us by the 
Management. Our opinion, in so far as it relates amounts 
and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries 
and joint venture, and our report in terms of sub-sections 
(3) of Section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the 
aforesaid subsidiaries and joint venture, is based solely 
on such unaudited financial statements and other 
unaudited financial information. In our opinion and 
according to the information and explanations given to 
us by the Management, these financial statements and 
other financial information are not material to the Group 
except those relating to China JV.
Our opinion above on the consolidated financial 
statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements below, is not modified in respect of the 
above matters with respect to our reliance on the work 
done and the reports of the other auditors and the financial 
statements and other financial information certified by the 
Management except those relating to China JV.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Annexure 2
To The Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Varroc Engineering Limted 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Varroc Engineering  Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”) as of and for the 
year ended March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
(the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as “the Group”) and its joint venture, which are 
companies incorporated in India, as of that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and its joint venture, which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Holding Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and 
errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding 
Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms 
of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's 
internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial 
statements 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
266
Annexure 2 (Contd.)
To The Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Varroc Engineering Limted 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
With 
Reference 
to 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements 
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Group and its joint venture, which are 
companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all 
material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements were operating effectively as at 
March 31,2023, based on the internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the Holding Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. 
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to 
one subsidiary and one joint venture, which are companies 
incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding 
reports of the auditors of such subsidiary and joint venture 
incorporated in India.

These audited consolidated financial statements were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the Board of Directors on May 23, 2023.
2.	 Significant accounting policies
	
This note provides a list of the significant accounting 
policies adopted in the preparation of these audited 
consolidated financial statements. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
	
a.   	Basis of preparation
	
	
(i)	 The 
audited 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements of the Group, which comprise 
the audited consolidated Balance Sheet 
as at March 31, 2023; audited consolidated 
statement of Profit and Loss including the 
statement of Other Comprehensive Income; 
audited consolidated Cash Flow Statement 
and audited consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year then ended 
and other select explanatory notes have 
been prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting 
Standard 
(IND 
AS) 
notified 
under the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules 2015 (as amended from 
time to time) and presentation requirements 
of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies 
Act, 2013, (IND AS compliant Schedule III), 
as applicable to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. All amounts included in these 
audited consolidated financial statements are 
reported in Million of Indian National Rupees (H 
in Million) except earnings per share data and 
unless stated otherwise. All amounts in these 
audited consolidated financial statements 
have been rounded off to the nearest million 
or decimal thereof unless otherwise stated.
	
	
(ii)	 Use of estimates and assumptions
	
	
	
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
Consolidated 
IND AS Financial Statements requires the 
management to make certain judgments, 
estimates and assumptions. It also requires 
the management to exercise judgement 
in the process of applying the accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to 
the consolidated financial statements are 
disclosed in Note 2A.
	
	
(iii) 	Historical cost convention
	
	
	
The audited Consolidated IND AS Financial 
Statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for the following:
	
 	
	
- 	
certain financial assets and liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) that are 
measured at fair value; and
	
 	
	
- 	
defined benefit plans and plan assets 
measured at fair value.
	
	
(iv)	 Current - Non-current classification
	
	
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification.
	
	
	
An asset is treated as current when it is:
	
	
	
 - 	
Expected to be realised or intended to 
be sold or consumed in normal operating 
cycle
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
276
	
	
	
	
- 	
Held primarily for the purpose of 
trading
	
	
 	
	
- 	
Expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
	
	
	
 	
- 	
Cash 
or 
cash 
equivalent 
unless 
restricted from being exchanged or 
used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months 
after 
the 
reporting 
period 
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
	
	
	
A  liability is current when:
	
	
	
	
 - 	
It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle
	
	
	
	
-	
It is held primarily for the purpose of 
trading
	
	
	
	
- 	
It is due to be settled within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
	
	
	
	
- 	
There is no unconditional right to 
defer the settlement of the liability 
for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
	
	
	
The terms of the liability that could, at the 
option of the counterparty, result in its 
settlement by the issue of equity instruments 
do not affect its classification.
	
	
	
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.
	
	
	
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
group has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
	
b.	 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting
	
	
These Consolidated Financial Statements comprise 
the financial statements of the Company, its 
subsidiaries and joint ventures as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2023.
	
	
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and 
only if the Group has:
	
	
 - 	
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that 
give it the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee)
	
 	
- 	
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
	
 	
- 	
The ability to use its power over the investee to 
affect its returns
	
	
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls 
an investee if facts and circumstances indicate 
that there are changes to one or more of the 
three elements of control. Consolidation of a 
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control 
over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group 
loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired 
or disposed of during the year are included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date 
the Group gains control until the date the Group 
ceases to control the subsidiary.
	
	
Consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in similar 
circumstances. If a member of the group uses 
accounting policies other than those adopted 
in the consolidated financial statements for like 
transactions and events in similar circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that group 
member’s financial statements in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements to ensure 
conformity with the group’s accounting policies.
	
	
The financial statements of all entities used for the 
purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same 
reporting date as that of the parent company, 
i.e., year ended on March 31. When the end of 
the reporting period of the parent is different 
from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, 
for consolidation purposes, additional financial 
information as of the same date as the financial 
statements of the parent to enable the parent 
to consolidate the financial information of the 
subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
277
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
	
(i)	 Subsidiaries
	
	
	
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group 
has control. The group combines the financial 
statements of the parent and its subsidiaries 
line by line adding together like items of 
assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and 
unrealized gains on transactions between 
group companies are eliminated. Unrealized 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of 
the transferred asset. Accounting policies 
of subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the group.
	
	
	
Non-controlling interests in the results and 
equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity 
and balance sheet respectively.
	
	
(ii) 	 Joint arrangements
	
	
	
Under IND AS 111 Joint Arrangements, 
investments 
in 
joint 
arrangements 
are 
classified as either joint operations or joint 
ventures. The classification depends on the 
contractual rights and obligations of each 
investor, rather than the legal structure of the 
joint arrangement.
	
	
	
a)  	Joint ventures
	
	
	
	
Interests in joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method (see (iii) 
below), after initially being recognized 
at cost in the consolidated financial 
statements.
	
	
	
b) 	 Joint operations
	
	
	
	
The Group recognises its direct right to the 
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 
of joint operations and its share of any 
jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, 
revenues 
and 
expenses. 
These 
are 
incorporated in the financial statements 
under the appropriate headings.
	
	
(iii)	 Equity Method
	
	
	
Under the equity method of accounting, the 
investments are initially recognized at cost and 
adjusted thereafter to recognize the group’s 
share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of 
the investee in profit and loss and the group’s 
share of other comprehensive income of the 
investee in other comprehensive income. 
Dividends received or receivable from joint 
ventures are recognized as a reduction in the 
carrying amount of the investment.
	
	
	
When the group’s share of losses in an equity-
accounted investment equals or exceeds 
its interest in the entity, including any other 
unsecured long-term receivables, the group 
does not recognize further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the other entity.
	
	
	
Unrealized gains on transactions between the 
group and its joint ventures are eliminated 
to the extent of the group’s interest in these 
entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated 
unless the transaction provides evidence of 
an impairment of the asset transferred.
	
	
	
The carrying amount of equity accounted 
investments 
are 
tested 
for 
impairment 
in 
accordance with the policy described in note 2(b).
	
	
(iv)	 Changes in ownership interests
	
	
	
The group treats transactions with non-
controlling interests that do not result in a loss 
of control as transactions with equity owners 
of the group. A change in ownership interest 
results in an adjustment between the carrying 
amounts of the controlling and non-controlling 
interests to reflect their relative interests in 
the subsidiary. Any difference between the 
amount of the adjustment to non-controlling 
interests and any consideration paid or 
received is recognized within equity.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
278
	
	
	
When the group ceases to consolidate or 
equity account for an investment because 
of a loss of control, joint control or significant 
influence, any retained interest in the entity is 
remeasured to its fair value with the change 
in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. 
This fair value becomes the initial carrying 
amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an 
associate, joint venture or financial asset. In 
addition, any amounts previously recognized 
in other comprehensive income in respect of 
that entity are accounted for as if the group 
had directly disposed of the related assets 
or liabilities. This may mean that amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss.
	
	
	
If the ownership interest in a joint venture or 
an associate is reduced but joint control 
or significant influence is retained, only 
a proportionate share of the amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss where 
appropriate.
	
	
(v)	 The difference between the cost of investment 
in the subsidiaries and jointly controlled 
entities, over the net assets at the time of 
acquisition of investment is recognised in the 
financial statements as Goodwill or Capital 
Reserve on consolidation as the case may be.
	
c.	
Foreign currency translation
	
	
The Group’s Consolidated IND AS Financial 
Statements are presented in INR, which is also 
the parent company’s functional currency. For 
each entity, the Group determines the functional 
currency and items included in the financial 
statements of each entity are measured using that 
functional currency.
	
	
Transactions and balances
	
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective 
functional currency spot rates at the date the 
transaction first qualifies for recognition.
	
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
	
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognized in 
profit or loss with the exception of the following:
	
	
-   	 Exchange differences arising on monetary 
items that forms part of a reporting entity’s 
net investment in a foreign operation are 
recognized in profit or loss in the separate 
financial statements of the reporting entity 
or the individual financial statements of 
the foreign operation, as appropriate. In 
the financial statements that include the 
foreign operation and the reporting entity 
(e.g., 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
when the foreign operation is a subsidiary), 
such exchange differences are recognized 
initially in OCI. These exchange differences 
are reclassified from equity to profit or loss on 
disposal of the net investment.
	
	
-  	
Exchange differences arising on monetary 
items that are designated as part of the hedge 
of the Group’s net investment of a foreign 
operation. These are recognized in OCI until 
the net investment is disposed of, at which 
time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to 
profit or loss.
	
	
-  	
Tax charges and credits attributable to 
exchange differences on those monetary 
items are also recorded in OCI.
	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value is 
determined. The gain or loss arising on translation 
of non-monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or 
loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair value 
gain or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or loss are 
also recognized in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
279
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
	
Group companies
	
	
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of 
foreign operations are translated into INR at the 
rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date 
and their statements of profit or loss are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. For practical reasons, the group uses 
an average rate to translate income and expense 
items, if the average rate approximates the 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
The exchange differences arising on translation for 
consolidation are recognized in OCI. On disposal 
of a foreign operation, the component of OCI 
relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognized in profit or loss.
	
	
Any goodwill arising in the acquisition/ business 
combination of a foreign operation on or after 1 
April, 2015 and any fair value adjustments to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on 
the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the foreign operation and translated at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date.
	
	
Any goodwill or fair value adjustments arising 
in business combinations/ acquisitions, which 
occurred before the date of transition to IND AS 
(1 April, 2015), are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the entity rather than as assets and liabilities 
of the foreign operation. Therefore, those assets 
and liabilities are non-monetary items already 
expressed in the functional currency of the parent 
and no further translation differences occur.
	
	
Gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any 
foreign operation excludes translation differences 
that arose before the date of transition but 
includes only translation differences arising after 
the transition date.
	
	
Foreign exchange differences regarded as an 
adjustment to borrowing costs are presented in 
the statement of profit and loss, within finance 
costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses 
are presented in the statement of profit and loss 
on a net basis within other gains/(losses).
	
d.	 Revenue Recognition
	
	
Revenue from contracts with customers
	
	
Revenue 
from 
contracts 
with 
customers 
is 
recognised when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the Group expects to be entitled in exchange 
for those goods or services. The Group has 
generally concluded that it is the principal in 
its revenue arrangements because it typically 
controls the goods or services before transferring 
them to the customer. Amounts disclosed as 
revenue are net of Goods and Service Tax (GST). 
The 
disclosures 
of 
significant 
accounting 
judgements, estimates and assumptions relating 
to revenue from contracts with customers are 
provided in Note 2A.
	
	
Sale of goods
	
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the 
point in time when control of the goods is transferred 
to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods. 
The normal credit term is 30 to 120 days upon delivery. 
Product 
development/Engineering 
services 
primarily pertaining to global automotive lighting 
business are considered as relating to sale of parts 
rather than a separate performance obligation. 
As a result, revenue from product development/
engineering services is recognised over the period 
of production from the start of production date and 
is included in the revenue from sale of finished goods. 
The Group considers whether there are other 
promises in the contract that are separate 
performance obligations to which a portion of 
the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g., 
warranties). In determining the transaction price 
for the sale of goods, the Group considers the 
effects of variable consideration, the existence 
of significant financing components, noncash 
consideration, and consideration payable to the 
customer (if any).
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
280
	
	
Variable consideration
	
	
If the consideration in a contract includes a 
variable amount (like volume rebates/incentives, 
cash discounts etc.), the Group estimates the 
amount of consideration to which it will be entitled 
in exchange for transferring the goods to the 
customer. The variable consideration is estimated 
at contract inception and constrained until it is 
highly probable that a significant revenue reversal 
in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised 
will not occur when the associated uncertainty 
with the variable consideration is subsequently 
resolved. The estimate of variable consideration for 
expected future volume rebates/incentives, cash 
discounts etc. are made on the most likely amount 
method. Revenue is disclosed net of such amounts.
	
	
Significant financing component
	
	
Generally, the Group receives short-term advances 
from its customers. Using the practical expedient 
in IND AS 115, the Company does not adjust the 
promised amount of consideration for the effects 
of a significant financing component if it expects, 
at contract inception, that the period between 
the transfer of the promised good or service to the 
customer and when the customer pays for that 
good or service will be one year or less.
	
	
Warranty obligations
	
	
The Group typically provides warranties for 
general repairs of defects as per terms of the 
contract 
with 
customers, 
These 
assurance-
type warranties are accounted for under IND 
AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets. Refer to the accounting policy 
on warranty provisions in section (t) Provisions 
Customer prepayments are amortised in Revenue 
over the life of the respective project.
	
	
Sale of services
	
	
Income from services is recognised on the basis 
of time/work completed as per contract with the 
customers. The Group collects taxes on services 
(where applicable) on behalf of the government 
and, therefore, they are not economic benefits 
flowing to the Group. Hence, they are excluded 
from revenue.
	
	
Tooling Revenue
	
	
Development of toolings for customers is considered 
as a separate performance obligation. Revenue from 
toolings primarily pertaining to global automotive 
lighting business is recognised over time based on 
the progress towards complete satisfaction of that 
performance obligation. Such progress is measured 
based on the proportion that the aggregate costs 
incurred for work done till the balance sheet date 
bear to the estimated total costs.
	
	
Determination 
of 
toolings 
revenues 
to 
be 
recognised over time necessarily involves making 
estimates by the Management (some of which 
are a technical nature) of the costs of completion, 
the expected revenues from each contract and 
the foreseeable losses to completion.
	
	
Foreseeable losses, if any, on the contracts are 
recognised as an expense in the period in which 
they are foreseen, irrespective of the stage of 
completion of the contract.
	
	
Contract balances
	
	
Trade receivables
	
	
A receivable represents the Group’s right to an 
amount of consideration that is unconditional 
(i.e., only the passage of time is required before 
payment of the consideration is due). Refer to 
accounting policy (m) Financial instruments – 
Financial assets at amortised cost.
	
	
Contract assets
	
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration in 
exchange for goods or services transferred to the 
customer. If the Group performs by transferring 
goods or services to a customer before the 
customer pays consideration or before payment is 
due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned 
consideration that is conditional.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
	
Contract liabilities
	
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods 
to a customer for which the Group has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration 
is due) from the customer. If a customer pays 
consideration before the Group transfers goods 
or services to the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made. Contract 
liabilities are recognised as revenue when the 
Group performs under the contract.
	
	
Refund liabilities
	
	
A refund liability is the obligation to refund some or 
all the consideration received (or receivable) from 
the customer and is measured at the amount the 
Group ultimately expects it will have to return to 
the customer. The Group updates its estimates of 
refund liabilities (and the corresponding change 
in the transaction price) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
Wind/solar power generation
	
	
Income from the wind / solar power generation 
is recognised when earned on the basis of 
contractual arrangements with the buyers.
	
	
Export Incentives
	
	
Income from duty drawback and export incentives 
is recognised on an accrual basis.
	
e.	
Government Grants
	
	
Grants from the government are recognised 
at their fair value where there is a reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and the 
group will comply with all attached conditions. 
Government grants relating to income are 
deferred and recognised in the profit or loss 
over the period necessary to match them 
with the costs that they are intended to 
compensate and presented within other income. 
Government grants relating to purchase of 
property plant and equipment are included in 
current and non current liabilities as deferred 
income and are credited to profit or loss on 
straight-line basis over the expected lives of the 
related assets and presented within other income.
	
f.	
Income tax
	
	
Current income-tax
	
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. 
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute 
the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date in 
the countries where the Group operates and 
generates taxable income.
	
	
Current income tax relating to items recognized 
outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit 
or loss (either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity). Current tax items are recognized in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in 
OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method 
on temporary differences between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all 
taxable temporary differences, except:
	
 	
-   	 When the deferred tax liability arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss
	
 	
-     In respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, when 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
282
probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized for all 
deductible temporary differences, the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and any unused 
tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilized, except:
	
 	
-     When the deferred tax asset relating to the 
deductible temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss.
	
	
 -   	 In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred tax assets are recognized only to the 
extent that it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.
	
	
Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is 
charged to the statement of profit and loss as 
current tax for the year. The deferred tax asset is 
recognised for MAT credit available only to the 
extent that it is probable that the concerned 
company will pay normal income tax during the 
specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT 
credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the 
year in which the company recognizes MAT credit 
as an asset, it is created by way of credit to the 
statement of profit and loss and shown as part 
of deferred tax asset. The company reviews the 
“MAT credit entitlement” asset at each reporting 
date and writes down the asset to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that it will pay normal tax 
during the specified period.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognized to the 
extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the year when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside 
profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income or in 
equity). Deferred tax items are recognized in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in 
OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable 
entity and the same taxation authority.
	
	
Tax benefits acquired as part of a business 
combination, but not satisfying the criteria for 
separate recognition at that date, are recognized 
subsequently if new information about facts and 
circumstances change. Acquired deferred tax 
benefits recognized within the measurement period 
reduce goodwill related to that acquisition if they 
result from new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances existing at the acquisition date. If the 
carrying amount of goodwill is zero, any remaining 
deferred tax benefits are recognized in OCl/ capital 
reserve depending on the principle explained for 
bargain purchase gains. All other acquired tax 
benefits realised are recognized in profit or loss.
	
	
Sales/value added taxes paid on acquisition of 
assets or on incurring expenses-
	
	
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of sales/value added taxes paid, except:

- 	
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets 
or services is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised

part of the expense item, as applicable;
	
-

receivables 
and 
payables

stated

The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable 
to, the taxation authority is included as part of 
receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
	
g.	 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations
	
	
The Group classifies non-current assets and 
disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a 
sale rather than through continuing use.
	
	
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified 
as held for sale are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs 
to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable 
to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding 
finance costs and income tax expense.
	
	
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded 
as met only when the sale is highly probable, 
and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Actions 
required to complete the sale/ distribution should 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to 
sell will be withdrawn. Management must be 
committed to the sale and the sale expected 
within one year from the date of classification.
	
	
For these purposes, sale transactions include 
exchanges 
of 
non-current 
assets 
for 
other 
non-current assets when the exchange has 
commercial substance. The criteria for held for sale 
classification is regarded met only when the assets 
or disposal group is available for immediate sale 
in its present condition, subject only to terms that 
are usual and customary for sales of such assets 
(or disposal groups), its sale is highly probable; 
and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The 
group treats sale of the asset or disposal group to 
be highly probable when:
	
	
 - 	
The appropriate level of management is 
committed to a plan to sell the asset (or 
disposal group),
	
	
- 	
An active programme to locate a buyer 
and complete the plan has been initiated (if 
applicable),
	
	
- 	
The asset (or disposal group) is being actively 
marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable 
in relation to its current fair value
	
	
- 	
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition 
as a completed sale within one year from the 
date of classification, and
	
	
 - 	
Actions required to complete the plan 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant 
changes to the plan will be made or that the 
plan will be withdrawn
	
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
are not depreciated, or amortised assets once 
classified as held for sale.
	
	
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 
are presented separately from other items in the 
balance sheet.
	
	
Discontinued operations are excluded from 
the results of continuing operations and are 
presented as a single amount as profit or loss 
after tax from discontinued operations in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Additional disclosures are provided in note 51. 
All other notes to the financial statements mainly 
include amounts for continuing operations, unless 
otherwise mentioned.
	
h.	
Leases
	
	
The Group assesses at contract inception whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
284
	
	
As a lessee
	
	
The Group applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. 
The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease 
payments and right-of-use assets representing the 
right to use the underlying assets.
	
	
(i)	 Right of use of asset
	
	
	
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., 
the date the underlying asset is available 
for use). Right-of-use assets are measured 
at cost, less any accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost 
of right-of-use assets includes the amount 
of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made 
at or before the commencement date less 
any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and the 
estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
	
	
	
• 	
Land and building : 3 to 25 years
	
	
	
• 	
Plant and machinery : 3 to 15 years
	
	
	
• 	
Motor vehicles and other equipment : 3 to 
5 years
	
	
The property, plant and equipment acquired 
under finance leases is depreciated over the 
asset’s useful life or over the shorter term of the 
asset’s useful life and lease term if there is no 
reasonable certainty that the group will obtain 
ownership at the end of the lease term.
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to 
the Group at the end of the lease term or the 
cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, 
depreciation is calculated using the estimated 
useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets 
are also subject to impairment. Refer to the 
accounting policies in section (j) Impairment of 
non-financial assets.
	
	
(ii)	 Lease liabilities
	
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the 
Group recognises lease liabilities measured 
at the present value of lease payments to 
be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance 
fixed 
payments) 
less 
any 
lease incentives receivable, variable lease 
payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase 
option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties for 
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects 
the Group exercising the option to terminate. 
Variable lease payments that do not depend 
on an index or a rate are recognised as 
expenses (unless they are incurred to produce 
inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occurs.
	
	
	
In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 
interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of 
lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a 
change in the lease payments (e.g., changes 
to future payments resulting from a change in 
an index or rate used to determine such lease 
payments) or a change in the assessment of 
an option to purchase the underlying asset.
	
	
(iii)	 Short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets
	
	
	
The Group applies the short-term lease 
recognition exemption to its short-term leases 
of machinery and equipment (i.e., those 
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or 
less from the commencement date and do 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
285
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
not contain a purchase option). It also applies 
the lease of low-value assets recognition 
exemption to leases of office equipment 
that are considered to be low value. Lease 
payments on short-term leases and leases of 
low value assets are recognised as expense 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
	
As a lessor
	
	
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an asset are classified as operating 
leases. Rental income arising is accounted for 
on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and 
is included in revenue in the statement of profit 
or loss due to its operating nature. Initial direct 
costs incurred in negotiating and arranging 
an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset and recognised over 
the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the 
period in which they are earned.
	
i.	
Business combinations
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree. For each business combination, 
the Group elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value 
or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs 
are expensed as incurred.
	
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired 
and 
the 
liabilities 
assumed 
are 
recognized at their acquisition date fair values. 
For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include 
contingent 
liabilities 
representing 
present 
obligation and they are measured at their 
acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact 
that outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits is not probable.
	
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses 
the financial assets and liabilities assumed for 
appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. This includes the separation of 
embedded derivatives in host contracts by the 
acquiree.
	
	
If the business combination is achieved in stages, 
any previously held equity interest is re-measured 
at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting 
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss or OCI, as 
appropriate.
	
	
Any contingent consideration to be transferred 
by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at 
the acquisition date. Contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability that is a financial 
instrument and within the scope of IND AS 109 
Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognized in profit 
or loss. If the contingent consideration is not 
within the scope of IND AS 109, it is measured 
in accordance with the appropriate IND AS. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as 
equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting 
dates and subsequent its settlement is accounted 
for within equity.
	
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognized for non-
controlling interests, and any previous interest 
held, over the net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses 
whether it has correctly identified all of the assets 
acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and 
reviews the procedures used to measure the 
amounts to be recognized at the acquisition 
date. If the reassessment still results in an excess 
of the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred, then the 
gain is recognized in OCI and accumulated in 
equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
286
clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity 
recognizes the gain directly in equity as capital 
reserve, without routing the same through OCI.
	
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is, from 
the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected 
to benefit from the combination, irrespective of 
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree 
are assigned to those units.
	
	
If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional 
amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
through goodwill during the measurement period, 
or additional assets or liabilities are recognized, to 
reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date 
that, if known, would have affected the amounts 
recognized at that date. These adjustments are 
called as measurement period adjustments. The 
measurement period does not exceed one year from 
the acquisition date.
	
j.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, 
whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable 
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or 
groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is considered impaired and is written down to 
its recoverable amount.
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value 
less costs of disposal, recent market transactions 
are taken into account. If no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model 
is used. These calculations are corroborated 
by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair 
value indicators.
	
	
The Group bases its impairment calculation on 
detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which 
are prepared separately for each of the Group’s 
CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. 
These budgets and forecast calculations generally 
cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a 
long-term growth rate is calculated and applied 
to project future cash flows after the fifth year. To 
estimate cash flow projections beyond periods 
covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, 
the Group extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining growth 
rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing 
rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate 
does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, or country or 
countries in which the entity operates, or for the 
market in which the asset is used.
	
	
Impairment losses of continuing operations, 
including 
impairment 
on 
inventories, 
are 
recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 
the year-end and when circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired.
	
	
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing 
the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group 
of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its 
carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be 
reversed in future periods.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are 
tested for impairment annually as at the year-
end at the CGU level, as appropriate, and when 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
	
k.	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet 
comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less, which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
	
	
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of 
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts/cash credits 
as they are considered an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management. Bank overdraft are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the 
Balance sheet.
	
l.	
Inventories
	
	
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
	
	
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its 
present location and condition are accounted for 
as follows:
	
	
-   	 Raw materials, Stores and spare-parts, Loose 
tools and Packing materials: cost includes 
cost of purchase and other costs incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. Cost is determined on 
weighted average basis.
	
	
-  	
Finished goods and work in progress: cost 
includes cost of direct materials and labour 
and a proportion of manufacturing overheads 
based on the normal operating capacity, but 
excluding borrowing costs. Cost is determined 
on weighted average basis.
	
	
Initial cost of inventories includes the transfer of 
gains and losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, 
recognized in OCI, in respect of the purchases of 
raw materials.
	
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less estimated 
costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
	
	
Duties and other taxes (other than those 
subsequently recoverable by the entity from the 
taxing authorities) are included in the value of 
inventory.

Financial Assets
	
	
Initial Recognition and measurement
	
	
All financial assets are recognized initially at fair 
value plus, in the case of financial assets not 
recorded at fair value through profit and loss, 
transactions costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs 
of financial assets carried at fair value through 
profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
	
	
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and the 
Group’s business model for managing them. 
With the exception of trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component 
or for which the Group has applied the practical 
expedient, the Group initially measures a financial 
asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial 
asset not at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component or 
for which the Group has applied the practical 
expedient are measured at the transaction 
price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the 
accounting policies in section (d) Revenue from 
contracts with customers.

Subsequent measurement
	
	
For 
purposes 
of 
subsequent 
measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four categories:
	
	
-   	 Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
	
-   	 Debt instruments at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
-  	
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity 
instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL)
	
	
-  	
Equity instruments measured at fair value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income 
(FVTOCI)
	
  	
Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortized 
cost if both the following conditions are met:
	
	
(a) 	The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for collecting 
contractual cash flows, and
	
	
(b) 	Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
This category is the most relevant to the Group. 
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized 
cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of EIR. The EIR 
amortization is included in finance costs/income 
in the Statement of Profit or Loss. The losses arising 
from impairment are recognized in the profit or 
loss. This category generally applies to trade and 
other receivables.
	
  	
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at FVTOCI if 
both of the following criteria are met:
	
	
(a)	 The objective of the business model is 
achieved both by collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling the financial assets, and
	
	
(b)	 The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
	
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI 
category are measured initially as well as at 
each reporting date at fair value. Fair value 
movements are recognized in the other 
comprehensive income (OCI). However, the 
Group recognizes interest income, impairment 
losses and reversals and foreign exchange 
gain or loss in the P&L. On de-recognition of 
the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognized in OCI is reclassified from the 
equity to P&L. Interest earned whilst holding 
FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest 
income under EIR method.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTPL
	
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the 
criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVTOCI is classified as FVTPL.
	
	
In addition, the Group may elect to designate a 
debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized 
cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, 
such election is allowed only if doing so reduces 
or eliminates a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency 
(referred 
to 
as 
‘accounting 
mismatch’). The Group has not designated any 
debt instruments as at FVTPL.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognized in P&L.
	
	
Equity investments
	
	
All equity investments in scope of IND AS 109 
are measured at fair value. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading and contingent 
consideration recognized by an acquirer in a 
business combination to which IND AS 103 applies 
are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity 
instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable 
election to present in other comprehensive 
income subsequent changes in the fair value. The 
Group makes such an election on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. This classification is made on 
initial recognition and is irrevocable.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
289
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
	
If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument 
at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in 
the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from 
OCI to P&L, even on the sale of the investment. 
However, the Group may transfer the cumulative 
gain or loss within equity.
	
	
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognized in P&L.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e. removed 
from the Group’s balance sheet) when:
	
	
-   The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
	
	
-   The Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
“pass-through” arrangement; and either (a) the 
Group has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from an asset or has entered into a 
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, 
the Group continues to recognize the transferred 
asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also 
recognizes an associated liability. The transferred 
asset and the associated liability are measured on 
a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that 
the Group has retained.
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the Group could be required to repay.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with IND AS 109, the Group applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial assets and credit risk exposure:-
	
	
(a)   Financial assets that are debt instruments, and 
are measured at amortized cost e.g. loans, 
debt securities, deposits, trade receivables 
and bank balance
	
	
(b)   Financial assets that are debt instruments and 
are measured at FVTOCI
	
	
(c)    Lease receivables
	
	
(d)  Trade receivables or any contractual right to 
receive cash or another financial asset that 
result from transactions that are within the 
scope of IND AS 115
	
	
(e)  Loan commitments which are not measured 
as at FVTPL
	
	
(f)    Financial guarantee contracts which are not 
measured as at FVTPL
	
	
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on:
	
	
	
-  	
 Trade receivables or contract assets; and
	
	
	
-   	 Lease receivables
	
	
	
The application of simplified approach does 
not require the Group to track changes in 
credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
	
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other 
financial assets and risk exposure, the Group 
determines that whether there has been a 
significant increase in the credit risk since initial 
recognition. If credit risk has not increased 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
290
significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide 
for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has 
increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. 
If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of 
the instrument improves such that there is no 
longer a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, then the entity reverts to 
recognizing impairment loss allowance based 
on 12-month ECL.
	
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses 
resulting from all possible default events over 
the expected life of a financial instrument. 
The 12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime 
ECL which results from default events on a 
financial instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date.
	
	
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual 
cash flows that are due to the Group  in 
accordance with the contract and all the 
cash flows that the entity expects to receive 
(i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the 
original EIR. When estimating the cash flows, 
an entity is required to consider:
	
	
-   	 All 
contractual 
terms 
of 
the 
financial 
instrument (including prepayment, extension, 
call and similar options) over the expected life 
of the financial instrument. However, in rare 
cases when the expected life of the financial 
instrument cannot be estimated reliably, then 
the entity is required to use the remaining 
contractual term of the financial instrument.
	
	
-  	
Cash flows from the sale of the collateral 
held or other credit enhancements that are 
integral to the contractual terms.
	
	
As a practical expedient, the Group uses a 
provision matrix to determine impairment loss 
allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The 
provision matrix is based on its historically observed 
default rates over the expected life of the trade 
receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the historical 
observed default rates are updated and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized as 
income/expense in the statement of profit and 
loss (P&L). This amount is reflected under the head 
‘other expenses’ in the P&L. The balance sheet 
presentation for various financial instruments is 
described below:
	
	
-	
Financial assets measured at amortized cost, 
contract assets and lease receivables: ECL is 
presented as an allowance, i.e. as an integral 
part of the measurement of those assets in the 
balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net 
carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Group does not reduce impairment 
allowance from the gross carrying amount.
	
	
-   	 Loan commitments and financial guarantee 
contracts: ECL is presented as a provision in 
the balance sheet i.e. as a liability.
	
	
-  	
Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since 
financial assets are already reflected at fair 
value, impairment allowance is not further 
reduced from its value. Rather, ECL amount 
is presented as ‘accumulated impairment 
amount’ in the OCI.
	
	
For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment 
loss, the Group combines financial instruments on 
the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with 
the objective of facilitating an analysis that is 
designed to enable significant increases in credit 
risk to be identified on a timely basis.
	
	
The Group does not have any purchased or 
originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, 
i.e., financial assets which are credit impaired on 
purchase/origination.
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial 
liabilities 
are 
classified, 
at 
initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair 
value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
	
	
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts 
and derivative financial instruments.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends 
on their classification, as described below:
	
	
-  	 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading 
and financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading 
if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing 
in the near term. This category also includes 
derivative financial instruments entered into by 
the Group that are not designated as hedging 
instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
IND AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives 
are also classified as held for trading unless they 
are designated as effective hedging instruments. 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognized in the profit or loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
at fair value through profit or loss are designated at 
the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria 
in IND AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as 
FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes 
in own credit risk are recognized in OCI. These gains/
losses are not subsequently transferred to P&L. 
However, the Group may transfer the cumulative 
gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair 
value of such liability are recognized in the statement 
of profit or loss. The Group has not designated any 
financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.
	
	
-   	 Loans and borrowings
	
	
This is the category most relevant to the Group. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and 
losses are recognized in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognized as well as through the 
EIR amortization process.
	
	
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The 
EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the 
statement of profit or loss. This category generally 
applies to interest bearing loans and borrowings.
	
	
-   	 Financial guarantee contracts
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the 
Group are those contracts that require a payment 
to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it 
incurs because the specified debtor fails to make 
a payment when due in accordance with the 
terms of the debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are recognized initially as a liability 
at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured 
at the higher of the amount of loss allowance 
determined as per the impairment requirements 
of IND AS 109 and the amount recognized less 
cumulative amortization.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognized when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires when an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
292
	
	
Embedded Derivatives
	
	
If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a 
financial asset within the scope of IND AS 109, the 
Group does not separate embedded derivatives. 
Rather, it applies the classification requirements 
contained in IND AS 109 to the entire hybrid contract.
	
	
Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts 
are accounted for as separate derivatives 
and recorded at fair value if their economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to 
those of the hose contracts and the host contracts 
are not held for trading or designated at fair value 
through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives 
are measured at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognized in profit or loss, unless designated 
as effective hedging instruments. Reassessment 
only occurs if there is either a change in the terms 
of the contract that significantly modifies the 
cash flows that would otherwise be required or a 
reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair 
value through profit or loss.
	
	
Embedded derivatives closely related to the host 
contracts are not separated.
	
	
Embedded foreign currency derivatives
	
	
Embedded foreign currency derivatives are not 
separated from the host contract if they are 
closely related. Such embedded derivatives are 
closely related to the host contract, if the host 
contract is not leveraged, does not contain any 
option feature and requires payments in one of 
the following currencies:
	
	
-   	 the functional currency of any substantial 
party to that contract,
	
	
-   	 the currency in which the price of the related 
good or service that is acquired or delivered 
is routinely denominated in commercial 
transactions around the world,
	
	
-   	 a currency that is commonly used in contracts 
to purchase or sell non-financial items in 
the economic environment in which the 
transaction takes place (i.e. relatively liquid 
and stable currency)
	
	
Foreign currency embedded derivatives which 
do not meet the above criteria are separated 
and the derivative is accounted for at fair value 
through profit and loss. The group currently does 
not have any such derivatives which are not 
closely related.
	
	
Reclassification of financial assets and liabilities
	
	
The Group determines classification of financial 
assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After 
initial recognition, no reclassification is made for 
financial assets which are equity instruments and 
financial liabilities.
	
	
For financial assets which are debt instruments, a 
reclassification is made only if there is a change 
in the business model for managing those assets. 
Changes to the business model are expected to 
be infrequent.
	
The Group’s Senior Management determines changes 
in the business model as result of external or internal 
changes which are significant to the Group’s 
operations. Such changes are evident to external 
parties. A change in the business model occurs when 
the Group either begins or ceases to perform an 
activity that is significant to the operations.
	
If the Group reclassifies financial assets, it applies the 
reclassification prospectively from the reclassification 
date which is the first day of the immediately next 
reporting period following the change in business 
model. The Group does not restate any previously 
recognized gains, losses (including impairment gains 
or losses) or interest.

n.	
Offsetting of financial instruments	
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet where there is a currently enforceable legal 
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is 
an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
o.	
Fair value measurement	
	
	
The Group measures financial instruments, such 
as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet 
date.
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
	
	
-   	 In the principal market for the asset or liability, 
or
	
	
-   	 In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or 
liability	
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Group. The fair value 
of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best 
interest.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability 
to generate economic benefits by using the asset 
in its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair 
value, maximizing the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable 
inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorized within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
 Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
	
 Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
The following table shows various reclassifications and how they are accounted for:
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
294
	
	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable	
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, 
the Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
p.	 Derivative 
financial 
instruments 
and 
hedge 
accounting
	
	
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
	
	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward currency contracts and interest 
rate swaps, to hedge its foreign currency risks and 
interest rate risks, respectively. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognized at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive and as 
financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
	
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or 
loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow 
hedges, which is recognized in OCI and later 
reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item 
affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment 
if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset 
or non-financial liability.	 	
	
	
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are 
classified as:	
	
	
-   	 Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure 
to changes in the fair value of a recognized 
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm 
commitment
	
	
-   	 Cash 
flow 
hedges 
when 
hedging 
the 
exposure to variability in cash flows that 
is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognized asset or liability 
or a highly probable forecast transaction or 
the foreign currency risk in an unrecognized 
firm commitment
	
	
-  	
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign 
operation
	
	
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group 
formally designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Group wishes to apply 
hedge accounting and the risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking the 
hedge. The documentation includes the group’s 
risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking hedge, the hedging/ economic 
relationship, the hedged item or transaction, the 
nature of the risk being hedged, hedge ratio 
and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of 
changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in 
offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged 
item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the 
hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be 
highly effective in achieving offsetting changes 
in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on 
an ongoing basis to determine that they actually 
have been highly effective throughout the 
financial reporting periods for which they were 
designated.		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for, as described 
below:	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge 
accounting		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognized in OCI in the cash 
flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is 
recognized immediately in the statement of profit 
or loss.	
	
	
The Group uses derivative contracts as hedges 
of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast 
transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective 
portion relating to foreign currency contracts is 
recognized in finance costs	
	
	
Amounts recognized as OCI are transferred to 
profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects 
profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial 
income or financial expense is recognized or 
when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged 
item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-
financial liability, the amounts recognized as OCI 
are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the 
non-financial asset or liability.

	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement or 
rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its 
designation as a hedge is revoked, or when the 
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognized in OCI remains separately in equity 
until the forecast transaction occurs or the foreign 
currency firm commitment is met.
	
	
The Group does not use hedges of fair value and 
net investment.	
	
q.	 Property, plant and equipment	
	
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost except 
in case of certain freehold land which are at 
revalued amounts. All other items of property, 
plant and equipment are stated at historical cost 
less depreciation except in case of certain assets 
which are at revalued amounts. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to 
the acquisition of the items. 	
	
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the 
item will flow to the group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. The carrying amount 
of any component accounted for as a separate 
asset is derecognised when replaced. All other 
repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or 
loss during the reporting period in which they are 
incurred.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and 
residual value	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate their cost, net of their residual 
values, over their estimated useful lives or, in 
the case of certain leased furniture, fittings and 
equipment, the shorter lease term as follows:	
Class of Assets
Estimated 
useful life 
(Years) 
(on single 
shift basis)
Buildings
30- 50 years
Plant and Machinery (including 
factory equipment and tools & 
instruments)
4-20 years
Moulds and Dies
4-7 years
Computers
3-7 years
Vehicles
4-7 years
Furniture and Fixtures
5-15 years
Other Assets (electrical 
installation and fitting, office 
equipments)
4-10 years
	
	
The  property, plant and equipment acquired 
under finance leases is depreciated over the 
asset’s useful life  or over the shorter term of the 
asset’s useful life and lease term if there is no 
reasonable certainty that the group will obtain 
ownership at the end of the lease term. 
	
	
The useful lives of all property plant and 
equipments have been determined based on 
technical evaluation done by the Management’s 
expert which are different than those specified by 
Schedule II to the Companies Act; 2013, in order to 
reflect the actual usage of the assets. The residual 
values are not more than 5% of the original cost of 
the asset. 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
An asset’s carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if the 
asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount.	
	
	
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These 
are included in profit or loss within other gains/ 
(losses).		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated impairment loss, if any.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023

The present value of the expected cost for 
the decommissioning of an asset after its use is 
included in the cost of the respective asset if the 
recognition criteria for a provision are met.
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
are reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate
	
r.	
Intangible assets
	
	
Intangible 
assets 
acquired 
separately 
are 
measured on initial recognition at cost. Following 
initial recognition, intangible assets are carried 
at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Internally 
generated 
intangibles, 
excluding 
capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and the 
related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in 
the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
	
	
(i)	 Goodwill	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is 
included in intangible assets. Goodwill is 
not amortised but it is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that it 
might be impaired, and is carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and 
losses on the disposal of an entity include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold.	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units 
for the purpose of impairment testing. The 
allocation is made to those cash-generating 
units or groups of cash-generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. The 
units or groups of units are identified at the 
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for 
internal Management purposes.	
	
	
(ii)	 Computer software
	
	
	
Costs associated with maintaining software 
programmes are recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Separately acquired software 
are shown at transaction cost, software 
acquired in a business combination are 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. They are subsequently carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation. Computer 
software are amortised on a straight line basis 
over a period of 3 to 5 years.		
	
	
(iii)	 Research and development
	
	
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred. 
Development expenditures on an individual 
project are recognised as an intangible asset 
when the Group can demonstrate: 
	
	
	
 - 	
The technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that the asset will be 
available for use or sale
	
	
	
- 	
Its intention to complete and its ability 
and intention to use or sell the asset
	
	
	
- 	
How the asset will generate future 
economic benefits
	
	
	
-	
The availability of resources to complete 
the asset
	
	
	
 - 	
The ability to measure reliably the 
expenditure during development
	
	
	
Development costs previously recognised 
as an expense are not recognised as an 
asset in a subsequent period. During the 
period of development, the asset is tested for 
impairment annually.
	
	
	
Capitalised 
development 
expenditure 
is 
amortised on a straight line basis from the 
start of production over a period of 3 years or 
project life whichever is lower.	
	
	
(iv)	 Technical knowhow fees	
	
	
	
Expenditure on acquiring Technical Know-
how (including Income Tax and R & D Cess) 
is capitalised and amortised on a straight line 
basis over a period of six years.	
	
	
(v)	 Customer relationships 
	
	
	
Customer relationships acquired in a business 
combination are recognised at fair value at 
the acquisition date. They have a finite useful 
life and are subsequently carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Customer relationships are amortised on 
a straight line basis over a period of 10-12 years.

(vi)	 Patents and others
	
	
	
Costs of intangible assets other than those 
internally generated, including patents and 
licenses, are valued at acquisition cost and 
amortized on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated future useful lives being 10 years.	
	
s.	
Borrowing costs	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
General and specific borrowing costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset 
are capitalised during the period of time that is 
required to complete and prepare the asset for its 
intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time 
to get ready for their intended use or sale.
	
	
Investment income earned on the temporary 
investment of specific borrowings pending their 
expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from 
the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.	
	
	
Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
in which they are incurred.	
	
t.	
Provisions	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
General	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Provisions are recognized when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. When the Group expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, 
under an insurance contract, the reimbursement 
is recognized as a separate asset, but only when 
the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented in the statement 
of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.	
	
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-
tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognized as a finance cost.
	
	
Warranty provisions	
	
	
Provisions 
for 
warranty-related 
costs 
are 
recognized when the product is sold or service 
provided to the customer. Initial recognition is 
based on historical experience. The initial estimate 
of warranty-related costs is revised annually.
	
	
Provision for onerous contracts	
	
	
A provision for onerous contracts is recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived by 
the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations 
under the contract. The provision is measured at 
the present value of the expected net cost of 
continuing with the contract. Before a provision is 
established, the Group recognizes any impairment 
loss on the assets associated with that contract for 
provision for onerous contract related to toolings, 
refer para d above.
	
	
Contingent liabilities recognized in a business 
combination	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
A contingent liability recognized in a business 
combination is initially measured at its fair value. 
Subsequently, it is measured at the higher of the 
amount that would be recognized in accordance 
with the requirements for provisions above or the 
amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, 
cumulative amortization recognized in accordance 
with the requirements for revenue recognition.
	
u.	
Employee benefits	
	
	
(i)	 Short-term obligations
	
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including 
non-monetary benefits that are expected to 
be settled wholly within 12 months after the 
end of the period in which the employees 
render the related service are recognized in 
respect of employees’ services up to the end 
of the reporting period and are measured 
at the amounts expected to be paid when 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2023 
298
the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit 
obligations in the balance sheet.	
	
	
(ii)	 Other 
long-term 
employee 
benefit 
obligations	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The liabilities for earned leaves are not expected 
to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end 
of the period in which the employees render the 
related service. They are therefore measured as 
the present value of expected future payments 
to be made in respect of services provided 
by employees up to the end of the reporting 
period using the projected unit credit method. 
The benefits are discounted using the market 
yields at the end of the reporting period that 
have terms approximating to the terms of the 
related obligation. Remeasurements as a result of 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in profit or loss.
	
	
	
The obligations are presented as current 
liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity 
does not have an unconditional right to defer 
settlement for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period, regardless of when the 
actual settlement is expected to occur.
	
	
(iii)	 Post-employment obligations
	
	
	
The group operates the following post-
employment schemes:
	
	
	
(a)	 defined benefit plans such as gratuity, 
pension; and
	
	
	
(b)	 defined 
contribution 
plans 
such 
as 
provident fund 
	
	
	
Pension and Gratuity obligations	
	
	
	
The liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of defined benefit pension 
and gratuity plans is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation at the end 
of the reporting period less the fair value of 
plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method.	
	
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation denominated in INR is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows by reference to market yields at the 
end of the reporting period on government 
bonds that have terms approximating to the 
terms of the related obligation. The benefits 
which are denominated in currency other than 
INR, the cash flows are discounted using market 
yields determined by reference to high-quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and 
that have terms approximating to the terms of 
the related obligation.
	
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net balance of the defined 
benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets. This cost is included in employee benefit 
expense in the statement of profit and loss
	
	
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognised in the 
period in which they occur, directly in other 
comprehensive income. They are included in 
retained earnings in the statement of changes 
in equity and in the balance sheet.	
	
	
	
Changes in the present value of the defined 
benefit 
obligation 
resulting 
from 
plan 
amendments or curtailments are recognised 
immediately in profit or loss as past service cost.
	
	
	
Defined contribution plans	
	
	
	
	
	
The Group makes contributions to funds 
for certain employees to the regulatory 
authorities. The group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are accounted 
for as defined contribution plans and the 
contributions are recognised as employee 
benefit expense when an employee renders 
the related service. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that 
a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available.

(iv)	 Bonus plans		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The group recognises a liability and an 
expense for bonuses. The group recognises 
a provision where contractually obliged 
or where there is a past practice that has 
created a constructive obligation.	
	
	
(v)	 Termination benefits		
	
	
	
Termination benefits are payable when 
employment is terminated by the group 
before the normal  retirement date, or when 
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy 
in exchange for these benefits. The group 
recognises termination benefits at the earlier 
of the following dates: (a) when the group 
can no longer withdraw the offer of those 
benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises 
costs for a restructuring that is within the scope 
of IND AS 37 and involves the payment of 
terminations benefits. In the case of an offer 
made to encourage voluntary redundancy, 
the termination benefits are measured based 
on the number of employees expected to 
accept the offer. Benefits falling due more 
than 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period are discounted to present value.
	
v.   Dividends
	
	
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend 
declared, being appropriately authorised and no 
longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before 
the end of the reporting period but not distributed 
at the end of the reporting period.
	
w. 	 Earnings per share	
	
	
(i)	 Basic earnings per share	
	
	
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by 
dividing the profit attributable to owners of the 
parent company by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during 
the reporting period. The weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during 
the  period and for all periods presented is 
adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, 
other than the conversion of potential equity 
shares that have changed the number 
of equity shares outstanding, without a 
corresponding change in resources.	
	
	
(ii)	 Diluted earnings per share	
	
	
	
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures 
used in the determination of basic earnings 
per share to take into account:
	
	
	
-	
the after income tax effect of interest 
and other financing costs associated with 
dilutive potential equity shares, and
	
	
	
-       the weighted average number of additional 
equity shares that would have been 
outstanding assuming the conversion of 
all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
	
	
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed 
converted as at the beginning of the period, 
unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential 
equity shares are determined independently 
for each period presented.	
	
	
	
The number of equity shares and potentially 
dilutive 
equity 
shares 
are 
adjusted 
retrospectively for all years presented for any 
share splits and bonus shares issues including 
for changes effected prior to the authorization 
for issue of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements by the Board of Directors.
	
x.	
 Contingent liabilities
	
	
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where 
there is a possible obligation that arises from past 
events and the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Group or a present obligation 
that arises from the past events where it is either 
not probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation or a reliable 
estimate of the amount cannot be made.
	
y.	
Segment reporting
	
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’). The 
CODM is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Note 2A: Significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
	
	
The preparation of the group’s consolidated 
financial statements requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, 
liabilities and the accompanying disclosures, and 
the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty 
about these assumptions and estimates could result 
in outcomes that require a material adjustment to 
the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in 
future periods.
	
	
Judgements
	
	
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies, management has made the following 
judgements, which have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements:
	
	
1 	
Revenue from contracts with customers
	
	
	
The Group provides product development/
engineering services to its customers. Under 
IND AS 115, the group has determined that 
such services generally do not constitute 
a separate performance obligation under 
the contracts with customers but are part 
of the performance obligation of the group 
to supply finished goods to the customer. 
Accordingly, under IND AS 115, revenue from 
product development/engineering services is 
recognised over the period of production from 
the start of production (SOP) date. Payments 
received from customers in respect of such 
services before SOP date are considered 
as contract liability. Further, the group has 
determined that the costs incurred in respect 
of product development/engineering services 
are eligible to be capitalised as intangible 
assets and accordingly such costs have been 
presented 
as 
‘Capitalised 
development 
expenditure’ under Intangible assets (also 
refer note 4.2).
	
	
	
Development of toolings for the customers has 
been identified by the group to be a separate 
performance obligation. Further, the group has 
determined that the performance obligation 
in respect of development of toolings primarily 
pertaining to global automotive lighting 
business is generally satisfied over time. For 
other tooling contracts, the performance 
obligation is satisfied at a point in time or 
over time based on the specific terms of the 
contract.
	
	
2	
Non-recognition of deferred tax liability on 
undistributed profits of subsidiaries
	
	
	
Certain subsidiaries and joint ventures of the 
group have undistributed retained earnings 
amounting to J 5,015.77 million (March 31, 
2022: J 12,227.78 million), which if distributed 
out as dividend would result in tax liability 
of group. Keeping in view that, no profit is 
proposed to be distributed in the immediate 
future by way of dividend out of such 
undistributed retained earnings, no deferred 
tax liability has been recognised
	
	
3	
Determining the lease term of contracts with 
renewal and termination options – Group as 
lessee
	
	
	
The Group determines the lease term as the 
non-cancellable term of the lease, together 
with any periods covered by an option to 
extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to 
be exercised, or any periods covered by an 
option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably 
certain not to be exercised. The Group 
has certain lease contracts that include 
extension and termination options. The Group 
applies judgement in evaluating whether it is 
reasonably certain whether or not to exercise 
the option to renew or terminate the lease. 
That is, it considers all relevant factors that 
create an economic incentive for it to exercise 
either the renewal or termination. After the 
commencement date, the Group reassesses 
the lease term if there is a significant event 
or change in circumstances that is within its 
control and affects its ability to exercise or not 
to exercise the option to renew or to terminate 
(e.g. construction of significant leasehold 
improvements or significant customisation to 
the leased asset).

De-recognition of trade receivables under 
factoring arrangements
	
	
	
The Group enters into non-recourse factoring 
arrangements for its trade receivables with 
various banks/financial institutions. The Group 
derecognizes the receivables from its books 
if it transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset 
(i.e. receivables). The assessment of de-
recognition of trade receivables under the 
factoring arrangements is complex and 
requires judgement.
	
	
	
Estimates and assumptions
	
	
1	
Goodwill Impairment Test: Key assumptions 
used for value-in-use calculations
	
	
	
The group tests whether goodwill has suffered 
any impairment atleast on an annual basis 
irrespective of whether there is any indication 
of impairment. The recoverable amount of a 
cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill 
balance is allocated is determined based 
on value-in-use calculations which require 
the use of assumptions. The calculations use 
cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by management covering 
a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the 
five-year period are extrapolated using the 
estimated growth, consistent with industry 
forecasts. The growth rates are consistent with 
forecasts included in industry reports specific 
to the industry in which each CGU operates. 
The key assumptions used to determine the 
recoverable amounts for the CGUs which 
have Goodwill amounts which are significant 
in comparison to the total carrying amount of 
goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, are 
disclosed and further explained in note 4.1.
	
	
2	
Defined benefit plans
	
	
	
The liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of defined benefit pension 
and gratuity plans is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation at the end 
of the reporting period less the fair value of 
plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method.
	
	
	
An 
actuarial 
valuation 
involves 
making 
various assumptions that may differ from 
actual developments in the future. These 
include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases and mortality 
rates. Due to the complexities involved in 
the valuation and its long-term nature, a 
defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to 
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date. 
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end 
of the reporting period on government 
bonds / high quality corporate bonds (as 
applicable) that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation. 
The mortality rate is based on publicly 
available 
mortality 
tables 
based 
on 
the country where the entity operates. 
Those mortality tables tend to change only at 
interval in response to demographic changes. 
Future salary increases and gratuity increases 
are based on expected future inflation rates 
of the respective country.
	
	
3	
Deferred taxes
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is 
probable that these amounts can be utilised 
against future taxable surpluses and against 
fiscal, temporary differences.  At each balance 
sheet date, the group assesses whether the 
realization of future tax benefits is sufficiently 
probable to recognize/carry forward deferred 
tax assets (including MAT credit). This assessment 
requires the use of significant estimates with 
respect to assessment of future taxable income. 
The recorded amount of total deferred tax 
assets could change if estimates of projected 
future taxable income or if changes in current 
tax regulations are enacted. Refer note 20 for 
details.

Recognition of tooling revenue over time
	
	
	
In respect of tooling contracts where revenue 
is recognised over time, the measurement 
of progress towards completion requires the 
group to estimate the services performed to 
date as a proportion of the total services to be

 for the year ended March 31, 2023

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
performed which is based on the proportion of 
actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. 
Such estimates are continually evaluated. 
They are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future 
events that may have a financial impact 
on the group and that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances.
	
	
5	
Leases - Estimating the incremental borrowing 
rate
	
	
	
The Group cannot readily determine the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, 
it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to 
measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of 
interest that the Group would have to pay 
to borrow over a similar term, and with a 
similar security, the funds necessary to obtain 
an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment. The 
IBR therefore reflects what the Group ‘would 
have to pay’, which requires estimation 
when no observable rates are available 
(such as for subsidiaries that do not enter 
into financing transactions) or when they 
need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and 
conditions of the lease (for example, when 
leases are not in the subsidiary’s functional 
currency). The Group estimates the IBR using 
observable inputs (such as market interest 
rates) when available and is required to make 
certain entity-specific estimates (such as the 
subsidiary’s stand-alone credit rating).

Provision for warranty
	
	
	
Warranties are provided for a specified period 
of time. Warranty obligations vary depending 
upon the type of the product, geographical 
location of its sale and other factors. The 
estimated liability for warranties is recorded 
when the products are sold. These estimates 
are established using historical information 
on the nature, frequency and average cost 
of warranty claims and estimates regarding 
possible future incidence based on actions 
on product failures. Determination of warranty 
liability is based on the estimated frequency 
and amount of future claims, which are 
inherently uncertain. Actual claims incurred 
in the future may differ from our original 
estimates, 
which 
may 
materially 
affect 
warranty expenses.

The Group has lease contracts for various items of land, building and plant/machineries used in its operations.  Leases of 
land and building generally have lease terms between 3 and 25 years, leases of plant and machinery generally have 
lease terms between 3 and 15 years. The Group’s obligations under its leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased 
assets. Generally, the Group is restricted from assigning and subleasing the leased assets.
The Group also has certain leases of machinery with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of office equipment with 
low value. The Group applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ recognition exemptions for these leases.

*With respect to goodwill amounts in these CGUs; reasonable change in key assumptions does not result change in the 
carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amounts as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.	
** CGU pertaining to VLS Turkey has been transferred to discontinued operations. Refer note 51 for more details.
The Group performed its annual impairment test for years ended March 2023 and March 2022 on March 31, 2023 and March 
31, 2022 respectively. The Group considers the relationship between the fair value (based on DCF) of each CGU and its book 
value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment.                                                                                                                                      
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGU, have been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash 
flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management. As a result of the analysis, management did 
not identify impairment.

Credit period

No trade or other receivable are due from directors or other officers of the company either severally or jointly with any 
other person. Nor any trade or other receivable are due from firms or private companies respectively in which any director 
is a partner, a director or a member.
Transferred Receivables	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The carrying amounts of trade receivables include receivable which are subject to a factoring arrangement. Under the 
arrangement, the Group has transferred the relevant receivables to the factor in exchange for cash and is prevented 
from selling or pledging the receivables. However, the Group has retained credit risk and late payment risk. The Group 
therefore continues to recognise the transferred assets in its balance sheet. The amount repayable under the factoring 
agreement is presented as secured/unsecured borrowing.
The relevant carrying amounts are as follows:

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on terms of 30 to 215 days.
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the 
Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before 
payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.
	
Contract liabilities include advances received from customers for performing engineering design and development 
services.

Performance obligation
	
Revenue from contracts with customers include revenue from finished goods, tooling and job work services.	
	
Information about the above Group’s performance obligations are summarised below:
	
Finished goods
	
For the sale of finished goods the performance obligation is generally satisfied upon its delivery and payment is 
generally due within 30 to 120 days from delivery. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
	
The Group provides normal warranty provisions on some of its products sold, in line with the industry practice. The 
Group considers that the contractual promise made to the automaker in the form of warranties for the parts supplied 
does not meet the definition of separate performance obligation as it does not give rise to additional service.	
	
Product development/engineering services are considered as related to sale of parts rather than a separate 
performance obligation. As a result, revenue from engineering services is recognised over the period of production 
from the date of start of production. Costs incurred in respect of providing engineering services are recognised as 
intangible assets and amortised over the period of production from the date of start of production. Payments received 
from customers in respect of product development/engineering services are presented as contract liabilities. 
	
Supply of toolings
	
Development of toolings for the customers has been identified by the group to be a separate performance obligation. 
Further, the group has determined that the performance obligation in respect of development of toolings primarily 
pertaining to automotive lighting business is generally satisfied over time. For other tooling contracts, the performance 
obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time based on the specific terms of the contract.
	
Job work revenue is recognised when the work is completed and billed to customer.
	
Set out below is the amount of revenue recognised from:

Defined Benefit Plan (Gratuity) (Indian entities) (forming part of continuing operations)	
	
The Group provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Employees who are 
in continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount of gratuity payable on retirement/
termination is the employees last drawn basic salary plus Dearness Allowance per month computed proportionately 
for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Group 
makes contributions to recognised funds in India. The Group does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target 
level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimations of expected gratuity payments.

4.86 - 12.13
	
As per actuary report, the group assesses these assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent 
industry standards. The discount rate is based on the government bonds.
	
Quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumptions are as follows:
Particulars
As at 
March 31, 2023
As at 
March 31, 2022
Increase/(decrease) in present value of defined benefit obligation as at 
the end of the year

3.78%
9.56%
(iv) 	1% decrease in rate of salary escalation
-3.56%
-8.46%
	
Sensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation 
of the defined benefit obligation by 1%, keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. When calculating the 
sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method(present value of 
defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of reporting period) has been 
applied while calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet. The methods  and types of 
assumptions used  in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

The group operates defined benefit pension plan in Italy (previous year - Mexico, Germany, Italy, Poland and Turkey). 
The plan is salary pension plan, which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension 
payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on members length of services and their salary in the final 
years leading up to retirement.
	
The group funds the pension liability as per legal requirements of respective countries. Plan assets are governed by 
local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the group and the trustees

RISK EXPOSURE AND ASSET LIABILITY MATCHING
	
Provision of a defined benefit scheme poses certain risks, some of which are detailed here under as companies take 
on uncertain long-term obligations to make future benefit payments.
	
1)	 Liability Risks
	
	
Asset-Liability Mismatch Risk
	
	
Risk which arises if there is a mismatch in the duration of the assets relative to the liabilities. By matching duration 
with the defined benefit liabilities, the company is successfully able to neutralize valuation swings caused by 
interest rate movements. Hence companies are encouraged to adopt asset-liability management.
	
	
Discount Rate Risk:
	
	
Variations in the discount rate used to compute the present value of the liabilities may seem small, but in practice 
can have a significant impact on the defined benefit liabilities.
	
	
Future Salary Escalation and Inflation Risk:
	
	
Since price inflation and salary growth are linked economically, they are combined for disclosure purposes. 
Rising salaries will often resulting higher future defined benefit payments resulting in a higher present value of 
liabilities especially unexpected salary increases provided at management’s discretion may lead to uncertainties 
in estimating this increasing risk
	
2)	 Asset Risks
	
	
All plan assets are maintained in a trust fund managed by a public sector insurer viz; LIC of India. LIC has a 
sovereign guarantee and has been providing consistent and competitive returns over the years.
	
	
For Overseas entities, the group has opted for a traditional fund wherein all assets are invested primarily in risk 
averse markets. The group has no control over the management of funds but this option provides a high level 
of safety for the total corpus. A single account is maintained for both the investment and claim settlement and 
hence 100% liquidity is ensured. Also interest rate and inflation risk are taken care of.

(ii)	  Valuation technique used to determine fair value
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments included in 
the above tables:
	
- 	
The fair values of the mutual funds are based on price quotations at the reporting date.
	
- 	
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit 
ratings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps are valued using valuation techniques, which 
employs the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward 
pricing model, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality 
counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency 
basis spread between the respective currencies, interest rate curves, etc. The changes in counterparty credit risk 
had no material effect on financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit and loss.
	
 -	
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and principal swap is determined using forward exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
Note 41 : Financial risk management
	
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, 
trade and other payables, and financial guarantee contracts. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to 
finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables and 
cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions. 
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s senior management oversees the 
management of these risks. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams 
that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives for 
speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks, which are summarised below:
	
A	
Market Risk
	
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk : currency risk, interest rate risk and other price 
risk such as equity price risk and commodity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans 
and borrowings, receivables, payables, deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.
	
	
a) 	 Foreign currency risk
	
	
	
The continuing operations of the Group operate internationally and the business is also transacted in several 
currencies. Consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk mainly in the North America and 
Europe. The exchange rate between the rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent 
years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations are 
affected positively/adversely as the rupee appreciates /depreciates against these currencies. The Group 
evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign exchange forward 
contracts, interest and principle swaps and options to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on 
foreign currency exposures. The Group follows established risk management policies, to hedge forecasted 
cash flows denominated in foreign currency. The Group has designated certain derivative instruments as 
cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure.
	
- 	
The borrowings are at floating rate of interest and hence their fair values as at March 31, 2023 approximate their 
carrying values. The fair value of the other non-current financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised costs 
is determined using discounted cash flow basis.
 	
- 	
The carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities including trade receivables, loans, trade 
payables, cash and bank balances, borrowings, security deposits, other financial assets, other financial liabilities, 
acceptances measured at amortised costs are considered to approximate their fair values, due to their short-
term nature.

Sensitivity
	
	
	
For the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, every 5% percentage point appreciation/
depreciation in the exchange rate between the INR and U.S. Dollar would have affected the Group’s 
incremental operating margins by approximately Rs. 6.14 Million and Rs. 5.04 Million respectively,  Euro by 
approximately Rs. 7.45 Million and Rs. 0.92 Million.
	
	
	
Sensitivity analysis is computed based on the changes in receivables and payables in foreign currency upon 
conversion into functional currency, due to exchange rate fluctuations between the previous reporting 
period and the current reporting period.
	
	
b) 	 Interest rate risk
	
	
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of change in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates 
primarily to the Group’s long term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
	
	
	
Interest rate sensitivity
	
	
	
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on exposure to interest rate. For floating rate 
liabilities, analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period 
was outstanding for the whole year. With all other variables held constant, the group profit before tax is 
affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:

c) 	 Other price risk	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Group does not have material investments in equity securities other than investments in Joint Ventures. 
Hence equity price risk is considered to be low. Further, the Group’s operating activities require the ongoing 
purchase of various commodities for manufacture of automotive parts. However, the movement in commodity 
prices are substantially adjusted through price differences as per customer contracts and hence commodity 
price risk for the Group is also considered to be low.
	
B	
Credit Risk Management	
	
	
Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or 
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities 
(primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, 
foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Group only deals with parties which have 
good credit rating/worthiness given by external rating agencies or based on the Group’s internal assessment.
	
	
Trade receivables
	
	
Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer 
credit risk management. Further, Group’s customers includes marquee OEMs and Tier I companies, having long 
standing relationship with the Group. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and reconciled. 
At March 31, 2023, receivable from Group’s top 15 customers accounted for approximately 82% (March 31, 2022 
: top 15 customers accounted for approximately 87%) of all the receivables outstanding. An impairment analysis 
is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis based on historical data. The maximum exposure to 
credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of trade receivables disclosed in note 10.
	
	
Financial instruments and cash deposits
	
	
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s corporate treasury 
department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved 
counterparties. Credit limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss 
through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
	
	
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at 31 March, 2023 and 31 
March, 2022 is the carrying amounts as disclosed in note 11. The group’s maximum exposure relating to financial 
guarantee is disclosed in Note 38.

C	
Liquidity risk
	
	
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or 
at a reasonable price. The Group’s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as 
well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior 
management. Management monitors the Group’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of 
expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks.

Note 51 :  Discontinued operations
Varroc Engineering Limited (“VEL”) and VarrocCorp Holding BV, Netherlands (“VCHBV”, wholly owned subsidiary of 
VEL) (together referred to as “Sellers”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated April 29, 2022 as amended 
dated October 05, 2022 and May 12, 2023 (collectively referred to as “SPA”) with Compagnie Plastic Omnium SE, France 
(referred to as “Buyer”), to divest the Sellers 4-Wheeler lighting business in the Americas and Europe (“VLS Business”) 
which was included in the Automotive segment. The equity value agreed under the SPA was Euro 69.5 million (subject to 
closing adjustments as provided under the SPA) and accordingly the loss on sale of VLS Business of H 5,709.12 million (after 
considering gain on release of foreign currency translation reserve balance of H 3,005.70 million) was recognised as of the 
Closing Date.
As per the terms of the SPA, a specific ‘Adjustment Escrow’ has been provided for the Final Closing Statement and the 
Final Closing Adjustment Statement to be prepared as of Closing Date i.e. October 06, 2022. The Buyer had a period of 90 
working days to come up with the same duly supported by requisite information/documentation. 
The Buyer submitted the final adjustments but failed to provide the necessary supporting details to enable the Sellers to 
understand these adjustments. Hence, Sellers sent a Dispute Notice in accordance with the SPA disputing the proposed 
adjustments. Pursuant to the amendment to SPA dated May 12, 2023, both parties have mutually agreed to attempt the 
resolution of their disagreements in accordance with the provisions of the SPA. Considering the disagreement between 
the parties and the negotiations with the Buyer are under progress, the  effect of the proposed adjustments cannot be 
ascertained for recognition in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2023.
A.	 Summarised financial information of the discontinued operations
	
The management assessed that VLS business satisfies the criteria prescribed under IND AS 105 "Non-current Assets 
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" for classification as discontinued operation. The income and expenses of 
continuing operations includes transactions with discontinued operation, which does not have impact on "Profit/(loss)
