Carbon emission is considered the 
primary driver of global climate

from industries strengthen the 
greenhouse 
effect,

discontinuation in demand from 
the customers may have an 
adverse effect on revenues and 
profitability of the Company.
The Company has been actively 
working on enhancing the quality 
and 
consistency 
of 
customer 
experience. The Company has also 
been making the efforts to de-risk 
the business model by diversifying 
the client base. The company’s track 
record is good on this measure.
Negative
11.
Health & Safety
Risk
Because of the nature of its 
operations, 
the 
Company’s 
business is exposed to risks, which 
involves jeopardizing the health 
and safety of our employees and 
customers. It requires that we 
make an objective assessment 
of hazards that can lead to the 
harm, injury, death, or illness of 
employees at the workplace or 
could harm customers.
The Company has 'zero tolerance' 
for any compromise or deviation 
from accepted safety norms and

a 
comprehensive 
objective 
and 
subjective measure of the interest, 
drive, level of enthusiasm and 
dedication employees feel toward 
their job and their general, broader 
organization responsibilities. This 
is an opportunity for the Company

more concerned about their work 
and about the performance of the 
Company.

Engagement
Opportunity
For business resilience and a 
positive and sustainable long-
term 
engagement 
with 
the

Business ethics risks are related 
to lack of ethical conduct in the 
organization. It is one of the 
most important dimensions of 
organizational risk and could 
lead

and 
operational 
negative 
impact 
on the organization. Hence, it 
is crucial that these risks are 
regularly identified and managed 
appropriately.

Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion
Opportunity
An 
organization’s 
long-term 
growth 
and 
its 
sustainability 
depends 
on 
how 
it 
creates 
opportunities for the workforce 
and how integrated they feel in the 
system. As modern-day working 
environment continues to evolve, 
Diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DEI) are closely linked values 
which could play an important 
role 
in 
creating 
a 
cohesive 
workplace and high-performance 
environment. 
Our 
company 
is 
an 
equal 
opportunity employer and there is

religions, 
abilities, 
genders, and sexual orientations. 
Our company is also a responsive

DBL ensures proper waste disposal, effluents and emissions checking, among 
several other steps to prevent health and environmental hazards. Waste such as 
used oils collected and stored in a covered and segregated area at site so that it 
will not impact on environment and send it to DBL CWS (Central work Shop) for 
reuse through recycle process. Steel Scrap Waste such as metal scrap is stored 
in a covered and isolated area on site and sent to foundries to be reused and 
developed for new iron/steel equipment and highway infrastructure parts. Re-
Using Milled Material in Road Bases is a great value addition to DBL's innovations. 
The process involves deploying Milling Machines to separate available aggregate 
portions from existing roads. DBL then blends this material (40%) and fresh 
aggregate (60%) to suit the specifications.
