around our robust commitment to environmental stewardship. We place considerable emphasis on actively engaging

extends beyond mere compliance. This is exemplified by the robust governance systems and meticulous risk management 
processes that underpin our operations. These include the implementation of effective policies and processes that 
ensure all our business activities adhere to ethical principles, internal policies, procedural guidelines, and pertinent legal 
regulations. Central to our ethos is an unwavering respect for human rights, which serves as the cornerstone of our 
operations and permeates our interactions with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities we are privileged 
to serve. A cornerstone of our commitment is the establishment of safe and healthy workplaces. As part of this dedication, 
we are resolute in contributing to the United Nations Sustainability Goals, with an aim to surpass our contributions and 
effect lasting positive change in the communities, for this we have taken many initiatives under our CSR Projects for 
the betterment of the society. Our initiatives span a wide spectrum, encompassing measures such as the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by planting indoor plants. We also take strides to enhance green spaces within our workplaces 
and promote energy conservation through the implementation of LED lighting. Our commitment to environmental 
responsibility is further demonstrated by the use of biodegradable garbage bags, and our LEED-certified buildings, which 
align with our commitment to sustainable building practices. We are proud of our progress thus far and remain dedicated

1
Potted plants in company 
premises 
 -
Reduction in GHG emissions and other indoor pollutants. It also 
enhances the greenery in the work place.
2
LED lights for energy 
conservation 
-
It helps to conserve energy, in various ways: 
1.	 High Energy Efficiency: LED (Light Emitting Diode) lights are 
highly energy-efficient compared to traditional incandescent 
or fluorescent bulbs.
2.	 Low Power Consumption: LED lights require significantly less 
power to produce the same amount of light as traditional 
bulbs.
Long Lifespan: LED lights have a much longer lifespan compared 
to traditional bulbs.
3
Usage 
of 
Biodegradable 
Garbage Bags
-
Benefits of the usage are: 
1.	 Environmental Friendliness: Biodegradable garbage bags are 
designed to break down and decompose naturally over time 
through biological processes.
2.	 Reduced Plastic Waste: By using biodegradable garbage 
bags, the reliance on traditional plastic bags is reduced.
Landfill Management: Biodegradable garbage bags can facilitate 
more efficient waste management in landfills.
4
Water Faucets rather than 
the Water Taps
-
It helps to conserve water, in various ways: 
1.	 Precise water control: Water faucets typically have lever 
handles or knobs that allow for precise control of the water 
flow and temperature.
2.	 Reduced Flow Rate: Many modern water faucets come with 
built-in flow restrictors or aerators, which limit the flow rate 
of water without compromising performance.
Leakage Detection: Faucets often have mechanisms that make it 
easier to detect and address leaks promptly.
5.
Installation of Solar Panels 
-
Solar utilizes lower powered items such as LED / CFL lamps, 
lower powered electronics, etc. that do not use as much power 
as standard electric systems. Also, LEDs are powered from 12 
VDC initially and require AC adapters to power with standard 
electric. By using DC power for LEDs, they are able to operate 
more efficiently by providing more light and less heat. In this 
way, electricity can be saved.
6.
LEED Gold certification
-
LEED-certified buildings save money, improve efficiency, lower 
carbon emissions and create healthier places for people. They 
are critical to addressing climate change and meeting ESG 
goals, enhancing resilience, and supporting more equitable 
communities. LEED categories can also contribute toward 
meeting the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals.
7.	 Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
