HGIEL is building 
for the next phase 
of its growth
Overview
At HGIEL, the principal message that I 
seek to communicate to shareholders 
is that your Company is at the cusp of 
a large structural shift – in terms of size, 
diversification and sustainability.
The priority is not just to address the 
order book of the day but embark on the 
process to make strategic adjustments 
that make our growth sustainable from 
this moment onwards.
The Company achieved the largest 
accretion in its order book and witnessed 
substantial revenue growth during 
the last financial year. Moreover, it has 
expanded its presence in sectors like 
water, railways, metro and partnered 
Adani Group in the Ganga Expressway 
project, secured prominent projects, 
including three HAM projects, three non-
road projects.
India growth story
At HGIEL, much of our optimism is 
derived from the unfolding India story.
The last two Union Budgets have 
been seminal for modern India. The 
government outlined an unprecedented 
outlay for infrastructure creation. 
When you take the last two Union 
Budgets combined, the outlay for 
infrastructure capital expenditure 
programmes has increased from H7.50 
At HGIEL, much of our optimism 
is derived from the unfolding 
India story.
Harendra Singh, Chairman and Managing Director
10     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Lakh Crore for FY 2021-22 to H10 Lakh 
Crore in FY 2023-24.
This indicates that even as it took India 
73 years to reach an infrastructure outlay 
of H4.39 Lakh Crore until FY 2020-21, it 
took the country just three years to add 
another H5.61 Lakh Crore.
In FY 2023-24, the central government 
plans to expedite road construction 
by awarding new projects covering 
approximately 12,000 to 12,500 Km. 
Additionally, there will be a focus on 
completing ongoing projects before 
the 2024 general elections, which is 
expected to significantly enhance 
execution pace during FY 2023-24.
For decades, India was principally a 
consumption-driven economy. Much 
of the country’s growth was generated 
from its growing population, increasing 
aspirations and evolving lifestyles. This 
growth transpired despite an extensive 
and long-standing under-investment in 
India’s infrastructure, which is usually the 
biggest income enabler. The result was 
that even as personal incomes grew, the 
growth of India’s infrastructure continued 
to be muted. The country’s growth 
was driven primarily by the strength 
coming from its single engine and that 
engine remained its aggregate personal 
consumption.
Then came the Union Budgets of 
FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. These two 
Budgets have kickstarted the shifting of 
the national needle. These two Budgets 
now represent a structural shift. They 
are expected to accelerate the transition 
of India from a consumption-driven 
economy to a consumption cum 
infrastructure-driven economy.
This transition will make it possible for 
India to emerge as one of the principal 
drivers of the global economy. This 
transition will emerge as a capex 
multiplier – from one government raising 
the infrastructure investment bar to 
thousands of companies doing the same 
across the breadth of the economy. This 
transition will enhance the investing 
confidence of sectors, companies and 
individuals – in equipment, technologies, 
processes and people. This transition will 
result in the building of a larger number 
of infrastructure drivers like roads, ports, 
airports, bridges, waterways and mobility. 
This transition will result in a quicker pace 
of infrastructure spending – what would 
happen in a decade in the past is now 
likely to be compressed within a couple 
of years.
When you have the rest of the world 
fearing a slowdown, and even a 
recession, the reality is the reverse in 
India. India is growing faster than China 
and any other major economy even 
The company 
also intend to 
grow revenues 
at existing 
pace of 20-25% 
and report yet 
another record 
year by revenues, 
cash flows and 
surplus.

as much of the world is slowing. India 
is preparing a growth runway for the 
next 24 years to 2047 where much 
of its growth its likely to be derived 
from a long-awaited correction in its 
infrastructure under-investment.
Capitalising
HGIEL is optimistic of capitalising on the 
national infrastructure inflection point.
The Company is broad basing its 
presence beyond road building; 
initiatives begun in this direction during 
the last financial year when the Company 
bidded for projects comprising metro rail 
projects, railway station infrastructure. 
These businesses may appear different 
at first glance; however, the principles of 
infrastructure building in these segments 
are similar to road building. In view of this 
reality, the extension may be considered 
adjacent and even synergic, making it 
possible for the Company to build on 
existing knowledge and experience 
pools.
The Company believes that by seeding 
its presence in these spaces, the 
Company may strengthen related pre-
qualification credentials, attract more 
projects, aggregate specific experience 
and bid for even larger projects – a 
virtuous cycle. In some spaces, the 
Company possesses pre-qualification 
credentials while in others the Company 
may enter into relevant joint ventures.
The result is that the Company’s intent 
is to enhance the proportion of non-
road projects in the order book from 
10% during the last financial year to an 
estimated 25% in the next three years. 
Our belief is that diversifying our revenue 
streams beyond highways, where we 
possess a competitive advantage, will be 
the crucial step in establishing ourselves 
as a comprehensive infrastructure 
company for the foreseeable future
We believe that India will emerge as 
one of the fastest growing infrastructure 
drivers in the world, marked by an 
unprecedented investment going into 
virtually every part of its transforming 
infrastructure story – whether it is 
airports, ports, railway stations, water 
treatment projects or ropeways. On 
the other hand, we believe that a 
sectorial shakeout, higher construction 
benchmarks, and rising pre-qualification 
standards have led to an industry wide 
consolidation. This trend favors larger 
companies with robust Balance Sheets, 
enabling them to address even bigger 
opportunities and strengthen their 
market position.
HGIEL’s priorities
At HGIEL, we are investing today to 
be attractively placed to capitalise on 
emerging long-term opportunities.
One, the Company is broad basing its 
organogram with the objective to create 
positions that will be critically needed; 
it is plugging these positions with 
subject matter experts, training these 
professionals, strengthening its business 
development function and creating 
platforms for scalable growth.
In FY 2023-24, the 
Company aims to secure 
orders worth H8,000 to 
H9,000 Crore, maintaining 
a book-to-bill ratio of 
over 2.5x
12     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Two, the Company is deepening its 
digital investments with the objective 
to control projects on real time basis 
through a competent of automation and 
manual surveillance. This is helping us 
correct deviations with speed, ensuring 
that our projects are completed on 
schedule and within budgeted costs.
Three, at HGIEL, we have created a 
robust network of vendors possessing 
specialised capabilities, making 
it possible for us to aggregate 
their competence and deliver as a 
consolidated whole in line with the 
needs of our customers.
Four, we possess a culture of fiscal 
discipline in growing revenues 20-25% 
each year, a growth sweet spot that will 
not strain our financials or compromise 
the sustainable delivery of stakeholder 
value. The Company will continue 
to exercise stringent control in cash 
flows management, capital allocation 
discipline, equipment fleet rejuvenation 
and remaining under-borrowed (debt-
equity ratio of 0.28 as on March 31, 2023).
Optimism
The Company has prepared for its 
expansion phase by focusing on 
operational efficiency, cost optimization, 
and timely project execution. In 
FY 2023-24, the Company aims to secure 
orders worth H8,000 to H9,000 Crore, 
maintaining a book-to-bill ratio of over 
2.5x. Notably, there is a strong NHAI 
bid of approximately H1,10,000 Crore 
in the pipeline this year. Additionally, 
in the railways and metro sectors, 
there is an expected bidding of around 
H15,000 Crore, presenting a significant 
opportunity to grow the business and 
increase the order book.
The company also intend to grow 
revenues at existing pace of 20-25% 
and report yet another record year by 
revenues, cash flows and surplus.
By the virtue of broad basing our 
presence beyond highways and 
progressing towards responsible well-
roundedness, we are building the stage 
for our Company to emerge as a larger 
and respected infrastructure organisation 
that is committed to help take India 
ahead.

A financial perspective 
into our business
How we maintained business growth 
in FY 2022-23 and created a new foundation
Big picture
The big picture message is that HGIEL 
balanced its business momentum and 
created a new foundation that will 
empower the Company towards the next 
growth phase. The Company reported a 
5-year CAGR revenue growth of 26.0%, 
EBITDA growth of 27.8%, PAT growth of 
38.0% and order book growth of 22.3%. 
During the year, the Company won new 
contracts, which indicates its overarching 
competence in addressing stakeholders’ 
needs for the moment and the future.
Order book
During the last financial year, your 
Company seeded its growth foundation 
to graduate to the next level. At the start 
of the year under review, your Company 
possessed an order book of H79,729 
Million; during the year under review, 
your Company added H86,298 Million in 
new orders and finished the year with a 
pending order book of H1,25,953 Million. 
The order book was achieved with a 
strike rate of 8%; average order size 
was H13,138 Million (which compares

favourably with the order book of 
H79,729 Million in FY 2021-22).
The net increase in order book increase 
of H46,224 Million was accounted for a 
large part 31% by the Ganga Expressway 
road building project. This is indicative 
of a structural shift in the sector, marked 
by projects of growing size. Around 
10% of the order book comprised non-
road building projects, indicating the 
Company’s commitment to broad base 
its business exposure.
The order book, which amounts to 
over H1,25,000 Million, is scheduled to 
be fulfilled within the next three years, 
resulting in increased revenues from 
2024 to 2026. The Company’s prudent 
approach has led to a balanced order 
book-to-revenue ratio of 2.9x, influenced 
by the strength of its Balance Sheet.
As a bidding discipline, the Company bid 
for projects around an EBITDA margin of 
15-16%.
Profitable growth
The valuation of the Company’s business 
model was derived from profitable 
growth across the last 5 years. In view 
of this, the Company’s revenue growth 
now translates into a higher rate of profit 
accretion. The Company reported 22.2% 
revenue growth over the previous year 
(compared with the Indian GDP growth 
of a projected 6%), 21.5% increase in 
EBIDTA and 24.4% growth in PAT in FY23.

Rating
The highlight of the Company’s 
performance was how it was perceived 
by demanding credit rating agencies. 
Your Company enhanced its credit rating 
of A+ to AA- for long-term borrowings 
as appraised by ICRA Limited. The 
rating was favourably influenced by the 
Company’s pre-qualification credentials, 
capital allocation discipline, established 
pan-India credentials, high bidding 
strike rate, pedigree of clients and timely 
projects completion. This creditable 
rating is likely to generate positive 
spin-offs, empowering the Company to 
mobilise low-cost debt across longer 
tenures and strengthen its respect as a 
front-line talent recruiter.

Capital efficiency
The Company reported creditable 
profitability during the year under review. 
EBITDA margin stood strong at 16.1%, 
which reflected an improvement in 
volumes, economies, working capital 
management and sizable equipment 
ownership. The Company achieved a 
robust Return on Capital Employed 
(RoCE) of 30% and a strong Return on 
Equity (RoE) of 24%.
The overall improvement in the health 
of the business was due to long-term 
priorities; enhanced economies of scale 
through larger contract sizes, rising 
equipment investments coupled with a 
sustained working capital management 
discipline.
Across the foreseeable future, the 
Company expects to generate a 
return superior to what risk partners 
(shareholders) would be able to generate 
if they invested in alternative asset 
classes. Following the expansion, the 
Company is optimistic of enhancing 
capital efficiency through a balance of 
debt cum equity-funded growth, timely 
projects commissioning, investment 
in cutting-edge technologies and 
commissioning of larger contract sizes 
around clusters.
Funding the expansion
The Company entered into a share 
purchase agreement with Highway 
Infrastructure Trust, supported by KKR, 
to sell its 100% stake in four subsidiaries: 
Gurgaon Sohna Highway Private Limited, 
H.G. Rewari Ateli Highway Private Limited, 
H.G. Ateli Narnaul Highway Private 
Limited, and H.G. Rewari Bypass Private 
Limited. The transaction’s enterprise 
value was H1,394 Crore, with an equity 
value of H531 Crore. The deal’s valuation 
stood at around 1.55x the price-to-book, 
surpassing the management’s earlier 
guidance of 1.3 to 1.4. The equity and 
debt commitments for all four HAM 
assets were H343 Crore and H996 Crore, 
respectively.
The Company focused on creating a 
sustainable financial foundation related 
to organic growth. The Company’s 
business was funded through H17,784 
Million of net worth and H5,037 Million 
of debt – a gearing of 0.28 that we 
consider safe. The Company considers 
the repayment tenure to be comfortable 
given its growing order book, increased 
contract size and enhanced surpluses. 
The Company finished the year under 
review with a gearing of 0.28, providing 
comfortable room to raise additional 
debt.
Margins
The Company maintained a robust 
EBITDA margin, which was achieved 
through a sustained focus on securing 
a larger number of contracts and larger 
project sizes per contract. This approach 
resulted in improved amortization and 
stronger margins. Additionally, the 
Company’s efficient working capital 
management ensured sufficient liquidity. 
By skillfully combining volume-based 
economies, resource management 
efficiency, and activity-based costing, the 
Company reinforced its position as one 
of the most competitive infrastructure 
companies in India. 
Revenues
The Company generated H44,013 Million 
from road construction operations in 
FY 2022-23. Road construction is the 
largest vertical in the Company and likely 
to remain so. However, the Company 
seeks to leverage its infrastructure 
construction capabilities and broad 
base its projects cum revenues mix. The 
Company intends to extend its business 
into adjacent business spaces like water 
resource, railways & metro projects, 
increasing the non-roads component of 
its order book to 25% in three years.
The Company generated its road 
building revenues from 11 States in 
FY 2022-23. The Company generated 
timely responses and stipulated 
construction scheduled through the 
creation of a regional office in South 
India (a region that accounted for 19% 
revenues in FY 2022-23). Nearly 46% of 
the Company’s revenue was derived from 
non-North India regions and 99% from 
non-Rajasthan (the state from where the 
Company started out). This capacity to 
broad base revenues beyond traditional 
geographic strongholds reflects the 
Company’s growing competence and 
confidence to service a rapidly growing 
national infrastructure sector.
Liquidity
As a policy, the management at HGIEL 
has maximised the use of accruals in 
business growth, moderating borrowed 
funds. This has worked best: the prudent 
use of moderately priced debt in projects 
has inspired the Company to perform 
better and left it with adequate net 
worth to fund working capital. The 
Company places a premium on liquidity, 
preferring it over profitability when 
the alternative is between maximum 
revenues with stretched liquidity and 
centrist revenues with enhanced 
liquidity.
The Company’s working capital 
management was strengthened through 
project completion before timelines, 
generating a bonus of H135.2 Million 
in FY 2022-23 (accounted for 1.9%of

the Company’s EBIDTA). Timely projects 
completion was achieved by working 
on projects marked by no land title 
issues and nearly 90% of the land being 
available to company to work on from 
the outset. The Company worked with an 
under-borrowed Balance Sheet, marked 
by adequate cash in hand, rising interest 
cover, strong gearing and lower Net 
debt/EBITDA. The Company focussed 
on strengthening terms of trade, 
leveraging cash in hand to generate raw 
material procurement discounts and 
addressing fresh capital expenditure 
needs (less incremental debt). The result 
of this financial discipline was that the 
Company repaid H615 Million during 
the last financial year even as it invested 
H2,874 Million in additional gross block.
Debt management
The Company’s total debt increased 
from H3,147 Million to H5,037 Million; net 
worth strengthened from H13,643 Million 
to H17,784 Million; gearing was from 
0.23 in FY 2021-22 to 0.28 in FY 2022-23 
as the Company grew net worth on the 
one hand and used short-term debt to 
address working capital requirements 
and investment in additional equipment 
following the award of a larger order 
book during the last financial year. The 
Company’s gearing as on March 31, 2023 
was among the lowest within India’s road 
building sector.
The cost of debt on the Company’s 
books was 8.28% on average during 
the year under review (7.95% on 
average in the previous year), which is 
considered reasonable. The Company 
mobilised fresh debt at 8.7%, which 
was lower than the rate at which most 
road builders mobilised short-term 
debt during the year under review. This 
was a manifestation of the Company’s 
competitive advantage translating 
into a lower cost of borrowings. The 
Company broad-based lenders from 
8.70% to 9.70%, widening its mobilisation 
flexibility and choice.
By the virtue of completing projects 
on schedule and realising receivables 
based on milestones, the Company is 
repaying short-term debt on time. The 
Company’s preference for the role of net 
worth in business growth has proved 
value-accretive, maximizing cash flows 
and creating a war chest for prospective 
investments.

it imperative for the Company to take 
a forward call on commodity price 
movements, negotiate volume-based 
documents with material providers 
and select to work with specialised 
material providers only. During the 
year under review, your Company 
moderated raw material costs as a 
proportion of revenues from 49.6% to 
48.5%, enhancing margins. The Company 
procured a larger quantity of material 
directly from companies as opposed to 
the erstwhile practice of procuring from 
authorised representatives.

Digitalisation interventions
In the business of infrastructure 
construction, there is a premium on the 
ability to control site dynamics. This need 
is increasingly pronounced in a business 
marked by several concurrent sites. Over 
the years, the Company made a decisive 
investment in digitalisation and CCTV 
coverage, making it possible to monitor 
construction across different sites. 
The Company increased investments 
in digitalised and automated fuel 
dispensing stations that translated into a 
lower cost related to diesel consumption. 
Besides, this approach standardised 
consumption per equipment, resulting 
in a deeper equipment understanding 
leading to precise planning. The 
Company invested in back-end 
digitalisation, strengthening financial 
planning and controls, the basis of the 
Company’s capacity to bid successively at 
one end and control projects in line with 
targeted estimates at the other.
Equipment ownership
In the business of infrastructure 
construction, the biggest expense is 
under the head of equipment. Plant & 
Equipment accounted for 51.9% of the 
Company’s gross block as on March 31, 
2023. The Company invested in a range 
of equipment to enhance workflow, 
moderate project downtime due to 
the non-availability of equipment and 
enhance project outcomes following 
the use of specialised equipment. 
Besides, the utilisation of proprietary 
equipment helped moderate the cost 
that would have been paid out as rental. 
Through prudent equipment planning, 
the Company accelerated projects and 
moderated equipment idling, catalysing 
profitability. As a matter of prudence, the 
Company maintained an equipment-
to-order book ratio of 2:5 optimising 
the availability of equipment for timely 
projects completion. The Company’s 
net fixed asset turnover stood at 7.7x, 
indicating that it utilised its investment in 
fixed assets to generate revenue.
Accruals management
Capital discipline is central to the 
Company’s sustainability. The Company 
generated H5,352 Million in cash profit 
during the year under review. Some 
1.2% of this availability was returned to 
shareholders as dividend.
Way forward
The Corporation enjoyed a strong 
financial position at the end of the fiscal 
year under review. The Company’s net 
worth stood at H17,784 Million as on 
March 31, 2023, with H5,037 Million 
in debt (long- and short-term). The 
Company’s large net worth was the 
outcome of a long-term build-up of 
surpluses. In an unpredictable world, 
this significant net worth bias implies 
relative de-risking; it provides the 
Company patient and resilient capital in 
challenging periods. The Company seeks 
to grow revenues 20-25% during the 
current financial year, growing its overall 
top line to a projected H10,000 Crore in 
three years.

Our integrated value 
creation approach
Overview
In the contemporary world, the focus has 
shifted from solely enhancing shareholder 
value to a broader concept recognised as 
stakeholder value. This term encompasses 
not only the interest group of shareholders 
but also every individual or entity that may 
be impacted by the Company’s brand, 
products, or operations. In essence, it 
encompasses all living beings and even non-
living entities likely to be influenced by the 
Company.
The Integrated Value Creation Report is 
gaining recognition for its comprehensive 
assessment of both tangible and intangible 
initiatives within its reporting framework. 
This report utilises various aspects, including 
financial data, management commentary, 
governance practices, remuneration 
strategies and sustainability reporting, to 
elucidate an organization’s capacity to 
generate, improve and maintain value. 
By incorporating these diverse strands, 
the report provides a holistic view of an 
organization’s overall performance and its 
ability to create sustainable value.
The Integrated Report enhances an 
understanding across diverse stakeholders 
(employees, customers, suppliers, business 
partners, local communities, legislators, 
regulators and policy makers), underlining 
the need for an organisation to enhance 
value in a sustainable manner.
Who we create value for
Our employees embody diverse expertise 
in driving business growth across multiple 
functions. We offer an energised workplace 
that fosters employment growth and boosts 
talent productivity.
Our shareholders invested capital during 
our business inception. Our primary objective 
is to generate re-investable free cash flow 
and undertake projects that prioritise shorter 
payback periods and improved Return on 
Capital Employed (RoCE), ultimately increasing 
shareholder value.
Our vendors ensure a steady supply of 
resources. We optimise materials procurement 
by establishing long-term contracts that 
prioritise quality, while rewarding promptness 
in remuneration.
Our customers play a vital role in generating 
the financial resources for our Company’s 
growth. We prioritise expanding our customer 
base and retaining existing customers to 
enhance our revenue visibility.
Our communities provide us with social 
capital (education, culture, security, safety, etc.) 
and, in turn, we support these communities 
through consistent engagement.
Our governments provide us with a stable 
structural framework that ensures law, order, 
policies etc. Our focus is to play the role of a 
responsible citizen.
At HGIEL, the prudent interplay of the value 
generated by each stakeholder ensures 
business sustainability and enhanced 
stakeholder value.

The resources of value creation
Our strategy
Natural capital: We derive 
all our resources – materials, 
water, fossil fuels and the 
world’s carbon sinks — from 
this capital. Our engagement 
is influenced by the degree 
of dependence on natural 
resources, environmental impact 
of the construction process 
on the environment and what 
the organisation needs to do 
to operate within environment 
limits. 
Social and relationship 
capital: This represents the 
relationships between our 
Company and stakeholders 
(community, governments, 
customers and supply 
chain partners). These could 
also comprise licenses or 
dependence on the supply 
chain. 
Intellectual capital: This 
includes resources like patents, 
copyrights, intellectual property 
and organisational systems, 
procedures and protocols. 
Human capital: This refers 
to organizational skills and 
know-how, marked by talent 
retention and training leading to 
outperformance. 
Financial capital: This 
comprises funds obtained 
through lenders or earnings 
- the funds pool available to 
business activities. 
Manufactured capital: 
This comprises physical 
infrastructure like buildings, 
equipment and tools that 
enhance organizational 
productivity.

At HGIEL, we are 
committed to 
strengthen our 
ESG commitment
Overview
As a responsible corporate citizen, HGIEL has adopted 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices 
that benefit all stakeholders. The Company focuses on 
stability, counter-cyclicality and long-term stakeholder 
value, rather than just reacting impulsively.
The Company believes that ESG is directly linked 
to improved competitiveness and is subset of 
sustainability. This enhanced competitiveness is 
reflected in factors such as revenue growth, cost 
reduction, reduced regulatory and legal interventions, 
increased employee engagement and optimised 
investment returns.
ESG practices are deeply embedded in HGIEL’s 
business strategy. The Company will continue to 
reinforce its ESG principles (adopted from NGRBC) to 
strengthen its foundation and deepen its position as a 
responsible corporate citizen.
Environment commitment: The Company will 
continue to invest in environmentally responsible 
practices and minimise carbon footprint through R&D 
and innovation in its offices and work sites.
Social commitment: The Company will continue to 
make proactive investments in hiring the right talent, 
building enduring relationships with customers, 
lenders and vendors and fulfil its corporate social 
responsibility.
Governance commitment: The Company continues 
to align business goals with ESG strategy, adherence 
to codes & conducts, maintain a well-composed 
Board, alignment with UNGC (United Nations Global 
Compact) principles and extensive risk management.
The Company has established an ESG council 
comprising representatives from various functions 
across its business. The council’s purpose is to discuss 
and plan the roadmap and actions pertaining to ESG. 
The Company is actively working on enhancing its 
systems, practices and procedures to make significant 
improvements in the ESG action.
Challenges and counter-initiatives
HGIEL operates in an infrastructure development 
projects setup where it faced many challenges while 
establishing a system for non-financial data collection 
from the project sites. Also, there were challenges 
related to limited ESG awareness among people 
working on the project sites.
HGIEL adopted a year-long step-by-step plan for the 
creation of ESG awareness among stakeholders, i.e. 
collection of information on a periodic basis, analysing 
trends, verifying the authenticity of information, and 
obtaining validation from process owners.
HGIEL engaged with internal and external 
stakeholders to understand their expectations. It 
conducts capacity-building workshops on ESG for all 
employees including the top management as well as 
vendors and suppliers meet.
HGIEL’s established systems for ESG are now control 
and ownership driven, which would be further built 
upon to create a holistic, robust and mature ESG 
culture.

Testimonials
“HGIEL’s tireless efforts in establishing 
the Gram Panchayat, Atal Sewa 
Kendra, anganwadi and schools 
brought about a positive change 
in our community. The provision of 
solar street lights was a remarkable 
addition, ensuring better safety and 
security for our village at night.”
Babita Garasiya
Sarpanch Umarni, Abu Road 
(Holistic Rural Development Project)
“Over 75 girls from underprivileged 
backgrounds residing in slums, 
living in kaccha houses, now 
have access to improved facilities 
due to impactful infrastructural 
interventions. They have benefited 
from better rooms, smart classrooms, 
toilets, drinking water, handwashing 
and sanitation facilities, which have 
played a crucial role in their overall 
development. As a long-term impact, 
these girls have gained aspirations 
to become self-reliant and have 
bigger dreams to achieve, such as 
becoming IAS officers, police officers, 
teachers and more.”

“HGIEL has planted 3,000 trees on our 
village’s barren land, a commendable 
step towards environmental 
conservation. The planted trees are 
in perfect alignment, transforming 
the land into a beautiful sight. In the 
future, we anticipate the growth of 
a lush forest on this very land where 
we stand.”

improved, and the provision of

Resident, Raya Kailashpuri 
(Holistic Rural Development Project)
“The establishment of RT-PCR facility 
in the State Disease Diagnostic 
Center will solve many problems as 
it will ease lumpy disease control. 
In future, due to the availability 
of facilities for testing with this 
technique in other diseases of 
animals and birds, there will be no 
dependence on disease diagnosis 
centers of other states. Kudos to H.G. 
Infra and H.G. Foundation for this 
great work.”

Directorate – Animal Husbandry 
Department, Rajasthan) (Animal

and an employee at the school, 
I have witnessed a remarkable

it has become vibrant and colorful. 
Boundaries have been constructed 
and drinking water facilities

“When my son was hospitalised in 
S.M.S Hospital for injuries sustained 
in an accident since March 28, 2023, 
I was concerned about arranging 
healthy meals. However, other 
patients informed me about the 
daily free meal distribution program 
by H.G. Foundation. I am delighted 
with the quality of the meals and it 
has been a great help for patients 
admitted here.’’

Management discussion 
and analysis
Global economy
Overview
The 
global 
economic 
growth 
was 
estimated at a slower 3.2% in 2022, 
compared to 6% in 2021 (which was 
on a smaller base of 2020 on account 
of the pandemic effect). The relatively 
slow global growth of 2022 was marked 
by the Russian invasion in Ukraine, 
unprecedented 
inflation, 
pandemic-
induced slowdown in China, higher 
interest rates, global liquidity squeeze and 
quantitative tightening by the US Federal 
Reserve.
The challenges of 2022 translated into 
moderated spending, disrupted trade and 
increased energy costs. Global inflation 
was 8.7% in 2022, among the highest in 
decades. US consumer prices increased 
about 6.5% in 2022, the highest in four 
decades. The Federal Reserve raised its 
benchmark interest rate to its highest in 
15 years. The concern in 2022 is that the 
following year would be slower.
The global equities, bonds, and crypto 
assets reported an aggregated value 
drawdown of USD26 trillion from its peak, 
equivalent to 26% of the global gross 
domestic product (GDP). In 2022, there 
was a concurrently unique decline in 
bond and equity markets; 2022 was the 
only year when the S&P 500 and 10-year 
US treasuries delivered negative returns 
of more than 10%.
Gross FDI inflows – equity, reinvested 
earnings and other capital – declined 
8.4% to $55.3 billion in April-December 
2022. The decline was even sharper in the 
case of FDI inflows as equity: these fell 
15% to $36.75 billion between April and 
December 2022. Global trade expanded 
by 2.7% in 2022 (expected to slow to 1.7% 
in 2023).
The S&P GSCI TR (Global benchmark for 
commodity performance) fell from a peak 
of 4,319.55 in June 2022 to 3495.76 in 
December 2022. There was a decline in 
crude oil, natural gas, coal, lithium, lumber, 
cobalt, nickel and urea realisations. Brent 
crude oil dropped from a peak of around 
USD 120 per barrel in June 2022 to USD 
80 per barrel at the end of the calendar 
year following the enhanced availability 
of low-cost Russian oil.

Outlook
The global economy is expected to 
grow at 2.8% in 2023, influenced by 
the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
Concurrently, global inflation is projected 
to fall marginally to 7%. Despite these 
challenges, there are positive elements 
within the global economic landscape. 
The largest economies like China, the 
US, the European Union, India, Japan, 
the UK, and South Korea are not in 
recession. Approximately 70% of the 
global economy demonstrates resilience, 
with no major financial distress observed 
in large emerging economies. The energy 
shock in Europe did not result in a 
recession, and significant developments, 
including China’s progressive departure 
from its strict zero-Covid policy and the 
resolution of the European energy crisis, 
fostered optimism for an improved global 
trade performance. Despite high inflation, 
the US economy demonstrated robust 
consumer demand in 2022. Driven by 
these positive factors, global inflation 
is likely to be still relatively high at 4.9% 
in 2024. Interestingly, even as the global 
economy is projected to grow less than 
3% for the next five years, India and China 
are projected to account for half the 
global growth.

According to the India Meteorological 
Department, the year 2022 delivered 
8% higher rainfall over the long-period 
average. Due to unseasonal rains, India’s 
wheat harvest was expected to fall to 
around 102 million metric tons (MMT) in 
2022-23 from 107 MMT in the preceding 
year. Rice production at 132 million 
metric tons (MMT) was almost at par 
with the previous year. Pulses acreage 
grew to 31 million hectares from 28 
million hectares. Due to a renewed focus, 
oilseeds area increased 7.31% from 102.36 
Lakh hectares in 2021-22 to 109.84 Lakh 
hectares in 2022-23.
India’s auto industry grew 21% in FY23; 
passenger vehicle (UVs, cars and vans) 
retail sales touched a record 3.9 million 
units in FY23, crossing 3.2 million units in 
FY19. The commercial vehicles segment 
grew 33%. Two-wheeler sales fell to 
a seven-year low; the three-wheeler 
category grew 84%.
Till the end of Q3FY23, total gross non-
performing assets (NPAs) of the banking 
system fell to 4.5% from 6.5% a year ago. 
Gross NPA for FY23 was expected to be 
4.2% and a further drop is predicted to 
3.8% in FY2023-24.
As India’s domestic demand remained 
steady amidst a global slowdown, import 
growth in FY23 was estimated at 16.5% 
to $714 billion as against $613 billion in 
FY22. India’s merchandise exports were 
up 6% to $447 billion in FY23. India’s total 
exports (merchandise and services) in 
FY23 grew 14 percent to a record of $775 
billion in FY23 and is expected to touch 
$900 billion in FY24. Till Q3 FY23, India’s 
current account deficit, a crucial indicator 
of the country’s balance of payments 
position, decreased to $18.2 billion, or 
2.2% of GDP. India’s fiscal deficit was 
estimated in nominal terms at ~ H17.55 
Lakh Crore and 6.4% of GDP for the year 
ending March 31, 2023.

India’s headline foreign direct investment 
(FDI) numbers rose from US$74.01 billion 
in 2021 to a record $84.8 billion in 2021-
22, a 14% Y-o-Y increase, till Q3FY23. 
India recorded a robust $36.75 billion 
of FDI. In 2022-23, the government was 
estimated to have addressed 77% of 
its disinvestment target (H50,000 Crore 
against a target of H65,000 Crore).
India’s 
foreign 
exchange 
reserves, 
which had witnessed three consecutive 
years of growth, experienced a decline 
of approximately $70 billion in 2022, 
primarily influenced by rising inflation 
and interest rates. Starting from $606.47 
billion on April 1, 2022, reserves decreased 
to $578.44 billion by March 31, 2023. The 
Indian currency also weakened during 
this period, with the exchange rate 
weakening from H75.91 to a US dollar 
to H82.34 by March 31, 2023, driven by 
a stronger dollar and increasing current 
account deficit. Despite these factors, 
India continued to attract investable 
capital.
Indian economy
Overview
Even as the global conflict remained 
geographically distant from India, ripples 
comprised increased oil import bills, 
inflation, cautious government and a 
sluggish equity market. India’s economic 
growth is at 7.2% in FY 2022-23. India 
emerged as the second fastest-growing 
G20 economy in FY 2022-23. India 
overtook UK to become the fifth-largest 
global economy. India surpassed China 
to become the world’s most populous 
nation (Source: IMF, World Bank)

under review, a rise of 15.8 percent over 
the previous year. India’s GDP per capita 
was 2,320 USD (March 2023), close to the 
magic figure of $2500 when consumption 
spikes across countries. Despite headline 
inflation, private consumption in India 
witnessed continued momentum and 
was estimated to have grown 7.3 percent 
in 2022-23.
Outlook
There are green shoots of economic 
revival, marked by an increase in rural 
growth during the last quarter and 
appreciable decline in consumer price 
index inflation to less than 5 percent in 
April 2023. India is expected to grow 
around 6-6.5 percent (as per various 
sources) in FY2024, catalysed in no small 
measure by the government’s 35% capital 
expenditure growth by the government. 
The growth could also be driven by 
broad-based credit expansion, better 
capacity utilisation and improving trade 
deficit. Headline and core inflation could 
trend down. Private sector investments 
could revive. What provides optimism 
is that even as the global structural 
shifts are creating a wider berth for 
India’s exports, the country is making its 
largest infrastructure investment. This 
unprecedented investment is expected to 
translate into a robust building block that, 
going ahead, moderates logistics costs, 
facilitates a quicker transfer of products 
and empowers the country to become 
increasingly competitive. This can benefit 
India’s exports in general, benefiting 
several sectors. The construction of 
national highways in 2022-23 was 10,993 
kilometres; the Ministry of Road Transport 
and 
Highways 
awarded 
highway 
contracts of 12,375 km in the last financial 
year.

The global landscape favours India: 
Europe is moving towards a probable 
recession, the US economy is slowing, 
China’s GDP growth forecast of 4.4% is 
less than India’s GDP estimate of 6.8% and 
America and Europe are experiencing its 
highest inflation in 40 years.
India’s 
production-linked 
incentive 
appears to catalyse the downstream 
sectors. Inflation is steady. India is at the 
cusp of making significant investments 
in renewable energy and other sectors 
and emerging as a suitable industrial 
supplement to China. India is poised to 
outpace Germany and Japan and emerge 
as the third-largest economy by the end 
of the decade. The outlook for private 
business investment remains positive 
despite an increase in interest rates. India 
is less exposed to Chinese economic 
weakness, with much less direct trade 
with China than many Asian peers.
Broad-based credit growth, improving 
capacity utilisation, government’s thrust 
on capital spending and infrastructure 
should 
bolster 
investment 
activity. 
According to our surveys, manufacturing, 
services and infrastructure sector firms 
are optimistic about the business outlook. 
The downside risks are protracted 
geopolitical tensions, tightening global 
financial conditions, and slowing external 
demand. 
Union budget FY 2023-24 
provisions
The Budget 2023-24 sought to lay the 
foundation for the future of the Indian 
economy by raising capital investment 
outlay by 33% to H10 Lakh Crores, 
equivalent to 3.3% of GDP and almost three 
times the 2019-20 outlay, through various 
projects like PM Gatishakti, Inclusive 
Development, Productivity Enhancement 
& Investment, Sunrise Opportunities, 
Energy Transition and Climate Action, 
as well as Financing of Investments. An 
outlay of H5.94 Lakh Crore was made to 
the Ministry of Defence (13.18% of the 
total Budget outlay). An announcement 
of nearly H20,000 Crores was made for 
the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan 
to catalyse the infrastructure sector. An 
outlay of H1.97 Lakh Crore was announced 
for Production Linked Incentive schemes 
across 13 sectors. The Indian government 
intends to accelerate road construction in 
FY24 by 16-21% to 12,000-12,500 km. The 
overall road construction project pipeline 
remains robust at 55,000 km across 
various execution stages. These realities 
indicate that a structural shift is underway 
that could strengthen India’s positioning 
as a long-term provider of manufactured 
products and its emergence as a credible 
global supplier of goods and services.

Growth drivers
Increasing population
India, with a population of 1,425,775,850 
has recently surpassed China. With a 
median age of 28.2 years, India’s growing 
population underscores the critical need 
to prioritize infrastructure development, 
particularly in terms of roadways and 
transit time. Improving connectivity 
through 
enhanced 
infrastructure 
is 
vital to ensure efficient and seamless 
transportation for its citizens.
Urbanisation
By 2047, 50% of the population is 
projected to reside in urban areas, 
creating a demand for enhanced urban 
infrastructure.
Industrialization
The launch of the PLI scheme will 
fuel industrial growth, leading to an 
increased demand for faster transit times 
and improved road infrastructure. This 
highlights the need for enhanced road 
connectivity throughout the country.
Infrastructure investment
To achieve India’s goal of becoming a $5 
trillion economy by 2025, infrastructure 
development is crucial. The government 
has introduced the National Infrastructure 
Pipeline (NIP) along with initiatives like 
‘Make in India’ and the production-linked 
incentives (PLI) scheme to accelerate the 
growth of the infrastructure sector.
Outlook
Timely asset monetization has become 
crucial to fund the Bharatmala program, 
given the cost escalation in land 
acquisition and input costs. NHAI aims to 
raise approximately H250 billion through 
asset monetization. The authority has 
identified 
potential 
(Build-operate-
tra¬ns¬fer) BOT projects to be awarded 
this year and expects an increase in BOT 
awards following amendments in the BOT 
concession agreement.
The road sector in India is experiencing 
a positive growth trajectory. Factors 
such 
as 
healthy 
traffic 
growth, 
expressway development under Gati 
Shakti, sustainability and multimodal 
connectivity and private capital influx 
contribute to its bright prospects. Private 
investments in the sector are expected 
to reach H1 trillion by 2030. Regulatory 
interventions, 
optimistic 
investor 
sentiment and a focus on improved 
mobility will further accelerate the 
sector’s development.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited (HGIEL) has commenced its 21st year in building a new India through constructing and 
developing infrastructure facilities.
To achieve milestones in sustainable practices, we at HGIEL have adopted the path of responsible business and are committed 
to achieve Environment, and Social Endeavors across our business practices. We have constituted ESG council which includes 
representatives from various functions of the company. As we are on a mission to adapt industry best practices in environmental 
and social exchanges, we are strengthening our system, practices, and procedures for the same.
As part of our agenda for the financial Year 2022-23 we take immense pride to announce that, we had organized various 
activities in the arena of environment and social parameters. Under this we have conducted stakeholder engagements with 
both internal and external stakeholders to understand their expectations. ESG capacity building workshops were organized 
to impart ESG awareness among all the employees, including the top management. We have identified material topics under 
environment, social and governance which are crucial to the business.
A special training on Human rights at workplace was organized to educate employees about their existing human rights, 
probable instances of human rights breach and reporting mechanism.
HGIEL has always promoted best practices in the environmental space by choosing path to sustainability. Adhering to 3R 
philosophy, some of the best practices are pertaining to the reuse of milling materials in the road constructions and usage 
of fly ash, pond ash, and plastics in road constructions. We continually improved upon increasing the usage of fly ash in the 
construction of structures. In the reporting period, our fly-ash utilization was 66,357 tons. We have utilized 49 MT of plastic for 
the construction of service lanes in one of our Road Project. We have replaced soil with inert material for one of our projects in 
embankment construction. We have successfully installed STPs at all labour camps and designed mechanized drainage system 
to collect storm water across our project locations. The recycled water is used in labor camps and also in dust suppression. 
To stand upon the commitment of protecting the environment we have translocated 15,000 tress and have organized tree 
plantation drives across our all-project locations. We have also switched to eco-efficient technology, such as screw conveyor 
which is environment friendly and efficient to prevent air pollution. We also sprinkle water in every project site for suppressing 
the dust particles to reduce air pollution. Moving a step ahead in coming financial years we strive to incorporate more best 
practices by shifting to renewable energy sources, increasing usage of alternate materials in construction and improving the 
GHG (Green House Gases) inventory.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
We view health and safety as an important management task that requires a culture of continual improvement. Our project-
level EHS team supports our operations and employees in integrating health and safety standards into their operational planning, 
business decisions, and daily process activities. Given the nature of our operations, occupational health and safety is always our 
top priority. We have established and implemented an Occupational Health and Safety Management System aligned to the ISO 
45001:2018 standards. Our project site personnel are trained to identify, alleviate, and control risks specific to their operation.

also implemented during the periodic maintenance in the plant. The company has established an EHS committee and periodic 
meeting is being organized with the involvement of worker’s representatives to understand their concerns and possible mitigation 
measures. The company has established a tally board System to monitor the entry and exit in a confined space. All the lifting 
alliances are equipped with the requirements of Automatic Safe Load Indicator (ASLI). Drone has been implemented in our project 
sites to identify the hidden hazards and risks avoid complexities and monitor the larger project areas

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited (“the Company”), 
which includes three jointly controlled operations consolidated 
on a proportionate basis (Refer note 51 to Standalone Financial 
Statements), which comprises the Standalone Balance Sheet 
as at March 31, 2023, the Standalone Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Standalone 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the Standalone Statement 
of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred 
to as the “standalone financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind 
AS”) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the 
Company as at March 31, 2023, its total comprehensive income 
(comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), its 
changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that 
date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone 
financial statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us, 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms 
of their reports referred to in “Other Matters” paragraph below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
1.	
Estimation of contract cost and revenue recognition. 
(Refer to note 1 (F) (i), 2 (d), 29 and 52) of the Standalone 
Financial Statements)
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over a period 
of time in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 115, 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The contract revenue 
amounts to H43,071.01 million for engineering, procurement and 
construction contracts, which usually extends over a period of 2-3 
years, and the contract prices are fixed and, in few cases, subject to 
clauses with price variances and variable consideration.
i.	
Evaluated the accounting policy for revenue recognition and 
assessed compliance of the policy with the principles enunciated 
under Ind AS 115 - ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customer’.
ii.	
Understood and evaluated the design and tested the 
operating effectiveness of key internal financial controls, 
including those related to review and approval of estimated 
costs and review of provision for foreseeable losses, if any, by the 
authorised representatives.
164     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
In accordance with Input method prescribed under Ind AS 115, 
the contract revenue is measured based on the proportion of 
contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to 
the estimated total costs. This method requires the Company to 
perform an initial assessment of total estimated cost and reassess 
the total construction cost at the end of each reporting period to 
determine the appropriate percentage of completion.
The estimation of total cost to complete the contract involves 
significant judgement and estimation throughout the period of 
contract, as it is subject to revision as the contract progresses - 
based on latest available information including physical work 
done on the ground, changes in cost estimates and need to 
accrue provision for onerous contracts, if any. Besides recognition 
of revenues based on actual costs and estimated costs to 
complete the work, at the period end, the measurement and 
recognition of contract assets (unbilled revenue) and contract 
liabilities (unearned revenue) related to each of the contracts is 
also dependent on cost estimates.
In view of above, we have considered the estimation of 
construction contract costs as a key audit matter.
iii.	
We obtained the revenue workings (percentage of 
completion calculations) from the Company’s management, for 
all contracts, containing actual costs incurred, estimated costs 
(comprising of actual costs and remaining costs to completion), 
estimated contract revenue and actual revenues recognised 
during the year based on proportion of actual costs to estimated 
costs. For sample of contracts, we agreed contract revenue with 
key contractual terms, agreed current year’s actual costs with 
system generated reports and agreed estimated costs with 
costs sheets for individual contracts approved by the authorised 
representatives. Reperformed the calculation of revenues during 
the year using proportion of actual costs to estimated costs and 
compared the results with workings provided by the Company.
iv.	
For actual costs incurred during FY 2022-23, we tested the 
samples to appropriate supporting documents.
v.	
To validate the remaining costs to completion, for sample 
contracts, we obtained the approved costs sheets (for each of 
such sample contracts) containing the breakdown of such
costs. 
Evaluated 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
management’s 
judgements and assumptions through comparison of actual 
margins during the year with base margins estimated at the 
beginning, comparison between financial progress (proportion 
of actual costs to estimated costs) and physical progress certified 
by the Independent Engineer, past trends of recovery of price 
escalation with incremental costs incurred and comparison of 
actual costs within similar contracts.
vi.	
Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the 
disclosures made in standalone financial statements in 
compliance with the requirements of Ind AS 115.
2.	
Valuation of accounts receivable and contract assets in 
view of risk of credit losses. (Refer note 1 (K), 39(i), 7 and 
11 – Trade Receivables and Note 16(a) for contract asset 
to Standalone Financial Statements)
	
Accounts receivable and Contract assets are significant 
items in the Company’s standalone financial statements 
aggregating to H14,637.81 million as of March 31, 2023 
and provision for impairment of receivables and contract 
assets amounted to H317.64 millions as at March 31, 2023. 
The Company has a concentration of credit exposure on 
certain customers, which include government and private 
organisations, where there are delays in collections due to 
various reasons.
	
The management periodically assess the adequacy of 
provisions recognised, as applicable, on receivables and 
contract assets, based on factors such as credit risk of 
the customer, status of the project, discussions with the 
customers and underlying contractual terms and conditions. 
This involves significant judgement.
i.	
Understood and evaluated the design and tested the 
operating effectiveness of key internal financial controls in 
relation to determination of expected credit loss.
i.	
Obtained confirmation from parties, for sample balances, 
with respect to outstanding balances. Wherever confirmations 
are not received for the samples, performed alternate procedures 
through verification of Company’s invoices approved by the 
respective customers which represents acknowledgement of 
work delivered.
iii.	
Performed inquiry procedures with senior management of 
the Company regarding status of collectability of the receivable 
and contract assets.
iv.	
In respect of material contract balances, corroborated our 
inquiry procedures with the correspondence between the 
Company and the customers, contracts and other documents.

Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
Given the relative significance of these receivables and contract 
assets to the standalone financial statements and the nature and 
extent of audit procedures involved to assess the recoverability of 
receivables and contract assets, we determined this to be a key 
audit matter.
v.	
Assessed the inputs used by the Management to determine 
the amount of allowances by considering factors such as credit 
risk of the customer, cash collections, past history and status of 
the project, and correspondence with customers.
vi.	
Presented the results of our work done to the audit 
committee.
vii.	 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the 
disclosures made in the standalone financial statements in this 
regard.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Management 
Discussion and Analysis, Director’s Report, Corporate Governance 
Report and Other Information included in the Annual Report but 
does not include the standalone financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements, 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Board of 
Directors for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance and other comprehensive income, changes 
in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS") specified under Section 
133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial 
statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, Management 
and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are 
also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting 
process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements.
We give in “Annexure A” a detailed description of Auditor’s 
responsibilities for Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements.
Other Matters
1.	
We did not audit the financial statements of three jointly 
controlled operations included in the standalone financial 
statements of the Company, whose financial statements 
reflect total assets of H40.26 millions as at March 31, 2023, 
and total revenues of H63.45 millions, total net profit after 
tax of H0.11 million and total comprehensive income of 
H0.11 million for the year ended March 31, 2023, and cash 
inflows (net) of H0.23 million for the year then ended. The 
166     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
financial statements of these jointly controlled operations 
have been audited by other auditors whose reports have 
been furnished to us by the Management, and our opinion 
on the standalone financial statements (including other 
information) in so far relates to the amounts and disclosures 
included in respect of these Jointly controlled operations, is 
based solely on the report of other auditors.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter 
with respect to our reliance on the work done and the 
reports of the other auditors.
2.	
The standalone financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2022, were audited by another firm of 
Chartered Accountants along with the joint auditors i.e. M/s 
Shridhar & Associates, Chartered Accountants, whose report 
dated May 23, 2022 expressed an unmodified opinion on 
those standalone financial statements.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter.

Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report on even date on the 
Standalone Financial Statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we 
are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the company has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by Management and Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s and 
Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the standalone financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore, the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

provisions stated in paragraph 3(i)(e) of the Order are 
not applicable to the Company.
ii.	
(a)	 The Inventory (excluding material in transit) has been 
physically verified during the year by the management. 
In our opinion, the frequency of verification, coverage 
and procedure of such verification is reasonable and

of repayment of principal and payment of interest. In 
respect of loans given to employees which are interest-
free, the schedule for repayment of principal has been 
stipulated and the repayments have been regular.

demand, we have been informed that the repayment 
has been made during the year when demanded by 
the Company and for loans which are repayable at the 
option of subsidiary companies, there is no due date 
specified therein. Therefore, in respect of aforesaid 
loans, there is no amount which is overdue for more 
than 90 days.
	
In respect of loans given to employees, there is no 
amount which is overdue for more than 90 days.
(e)	 According to the information and explanations 
provided to us, in respect of loans which are repayable 
on demand of the Company, the repayments have been 
done when demanded by the Company and therefore, 
these loans have not been renewed or extended. In 
respect of loans which are repayable at the option of 
subsidiary companies, the question of the amount 
falling due during the year does not arise. In respect 
of loans to employees, the repayments which have 
fallen due, during the year, have not been renewed or 
extended.
	
As mentioned in (d) above, there was no overdue 
amount during the year and therefore, the question

by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control with reference to standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were

conduct of its business, including adherence to Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls

with reference to standalone financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A Company's internal financial control with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial 
control with reference to standalone financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures

of the Company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
standalone financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial 
Controls With reference to Standalone financial 
statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matter
Reporting under section 143 (3) (i) of the Act in respect of the 
adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to the 
standalone financial statements is not applicable to three jointly 
controlled operations.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statement

Background
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited ("the Company") is a Public Limited Company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock 
Exchange on March 9, 2018. Its registered office is at 14, Panchwati Colony, Ratanada, Jodhpur – 342001, Rajasthan, India.
The Company is engaged in the business of Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), Maintenance of roads, bridges, flyovers 
and other infrastructure contract works.
These Standalone financial statements were reviewed by the Audit Committee and authorized to be issued by the Board of Directors 
on May 10, 2023.
Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Standalone financial statements. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
A.	 Basis of preparation
	
(i)	
Compliance with Ind AS
	
The Standalone financial statements of the Company comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) read with Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
(ii)	 Historical cost convention
	
	
The Standalone financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:
•	
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value;
•	
Assets held for sale – measured of fair value less cost of sell and
•	
Defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value
	
(iii)	 New and amended standards adopted by the Company
	
	
Onerous Contracts- Cost of Fulfilling a Contract - Amendments to Ind AS 37
	
Ind AS 37 defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs (costs that the Company has committed 
to pursuant to the contract) of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be 
received under it.
	
	
The amendments to Ind AS 37 clarify, that the costs relating directly to the contract consist of both:
•	
The incremental costs of fulfilling that contract- e.g. direct labour and material; and
•	
An allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts: e.g. Allocation of depreciation charge on property, 
plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract.
	
	
The Company, prior to the application of the amendments, had onerous contracts.
	
The effect of adoption of the Ind AS 37 amendments as at 01 April, 2022 did not have any material impact on the Standalone 
financial Statements as the Company has already included above costs in recording Provisions for Onerous Contracts in the 
previous year.
	
	
The below amendments had no impact on the Standalone financial statements of the Company.
a.	
Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds Before Intended Use - Amendment to Ind AS 16
b.	
References to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to Ind AS 103
c.	
Taxation in fair value measurements – Amendments to Ind AS 41
d.	
Ind AS 101: First Time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards - Subsidiary as a first time adopter
e.	
Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments - Fees in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of financial liability

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 
March 31, 2023 to amend certain Ind ASs which are effective from 01 April 2023:
	
	
Below is a summary of such amendments:
i.	
Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendment to Ind AS 1 Presentation of financial statements
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 01 April, 2023. The Company is currently 
revisiting their accounting policy information disclosures to ensure consistency with the amended requirements.
ii.	
Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to Ind AS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting 
estimates and errors.
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 01 April 2023. The amendments are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Standalone financial statements.
iii.	 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to Ind AS 12 
Income taxes
	
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the amendments.
iv.	 The other amendments to Ind AS notified by these rules are primarily in the nature of clarifications.
B.	 Operating Cycle
	
The Company classifies an asset as current when:
-	
it expects to realise the asset or intends to sell or consume it in normal operating cycle
-	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading
-	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period or
-	
the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
The Company classifies a liability as current when:
-	
it expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle
-	
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading
-	
the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
-	
there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms of 
a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect 
its classification.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current. 
	
Operating cycle
Operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash or cash equivalents.
	
Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash 
or cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current, non current 
classification of assets and liabilities.

C.	 Joint control operation
	
The Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly 
held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the Standalone financial statements 
under the appropriate headings. Details of the joint operation are set out in note 51.
D.	 Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker (CODM). The Managing Director of the Company has been identified as CODM and he assesses the financial performance 
and position of the Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer note 41 for segment information.
E.	 Foreign currency translation
	
(i)	
Functional and presentation currency
	
Items included in the Standalone financial statements of the entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency’). The Standalone financial statements are presented in 
Indian rupee, which is Companies functional and presentation currency.
	
(ii)	 Transactions and balances
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in 
Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
F.	
Revenue recognition
	
The Company derives revenue principally from following streams:
•	
Construction contracts
•	
Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
(i)	
Construction contracts
	
The Company recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the period of time, 
as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the customer. EPC contracts are 
generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex integration of goods and services.
	
The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Company recognises revenue using input 
method (i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated 
contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised in the period in which they are determined as 
assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract includes price variation clause or there are amendments in 
contracts, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.
	
Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation of total 
revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Variability in the 
transaction price arises primarily due to liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes in scope, incentives, if any. The 
Company considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount 
of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and determining whether the estimated variable consideration should be 
constrained. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant 
reversal of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration 
is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all 
information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.

Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract. Billing 
terms of the over-time contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The difference between the 
timing of revenue recognised and customer billings result in changes to contract assets and contract liabilities. Payment is 
generally due upon receipt of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less. Contractual retention amounts billed to customers 
are generally due upon expiration of the contract period.
	
The contracts generally result in revenue recognised in excess of billings which are presented as contract assets on the 
statement of financial position. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as receivables on the statement of 
financial position. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered 
a significant financing component since it is usually intended to provide customer with a form of security for Company’s 
remaining performance as specified under the contract, which is consistent with the industry practice. Contract liabilities 
represent amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognised till date. A liability is recognised for advance payments 
and it is not considered as a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital requirements at the 
time of project mobilisation stage. The same is presented as contract liability in the statement of financial position.
	
Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting 
increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in Standalone Statement of profit and loss in the period in 
which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.
	
For construction contracts the control is transferred over time and revenue is recognised based on the extent of progress 
towards completion of the performance obligations. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. The percentage of completion was calculated according 
to the nature and the specific risk of each contract in order to reflect the effective completion of the project. This percentage 
of completion could be based on technical milestones or as per the contractual terms specified. A construction contract is 
considered completed when the last technical milestone is achieved, which occurs upon contractual transfer of ownership of 
the asset.
	
(ii)	 Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
Revenue from providing operating and maintenance services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are 
rendered. Invoices are issued according to contractual terms and are usually payable as per the credit period agreed with the 
customer.
	
(iii)	 Interest income
	
Interest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is disclosed as interest income within other income. 
Interest income on financial assets at amortised cost using the effective interest method is recognised in the Standalone 
Statement of profit and loss as part of other income.
	
Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except 
for financial assets that subsequently become credit- impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is 
applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance).
	
(iv)	 Other income
	
All other income is accounted on accrual basis when no significant uncertainty exist regarding the amount that will be 
received.
G.	 Income tax
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable 
income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences.
	
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the 
reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax 
treatment. The Company measures its tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on 
which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statement 
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Standalone financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates 
(and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses / tax credits only if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and 
when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the 
entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in Standalone Statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
H.	 Leases
As a lessee
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use 
by the Company.
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value 
of the following lease payments:
•	
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable and
•	
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.
Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which 
is generally the case for leases in the Company, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual 
lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Company:
•	
where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect 
changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received
•	
uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by Company, which does 
not have recent third party financing, and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to Standalone Statement of profit 
and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period.
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:
•	
the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
•	
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
•	
any initial direct costs, and
•	
restoration costs.
Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
186     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statement
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis 
as an expense in Standalone Statement of profit and loss. Short- term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-
value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.
I.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that 
suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.
J.	
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held 
at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank 
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the Standalone Balance Sheet.
K.	 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade 
receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing 
components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Company holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the 
contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less loss 
allowance.
L.	 Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value.
Cost of raw material, stores and spare parts and construction materials includes cost of purchases and other cost incurred in 
bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost is determined using rolling weighted average method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to complete the contract.
M.	 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
Financial Assets:
	
Classification
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
•	
those measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss) and
•	
those measured at amortized cost.
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash 
flows.

Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial 
assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair 
value through profit or loss are expensed of in the Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
	
Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial assets are measured at:
•	
fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss)
•	
amortized cost
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised in the Standalone Statement of profit and loss (i.e. fair 
value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), or recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (i.e. fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)).
(i)	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost:
	
Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in financial income using 
effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented 
in other gain/(losses).
(ii)	 Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
	
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows 
represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken 
through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains of losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses 
which are recognised in Standalone Statement of profit and loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). 
Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item 
in Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
	
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss 
on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in Standalone Statement 
of profit and loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these 
financial assets is included in other income.
	
Debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company business model for managing the asset and the cash 
flow characteristics of the asset. Debt instrument are classified as amortised cost instruments.
	
Impairment of Financial Assets
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL) associated with its financial assets carried at 
amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. Note 
39(i) details how the Company determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
For trade receivables (including contract assets), the Company applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109, which 
requires lifetime ECL to be recognised as loss allowances.
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets
188     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statement  
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
A financial asset is derecognized only when:
•	
the Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or
•	
retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the 
cash flows to one or more recipients.
Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. Where the entity has not transferred substantially 
all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognized.
Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
asset, the financial asset is derecognized if the Company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Company retains 
control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognized to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.
	
Financial Liabilities:
	
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are initially measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit 
or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue/origination of the financial liability.
	
Subsequent Measurement
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized 
cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in Standalone 
Statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
	
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference 
between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration 
paid, including any non- cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss as other gains/(losses).
N.	 Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Standalone Balance Sheet where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the 
normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
O.	 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less 
depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it 
is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All 
other repairs and maintenance are charged to Standalone Statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they 
are incurred.
Transition to Ind AS
On transition to Ind AS, the Company had elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and equipment 
measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the written down value (WDV) / Straight Line Method (SLM) over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets, based on technical evaluation done by management’s expert, which are higher than those specified by 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, in order to reflect the actual usage of the assets. The useful life, residual value and the 
depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year end. If the expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes 
are accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
The management estimates useful lives of the tangible fixed assets as follows:

Based on the technical experts assessment of useful life of the aforementioned assets, Plant and machinery i.e Cranes are being 
depreciated over the useful life different from the prescribed useful life under Schedule II the Companies Act, 2013. Management 
believes that such estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to 
be used.
* It includes Low value assets (LVA) having useful life of 1 year. LVA are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in Standalone 
Statement of profit and loss within other gains/ (losses). (Also refer note 2(a)).
P.	
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial 
assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is 
recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment 
loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset is recognised 
at the date of de-recognition.
Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable 
to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the Standalone Balance Sheet.
Q.	 Investment Property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property. Investment 
property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent 
expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 
190     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statement  
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance 
costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised.
Investment properties are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. Investment properties have 
a useful life of 60 years. The useful life has been determined based on technical evaluation performed by the management expert.
R.	 Intangible assets
Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Purchases costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is available for use.
Transition to Ind AS
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of its intangible assets measured as per the 
previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the intangible assets.
Amortisation methods and periods
The Company amortises intangible assets with a finite useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

S.	 Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial year which are 
unpaid. The amounts are unsecured. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 
12 months after the reporting period.
T.	
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in 
Standalone Statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are removed from the Standalone Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled 
or expired.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the reporting period.
U.	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
	
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 
Company, or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.

V.	 Employee benefits
(i)	
Short term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after 
the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognized in respect of employees’ services up to the 
end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the Standalone Balance Sheet.
(ii)	 Other long term employee benefit obligations
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in 
which the employees render the related service. They are therefore measured as the present value of expected future payments 
to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit 
method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to 
the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are recognized in Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the Standalone Balance Sheet if the Company does not have an unconditional 
right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected 
to occur.
(iii)	 Post-employment obligations
The Company operates the following post-employment schemes.
•	
Defined benefit plan i.e. gratuity
•	
Defined contribution plans such as provident fund, superannuation etc.
Gratuity obligations ( Also, Refer note 2(b) )
The liability or asset recognized in the Standalone Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference 
to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the 
related obligation.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair 
value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Standalone Statement of profit and loss .
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in the 
period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of 
changes in equity and in the Standalone Balance Sheet.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognized 
immediately in Standalone Statement of profit and loss as past service cost.
Defined contribution plans
The Company pays contribution to defined contribution schemes such as provident fund etc. The Company has no further 
payment obligation once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and 
the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Bonus plans
The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses. The Company recognises a provision where contractually obliged 
or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

W.	 Contributed equity
Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
X.	 Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the 
entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.
Y.	 Earnings per share
	
(i)	
Basic earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
•	
The profit attributable to owners of the Company; and
•	
By the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in 
equity shares issued during the year
	
(ii)	 Diluted earnings per share
	
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:
•	
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares, and
•	
the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of 
all dilutive potential equity shares.
Z.	 Rounding of amounts
All amounts disclosed in the Standalone financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million as per the 
requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.
Note 2:	 Critical estimates and judgments
	
The preparation of the Standalone financial statements requires use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom 
equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgment in applying the Company’s accounting policies.
	
This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgments or complexity, and of items which 
are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally 
assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with 
information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the Standalone financial statements.
	
The areas involving critical estimates or judgments are:
	
	
(a)	 Estimation of useful life of Property, plant and equipment
	
The Company estimates the useful life of the Property, plant and equipment as mentioned in Note 1(o) above, which is 
based on the expected technical obsolescence of such assets. However, the actual useful life may be shorter or longer 
than the life estimated, depending on technical innovations and competitor actions.
	
	
(b)	 Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment employee benefits and the present value of the 
gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary 
increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. The 
parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in

India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of 
the post-employment benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publicly available Indian Assured Lives Mortality 
(2012-14) Ultimate. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future 
salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the respective countries. Refer note 
44 for key actuarial assumptions.
	
	
(c)	 Estimation of fair value of level 3 financial instruments
	
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. 
The Company uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market 
conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. Refer note 38 on fair value measurements where the assumptions 
and methods to perform the same are stated.

the Company considers information from a variety of sources including:
•	
Current prices in an active market for properties of different nature or recent prices of similar properties in less active 
markets, adjusted to reflect those differences
•	
Discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows
•	
Capitalised income projections based upon a property’s estimated net market income, and a capitalisation rate derived 
from an analysis of market evidence.
	
The Company has obtained independent valuations report of investment properties from the Ravi Vindal, who is a registered 
valuer as defined under rule 2 of Companies (Registered Valuers & Valuation) Rule, 2017. The main inputs used are quantum, 
area, location,demand, rental growth rates, expected vacancy rates, terminal yields and discount rates. All resulting fair value 
estimates for investment properties are included in level 3.

(ii)	 Fair value hierarchy
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are 
measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements.
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes instruments like listed equity 
instruments, traded bonds and mutual funds that have quoted price.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the counter 
derivatives etc) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as 
possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is 
included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This 
is in the case of unlisted securities, investment properties etc.

The carrying amounts of short term loans, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and cash 
equivalents, other receivables, trade payables, current borrowings, interest accrued, capital creditors and other payables are considered 
to be the same as their fair values due to their short-term nature. The impact of fair vaue on Non current trade receivables and payables 
is not expected to have material impact on the standalone financial statements, hence not dislcosed above.	
 
The fair value of security deposits were not calculated based on their future cash flows discounted at current lending rate as these 
security deposits are expected to continue to remain till the existence of the Company.

risk on trade receivables and contract assets considering the customer profile. Customers of the company mainly consists of the 
government promoted entities and some large private corporates. In case of government customers which forms the majority of

The reasons for loss allowances could be recovery of claims, disputes with customer, customers ability to pay, delays in approval by 
government authorities, and expected time to recover the amount. Management makes an assessment considering facts of each 
contract, past trends, terms of the contract and accordingly considers the need for loss allowances, if any.
For Loans : The Company's investments in debt instruments and certain loans are considered to be low risk investments.

(iii)	Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises two types of risks i.e. interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk 
include borrowings and creditors for capital expenditures.
	
(a)	 Foreign currency risk
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in 
foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant and relates 
primarily to the Company’s creditors for capital expenditures. The Company’s foreign currency risks are identified, measured 
and managed at periodic intervals in accordance with the Company’s policies. As at March 31, 2023, Company's foreign 
currency exposure amounts to H47.44 Million ( as at March 31, 2022 H45.03 Million ).

The Change in exchange rates does not affect the components of other equity.
(b)	 Interest risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to risk of changes in market rate is limited to short term working capital loans at 
variable rate taken from banks as the Company’s long term borrowings bear fixed interest rate.
	
The Company’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in 
Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.
	
The Company manages the interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The exposure of 
the Company’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

Profit or loss is sensitive to higher / lower interest expense as a result of changes in interest rates. A 20 basis point increase 
or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s 
assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit 
before tax will be impacted by a change in interest rate as follows:

Note 40 - Capital Management
(a)	 Risk Management
For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Company and borrowings.
The Company aims to manage its capital efficiently so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise 
returns to our shareholders. The capital structure of the Company is based on management’s judgement of the appropriate balance

manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
The Company’s aim is to translate profitable growth to superior cash generation through efficient capital management. The 
Company’s policy is to maintain a stable and strong capital structure with a focus on total equity so as to maintain investor, creditors 
and market confidence and to sustain future development and growth of its business. The Company will take appropriate steps in 
order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, its capital structure.

The Code on Social Security 2020 (‘the Code’) relating to employee benefits, during the employment and post-employment, 
has received Presidential assent on September 28, 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. Further, the 
Ministry of Labour and Employment has released draft rules for the Code on November 13, 2020. However, the effective date 
from which the changes are applicable is yet to be notified and rules for quantifying the financial impact are also not yet issued.

(b)	 Defined Benefit Plans:
	
	
Gratuity
	
The company provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Employees who are in 
continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount of gratuity payable on retirement/termination 
is the employees last drawn basic salary per month computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of 
years of service. Contributions are made to a gratuity based upon actuarial valuation done at the year end of every financial 
year using “Projected Unit Credit” method. The charge on account of provision for gratuity has been included in Employee 
Benefits Expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss except remeasurements i.e. actuarial gains and losses and the return on 
plan assets, excluding amounts included in other comprehensive income.

Sensitivity Analysis
	
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to increase and decrease in the weighted principal assumptions by 0.50% is as 
below:

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The methods and types of 
assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.
(iii)	 The major categories of plans assets are as follows:
	
The plan asset for the funded gratuity plan is administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India (‘LIC’) as per the investment 
pattern stipulated for Pension and Group Schemes fund by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority regulations i.e. 100% 
of plan assets are invested in insurer managed fund. Quoted price of the same is not available in active market.
(iv)	 Risk Exposure
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Demographic Risk : This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, 
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and 
depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals 
because in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to a 
long service employee.
Asset volatility : The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields; if plan assets underperform 
this yield, this will create a deficit. 100% of the plan asset investments is in insurer managed funds. These are subject to interest rate 
risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level.
Salary Inflation Risk : Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.
Interest-Rate Risk : The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, 
the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
(v)	 Defined Benefit Liability and Employer Contributions
The Company considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the 
agreed period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited, in which are 
incorporated three jointly controlled operations (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”), its subsidiaries (Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) 
and its associates (Refer Note 51 to consolidated financial 
statements), which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as 
at March 31, 2023, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, and based on consideration of 
reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and 
on the other financial information of subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled operations, the aforesaid consolidated financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (“Ind AS”) and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of their 
consolidated state of affairs of the Group and its associates 
as at March 31, 2023, its consolidated total comprehensive 
income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), 
consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated cash flows 
for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated 
financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group and its associates in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by 
Institute of Chartered Accountant of India (“ICAI”), and the 
relevant provisions of the Act and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and on 
consideration of audit reports of other auditors referred to in 
paragraph (a) and (b) of the “Other Matters” section below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
1.	
Estimation of contract cost and revenue recognition. 
(Refer to note 1 (F) (i), 2 (d), 29 and 52) of the consolidated 
financial statements)
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over a period 
of time in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 115, 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The contract revenue 
amounts to H43,071.01 million for engineering, procurement and 
construction contracts, which usually extends over a period of 2-3 
years, and the contract prices are fixed and, in few cases, subject to 
clauses with price variances and variable consideration.
i.	
Evaluated the accounting policy for revenue recognition 
and assessed compliance of the policy with the principles 
enunciated under Ind AS 115 – ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customer’.
ii.	
Understood and evaluated the design and tested the 
operating effectiveness of key internal financial controls, 
including those related to review and approval of estimated 
costs and review of provision for foreseeable losses, if any, by 
the  uthorized representatives.
248     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
In accordance with Input method prescribed under Ind AS 115, 
the contract revenue is measured based on the proportion of 
contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the 
estimated total costs. This method requires the Holding Company 
to perform an initial assessment of total estimated cost and 
reassess the total construction cost at the end of each reporting 
period to determine the appropriate percentage of completion.
The estimation of total cost to complete the contract involves 
significant judgement and estimation throughout the period of 
contract, as it is subject to revision as the contract progresses – 
based on latest available information including physical work 
done on the ground, changes in cost estimates and need to 
accrue provision for onerous contracts, if any. Besides recognition 
of revenues based on actual costs and estimated costs to 
complete the work, at the period end, the measurement and 
recognition of contract assets (unbilled revenue) and contract 
liabilities (unearned revenue) related to each of the contracts is 
also dependent on cost estimates.
In view of above, we have considered the estimation of 
construction contract costs as a key audit matter.
iii.	
We obtained the revenue workings (percentage of 
completion calculations) from the Company’s management, 
for all contracts, containing costs incurred upto March 
31, 2023, estimated costs (comprising of actual costs and 
remaining costs to completion), estimated contract revenue 
and actual revenues authorized during the year based on 
proportion of actual costs to estimated costs. For sample of 
contracts, we agreed contract revenue with key contractual 
terms, agreed current year’s actual costs with system 
generated reports and agreed estimated costs with cost 
sheets for individual contracts approved by the authorized 
representatives. Reperformed the calculation of revenues 
during the year using proportion of actual costs to estimated 
costs and compared the results with workings provided by 
the Holding Company.
iv.	
For actual costs incurred during FY 2022-23, we tested the 
samples to appropriate supporting documents.
v.	
To validate the remaining costs to completion, for sample 
contracts, we obtained the approved costs sheets (for each 
of such sample contracts) containing the breakdown of 
such costs. Evaluated the reasonableness of management’s 
judgements and assumptions through comparison of actual 
margins during the year with base margins estimated at 
the beginning, comparison between financial progress 
(proportion of actual costs to estimated costs) and physical 
progress certified by the Independent Engineer, past trends 
of recovery of price escalation with incremental costs 
incurred and comparison of actual costs within similar 
contracts.
vi.	
Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the 
disclosures made in consolidated financial statements in 
compliance with the requirements of Ind AS 115.
2.	
Valuation of accounts receivable and contract assets in 
view of risk of credit losses. (Refer note 1 (K), 39(i), 7, 11 and 
15 – Trade Receivables and Note 16(a) for contract asset to 
consolidated financial statements)
Accounts receivable and Contract assets are significant items 
in the Group’s consolidated financial statements aggregating 
to H14,637.81 million as of March 31, 2023 and provision for 
impairment of receivables and contract assets amounted to 
H317.64 million millions as at March 31, 2023. The Group has a 
concentration of credit exposure on certain customers, which 
include government and private organisations, where there are 
delays in collections due to various reasons. 
The management periodically assess the adequacy of provisions 
recognised, as applicable, on receivables and contract assets, based 
on factors such as credit risk of the customer, status of the project, 
discussions with the customers and underlying contractual terms 
and conditions. This involves significant judgement.
i.	
Understood and evaluated the design and tested the 
operating effectiveness of key internal financial controls in 
relation to determination of expected credit loss.
ii.	
Obtained confirmation from parties, for sample balances, 
with 
respect 
to 
outstanding 
balances. 
Wherever 
confirmations are not received for the samples, performed 
alternate procedures through verification of Holding 
Company’s invoices approved by the respective customers 
which represents acknowledgement of work delivered.
iii.	
Performed inquiry procedures with senior management of 
the Holding Company regarding status of collectability of 
the receivable and contract assets.
iv.	
In respect of material contract balances, corroborated our 
inquiry procedures with the correspondence between the 
Holding Company and the customers, contracts and other 
documents.

Report and Other Information included in the Annual Report but 
does not include the consolidated financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed 
and the reports of other auditors referred to in Paragraph (a) and 
(b) of Other Matters section below, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these 
consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements 
of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position, consolidated financial performance and 
other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity 
and consolidated cash flows of the Group and its Associates in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under 
section 133 of the Act. The respective management and board 
of directors of the companies included in the Group and of 
its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding the assets of such companies respectively and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate

or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and of its associates are responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of each such company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
250     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of 
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such 
controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by Management and Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s and 
Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of 
the Group and its associates to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group and its associates to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group and its associates to express an opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit 
of the financial statements of such entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors. For the other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements, which have been audited 
by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits 
carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Holding Company regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Opinion

statements criteria established by the respective companies 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“the ICAI”).
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal control 
with reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the respective companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and 
the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of 
the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their 
reports referred to in the Other Matter paragraph below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company's internal financial control with reference to financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a 
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
With 
Reference 
to 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Background
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited ("Parent Company or the Company") is a public limited Company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange 
and National Stock Exchange on March 9, 2018. Its registered office is at 14, Panchwati Colony, Ratanada, Jodhpur – 342001, Rajasthan, 
India. The Company (including 3 jointly controlled operations consolidated on proportionate basis) and 10 subsidiaries together referred 
to as “the Group”.
The Group is engaged in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), maintenance of roads, bridges, flyovers, railway networks and 
other infrastructure contract works. The Group is also engaged in projects under Hybrid Annuity Model through Subsidiary Companies. 
These consolidated financial statements were reviewed by Audit Committee and authorized to be issued by the Board of Directors on 
May 10, 2023. Also, the Company secures controls by submitting bids in response to tenders in terms of which it is required to form 
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Companies (subsidiary companies) to execute the awarded projects. As at March 31, 2023 the company 
has 10 SPV’s.
Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
A.	 Basis of preparation
	
(i)	
Compliance with Ind AS
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) read with Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
(ii)	 Historical cost convention
	
	
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:
•	
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value;
•	
Assets held for sale – measured at fair value less cost to sell and
•	
Defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value
	
(iii)	 New and amended standards adopted by the Group
	
	
Onerous Contracts- Cost of Fulfilling a Contract - Amendments to Ind AS 37
	
Ind AS 37 defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs (costs that the Group has committed 
to pursuant to the contract) of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be 
received under it. 
	
	
The amendments to Ind AS 37 clarify, that the costs relating directly to the contract consist of both:
•	
The incremental costs of fulfilling that contract- e.g. direct labour and material; and
•	
An allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contract: e.g. Allocation of depreciation charge on property, 
plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract. 
	
	
The Group, prior to the application of the amendments, had onerous contract.
	
The effect of adoption of the Ind AS 37 amendments as at 01 April, 2022 did not have any material impact on the consolidated 
financial Statements as the Group has already included above costs in recording provisions for Onerous Contracts in the 
previous year.
	
	
The below amendments had no impact on the Consolidated financial statements of the Group.
a.	
Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds Before Intended Use - Amendment to Ind AS 16

Amendments to Ind AS 12 Income taxes
	
	
	
The management of Holding Company is in the process of currently assessing the impact of the above amendments.
iv.	 The other amendments to Ind AS notified by these rules are primarily in the nature of clarifications.
B.	 Operating Cycle
	
The Group classifies an asset as current when:
-	
it expects to realise the asset or intends to sell or consume it in normal operating cycle
-	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading
-	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period or
-	
the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least

a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect 
its classification.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Operating cycle
	
Operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash or cash equivalents.
Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash or cash 
equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current, non current classification 
of assets and liabilities.
C.	 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting
	
(i)	
Subsidiaries
	
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.
	
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date when control ceases.
	
The Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets, 
liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between 
group Companies are eliminated ( Refer Note 55 ). Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Details of the Subsidiaries are set out in Note 51.
	
(ii)	 Jointly controlled operation
	
The Holding Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its 
share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the standalone 
financial statements of Holding Company under the appropriate headings. Details of the jointly controlled operations are set 
out in Note 51.
	
(iii)	 Accounting under Equity method for Associates Entities
	
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise 
the group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the group’s share of other 
comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates are 
recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
	
When the group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any 
other unsecured long-term receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the other entity.
	
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associate are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in 
these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the group.
	
The carrying amount of equity accounted investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in 
note 1 (M)(iii) below.

as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
D.	 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker 
(CODM). The Managing Director of the Holding Company has been identified as CODM and he assesses the financial performance 
and position of the Holding Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer Note 41 for segment information presented.
E.	 Foreign currency translation
	
(i)	
Functional and presentation currency
	
Items included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Indian rupee, which is Holding Company’s functional and presentation currency.
	
(ii)	 Transactions and balances
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in 
Consolidated Statement profit or loss.
F.	
Revenue recognition
The Group derives revenue principally from following streams:
•	
Construction contracts
•	
Service concession arrangement
•	
Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
(i)	
Construction contracts
	
The Group recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the period of time, 
as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the customer. EPC contracts are 
generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex integration of goods and services.
	
The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Group recognises revenue using input method 
(i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated 
contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised in the period in which they are determined as 
assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract includes price variation clause or there are amendments in 
contracts, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.
	
Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation of total 
revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Variability in the 
transaction price arises primarily due to liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes in scope, incentives, if any. The 
Group considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount 
of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and determining whether the estimated variable consideration should 
be constrained. The Group includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant 
reversal of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration 
is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all 
information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.
	
Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract. Billing 
terms of the over-time contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The difference between the 
timing of revenue recognised and customer billings result in changes to contract assets and contract liabilities. Payment is 
generally due upon receipt of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less. Contractual retention amounts billed to customers 
are generally due upon expiration of the contract period.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statement 
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
	
The contracts generally result in revenue recognised in excess of billings which are presented as contract assets on the 
statement of financial position. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as receivables on the statement of 
financial position. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a 
significant financing component since it is usually intended to provide customer with a form of security for Group’s remaining 
performance as specified under the contract, which is consistent with the industry practice. Contract liabilities represent 
amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognised till date. A liability is recognised for advance payments and it is 
not considered as a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital requirements at the time of 
project mobilisation stage. The same is presented as contract liability in the statement of financial position.
	
Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting 
increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period in 
which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.
	
For construction contracts the control is transferred over time and revenue is recognised based on the extent of progress 
towards completion of the performance obligations. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. The percentage of completion was calculated according 
to the nature and the specific risk of each contract in order to reflect the effective completion of the project. This percentage 
of completion could be based on technical milestones or as per the contractual terms specified. A construction contract is 
considered completed when the last technical milestone is achieved, which occurs upon contractual transfer of ownership of 
the asset.
	
(ii)	 Service concession arrangement
	
Construction revenue from Hybrid Annuity Contracts
	
The Group constructs the infrastructure (road) used to provide a public service and operates and maintains that infrastructure 
for a specified period of time. Under Appendix D to Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, this arrangement is 
accounted for based on the nature of the consideration. Financial asset is recorded when the Company has an unconditional 
right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor for the construction services.
	
Design - Build - Operate - Transfer (DBOT) contracts on hybrid annuity basis contain three streams of revenue – Construction 
revenue, Finance income and Operations and maintenance (O&M) income.
	
The construction stream of DBOT revenues are accounted for in the construction phase of DBOT, O&M income is recognised 
in the operating phase of the DBOT, while finance income is recognised over the concession period based on the imputed 
interest method.
	
Service concession arrangement
	
Revenue related to construction services provided under the service concession arrangement is recognised based on stage 
of completion of the work performed. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to input method i.e. cost incurred till 
date in proportion to total estimated cost to complete the work.
	
Contract Balances - Contract Assets
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If respective 
entities in the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or 
before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.
	
Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables. Unbilled receivables, 
which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable 
when they are billed under the terms of the contract.
	
Contract Balances - Contract Liabilities
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which respective entities in the Group has 
received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the 
266     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statement
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
such entities transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made, or the 
payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when such entities performs under the 
contract. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date and other advances 
received from customers.
	
Variable consideration
	
The nature of the company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, unpriced change 
orders, award and incentive fees, change in law, liquidated damages and penalties. The company recognizes revenue for 
variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not 
occur. The company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value 
(i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict 
the amount.
	
The respective entities in Group  claim for extra work, incentives and escalation in rates relating to execution of contracts are 
recognized as revenue in the year in which said claims are finally accepted by the clients. Claims under arbitration/ disputes 
are accounted as income based on final award. Expenses on arbitration are accounted as incurred.
	
Before including any amount of variable consideration in the transaction price, the respective entities  considers whether the 
amount of variable consideration is constrained. The Company determined that the estimates of variable consideration are 
not constrained based on its historical experience, business forecast and the current economic conditions. In addition, the 
uncertainty on the variable consideration will be resolved within a short time frame.
	
Revenues are shown net of Goods & Service Tax, applicable discounts and allowances.
	
(iii)	 Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
Revenue from providing operating and maintenance services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are 
rendered. Invoices are issued according to contractual terms and are usually payable as per the credit period agreed with the 
customer.
	
(iv)	 Interest income
	
Interest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is disclosed as interest income with in other income. 
Interest income on financial assets at amortised cost using the effective interest method is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of profit and loss as part of other income.
	
Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except 
for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is 
applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance).
	
(v)	 Other income
	
All other income is accounted on accrual basis when no significant uncertainty exist regarding the amount that will be 
received.
G.	 Income tax
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable 
income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences.
	
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the 
reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain 
tax treatment. The Group measures its tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on 
which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statement  
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses / tax credits only if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and 
when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the 
entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
H.	 Leases
	
As a lessee
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use 
by the Group.
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value 
of the following lease payments:
•	
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable and
•	
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.
Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is 
generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee 
would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic 
environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:
•	
where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect 
changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received.
•	
uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by Group, which does 
not have recent third party financing, and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to Consolidated Statement of profit 
or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period.
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:
•	
the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
•	
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
•	
any initial direct costs, and
•	
restoration costs.
Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis 
as an expense in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. 
Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statement  
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
I.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that 
suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.
J.	
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held 
at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank 
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet.
K.	 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade 
receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing 
components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the 
contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less loss 
allowance.
L.	 Inventories
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value.
Cost of raw material, stores and spare parts and construction materials includes cost of purchases and other cost incurred in 
bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost is determined using rolling weighted average method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to complete the contract.
M.	 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
Financial Assets:
	
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
•	
those measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss) and
•	
those measured at amortized cost.
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash 
flows.
	
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognized when the Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through Consolidated Statement 
of Profit or Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets 
carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed of in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial assets are measured at:
•	
fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss)
•	
amortized cost
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit and loss (i.e. 
fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)).
	
(i)	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost:
	
Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using 
effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in Consolidated Statement of 
profit or loss and presented in other gain/(losses).
	
(ii)	 Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
	
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows 
represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken 
through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains of losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses 
which are recognised in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). 
Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item 
in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss.
	
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
	
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or 
loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in Consolidated 
Statement of profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises. Interest income from 
these financial assets is included in other income.
	
Debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group business model for managing the asset and the cash flow 
characteristics of the asset. Debt instrument are classified as amortised cost instruments.
	
Impairment of Financial Assets
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL) associated with its financial assets carried at 
amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. 
Note 39(i) details how the Group determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
For trade receivables (including contract assets), the Group applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109, which requires 
lifetime ECL to be recognised as loss allowances.
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets
A financial asset is derecognized only when:
•	
the Group has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or
•	
retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the 
cash flows to one or more recipients.
Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. Where the entity has not transferred substantially 
all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognized.
Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
270     H.G. Infra Engineering Limited 
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statement  
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
asset, the financial asset is derecognized if the entity has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the entity retains control 
of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognized to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.
	
Financial Liabilities:
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are initially measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit 
or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue/origination of the financial liability.
	
Subsequent Measurement
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in Consolidated 
Statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss.
	
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference 
between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration 
paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss as other gains/(losses).
N.	 Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the 
normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.
O.	 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less 
depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs 
and maintenance are charged to Consolidated Statement of profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the written down value (WDV) / Straight Line Method (SLM) over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets, based on technical evaluation done by management’s expert, which are higher than those specified by 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, in order to reflect the actual usage of the assets. The useful life, residual value and the 
depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year end. If the expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes 
are accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
The management of Holding Company estimates useful lives of the tangible fixed assets as follows:

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statement  
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
Based on the technical experts assessment of useful life of the aforementioned assets, Plant and machinery i.e Cranes are being 
depreciated over the useful life different from the prescribed useful life under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Management 
believes that such estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to 
be used.
* It includes Low value assets (LVA) having useful life of 1 year. LVA are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in Consolidated 
Statement of profit or loss within other gains/ (losses). (Also refer note 2(a)).
P.	
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial 
assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is 
recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment 
loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset is recognised 
at the date of de-recognition.
Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable 
to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Q.	 Investment Property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property. Investment 
property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent 
expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance 
costs are expensed as incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised.
Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Investment properties have 
a useful life of 60 years. The useful life has been determined based on technical evaluation performed by the management expert.
R.	 Intangible assets
Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Purchases costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is available for use.
Amortisation methods and periods
The Group amortises intangible assets with a finite useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:

S.	 Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year which are 
unpaid. The amounts are unsecured. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 
12 months from the end of reporting period.
T.	
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in 
Consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are removed from the Consolidated balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, 
cancelled or expired.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months from the end of reporting period.
U.	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
	
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the Group, or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
V.	 Employee benefits
	
(i)	
Short term obligations
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognized in respect of employees’ services 
up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the Consolidated balance sheet.
	
(ii)	 Other long term employee benefit obligations
	
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the 
period in which the employees render the related service. They are therefore measured as the present value of expected future 
payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected 
unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognized in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
	
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet if the group does not have an 
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual 
settlement is expected to occur.

(iii)	 Post-employment obligations
	
The group operates the following post-employment schemes.
•	
Defined benefit plan i.e. gratuity
•	
Defined contribution plans such as provident fund, superannuation etc.
	
Gratuity obligations ( Also, Refer Note 2 (b) )
	
The liability or asset recognized in the Consolidated balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated annually by Actuary using the projected unit credit method.
	
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the 
terms of the related obligation.
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the 
fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit and loss.
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized 
in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the 
statement of changes in equity and in the Consolidated balance sheet.
	
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognized 
immediately in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss as past service cost.
	
Defined contribution plans
	
The Group pays contribution to defined contribution schemes such as provident fund etc. The group has no further payment 
obligation once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and the 
contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.
	
Bonus plans
	
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonus. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or 
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
W.	 Contributed equity
Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
X.	 Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the 
entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.
Y.	 Earnings per share
	
(i)	
Basic earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
•	
The profit attributable to owners of the Group; and
•	
By the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in 
equity shares issued during the year

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statement 
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
(All amounts are in H millions, unless otherwise stated)
	
(ii)	 Diluted earnings per share
	
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:
•	
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares, and
•	
the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of 
all dilutive potential equity shares.
Z.	 Rounding of amounts
All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million as per the 
requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.
Note 2: Critical estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom 
equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.
This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgements or complexity, and of items which are 
more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally assessed. 
Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with information about 
the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the consolidated financial statements.
The areas involving critical estimates or judgements are:
	
(a)	 Estimation of useful life of Property, plant and equipment
	
The Group estimates the useful life of the Property, plant and equipment as mentioned in Note 1(o) above, which is based 
on the expected technical obsolescence of such assets. However, the actual useful life may be shorter or longer than the life 
estimated, depending on technical innovations and competitor actions.
	
(b)	 Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment employee benefits and the present value of the 
gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary 
increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. The 
parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in 
India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the 
post-employment benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publicly available Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2012-14) 
Ultimate. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases 
and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the respective countries. Refer Note 44 for key actuarial 
assumptions.
	
(c)	 Estimation of fair value of level 3 financial instruments
	
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. The 
Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions 
existing at the end of each reporting period. Refer note 38 on fair value measurements where the assumptions and methods 
to perform the same are stated.
	
(d)	 Revenue recognition for construction contract - Refer note 1(f) and note 52
	
(e)	 Impairment of trade receivables ( including Contract Assets ) – 	Refer note 1(k) and 7,11, 16(a) and 39(i)

(ii)	 Fair value hierarchy
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are measured 
at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements.
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes instruments like listed equity 
instruments, traded bonds and mutual funds that have quoted price.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the counter 
derivatives etc) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible 
on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in 
level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is in 
the case of unlisted securities, investment properties etc.

approximate to the carrying value. 
The fair value of security deposits were not calculated based on their future cash flows discounted at current lending rate as these 
security deposits are expected to continue to remain till the existence of the Group.

government customers which forms the majority of the revenue, credit risk is low. For private corporate customers, the Group deals 
with established players with strong track record of project execution including few of such customers award sub contracts to the 
Group pursuant to execution construction contracts awarded to them by the Government customers.

The reasons for loss allowances could be recovery of claims, disputes with customer, customers ability to pay, delays in approval by 
government authorities, and expected time to recover the amount. Management makes an assessment considering facts of each 
contract, past trends, terms of the contract and accordingly considers the need for loss allowances, if any.
For Loans : The Group’s investments in debt instruments and certain loans are considered to be low risk investments.

The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due for less than 1 year, equal their 
carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
* Guarantee issued by the Holding Company to the bankers on behalf of subsidiary companies with respect to limits availed by 
them. These amounts will be payable in case of default by the subsidiary Companies. As of the reporting date, the subsidiary 
Companies has not defaulted and hence, the Holding Company does not have any present obligation to third parties in relation 
to such guarantee.
(iii)	Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises two types of risks i.e. interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk 
include borrowings and creditors for capital expenditures.
	
(a)	 Foreign currency risk
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in 
foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant and relates 
primarily to the Group’s creditors for capital expenditures. The Group’s foreign currency risks are identified, measured and 
managed at periodic intervals in accordance with the Group’s policies. As at March 31, 2023, Group’s foreign currency exposure 
amounts to H47.44 Million (as at March 31, 2022 H45.03 Million).

The Change in exchange rates does not affect the components of other equity.
(b)	 Interest risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to risk of changes in market rate is limited to short term working capital loans at variable 
rate taken from banks as the Group’s long term borrowings bear fixed interest rate.
	
The Group’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in Ind 
AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.
	
The Group manages the interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The exposure of the 
Group’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

Sensitivity
	
Profit or loss is sensitive to higher / lower interest expense as a result of changes in interest rates. A 20 basis point increase 
or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s 
assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit before 
tax will be impacted by a change in interest rate as follows:

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves attributable 
to the equity holders of the Group and borrowings.
The Group aims to manage its capital efficiently so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns 
to our shareholders. The capital structure of the Group is based on management’s judgement of the appropriate balance of key 
elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage 
the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
The Group’s aim is to translate profitable growth to superior cash generation through efficient capital management. The Group’s 
policy is to maintain a stable and strong capital structure with a focus on total equity so as to maintain investor, creditors and 
market confidence and to sustain future development and growth of its business. The Group will take appropriate steps in order to 
maintain, or if necessary adjust, its capital structure.

Sensitivity Analysis
	
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to increase and decrease in the weighted principal assumptions by 0.50% is as 
below:
Particulars
Year ended March 31, 2023
Year ended  March 31, 2022

 1.64 
Impact of Decrease in 50 BPS on DBO
 3.14 
 (2.68)
 1.83 
 (1.60)
	
The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The methods and types of 
assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.	
(iii)	 The major categories of plans assets are as follows:
	
The plan asset for the funded gratuity plan is administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India (‘LIC’) as per the investment 
pattern stipulated for Pension and Group Schemes fund by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority regulations i.e. 100% 
of plan assets are invested in insurer managed fund. Quoted price of the same is not available in active market.
(iv)	 Risk Exposure
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Demographic Risk : This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, 
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and 
depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals 
because in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to a 
long service employee.
Asset volatility : The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields; if plan assets underperform 
this yield, this will create a deficit. 100% of the plan asset investments is in insurer managed funds. These are subject to interest rate 
risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level.
Salary Inflation Risk : Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.
Interest-Rate Risk : The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, 
the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
(v)	 Defined Benefit Liability and Employer Contributions
The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed 
period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending March 31, 2023 are H134.80 Million   (Year ending 
March 31, 2022 H10 Million ).
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 6.16 years (March 31, 2022: 3.66 years). The expected maturity 
analysis of undiscounted gratuity is as follows:

The Group has evaluated the impact of the Supreme Court (SC) judgement dated February 28, 2019 in case of “Vivekananda Vidyamandir 
And Others Vs The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (II) West Bengal” and the related circular (Circular No. C-I/1(33)2019/
Vivekananda Vidya Mandir/284) dated March 20, 2019 issued by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation in relation to non-exclusion 
of certain allowances from the definition of “basic wages” of the relevant employees for the purposes of determining contribution to 
provident fund under the Employees’ Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. In the assessment of the management 
which is supported by legal advice, the Group believes that the aforesaid judgement does not have material impact on the Group. The 
Group will continue to monitor and evaluate its position based on future events and developments.

consolidated financial statements	 	
Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) contracts on hybrid annuity method are governed by Service Concession 
Agreements with government authorities (grantor). Under these agreements, the operator does not own the road, but gets the “right 
to receive annuity” against the construction services rendered. Since the construction revenue earned by the operator is considered as 
exchanged with the grantor against the right to receive annuity, revenue is recognised at fair value of construction services rendered 
and profit from such contracts is considered as realised.

As at March 31, 2023, the 10 subsidiary companies in the Group (the ""SPVs"") have assessed their collection plan (which is contractually 
recoverable from the respective customers In next 12 months for the work already done upto the reporting date and recognised as 
revenues in the books) and accordingly, classified the financial asset, related to ""Receivables under service concession agreement with 
National Highway Authorities of India"", between current and non-current assets. Whereas as at March 31, 2022, the SPVs classified 
their financial asset based on anticipated collections in next 12 months (pertaining to work already done upto March 31, 2022 as well 
as expected work to be delivered in next 12 months) resulting into misclassification between current financial assets and non-current 
financial assets as at March 31, 2022. Due to this, the SPVs have restated the current financial assets and non-current financial assets 
considering the expected collections in next 12 months from March 31, 2022 pertaining to the work done and corresponding revenues 
recognised by then only. 
Furthermore, while there is no impact of the said reclassification on the Consolidated Statement of Profit and loss for the year ended 
March 31, 2022 and Total Equity of the Group as at March 31, 2022 and April 1, 2021 respectively, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at
