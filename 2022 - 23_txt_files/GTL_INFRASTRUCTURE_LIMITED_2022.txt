DIRECTORS’ REPORT
	
	
Note III: Shut down / exit of 14 telecom customers resulted into abandonment of more than 14,000 towers of the Company by such discontinued 
telecom customers, making such towers unoccupied. Such discontinuing telecom customers did not make any payment of their contractual dues to 
the Company, including rent payable to landlords, which are pass through payments for the Company. The Company has requested Edelweiss Asset 
Reconstruction Company Limited (“EARC”) being Monitoring Institution, for making payments due to the landlords of the unoccupied sites, however, 
the same is yet to be approved. Further, resolution plans were submitted by the Company included payment of rent to landowners. However, none of 
the resolution proposals were considered by the lenders. Due to non-receipt of the rental amounts from the discontinuing operators as per contractual 
arrangement, pending approval of payment requests of the Company with the Monitoring Institution and non-resolution of issue of unpaid liabilities 
towards unoccupied towers, the rentals to landlords for those unoccupied sites remained unpaid. As a result, such landlords initiated legal actions 
against the Company and its directors / officials. The no. of legal notices received by the Company from various landlords are 1,546 nos. in FY 2021-
2022 and 1,109 nos. in FY 2022-2023 respectively. The Company has responded to majority of such legal notices and as on March 31, 2023, 342 
number of matters have been filed by various landlords before various judicial authorities and Company is defending the same.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
The Company’s business has a dependence on availability of electricity on 24x7 basis. To achieve this, back up power is provided 
from Battery Banks and Diesel generators at sites for the telecom networks to remain live in the event of electricity grid failure, 
force majeure events etc.
As a part of our endeavour for cleaner environment, the Company has been consistently working towards reducing its energy 
dependence on Diesel. Several measures have been adopted like installation of free cooling devices, battery augmentation, 
electrification of sites, working with electricity providers to improve the electricity availability etc.
Waste management is also done in a responsible manner.

Green Sites - We are continuously working towards converting our regular diesel filling sites into Green Sites where diesel consumption 
is less than 100 litres per quarter. As of FY-2021-22 there were 2,313 green sites which increased to 2,547 sites in FY-2022-23.
	
(on case-to-case basis in events of prolonged EB cut or in force majeure events a small quantity of diesel may be used to power on Telecom Networks)
	
Natural Cooling - installed FCU (Free Cooling Units) at our sites to overcome the dependability on Air-conditioners run 
where ambient temperature compliments the working of equipments.
	
Advance battery bank solutions - We have introduced VRLA Based HTC (High Temperature Cyclic) batteries, to optimise 
energy consumption.
	
We have taken initiative to optimise the power plant performance at site by installing the single power plant instead of 
multiple power plant Telecom Operator-wise, thus reducing the unnecessary DG run hours and utilizes the maximum battery 
backup, thus reducing the diesel consumption. 
	
High Electricity Availability: We undertake phase conversion and feeder conversion projects which benefit us to have higher 
EB availability, especially in Urban and Rural areas. This results in reduction of Diesel Generator run hours.
