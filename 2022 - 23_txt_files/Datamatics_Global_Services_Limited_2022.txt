GHG emissions 
and carbon 
emissions
Risk
In the IT and BPM sector, data centers 
and electronic devices are used. The 
operation of this equipment is an 
energy-intensive activity and generates 
si g n i f i ca n t  d i re c t  a n d  i n d i re c t 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
including carbon dioxide and methane 
from fuel use. Uncontrolled pollutants, 
emissions and associated activities 
impose legal and environmental risks for 
the company.
Leveraging cloud and 
other Green IT techno-
logies, implementing 
energy efficient lights 
helps us to reduce our
carbon footprint.

2
Energy 
management
Risk
Energy management can be a 
potential risk for various companies. 
In the context of an IT company, 
energy management risk can be 
significant due to the high energy 
consumption of data centres and 
other IT infrastructure. Similarly, IT 
companies may be vulnerable to 
disruptions in the energy supply 
chain, such as power outages or fuel 
shortages, which can impact the 
availability and reliability of their IT 
systems. Also many countries and 
regions have environmental 
regulations that impose restrictions 
on energy consumption and carbon 
emissions. Failure to comply with 
these regulations can result in fines 
and other penalties.
Our strategies include 
using green techno-
logies such as cloud, to 
f u r t h e r  re d u ce  o u r 
environment footprint 
and impact along with 
usage and promotion of 
third-party renewable 
energy sources.
Negative
3
Human Rights
Risk
Companies focusing on respecting 
human rights demonstrate their 
commitment to building sustainable and 
mutually beneficial relationships with 
those who are influenced or impacted by 
their operations, such as customers, 
communities, workers, and investors. This 
includes demonstrating that they care 
about the people whose lives they 
engage with.
Develop clear policies 
and guidelines that 
governs the human 
rights.
Establishment of confi-
dential reporting chan-
nel for the employees to 
report human rights 
concerns.
Negative 
4
Employee 
Engagement, 
Diversity & 
Inclusion 
Opportunity
A company's high diversity and inclusion 
rate reflects employees' sense of 
belonging and fairness within the 
Company. Improving diversity and 
inclusion helps companies to support 
vulnerable groups resulting in community 
brand image creation for the company. 
Our strategies include 
implementing policies to 
prevent discrimi-nation, 
fostering a culture of 
respect and inclusivity, 
and promoting diversity 
in hiring practices. This 
enables us to be bring 
many diverse ideas and 
cater to larger set of 
clients.
Positive
5
Customer 
responsibility 
and 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Customer satisfaction is a key indicator 
of success. A poor customer experience 
relationship can pose a risk of loss of 
existing customers or decrease in 
customer loyalty. Similarly, loss of 
customers and damage to reputation 
can lead to decline in sales and revenue.
Organization uses matr-
ix and data to track 
customer satisfaction 
and identify area of 
improvement.
Positive 
6
Employee well-
being and 
health
Risk
Employee wellbeing is one crucial risk for 
the company. BPM companies often deal 
with complex and high-volume 
workloads, leading to a high-stress work 
environment for employees. Jobs in IT 
and BPM require sitting for extended 
periods, leading to a sedentary lifestyle 
that can lead to various health problems 
and sometimes experience mental 
health issues such as anxiety, depression, 
and stress due to workload pressure.
Employee wellness is a 
top priority of Data-
matics. Some of our 
st ra te g i es  i n c l u d e 
imple-menting safety 
protocols, providing 
access to healthcare 
resources, and promo-
ting healthy lifestyles for 
all employees.

Talent 
Attraction & 
Retention
Opportunity
Talent attraction and retention is a 
significant risk for BPM and IT companies 
due to the highly competitive nature of 
the industry and the demand for 
specialized skills. Similarly, BPM 
companies may experience high 
turnover rates due to factors such as job 
dissatisfaction, lack of career growth 
oppor tunities, and inadequate 
compensation and benefits.
Our strategies include 
providing employees 
with opportunities for 
professional develop-
ment and education, as 
we l l  a s  c re a t i n g  a 
diverse and inclusive 
workforce culture.
Positive
8
Service quality 
and delivery 
Opportunity
BPM companies can leverage service 
qualit y and deliver y to gain a 
competitive edge in the industry, build 
customer loyalty, and increase revenue. 
BPM companies can optimize their 
processes to ensure efficient and 
effective delivery of services. This can 
include using automation, process 
mapping, and continuous improvement 
methodologies.
Our organization work 
o n  s t a n d a r d i z i n g 
processes to ensure 
consistent quality and 
t i m e l y  d e l i v e r y  o f 
services. We focused on 
u n d e rsta n d i n g  t h e 
needs and expectation 
of our customer, aligning 
processes to deliver 
services that meet or 
e x c e e d  t h o s e 
expectations.
Positive

Community 
Giving 
Opportunity
Environmental policy, community health, 
and process safety have significant 
regulatory, operational, financial, and 
re p u ta t i o n a l  ra m i f i c a t i o n s  fo r 
companies. Building strong relationships 
with communities can help companies to 
mitigate potential operational 
disruption, reduce regulatory risk, retain 
top employees, lower the risk of litigation 
expenses in the event of process safety 
incidents, and ensure a strong social 
license to operate. Process safety 
incidents jeopardise community health 
and safety, resulting in regulatory 
penalties, legal action, and mitigating 
expenses. 
Our strategies include 
engaging in philan-
thropic initiatives, supp-
orting local businesses, 
volunteering employee 
time and promoting 
economic development. 
Increasing community 
activity enables us to 
create future Datamatics 
first-class employees.
Positive
10
Data Privacy & 
Cyber Security
Risk
Companies are assessed based on the 
amount of personal data they collect, 
their exposure to evolving or increasing 
privacy regulations, their vulnerability to 
potential data breaches, and their data 
protection systems.
We have implemented a 
robust set of security 
measure and controls to 
protect against cyber 
threats and safeguard 
and protect sensitive 
data of Datamatics and 
our clients.
Negative 
11
Training and 
development
Opportunity
Training and development are essential 
to the success of any IT and BPM organi-
zation. Companies that invests in 
employee training and development can 
increase their competitiveness, improve 
their workforce's skills and knowledge, 
and promote a culture of continuous 
learning and development.
The Company offers 
various learning and 
training program to its 
employees. It helps 
employees to leverage 
on all the new technology 
courses & learnings.

programs, and holding 
employees accountable 
for ethical violations.

Corporate 
governance
Risk
Businesses are assessed based on their 
performance across all key governance 
issues, which include ownership & 
control, Board pay, accounting, business 
ethics, and tax transparency. This topic 
examines the effect that a company's 
corporate governance and business 
ethics practices have on its shareholders 
and other investors.

Vigyanlabs –A semi Government funded Technology 
Development Organization which is focused on building 
products to promote green computing.
It’s a non-intrusive AI PowerMind Energy Savings app which 
helps save more than 50% energy consumed units.
The systems if found idle are put into sleep mode by this 
application resulting in power saving.
Gradually the same will be installed in 4400+ machines across 
PAN India Offices.
