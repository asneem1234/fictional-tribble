Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) Other waste.
	
Products post-consumer waste:  
	
As a part end-of-life product management, we are continuously working on improving our product’s circularity. It involves 
designing the vehicle for recyclability, selection of sustainable materials by studying its environmental impact, designing 
vehicle assemblies / components that are easy to dismantle and providing information for the same in our products, etc. 
Design for recycling approach complements our initiative on circular economy which aims to minimize waste and reduce 
the negative impact.
	
At the end of the product lifecycle, scrapping and recycling of vehicles in a responsible way supports environmental 
goals. Tata Motors demonstrated its holistic commitment towards sustainable mobility with the launch of “Re.Wi.Re – 
Recycle with Respect” to facilitate the safe recycling of End-of-life Vehicles(ELV). Our first state-of-the-art franchise 
based Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facility (RVSF) commenced operations at Jaipur, Rajasthan. Launched in February 
2023, we are planning to open many more such facilities across India in future. This move will lessen the pollution involved 
in the dismantling of ELVs and bring this activity within the organized sector. 
	
Operations:
	
 Our manufacturing operations generate various types of wastes which are covered under various National regulations. 
All our Plants ensure that the management of such wastes is done in full compliance of these legal requirements as 
specified by the operating permits, consents, and authorizations. Our manufacturing operations receive a large and 
diverse number of parts, components, and consumables in various forms of packaging which are discarded. These are 
segregated as per material type and shape and sold to re-cyclers for conversion and utilization. Specifically – we ensure 
the sale of all flexible and rigid plastic packaging to authorized plastic waste processors for re-cycling and utilization 
in manufacture of new packaging material. Hazardous and Other Waste are similarly routed to authorized re-cyclers 
or re-processors for material recovery or to co-processing for energy recovery through cement plants. We also ensure 
safe disposal of specific hazardous wastes as mandated in operating Consent/Authorizations, through Government 
authorized Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities. E-wastes from our Operations comprising of electronic devices, 
their components and IT assets which are discarded after their useful life or due to obsolescence is disposed only to 
authorized re-cyclers. Where technically feasible, we are utilizing the recovered material such as reclaimed thinner, 
secondary paint made from paint sludge or sand from our foundries in our own manufacturing operations or in our supply

Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities. If Yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If 
not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, the EPR provisions under The Plastic Waste Management & Handling Rules, 2016 (as amended) are applicable. We 
are registered as a “Brand Owner” and as an “Importer” with the CPCB and have complied with the requirements of the 
Registration for the concluded year 2022-23. The Company have set up internal systems to track and ensure compliance 
on a running basis, for current year 2023-24 and beyond. 
	
Legal compliance of our EPR target for FY 2022-23 has been ensured by the procurement of re-cycling certificates 
through a third party. Going forward, we will continue to fulfil our EPR targets through this route using the established 
systems for collection, transportation and the re-cycling of post-consumer plastic packaging waste. In the case of The 
Battery Waste Management Rules-2022, Company is Registered as a 'Producer' with the CPCB, and is working towards 
meeting the necessary requirements going forward.

Tata Motors has a robust governance mechanism for occupational safety & health where reviews are undertaken at 
multiple levels. The Safety, Health and Sustainability (SHS) Committee of Board of Directors is an apex review body, which 
reviews performance once in four months, followed by business unit head led Safety & Health Council which reviews 
performance every month. Further reviews at factory level are taken by Apex Committee, various Sub-committees for 
Safety Standards and then the Factory Implementation Committees (FIC). Also for non-manufacturing areas, focused 
safety reviews are conducted at defined frequency at regional offices with the Customer Service and Warehouse teams.
	
Below measures are taken to ensure safety & health in TML operations:
	
	
Critical to Safety Stations (CTS): TML has recognized CTS stations across plant locations, creating a focused 
approach towards stations having higher injury potential. Over the last year, a total of 801 CTS stations were worked 
upon. This exercise placed special attention to risk mitigation, leading to 65.44% reduction in incidents at CTS stations 
over the year.
	
	
Safety Kaizen: To facilitate a deep dive into the safety issues, 72 Safety Kaizens were held across locations on themes 
such as working in line of fire, driving safety, PPE compliance, material handling etc.
	
	
Long Term Settlement: Safety-linked payment system based on both Lead and Lag Safety Parameters introduced 
in manufacturing locations for permanent technicians.
	
	
Safety Observations: A six step process is being implemented by 3500+ White Collar Employee on a weekly basis 
which helps to identify safe and unsafe acts and situations and help increasing interactions/ coaching opportunity 
with shop floor employees.
	
	
Actions Employees Can Take: Under the AECT programme (Actions Employee Can Take), workers report unsafe 
acts and situations in their respective areas. These observations are assessed by supervisors and relevant corrective 
actions are implemented.
	
	
Training and awareness across organization is considered as a key element of the Safety Strategy. Managers 
& workers are trained on Safety management aspects such as Safety Management Fundamentals, Incident 
Investigation, Contractor Safety Management, Actions Employees Can Take (AECT) etc.

Is the premise / office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, as per the requirements of the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?
	
At all of our commercial locations where we own property, we prioritize inclusivity by providing ramps to assist differently 
abled individuals. In the properties we rent, we strive to ensure accessibility by offering ramps or elevators at the majority 
of our locations. However, there are a few instances where only steps are available leading to the building. In such 
cases, we actively engage with the building management team or owner to request the implementation of provisions 
for accessibility. Additionally, all high-rise buildings within our ownership are equipped with elevators to accommodate 
individuals with mobility challenges.
	
When it comes to our plants, we maintain a commitment to accessibility by ensuring that the floors are predominantly 
situated at ground level, allowing for easy access for everyone. In situations where we have building blocks with multiple 
floors, we make sure that ramps or elevators are available to enable smooth navigation for individuals with disabilities.

investigation against the car manufacturers in India (including Tata Motors). Finally, CCI vide its order dated 25.08.2014 
held the car manufacturers of having indulged in anti-competitive practices. CCI, among other directives, imposed a 
penalty on Tata Motors amounting to ` 1346.46 crores. TML, along with a majority of car manufacturers, challenged the 
order of CCI and presently there is a stay on CCI’s order. Now the matter shall be listed in due course before Supreme

CCI ordered its Director General ("DG") to conduct an investigation on the complaint against TML, TMFL and TCFSL for 
concerting together to form a cartel, abusing their dominance in the vehicle market and causing irreparable financial 
losses to its dealers. Subsequently, TMFL and TCFSL have been dropped from the investigation. The DG has concluded 
his investigation and submitted the report with CCI prima facie holding TML guilty of imposing territorial restrictions on 
its dealers from selling the vehicles. We have filed our objections to DG’s report and are now awaiting further instructions
