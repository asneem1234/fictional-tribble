Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback:
Complaints are recorded through two applications: eFacilito for retailers and Nhance for customers. 
eFacilito is used to log and track complaints received from retailers. Complaints are escalated according to the 
allotted time frame. If the issue is not resolved within 24 hours, it is escalated to the GM level. If the complaint remains 
unresolved after 48 hours, it is further escalated to the Centre Director.
Nhance is a loyalty programme app where customers can also submit complaints/feedback in the support section. The 
mall operations team prioritises connecting with these customers to resolve the issue within the defined TAT of 24 
hours. Customers can also give their feedback on the mall’s website.
Note : Since the Company is not into manufacturing of the products, we have also considered services sourced by the Company 
from MSMEs Vendors/Service Providers for the purpose of calculation of the input material (inputs to total input by value).
