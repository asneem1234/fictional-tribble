Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or

1.
Technological 
Advancements 
and Innovation
Opportunity
Identifying and capitalizing on 
technological advancements 
and fostering innovation can 
give Zen Technologies Limited a 
competitive edge, leading to the 
development of cutting-edge 
products and services, increased 
market share, and improved 
customer satisfaction.
NA
Potential revenue growth, 
cost savings through 
improved efficiency, and 
increased profitability.
2.
Government 
Regulations 
and Policies
Risk and 
Opportunity
Adherence to government 
regulations is critical to avoid 
penalties and maintain a 
favourable business environment. 
On the other hand, favourable 
policies can present opportunities 
for Zen Technologies Limited to 
secure government contracts and 
incentives.
Stay informed about 
changing regulations, 
maintain compliance, 
and actively engage with 
policymakers for favourable 
policies.
Non-compliance may lead 
to fines and reputational 
damage, while compliance 
can lead to increased 
business opportunities and 
potential cost savings.
3.
Geopolitical 
and Economic 
Stability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Zen Technologies Limited’s 
operations may be affected 
by geopolitical tensions and 
economic fluctuations in 
different regions where it 
operates or sells its products.
Diversify markets, assess 
geopolitical risks, and 
implement risk management 
strategies.
Instability can lead to 
market volatility and 
impact revenue, while 
stability can provide growth 
opportunities in stable 
markets.
4.
Customer 
Satisfaction 
and Retention
Opportunity
Satisfied customers are more 
likely to be loyal and recommend 
Zen Technologies Limited’s 
products and services to others, 
leading to increased sales and a 
positive brand image.
NA
Increased customer 
retention can lead to 
higher recurring revenue 
and reduced marketing 
costs for acquiring new 
customers.
5.
Cybersecurity 
and Data 
Privacy
Risk
As a technology Company dealing 
with sensitive data, the risk of 
cybersecurity breaches and data 
privacy violations can lead to legal 
liabilities, reputational damage, 
and financial losses.
Implement robust 
cybersecurity measures, 
conduct regular security 
audits, and comply with data 
protection regulations.
Data breaches can result 
in financial losses, legal 
penalties, and damage to 
the Company’s reputation.
6.
Talent 
Acquisition and 
Retention
Opportunity 
and Risk
Attracting and retaining skilled 
and talented employees is 
crucial for the Company’s growth 
and success. On the other hand, 
high employee turnover can lead 
to increased recruitment costs 
and loss of valuable expertise
Offer competitive 
compensation packages, 
career development 
opportunities, and foster a 
positive work culture.
Effective talent 
management can result in 
increased productivity and 
reduced recruitment costs, 
while high turnover can lead 
to higher expenses and 
lower productivity.
7.
Supply Chain 
Disruption
Risk
Identifying the risk of supply 
chain disruption is crucial as it 
can lead to production delays, 
increased costs, and customer 
dissatisfaction.
The Company maintains 
a diversified supplier base, 
conducts regular risk 
assessments, and establishes 
contingency plans to mitigate 
supply chain disruptions. 
Collaborative relationships 
with suppliers and real-time 
monitoring also contribute to 
timely responses to potential 
disruptions.
Proper risk management 
helps minimize financial 
losses associated with 
supply chain disruptions, 
such as production 
downtime and increased 
operational expenses.

Capacity or 
Infrastructure

Opportunity 
and Risk
Recognizing capacity or 
infrastructure constraints is 
essential to ensure optimal 
resource allocation and prevent 
operational bottlenecks that 
may impede growth.
The Company continuously 
invests in capacity 
expansion and infrastructure 
development based on 
demand forecasts. This 
proactive approach enables 
seamless operations and 
supports business growth. 
Additionally, partnerships 
and collaborations can help 
address temporary capacity 
constraints.
Adequate capacity and 
infrastructure planning 
enhance operational 
efficiency, reduce 
disruptions, and support 
revenue growth by meeting 
customer demands 
effectively.
9.
Dependence 
on 
Outsourcing 
to External 
Vendors for 
Manufacturing 
Sub-systems
Opportunity 
and Risk
Recognizing the dependence 
on external vendors for 
manufacturing sub-systems 
helps assess potential risks 
to quality control, delivery 
timelines, and cost fluctuations, 
as well as opportunities for 
collaboration and innovation.
The Company employs 
stringent vendor selection 
criteria, quality control 
processes, and regular 
performance assessments to 
ensure consistent and reliable 
supply. Exploring strategic 
partnerships and joint 
development initiatives can 
also enhance collaboration 
with vendors.
Effective vendor 
management contributes 
to stable costs, high-quality 
products, and innovation, 
positively impacting the 
Company’s financial 
performance.
10.
Financial 
Risk - Timely 
Availability of 
Fund Based 
and Non-fund 
Based Finance
Risk
Recognizing financial risks 
associated with the timely 
availability of fund-based and 
non-fund-based finance is 
crucial to ensure uninterrupted 
business operations and growth 
plans.
The Company maintains 
strong banking relationships, 
diversifies funding sources, 
and regularly assesses 
financial requirements. 
Developing contingency 
plans and optimizing working 
capital management help 
mitigate the risk of financial 
constraints.
Effective financial risk 
management safeguards 
against potential cash 
flow disruptions, penalties, 
and missed growth 
opportunities, ensuring 
the Company’s financial 
stability, and supporting 
strategic initiatives.
