Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.	
	
As part of the HED manual, both the policies - "Whistleblower Policy" and the "Policy on Sexual Harassment" state the 
mechanisms to prevent retaliation against the complainant. This includes, but is not limited to, protection from retaliation 
in the form of an adverse employment action such as termination, compensation decreases, or poor work assignments and 
threats of physical harm. The right of a whistleblower for protection against retaliation does not include immunity for any 
personal wrongdoing that is alleged and investigated.
