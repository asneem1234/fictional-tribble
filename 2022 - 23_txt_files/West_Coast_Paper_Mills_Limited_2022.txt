base. Further, increasing use 
of paper products in the 
food industry is an emerging 
opportunity.
Continuous monitoring 
and 
improvement 
of product quality is 
required 
to 
ensure 
our products have a 
consistent quality and 
meet the customer's 
quality expectations.

Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
With 
increasing 
scarcity of natural resources 
and 
increasing 
cost, 
efficient 
management 
of 
energy 
becomes 
critical for uninterrupted 
business 
operations. 
Opportunity:

Environment 
Management
Risk 
Risk: Water is a critical 
input 
material 
in 
our 
production 
process. 
We 
have to also ensure that we 
meet air emission & water 
consumption and discharge 
norms.
Our 
Company 
has 
improved 
production 
process 
over 
the 
years to reduce water 
consumption. Further, 
it 
is 
our 
constant 
endeavour to increase 
the use of recycled 
water 
in 
operation. 
During 
the 
year, 
through various process 
and 
improvement, 
we 
were 
able 
to 
reduce 
the 
water 
consumption by 11% 
in 2022-23 as compared 
to 2021-22 and by 
37% as compared to 
2015-16.   We have 
online 
monitoring 
system for Water & Air 
emission. We need to 
conserve water using 
3R principle.  For this 
new technology and 
equipment are being 
explored and used to 
meet Air & Water norms.
Negative: Non-Compliance of 
norms may lead to closure of 
plant.
6.
Coal - Availability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Availability of local coal 
is limited. Cost of sourcing 
imported coal is high.
Opportunity: To look for 
opportunity 
to 
reduce 
energy (Steam & Power) 
consumption to reduce cost. 
Also look for non-fossil fuel 
energy sources.
We are continuously 
getting 
technical 
energy 
audit 
done 
and replacing energy 
inefficient 
equipment 
with energy efficient 
equipment 
& 
technology to reduce 
carbon footprint.  We 
are 
also 
optimising 
using of chipper dust in 
Coal Fired Boilers.
Negative: Increase in energy 
cost due to use of high cost 
imported coal.

Management Discussion 
and Analysis
Global Economy 
Overview: The global economy was 
estimated to have grown at a slower 
3.2% in 2022, compared to 6% in 2021 
(which was on a smaller base of 2020 
on account of the pandemic effect). The 
relatively slow global growth of 2022 
was marked by the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine, unprecedented inflation, 
pandemic-induced slowdown in China, 
higher interest rates, global liquidity 
squeeze and quantitative tightening by 
the US Federal Reserve.
The challenges of 2022 translated into 
moderated spending, disrupted trade 
and increased energy costs. Global 
inflation was 8.7% in 2022, among 
the highest in decades. US consumer 
prices increased about 6.5% in 2022, 
the highest in four decades. The Federal 
Reserve raised its benchmark interest 
rate to its highest in 15 years. The result is 
that the world ended in 2022 concerned 
that the following year would be slower.
The global equities, bonds and crypto 
assets reported an aggregated value 
drawdown of USD26 trillion from the 
peak, equivalent to 26% of the global 
gross domestic product (GDP). In 2022, 
there was a concurrently unique decline 
in bond and equity markets; 2022 
was the only year when the S&P 500 
delivered negative returns of more than 
10%.
Global FDI inflows – equity, reinvested 
earnings and other capital – declined 
24% to nearly US$1.28 trillion in 2022. 
Global trade expanded by 2.7% in 2022 
(expected to slow to 1.7% in 2023). 
(Source: OECD, WTO data)
The 
S&P 
GSCI 
(benchmark 
for 
commodity investments and a measure 
of global commodity performance) fell 
from a peak of 4319.55 in June 2022 to 
3,495.76 in December 2022. There was 
a sharp decline in crude oil, natural 
gas, coal, lithium, lumber, cobalt, nickel 
and urea realisations. Brent crude oil 
dropped from a peak of around USD 
120 per barrel in June 2022 to USD 80 
per barrel at the end of the calendar year 
following the enhanced availability of 
low-cost Russian oil.

Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)
Indian Economy  
Overview: Even as the global conflict 
remained geographically distant from 
India, ripples comprised increased 
oil import bills, inflation, cautious 
government and a sluggish equity 
market. India reported an estimated 
economic growth of 7.2% in FY 2022-23. 
India emerged as the second fastest-
growing G20 economy in FY 2022-23. 
India had retained its position as the 
fifth-largest global economy and was 
seen as a principal driver of the global 
economy (with China).

Performance of major economies  
Outlook: The global economy is 
projected to grow a weak 2.8% in 2023, 
marked by sustained Russia-Ukraine 
conflict and higher interest rates. Global 
inflation is projected to be 6.6% in 2023. 
On the positive side, the reopening 
of China’s economy after the waning 
of the pandemic, the decline in the 
European energy crisis and the robust 
US consumption outlook (despite high 
inflation) remain positives. Interestingly, 
even as the global economy is projected 
to grow less than 3% for five years, India 
and China are likely to account for half 
the global growth in 2023 (Source: IMF). 
According to the India Meteorological 
Department, the year 2022 delivered 
8% higher rainfall than the long-period 
average. India’s wheat harvest was 
expected to fall to around 102 million 
metric tons (MMT) in 2022-23 from 
107 MMT in the preceding year due to 
unseasonal rains. Rice production at 132 
million metric tons (MMT) almost at par 
with the previous year’s yield. Pulses 
acreage grew to 31 million hectares from

for the year ending March 31, 2023.
India’s 
headline 
foreign 
direct 
investment (FDI) numbers rose to 
a record $84.8 billion in FY2021-22, 
However, during the fiscal year 2022-
23, the country experienced a 16% 
decrease in foreign direct investment 
(FDI) inflows, amounting to $71 billion 
on a gross basis. This decline can be 
attributed to the unfavourable global 
economic conditions and stands as the 
first contraction in FDI in the past ten 
years.
After three consecutive years of rise, 
India’s 
foreign 
exchange 
reserves 
declined by around $ 70 billion in 2022 
amid rising inflation and interest rates. 
The country’s forex reserves, which 
stood at $606.47 billion on 1 April 2022, 
declined to $578.44 billion on March 31, 
2023. India’s currency weakened from 
` 75.91 to a US dollar to ` 82.34 as on 31 
March 2023 due to a stronger dollar and 
weaker current account deficit.
The country’s retail inflation, measured 
by the consumer price index (CPI), eased 
to 5.66% in March 2023. Inflation data 
on the wholesale Price Index, WPI(which 
calculates the overall prices of goods 
before selling at retail prices) eased to 
1.3% during the period. In 2022, CPI hit 
its highest of 7.79% in April 2022; WPI 
reached its highest of 15.88% in May 
2022.
India moved up in the Ease of Doing 
Business (EoDB) rankings from 100th in 
2017 to 63rd in 2022. The government 
was estimated to have addressed 77% of 
its disinvestment target (` 50,000 crore 
against a target of ` 65,000 crore).
In 2022-23, total receipts (other than 
borrowings) were estimated at 6.5% 
higher than the Budget estimates. 
Tax- GDP ratio was estimated to have 
improved by 11.1 percent Y-o-Y in RE 
2022-23.
The total gross collection for FY23 was 
`18.10 lakh crore, an average of `1.51 
lakh a month and up 22% from FY22, 
India’s monthly goods and services tax 
(GST) collections hit the second highest 
ever in March 2023 to ` 1.6 lakh crore. 
For 2022–23, the government collected 
`16.61 lakh crore in direct taxes, 
according to data from the Finance 
Ministry. This amount is 17.6 percent 
more than what was collected in the 
previous fiscal.
Per capita income almost doubled in 
nine years to ` 172,000 during the year 
under review, a rise of 15.8 percent 
over the previous year. India’s GDP per 
capita was 2,320 USD (March 2023), 
close to the magic figure of $2500 when 
consumption spikes across countries.
Outlook: According to the World Bank 
April 2024 projections India’s GDP is 
projected to expand by 6.3 percent in 
FY24, catalysed in no small measure 
by 35% capital expenditure growth by 
the government. The growth could 
also be driven by broad-based credit 
expansion, better capacity utilisation 
and improving trade deficits. Headline 
and core inflation rates could trend 
down. Private sector investments could 
revive. India’s retail inflation rate could 
decline from 6.6 percent to 5.2 percent 
in FY24.
The global landscape favours India: 
Europe is moving towards a probable 
recession, the US economy is slowing, 
China’s GDP growth forecast of 4.4% 
is less than India’s GDP estimate of 
7.2% and America and Europe are 
experiencing its highest inflation in 40 
years.
India’s 
production-linked 
incentive 
appears to catalyse downstream sectors. 
Inflation is steady. India is at the cusp 
of making significant investments in 
renewable energy and other sectors 
and emerging as a suitable industrial 
supplement to China. India is poised 
to outpace Germany and Japan and 
emerge as the third-largest economy by 
the end of the decade.
The 
outlook 
for 
private 
business 
investment remained positive despite an 
increase in interest rates. India remains 
less exposed to Chinese economic 
weakness, with much less direct trade 
with China than many Asian peers.
Broad-based credit growth, improving 
capacity utilisation, government’s thrust 
on capital spending and infrastructure 
should bolster investment activity. 
According to our surveys, manufacturing, 
services and infrastructure sector firms 
are optimistic about the business 
outlook. The protracted geopolitical 
tensions, tightening global financial 
conditions 
and 
slowing 
external 
demand are the downside risks.
Union Budget FY 2023-24
The Budget 2022-23 sought to lay the 
foundation for the future of the Indian 
economy through projects like PM 
Gati-Shakti, 
Inclusive 
Development, 
Productivity Enhancement & Investment, 
Sunrise Opportunities, Energy Transition 
and Climate Action, as well as Financing 
of Investments. The capital expenditure 
of the Indian government expanded 
35.4% from ` 5.54 lakh crore to `7.50 
lakh crore. An outlay of ` 5.25 lakh crore 
was made to the Ministry of Defence 
(13.31% of the total Budget outlay). An 
announcement of nearly ` 20,000 crores 
was made for the PM Gati-Shakti National 
Master Plan to catalyse the infrastructure 
sector. An expansion of 24,500 km was 
initiated for the national highways 
network. An outlay of ` 1.97 lakh crore 
was announced for Production Linked 
Incentive schemes across 13 sectors.

India is arguably the fastest-growing 
paper market. The country’s paper 
industry is projected to experience a 
sustained demand surge on account of 
a need for quality packaging boards in 
addition to a growing demand for value-
added paper (copier, cup stock, base 
paper for making straws and paper bags 
and other single-use paper products). 
India’s paper and pulp domestic market 
size of $10.6 Bn. Paper consumption 
in India was approximately 22.05 MT 
in FY23. Carton boards and container 
boards (corrugated boards) account for 
55%, followed by writing and printing 
paper at 25%, specialty paper at 10% 
and newsprint at 10%. The country is 
expected to grow 6-7% a year to reach 30 
million tonnes by FY 2026-27, catalysed 
by robust growth in the packaging 
board. 
The 
consumer 
packaging 
segment is expected to grow by 9.5% 
CAGR, driven by increased volumes of 
household appliances, FMCG products, 
ready-made garments, pharmaceuticals 
and e-commerce. The ban on single-use 
plastics is likely to increase the demand 
for paper-based alternatives. There has 
been a steady capacity increase in the 
packaging paper segment from FY2017 
to FY2023; 2.4 lakh tonnes per annum 
has been added and another 4.0 lakh 
tonnes per annum is anticipated to be 
added by FY24.

Value impact (production) 
In our Paper and Paper Board segment, 
we achieved a remarkable year-on-year 
production increase of approximately 
6.11%. This growth can be attributed 
to our ability to meet the rising 
demand for paper and paperboard 
products. With production volumes 
reaching 314,919 tonnes in FY2023, 
up from 296,785 tonnes in FY2022, we 
have demonstrated our agility and 
responsiveness in addressing market 
demand. 
This 
significant 
increase 
positions us favourably in the industry, 
allowing us to capture a larger market 
share and expand our customer base. 
Similarly, in the Optical Fibre Cable 
segment, we experienced a noteworthy 
year-on-year production increase of 
about 13.54%. Our production quantities 
rose from 63,630 kilometers in FY2022 
to 72,246 kilometers in FY2023. This 
growth showcases our ability to adapt 
to the growing demand for optical fibre 
cables and indicates our commitment 
to staying ahead in a rapidly evolving 
market. By expanding our production 
capacity, we are positioned to service the 
increasing needs of our customers and 
capitalize on emerging opportunities. 
Value impact (sales) 
In the Paper and Paper Board segment, 
we witnessed a modest year-on-year 
increase of around 2.18% in sales 
volume, with volumes rising from 
303,715 tonnes in FY2022 to 310,349 
tonnes in FY2023. While the growth 
rate may seem moderate, it signifies our 
ability to maintain steady sales and meet 
customer requirements in a competitive 
market. This consistent performance 
positions us attractively for expansion 
and sustained market presence. 
On the other hand, the Optical 
Fibre Cable segment experienced a 
substantial year-on-year sales volume 
increase of approximately 28.23%. Sales 
volumes rose from 63,470 kilometers in 
FY2022 to 81,388 kilometers in FY2023, 
indicating strong market demand for 
optical fibre cables and our ability to 
effectively meet and exceed customer 
expectations. This impressive growth 
showcases our competitiveness in 
the segment and our capacity to seize 
opportunities in the rapidly expanding 
telecommunications industry.

The Company has implemented a 
comprehensive 
risk 
framework 
to 
identify, assess and mitigate risks. The 
framework comprises risk mapping, 
trend analysis, risk exposure evaluation 
and potential impacts assessment. The 
Board and Risk Management Committee 
review risks and recommend measures 
to manage/mitigate, them through 
a 
well-defined 
risk 
management 
framework 
outlined 
in 
the 
Risk 
Management Policy.
Environmental Sustainability:
The Company invested in a state-of-the-
art effluent treatment plant and 100% 
elemental chlorine-free bleaching in 
2010. It complies with all the prescribed 
norms 
under 
the 
Environment 
Protection Act, of 1986 and other 
environmental regulations, including 
the CREP requirements.

The Company took measures to reduce 
water 
consumption; 
it 
decreased 
specific energy consumption to comply 
with the norms prescribed under PAT-
Cycle-II.
Business 
environment 
risk: 
The 
mature and capital-intensive paper 
industry is exposed to competition and 
unpredictable market dynamics.
Mitigation: To mitigate this risk, the 
Company ensures adequate access 
to low-cost resources that make it 
competitive across market cycles.
Realizations risk: Declining realizations 
could affect the Company’s profitability.
Mitigation: The Company has broad-
based its portfolio risk (across writing 
and printing paper, packaging paper and 
specialty paper) so that it can capitalise 
on increased literacy, e-commerce 
and the growing demand for product 
packaging.
Raw materials risk: An inability to 
procure raw materials could impact 
operations.
Mitigation: 
The 
Company 
implemented 
a 
clonal 
plantation 
program to augment wood availability; 
it distributes subsidized seedlings. The 
company procures 50 percent of its 
plantation wood from within 300 km.

West Coast Paper Mills Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)
The Company also procures hardwood 
(Casuarina, Eucalyptus, Subabul and 
Acacia) from cultivators in Karnataka, 
Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The 
Company imports pinewood pulp to 
manufacture specialty paper.
Quality risk: An inability to address 
customer demand for quality products 
could impact the Company’s brand.
Mitigation: The Company invested in 
systems and processes to manufacture 
quality products. The Company was 
accredited with ISO 9001:2015 QMS, 
14001:2015 EMS, ISO 45001:2018 OHSMS 
and FSC-certified products, validating its 
quality commitment.
Human resource risk: Unforeseen 
talent 
attrition 
could 
affect 
competitiveness.
Mitigation: 
The 
Company 
has 
implemented various HR initiatives to 
retain talent apart from conducting 
structured 
training 
programs 
and 
succession planning for critical positions. 
Attrition analysis is being done through 
the exit interview process.
Liquidity risk: The paper industry is 
capital-intensive; liquidity risks can be of 
concern.
Mitigation: 
The 
company 
enjoys 
healthy cash flows from operations, a 
strong cash balance and a modestly 
exercised working capital limit. WCPML 
can service near-term commitments 
through 
accruals 
while 
retaining 
substantial cash.
Environmental risk: Paper mills are 
regulated to reduce environmental 
impact; 
this 
can 
warrant 
costly 
investments and limit their capacity to 
grow.
Mitigation: The company installed 
water-saving measures. Water use per 
tonne of product declined from 66 m3/
MT in FY2022 to 58 m3/MT in FY2023. 
The firm obtained pulp wood from 
private parties, captive plantations, 
agricultural forestry programs and the 
Karnataka State Government. The Forest 
Stewardship Council Chain of Custody 
and 
Forest 
Stewardship 
Council 
Managed Wood certifications for pulp 
wood validated that the paper made 
from wood was socially and ecologically 
responsible.
Internal control systems and their adequacy
Human resources
The Company has established an 
efficient internal control system for 
its 
business 
processes 
to 
ensure 
operational 
efficiency, 
financial 
reporting 
and 
compliance 
with 
applicable laws and regulations. Well-
defined roles and responsibilities have 
been institutionalized for all managerial 
positions. All operating parameters 
are monitored and controlled and 
regular internal audits and checks 
are conducted to ensure effective 
execution 
of 
responsibilities. 
The 
adequacy and effectiveness of the 
internal control systems are periodically 
reviewed by the Audit Committee of 
the Board of Directors, which suggests 
improvements to strengthen them. The 
Company has implemented a process-
driven framework for Internal Financial 
Controls (IFC) in accordance with the 
explanation of Section 134(5) (e) of the 
Companies Act, 2013. For the fiscal year 
ended March 31, 2023, the Company 
has sound IFC commensurate with the 
nature and size of its business operations 
that are operating effectively and no 
material weakness exists. The Company 
continuously monitors and identifies 
gaps, if any and implements new and/or 
improved controls wherever the effect 
of such gaps would have a material 
effect on the Company’s operations. 
The Committee members review the 
performance of the Statutory Auditors 
and Internal Auditors and take note of 
the adequacy of the Internal Financial 
Control System
The employees of the company are 
considered as its most valuable resource 
and the company recognizes the 
importance of aligning human resource 
practices with business priorities and 
objectives. The workforce is the key 
strategic pillar that drives the business 
processes to attain the company’s vision. 
The company has maintained a healthy 
and cordial industrial relationship with 
its employees, who have been equal 
partners in implementing company 
policies 
and 
achieving 
stretched 
operational targets. During the year, the 
company’s industrial relations remained 
cordial and the newly elected JNC 
demanded permanency of all contract 
workers and indulged in illegal contract 
workers strike on 22.02.2023. The issue 
was resolved amicably. As of March 31, 
2023, the company employed 2415 
employees.

Independent Auditor’s Certificate on Corporate Governance

West Coast Paper Mills Limited
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Members of West Coast Paper Mills Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of West Coast Paper Mills Limited (“the 
Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the 
statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the 
year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act 2013 (“The Act” or “Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under 
section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, its 
profit including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), 
as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in 
the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed 
the matter is provided in that context. 
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
1.  Revenue Recognition (Refer Note 1 (III) (h) and 28 to the Standalone financial Statements)
Revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects 
the consideration to which the Company expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods 
to a customer. The revenue recognition occurs 
at a point in time when the control of the goods 
is transferred to the customer.
We focussed on this area as a key audit matter 
as the value is significant and inherent risk exists 
of revenue being recognized before the control 
is transferred, including risk of incorrect timing 
of estimation related to recording the discounts 
and rebates.
As part of our audit procedures, we:
 Read the Company’s accounting policy for revenue recognition 
and assessed compliance with the requirements of Ind AS 115.
 Evaluated the design, tested the implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls 
including general IT controls and key IT application controls 
over recognition of revenue.
 On a sample basis, tested supporting documentation for sales 
transactions which included sales invoices, customer contracts 
and shipping documents.
Independent Auditor’s Report 
Statutory Reports
Standalone Financials
Consolidated Financials
85
Annual Report 2022-23
 Tested revenue samples focused on sales recorded 
immediately before the year-end, obtained evidence as 
regards timing of revenue recognition, based on terms and 
conditions of sales contracts and delivery documents.
 Assessed disclosures in financial statements in respect of 
revenue, as specified in Ind AS 115.
2. Provisions and contingent liabilities related to taxation, litigation and claims (Refer Note 39 to the 
     Standalone financial statements)
The Company has ongoing litigations with 
various regulatory and tax authorities and third 
parties. Where an outflow of funds is believed 
to be probable and a reliable estimate of the 
outcome of the dispute can be made based 
on management’s assessment of specific 
circumstances of each dispute and relevant 
external advice, management provides for its 
reliable estimate of the liability. Such accruals 
are by nature complex and can take number 
of years to resolve and can involve estimation 
uncertainty.
Due to the level of judgement relating to 
recognition, valuation and presentation of 
provisions and contingent liabilities, this is 
considered to be a key audit matter
As part of our audit procedures, we:
 Obtained an understanding of management’s process to 
identify new obligations and changes in existing obligations 
for compliance with Ind AS 12 – Income taxes and Ind AS 37 - 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
 analysed significant changes in material provisions from prior 
periods and obtained a detailed understanding of these 
changes and assumptions applied.
 Our audit procedures related to material provisions recognised 
and contingent liabilities disclosed in the standalone  financial 
statements included:
	
l Assessment of the recognition criteria for the liability;
	
l Evaluation of the methodology adopted by management 
for the measurement of the liability;
	
l Assessment of the other key measurement assumptions 
and inputs.
	
l  We have obtained opinions and confirmations from 
internal /external experts and legal counsel, where 
necessary, which we have relied upon.  
 We reviewed the minutes of the Board meetings including 
other committees to evaluate the process and controls over 
obligations operated by management.
 Testing of the mathematical accuracy of the measurement 
calculation.
 We assessed the appropriateness of the presentation of 
the most significant contingent liabilities in the financial 
statements.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s management and Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the standalone financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information. We are required to report 
that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a 
Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.)
86
West Coast Paper Mills Limited
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and 
take necessary actions, as applicable under the applicable laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s management and Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the 
financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity 
of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with [the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended]. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities. Selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
• 	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Annual Report 2022-23
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be 
influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial 
statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

(Referred to in paragraph 2 (f) of the Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the members of WEST COAST 
PAPER MILLS LIMITED on the Standalone financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (‘the Act’)
1.	
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of West Coast Paper Mills Limited (‘the 
Company’) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the Financial Statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting (the ‘Guidance Note’) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and 
deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
6.	
Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	
(1) 	 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
	
(2) 	 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
Statutory Reports

of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
Company; and
	
(3) 	 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Subsequent expenditure on major maintenance or repairs includes the cost of the replacement of parts of assets 
and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will be available to the Company, the expenditure is capitalised and the carrying amount 
of the item replaced is derecognised. Similarly, overhaul costs associated with major maintenance are capitalised 
and depreciated over their useful lives where it is probable that future economic benefits will be available and 
any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls are derecognised. 
	
Decommissioning Liability:
	
Cost of PPE also includes the estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the land 
back on vacant conditions at the end of lease period. The Company has estimated such costs being the present 
value of future liability for decommissioning. Such costs are capitalized and a provision of the equivalent amount 
has been created. The provision is periodically increased by adding the interest cost at the IRR determined by the 
Company.
	
Disposal of Assets:
	
An item of PPE is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE is determined 
as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Intangible Assets:
	
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation & impairment loss, if any.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when 
the asset is derecognised.
b)	
Depreciation & Amortization:
	
The Company depreciates PPE over their estimated useful lives as per the provisions of the Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013. The estimated useful lives of PPE are as follows:

acquisition of fixed assets, depreciation is provided over the remaining residual life of the respective assets.

of impairment based on internal / external factors. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price 
and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present

Foreign currency current assets and current liabilities outstanding at the balance sheet date are translated at the 
exchange rate prevailing on that date and the resultant gain or loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit & Loss.
	
Any income or expenses on account of exchange difference either on settlement or on translation is recognized 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss except in case of long term liabilities, where they relate to acquisition or 
construction of fixed assets, in which case they are adjusted to the carrying cost of such assets in accordance with 
the exemption under Para D13AA of Ind AS 101.
n)	
Financial Instruments:
	
Financial Assets :
	
Financial assets are classified as equity instrument if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of ‘equity’ for 
the issuer. All other non-derivative financial assets are debt.
	
All Financial Assets are recognised on trade date when the purchase of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose term requires delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. 
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets 
which are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) at inception. All recognised financial assets are 
subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.
	
Trade Receivables:
	
A Receivable is classified as a ‘trade receivable’ if it is in respect to the amount due from customers on account of 
goods sold or services rendered in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognised at transaction 
value and subsequently measured at transaction value less provision for impairment. For some trade receivables 
the Company may obtain security in the form of guarantee, security deposit or letter of credit which can be called 
upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.
	
Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the 
expected life of financial assets. The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for 
impairment and the impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.
	
Financial assets at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL):
	
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of classifying as amortised cost or fair value through other 
comprehensive income described above, or that meet the criteria but the entity has chosen to designate as at 
FVTPL at initial recognition, are measured at FVTPL.
	
Investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL, unless the Company designates an investment that 
is not held for trading at FVTOCI at initial recognition.
	
Financial assets classified at FVTPL are initially measured at fair value excluding transaction costs.
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Dividend income on investments in equity instruments at FVTPL is recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
in investment income when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend can be 
measured reliably.
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets:
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset on trade date only when it transfers the financial asset and 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. 
	
On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Company retains an option to 
repurchase part of a transferred asset), the Company allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset 
between the part it continues to recognise under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognises 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023 (Contd.)
106
West Coast Paper Mills Limited
on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The difference between the 
carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognised and the sum of the consideration received for 
the part no longer recognised and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognised in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.  Cumulative gain or loss that had been 
recognised in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to be recognised and 
the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.
	
Financial Liability:
	
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
	
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated 
as at FVTPL.
	
Financial Liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for 
loans where the difference between IRR and normal rate of interest was immaterial.
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company 
take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics 
into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or 
disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for employee share-
based payment, leasing transactions and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair 
value, such as net realisable value in Inventories or value in use in Impairment of Assets. The basis of fair valuation 
of these items are given as part of their respective accounting policies.
	
Derivative Financial Instruments:
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to 
hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at 
the end of each period. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative 
is designated as a hedging instrument and if so, on the nature of the item being hedged. Any gains or losses 
arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss.
	
Trade and Other Payables:
	
A payable is classified as ’trade payable’ if it is in respect of the amount due on account of goods purchased or 
services received in the normal course of business. These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services 
provided to the Company prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are 
presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period.
	
Other Financial Liabilities:
	
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other 
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
	
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, 
to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
o)	
Borrowing Cost: 
	
Borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets up to the date when 
they are ready for their intended use and other borrowing costs are charged to profit and loss account.

p)	
Taxation:
	
Provision for Taxation is determined on the basis of the Taxable profits computed for the current accounting 
period in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961.
	
Deferred Tax resulting from “temporary difference” between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the 
balance sheet and its tax base book profit and taxable profit for the year is accounted for using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted as on the balance sheet date. The deferred tax asset is 
recognized and carried forward only to the extent that there is a virtual certainty that the asset will be adjusted in 
future.
	
Minimum Alternate Tax credit is recognized, as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence 
that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period.
q)	
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets :
	
Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and 
it is probable (“more likely than not”) that it is required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation.
	
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. 
Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flow to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount 
is the present value of those cash flows. The discount rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money in that jurisdiction and the risks specific to the liability.
	
Contingent Liability is disclosed after careful evaluation of facts, uncertainties and possibility of reimbursement. 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed in notes.
	
Contingent Assets are not recognised in financial statements but are disclosed, since the former treatment may 
result in the recognition of income that may or may not be realised. However, when the realisation of income is 
virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.
r)	
Government Grants:
	
Incentive received from the Government under sales tax deferral scheme, which is interest free in nature is 
determined based on fair value. Fair value is determined on the present value technique based on cash flow 
payable under the scheme & the same is amortized over the remaining period of sales tax deferral loan.
s)	
Leases:
	
On April 1, 2019, the Company adopted Ind AS 116, Leases. Accordingly, the policy for Leases as presented in the 
Company’s Annual Report is amended as under: 
	
The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the 
lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Company determines the lease 
term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the 
lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is 
reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it 
considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise 
the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the 
lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate is generally based on 
the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics

The Company as lessee:
	
At the inception of the contract, the Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease. A contract is, or 
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. For the purpose of identifying if a contract contains a lease, the Company assesses 
whether: 
	
(i)	
The contract involves the use of an identified asset.
	
(ii)	
The Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease, 
	
and 
	
(iii)	 The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except in case of low value leases 
and short term leases (a term of less than twelve months) wherein the lease payments are recognized as an 
operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The 
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using 
the incremental borrowing rates.
	
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. 
ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. 
Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company 
changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost. Cost includes the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less 
any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses.
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the useful life 
of the underlying asset or the lease term whichever is shorter. Right of use assets are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been 
classified as financing cash flows.
t)	
Recent accounting pronouncements:
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:
	
i.	
Ind AS 1 – Material accounting policies - The amendments mainly related to shifting of disclosure of 
erstwhile “significant accounting policies” in the notes to the financial statements to material accounting 
policy information requiring companies to reframe their accounting policies to make them more “entity 
specific. This amendment aligns with the “material” concept already required under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
	
ii.	
Ind AS 8 – Definition of  accounting estimates - The amendments specify definition of ‘change in 
accounting estimate’ replaced with the definition of ‘accounting estimates’. 
	
iii.	
Ind AS 12 – Income taxes – Annual Improvements to Ind AS - The amendment clarifies that in cases 
of transactions where equal amounts of assets and liabilities are recognised on initial recognition, the 
initial recognition exemption does not apply. Also, If a company has not yet recognised deferred tax asset 
and deferred tax liability on right-of-use assets and lease liabilities or has recognised deferred tax asset or 
deferred tax liability on net basis, that company shall have to recognise deferred tax assets and deferred tax

liabilities on gross basis based on the carrying amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities existing at 
the beginning of 1st April, 2023.
u)	
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
	
-	
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will 
seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the company’s 
accounting policies.
	
-	
The estimates and judgements  involves a higher degree of judgement or complexity and of items which 
are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than 
those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included 
in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the 
financial statements.
	
Critical estimates and judgements
	
The areas involving critical estimates or judgements are:
	
- 	
Estimation of current tax expense and payable
	
- 	
Estimated useful life of PPE & intangible assets
	
- 	
Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
- 	
Recognition of revenue
	
- 	
Recognition of deferred tax assets for carried forward tax losses
	
- 	
Impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets
	
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the company and that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances.

had preferred appeals with Commissioner Appeals and / or ITAT. The ITAT  partly allowed the appeals of the

LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT
The Company had entered into a loan purchase agreement with ICICI Bank Ltd. for ` 4,000 Lakhs in respect of 
borrowings of Shree Rama Newsprint Limited (SRNL) after sale of its investment in shares of SRNL. The loan purchase 
agreement stipulates that upon occurrence of default ICICI Bank Ltd. will have “a right” to require the Company to 
purchase the loan outstanding of SRNL along with transfer of underlying security by ICICI Bank Ltd., to the Company. 
The outstanding balance as at March 31, 2023 of SRNL loan is ` 2,979.00 Lakhs with principal repayment due by June 
30, 2025. The Company does not foresee any event of default, further the security value is significantly higher than the 
outstanding loan balance and hence no liability is envisaged in this respect.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES
1	 Financial Risk
	
The company’s operational activities expose to various financial risks i.e., market risk, credit risk and risk of liquidity. 
The company realizes that risks are inherent and integral aspect of any business. The primary focus is to foresee the 
unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. 
The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk & interest rate risk. The Company uses derivative 
financial instruments to reduce foreign exchange risk exposures.
i	
Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
fluctuation in market prices. These comprise three types i.e., currency rate, interest rate and other price related risks. 
Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivative 
financial instruments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future 
cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Regular interaction 
with bankers, intermediaries and the market participants help us to mitigate such risk.
a	 Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
	
The primary market risk to the company is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments 
to reduce foreign exchange risk exposure and follows its risk management policies to mitigate the same. After 
taking cognizance of the natural hedge, the company takes appropriate hedges to mitigate its risk resulting from

b.	 Interest rate risk and sensitivity
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to long term debt. The 
Company has entered into various interest rate swap contracts, in which it agrees to exchange, at specific intervals, the 
difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon principal amount. 
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. With all other variables held constant, 
the following table demonstrates composition of fixed and floating rate borrowing of the company and impact of 
floating rate borrowings on company’s profitability.

ii	 Credit Risk
	
The Company evaluates the customer credentials carefully from trade sources before appointment of any distributor 
and only financially sound parties are appointed as distributors. The Company secures adequate deposits from its 
distributor and hence risk of bad debt is limited. The credit outstanding is sought to be limited to the sum of 
advances / deposits and credit limit determined by the company. The company have stop supply mechanism in 
place in case outstanding goes beyond agreed limits.
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ` 15,086.23 
Lakhs and ` 9,570.82  Lakhs as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Trade receivables are typically 
unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in India. Credit risk has always 
been managed by the company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring 
the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. On 
account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or 
gain. The Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. 
The provision matrix takes into account as per the Company’s historical experience for customers.

iii	 Liquidity Risk
	
Liquidity risk arises when the Company will not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations.

effects. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. Risk management is carried 
out by the Finance department under Forex Policies as adopted and duly approved by the Board. The Company’s 
approach is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due and

West Coast Paper Mills Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of West Coast Paper Mills Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as the ‘Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the 
Group”), which comprise of the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2023, and the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 
“the Consolidated Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the 
consideration of report of other auditors on separate financial statements of subsidiaries as was audited by the other 
auditors, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2023, of its consolidated profit 
including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then 
ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with 
the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the 
audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of audit report of the other auditor referred to “Other 
Matters” paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the Consolidated financial 
statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matters
How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
1.  Revenue Recognition (Refer note no. 1 (III) (G) and 28 to Consolidated Financial Statements)
Revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects 
the consideration to which the Company expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods 
to a customer. The revenue recognition occurs at 
a point in time when the control of the goods is 
transferred to the customer.
We focused on this area as a key audit matter as 
the value is significant and inherent risk exists of 
revenue being recognized before the control is 
transferred, including risk of incorrect timing of 
estimation related to recording the discounts 
and rebates.
As part of our audit procedures, we:
 Read the Group’s accounting policy for revenue recognition 
and assessed compliance with the requirements of Ind AS 
115.
 Evaluated the design, tested the implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 
including general IT controls and key IT application controls 
over recognition of revenue.
 On a sample basis, tested supporting documentation for 
sales transactions which included sales invoices, customer 
contracts, and shipping documents.
Independent Auditor’s Report 
Statutory Reports
Standalone Financials
Consolidated Financials
147
Annual Report 2022-23
 Tested revenue samples focused on sales recorded 
immediately before the year-end, obtained evidence as 
regards timing of revenue recognition, based on terms and 
conditions of sales contracts and delivery documents.
 Assessed disclosures in financial statements in respect of 
revenue, as specified in Ind AS 115.
2.	 Provision and contingent liability related to taxation, litigation and claims (Refer note no. 39 to 
Consolidated Financial Statements)
The Group has ongoing litigations with various 
regulatory and tax authorities and third parties. 
Where an outflow of funds is believed to 
be probable and a reliable estimate of the 
outcome of the dispute can be made based 
on management’s assessment of specific 
circumstances of each dispute and relevant 
external advice, management provides for its 
reliable estimate of the liability. Such accruals are 
by nature complex and can take number of years 
to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty.
Due to the level of judgement relating to 
recognition, valuation and presentation of 
provisions and contingent liabilities, this is 
considered to be a key audit matter
As part of our audit procedures, we:
 Obtained an understanding of management’s process to 
identify new obligations and changes in existing obligations 
for compliance with Ind AS 12 – Income taxes and Ind AS 37 
- Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
 analysed significant changes in material provisions from prior 
periods and obtained a detailed understanding of these 
changes and assumptions applied.
 Our audit procedures related to material provisions 
recognised and contingent liabilities disclosed in the 
Consolidated financial statements included:
 
l Assessment of the recognition criteria for the liability;
	
l  Evaluation of the methodology adopted by management 
for the measurement of the liability;
	
l Assessment of the other key measurement assumptions 
and inputs.
	
l We have obtained opinions and confirmations from 
internal /external experts and legal counsel, where 
necessary, which we have relied upon.  
 We reviewed the minutes of the Board meetings including 
other committees to evaluate the process and controls over 
obligations operated by management.
 Testing of the mathematical accuracy of the measurement 
calculation;
 We assessed the appropriateness of the presentation of 
the most significant contingent liabilities in the financial 
statements.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s annual report, but does not include the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made 
available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated 
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based 
on the work we have performed and based on the work done/ audit report of other auditor, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.)
148
West Coast Paper Mills Limited
Responsibilities of the Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Holding Company’s management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of 
these Consolidated Financial Statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the 
consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit/loss including other comprehensive income, consolidated statement 
of changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the 
Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible 
for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the 
assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by 
the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
l	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
l	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls based on our audit.
l	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by Management and Board of Directors.
l	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our Auditor’s Report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.)
Statutory Reports
Standalone Financials
Consolidated Financials
149
Annual Report 2022-23
to the date of our Auditor’s Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group (Holding Company 
and Subsidiaries) to cease to continue as a going concern.
l	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
l	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of such entities or business 
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, of which we are the 
independent auditors. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial 
information of such entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent 
auditors. For the other entity included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which has been audited by other 
auditor, such other auditor remains responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit carried 
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further 
described in the section titled ‘Other Matters’ in this audit report.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of audit report of the other auditor 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our Auditor’s Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
We did not audit the financials statements of 2 subsidiaries whose financial statements includes total assets of 
`2,01,925.42 Lakhs as at March 31, 2023, total revenues of ` 2,11,955.78 Lakhs for the year ended March 31, 2023 and 
net cash inflow of ` (-) 422.40 Lakhs for the year ended March 31, 2023, as considered in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. These Financial Statements have been audited by other auditor whose report has been furnished to us by 
the Management and our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and our report in terms of sub-section 
(3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of the subsidiary, 
are based solely on the reports of the other auditor.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements is not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to 
our reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors.

Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.)

West Coast Paper Mills Limited
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013
(Referred to in paragraph 2 (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our 
report of even date)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of West Coast Paper Mills Limited (‘the Holding 
Company’) as of and for the year ended 31st March 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies incorporate in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Company’s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements based on the criteria established by 
the respective Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”).
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the Auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements are a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies incorporated in India have, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial 
controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of 
such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid reports are under section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting insofar as it relates to subsidiaries, which are incorporated in India, is based 
on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies. Our opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.

Note 1 – Company Overview, Basis of Preparation and Significant Accounting Policies
I.	
The Company Overview:
	
West Coast Paper Mills Limited, a Public Limited Company listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited 
and the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited. The registered office of the Parent Company is situated at Bangur 
Nagar, Dandeli 581325 District Uttar Kannada, Karnataka which was established in 1955. The Parent Company has

Optical Fibre Cable which cater requirement of telecom sector of India.
II.	
Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements:
a)	
Basis of Preparation:
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements (“the financial statements”) relate to the Company and its subsidiaries 
(collectively “the group”) and its interest in associates. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group, are 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) under the historical cost convention 
on the accrual basis.The Ind AS are prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and the relevant 
provisions thereof. The financial statements of the subsidiary companies used in the preparation of the 
Consolidated financial statements have been drawn upto the same report date as that of the parent Company. 
 	
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly issued Accounting Standard is initially 
adopted or a revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in 
use.The Group has prepared these Consolidated Financial Statements as per the format prescribed in Schedule III 
to the Companies Act, 2013. 
b)	
Principles of consolidation and equity accounting:
	
i.	
Subsidiaries:
	
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The Group 
combines the financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries line by line adding together 
like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised 
gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
	
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet 
respectively.
	
ii. 	
Associates:
	
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This is 
generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates 
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. 
c)	
Business Combination and Goodwill:
	
The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred 
by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023
160
West Coast Paper Mills Limited
on acquisition-date, liabilities assumed and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair 
value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. For this purpose, the liabilities 
assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they are measured at their acquisition 
date fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable. 
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
	
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date. Deferred tax asset or liability arising from a business 
combination are recognized in accordance with the requirements of  Ind AS 12 “Income Taxes”. 
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and 
the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.
d)	
Functional and Presentation Currency:
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been presented in Indian Rupees (INR), which is the Company’s 
functional currency. All financial information presented in INR has been rounded off to the nearest two decimals 
of Lakhs unless otherwise stated.
e)	
Use of Estimates:
	
The preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires Management to make estimates 
and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure 
of contingent liabilities as on the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amount of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Difference between the actual results and estimates are recognized in the 
period in which the results are known/ materialized.
f)	
Classification of Assets and Liabilities as Current and Non-Current:
	
All Assets and Liabilities have been classified as Current or Non-Current as per the Group’s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of product & 
activities of the Group and their realisation in cash and cash equivalent, the Group has determined its operating 
cycle as twelve months for the purpose of Current and Non-Current classification of assets and liabilities. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
III.	 Significant Accounting Policies:
a)	
Property, Plant and Equipments (PPE):
	
PPE are stated at cost of acquisition (net of Cenvat & VAT / GST wherever applicable) or construction less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Cost includes any directly attributable cost of bringing 
each asset to its working condition for intended use. 
	
Assets under installation or under construction as at Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital work in progress 
together with project expenses.
	
Subsequent expenditure on major maintenance or repairs includes the cost of the replacement of parts of assets 
and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will be available to the Group, the expenditure is capitalised and the carrying amount 
of the item replaced is derecognised. Similarly, overhaul costs associated with major maintenance are capitalised 
and depreciated over their useful lives where it is probable that future economic benefits will be available and 
any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls are derecognised. 
	
Decommissioning Liability:
	
Cost of PPE also includes the estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the land 
back on vacant conditions at the end of lease period. The Group has estimated such costs being the present 
value of future liability for decommissioning. Such costs are capitalized and a provision of the equivalent amount

has been created. The provision is periodically increased by adding the interest cost at the IRR determined by the 
Group.
	
Disposal of Assets:
	
An item of PPE is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE is determined 
as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Intangible Assets:
	
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation & impairment loss, if any.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when 
the asset is derecognised.
b)	
Depreciation & Amortization:
	
The Parent Company and a subsidiary depreciates PPE over their estimated useful lives as per the provisions of 
the Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. The estimated useful lives of PPE are as follows:

c)	
Investment Properties:
	
Investment properties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both are stated in the Balance Sheet 
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses. Any gain or loss on disposal of 
investment property is determined as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Transfer to, or from, investment property is 
done at the carrying amount of the property.
d)	
Impairment of Non Financial Assets:
	
The carrying amounts of non financial assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine if there is any 
indication of impairment based on internal / external factors. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the 
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value 
less cost of disposal and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor. 
	
An impairment loss  is recognized as an expense in the Statement of Profit and loss in the year in which an asset is 
identified as impaired. The impairment loss recognized in the prior accounting years is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimate of recoverable amount.
e)	
Assets held for Sale:
	
The Group recognize Assets for Sale of those assets which are not in use and identified for sale / disposal. The 
same is valued at carrying amount net or realizable value whichever is lower.
f)

weighted average cost, after providing for obsolescence, if any. 
	
Work in process is valued at cost.
	
Finished goods & Stock-in-trade are valued at lower of cost or net realizable value.
	
The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and 
related production overheads.
	
Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion 
costs necessary to make the sale.
	
Stock of scrap is valued at realizable value. 
	
Biological assets other than bearer plants which are matured and have market value are valued at fair value 
Biological Assets which are immature are valued at cost.
g)	
Revenue Recognition:
	
Revenue is recognized on transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer and are adjusted 
for discounts (net), taxes and foreign exchange differences. Turnover is net of Goods & Service Tax collected on 
behalf of the Government.
	
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised in accordance with Ind AS 115, when control of the goods 
or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
	
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received / receivable taking into account contractually 
defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the Government.
	
Sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The 
revenue is measured on the basis of the consideration defined in the contract with a customer, including variable 
consideration, such as discounts, volume rebates, or other contractual reductions. As the period between the 
date on which the Company transfers the promised goods to the customer and the date on which the customer 
pays for these goods is generally one year or less, no financing components are taken into account.

m)	 Financial Instruments:
	
Financial Assets :
	
Financial assets are classified as ‘equity instrument’ if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of ‘equity’ for 
the issuer. All other non-derivative financial assets are ‘debt
	
All Financial Assets are recognised on trade date when the purchase of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose term requires delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. 
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets 
which are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) at inception. All recognised financial assets are 
subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.
	
Trade Receivables:
	
A Receivable is classified as a ‘trade receivable’ if it is in respect to the amount due from customers on account of 
goods sold or services rendered in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognised at transaction 
value and subsequently measured at transaction value less provision for impairment. For some trade receivables 
the Company may obtain security in the form of guarantee, security deposit or letter of credit which can be called 
upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.
	
Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the 
expected life of financial assets. The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for 
impairment and the impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.
	
Financial assets at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL):
	
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of classifying as amortised cost or fair value through other 
comprehensive income described above, or that meet the criteria but the entity has chosen to designate as at 
FVTPL at initial recognition, are measured at FVTPL.
	
Investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL, unless the Company designates an investment that 
is not held for trading at FVTOCI at initial recognition.
	
Financial assets classified at FVTPL are initially measured at fair value excluding transaction costs.
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Dividend income on investments in equity instruments at FVTPL is recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
in investment income when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity; and the amount of the dividend can be 
measured reliably.
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets:
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset on trade date only when it transfers the financial asset and substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. 
	
On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Company retains an option to 
repurchase part of a transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset 
between the part it continues to recognise under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognises 
on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The difference between the 
carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognised and the sum of the consideration received for 
the part no longer recognised and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognised in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.  Cumulative gain or loss that had been 
recognised in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to be recognised and 
the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.

Financial Liability:
	
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
	
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated 
as at FVTPL.
	
Financial Liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for 
loans where the difference between IRR and normal rate of interest was immaterial.
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company 
take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics 
into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or 
disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for employee share-
based payment, leasing transactions, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair 
value, such as net realisable value in Inventories or value in use in Impairment of Assets. The basis of fair valuation 
of these items are given as part of their respective accounting policies.
	
Derivative Financial Instruments:
	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to 
hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at 
the end of each period. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative 
is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, on the nature of the item being hedged. Any gains or losses 
arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss.
	
Trade and Other Payables:
	
A payable is classified as ’trade payable’ if it is in respect of the amount due on account of goods purchased or 
services received in the normal course of business. These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services 
provided to the Company prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are 
presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period.
	
Other Financial Liabilities:
	
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.Other 
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
	
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, 
to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
n)	
Borrowing Cost: 
	
Borrowings costs that are attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets up to the date when 
they are ready for their intended use and other borrowing costs are charged to profit and loss account.  
o)	
Taxation:
	
Provision for Taxation is determined on the basis of the Taxable profits computed for the current accounting 
period in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961.
	
Deferred Tax resulting from “ temporary difference” between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the 
balance sheet and its tax base book profit and taxable profit for the year is accounted for using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted as on the balance sheet date. The deferred tax asset is 
recognized and carried forward only to the extent that there is a virtual certainty that the asset will be adjusted in 
future.

Minimum Alternate Tax credit is recognized, as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence 
that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period.
p)	
 Provisions & Contingent Liabilities/Assets:
	
Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and 
it is probable (“more likely than not”) that it is required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.
	
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. 
Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flow to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount 
is the present value of those cash flows. The discount rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money in that jurisdiction and the risks specific to the liability.
	
Contingent Liability is disclosed after careful evaluation of facts, uncertainties and possibility of reimbursement. 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed in notes.
	
Contingent Assets are not recognised in financial statements but are disclosed, since the former treatment may 
result in the recognition of income that may or may not be realised. However, when the realisation of income is 
virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.
q)	
Government Grants:
	
Incentive received from the Government under sales tax deferral scheme, which is interest free in nature is 
determined based on fair value. Fair value is determined on the present value technique based on cash flow 
payable under the scheme & the same is amortized over the remaining period of sales tax deferral loan.
r)	
Leases:
	
On April 1, 2019, the Company adopted Ind AS 116, Leases. 
	
The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the 
lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Company determines the lease 
term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the 
lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is 
reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it 
considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise 
the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the 
lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate is generally based on 
the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics.
	
The Company as lessee:
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for Land, building, plant & machinery and vehicles. 
At the inception of the contract, the Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease. A contract is, or 
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. For the purpose of identifying if a contract contains a lease, the Company assesses 
whether: 
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset 
	
(ii)	
the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the 
	
lease, and 
	
(iii)	 the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except in case of low value leases 
and short term leases (a term of less than twelve months) wherein the lease payments are recognized as an 
operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The 
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using 
the incremental borrowing rates.
	
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. 
ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. 
Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company 
changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost. Cost includes the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less 
any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses.
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the useful life 
of the underlying asset or the lease term whichever is shorter. Right of use assets are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified 
as financing cash flows.
	
The Group adopted Ind AS 116 –“ Leases” using retrospective / modified retrospective methods as permitted in 
the Accounting Standard..
s)	
Recent accounting pronouncements:
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:
	
i.	
Ind AS 1 – Material accounting policies - The amendments mainly related to shifting of disclosure of 
erstwhile “significant accounting policies” in the notes to the financial statements to material accounting 
policy information requiring companies to reframe their accounting policies to make them more “entity 
specific. This amendment aligns with the “material” concept already required under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
	
ii.	
Ind AS 8 – Definition of  accounting estimates - The amendments specify definition of ‘change in 
accounting estimate’ replaced with the definition of ‘accounting estimates’. 
	
iii.	
Ind AS 12 – Income taxes – Annual Improvements to Ind AS - The amendment clarifies that in cases 
of transactions where equal amounts of assets and liabilities are recognised on initial recognition, the 
initial recognition exemption does not apply. Also, If a company has not yet recognised deferred tax asset 
and deferred tax liability on right-of-use assets and lease liabilities or has recognised deferred tax asset or 
deferred tax liability on net basis, that company shall have to recognise deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities on gross basis based on the carrying amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities existing at 
the beginning of 1 April 2023.
t)	
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
	
-	
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will 
seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the company’s 
accounting policies.
	
-	
The estimates and judgements  involves a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which 
are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023 (Contd.)

West Coast Paper Mills Limited
those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included 
in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the 
financial statements.
	
Critical estimates and judgements
	
The areas involving critical estimates or judgements are:
	
- 	
Estimation of current tax expense and payable	
	
- 	
Estimated useful life PPE &  intangible asset
	
- 	
Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
- 	
Recognition of revenue
	
- 	
Recognition of deferred tax assets for carried forward tax losses
	
- 	
Impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets
	
- 	
Fair Valuation for the purpose of Business Combination
	
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the company and that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The company has therefore not recorded adjustment of taxes/order in books.
	
c.	 MATERIAL DEMANDS AND DISPUTES CONSIDERED AS “REMOTE” BY THE HOLDING COMPANY:
	
	
The Holding  Company claimed deduction under Section 80 IA of the Income Tax Act 1961 in its return  for 
Power Undertaking for Financial Year 1998-99 to 2021-22 and for Effluent ( Water )  treatment   for financial year 
2016-17 to 2021-22. The assessing officer  disallowed the benefit of deductions at assessment stage. Company 
had preferred appeals with Commissioner Appeals and / or ITAT. The ITAT  partly allowed the appeals of the 
company. Department / Company have preferred appeal against the order of ITAT. As advised by legal advisors, 
Company has a strong case / merit for claiming the deduction and thus expects a favorable outcome.
	
d.	 The total demand outstanding as on 31.03.2023 on account of income tax dues is ` 2820.15 lakhs (Previous year 
` 3151.69 lakhs), net of tax paid/adjusted under protest ` 657 Lakhs.

LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT
The Holding Company had entered into a loan purchase agreement with ICICI Bank Ltd. for ` 4000 Lakhs in respect of 
borrowings of Shree Rama Newsprint Limited (SRNL) after sale of its investment in shares of SRNL. The loan purchase 
agreement stipulates that upon occurrence of default ICICI Bank Ltd. will have “a right” to require the Holding Company 
to purchase the loan outstanding of SRNL along with transfer of underlying security by ICICI Bank Ltd., to the Holding 
Company. The outstanding balance as at March 31, 2023 of SRNL loan is ` 2979.00 Lakhs with principal repayment due 
by June 30, 2025. The Holding Company does not foresee any event of default, further the security value is significantly 
higher than the outstanding loan balance and hence no liability is envisaged in this respect.
Note 43
During the year 2020-21, a supplier has made a claim of  approximately ` 3,600 Lakhs against the Cable division of the 
company for alleged breach of contract and had initiated Arbitration proceedings against the company.
The company has received Award dated 16th June 2022 from Hon’ble Sole Arbitrator in favour of it rejecting the claim 
of supplier. However, the supplier has challenged the award in the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi by filing Petition u/s 34 
of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking to set aside the aforesaid award, and the matter is pending.

Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
fluctuation in market prices. These comprise three types i.e., currency rate, interest rate and other price related risks. 
Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivative 
financial instruments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future 
cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Regular interaction 
with bankers, intermediaries and the market participants help us to mitigate such risk.
a	 Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
	
The primary market risk to the company is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments 
to reduce foreign exchange risk exposure and follows its risk management policies to mitigate the same. After 
taking cognizance of the natural hedge, the company takes appropriate hedges to mitigate its risk resulting from 
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate(s).

b.	 Interest rate risk and sensitivity
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to long term debt. The Group has 
entered into various interest rate swap contracts, in which it agrees to exchange, at specific intervals, the difference 
between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon principal amount. Borrowings 
at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. With all other variables held constant, the following 
table demonstrates composition of fixed and floating rate borrowing of the Group and impact of floating rate 
borrowings on company’s profitability.

ii	 Credit Risk
	
The Group evaluates the customer credentials carefully from trade sources before appointment of any distributor 
and only financially sound parties are appointed as distributors. The Group secures adequate deposits from its 
distributor and hence risk of bad debt is limited. The credit outstanding is sought to be limited to the sum of 
advances / deposits and credit limit determined by the Group. The Group have stop supply mechanism in place in 
case outstanding goes beyond agreed limits.
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to `27314.41 
Lakhs and `13,768.88 Lakhs as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Trade receivables are typically 
unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in India. Credit risk has always 
been managed by the Group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring 
the creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. On 
account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Group uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or 
gain. The Group uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. The 
provision matrix takes into account as per the Group’s historical experience for customers.

iii	 Liquidity Risk

The risk management action focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and tries to minimise adverse 
effects. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by 
the Finance department under Forex Policies as adopted and duly approved by the Board. The Group’s approach 
is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due and company

Note 61
In case of one of the subsidiaries, Andhra Paper Ltd (APL), in the year ended March 31, 2017, the Hon’ble High Court 
for the State of Telangana and the State of Andhra Pradesh upheld the validity of levy of electricity duty @ 25 paisa 
per unit by the State Government on consumption of electricity by captive generating units relating to earlier years. 
The said subsidiary (along with other petitioners) filed a Special Leave Petition in the Hon’ble Supreme Court, which 
in the interim, directed the petitioners to pay partial amount without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the 
petitioners, pursuant to which APL had paid `1,502.05 lakhs under protest in the year ended March 31, 2017. The 
matter is pending hearing.	
In view of the inherent uncertainty in predicting the final outcome of the above litigation, the Management of APL 
has, on grounds of prudence and abundant caution, made a provision amounting to ` 3,143.24 lakhs (including 
` 785.81 Lakhs on account of business combination during the earlier period) towards the potential liability in the 
event of an unfavourable verdict in this matter. Additionally, an amount of ` 785.81 lakhs has been disclosed as a 
contingent liability. On the basis of the legal advice obtained, in the opinion of the Management of APL, no further 
provision would be required in relation to this disputed matter.
