Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues:
	
Tata Communications does not tolerate any malpractice, impropriety, non-compliance, or wrongdoing with 
respect to Human Rights and its salient elements. To that end, Tata Communications has adopted an exhaustive 
grievance redressal and remedial framework consisting of its Whistleblower Policy.

defined in the policy, including but not limited to infringement of human rights including privacy rights and 
freedom of expression, disclosure matters, anti–corruption, or any other company matters involving fraud,

normal management channels. The Whistleblower Policy intends to encourage and enable employees and any 
person other than employees to proactively raise concerns regarding any such instances without fear of reprisal, 
discrimination or adverse employment consequences. This can be done through Tata Communications’ “Ethics 
Helpline”, managed by an independent third party which enables a whistleblower to report a potential wrongdoing 
through various channels such as phone, email, web portal, fax, post box.

9.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your entity to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes: 
	
Being a service-oriented organisation, Tata Communications does not typically generate waste as a by-product 
of its processes. The waste generated can be divided into two categories: non-hazardous waste generated by 
domestic activities such as housekeeping and cafeteria operations, and hazardous waste generated by equipment 
which provide services to customers. Such equipment is purchased based on business requirements, and Tata 
Communications relies on its suppliers for delivery of such products and services.
	
Tata Communications aims to reduce the environmental impact of waste by focusing on the efficient and 
sustainable disposal of all types of waste. Non-hazardous garbage is collected by municipalities and authorised 
third party agencies to ensure safe disposal. Hazardous waste is appropriately disposed off through authorised 
recyclers. Tata Communications ensures adequate storage with secondary containments during collection and 
handling of such hazardous waste and ensures proper training of the waste handlers. The scrap waste is recycled 
and disposed through external agencies while ensuring that all regulatory criteria of waste management rules of 
relevant regions or nations are complied with.
