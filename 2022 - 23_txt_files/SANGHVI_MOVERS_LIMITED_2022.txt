1
Emissions & 
Pollutants
Risk
As a crane rental Company, 
the Company rents cranes 
for a variety of projects. The 
operation of these cranes is an 
energy intensive activity and 
generates 
significant 
direct 
and indirect Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) 
emissions, 
including 
carbon dioxide and methane 
from fuel use. Uncontrolled 
pollutants and emissions during 
operation 
and 
associated 
activities may impose some 
legal and environmental risks 
for the Company.
SML is committed to clean energy 
transition with an environmental 
policy. We’ve invested in solar plants 
and energy-efficient equipment like 
air conditioning units, contributing 
to renewable energy and energy 
conservation.

Improve 
Operational 
Efficiency
Opportunity
The 
goal 
of 
operational 
efficiency is to gain more 
with 
less, 
which 
may 
be 
achieved 
by, 
for 
instance, 
using 
less 
energy, 
boosting 
yield, 
and 
using 
equipment 
more 
effectively 
overall. 
Bringing 
processes 
in 
place 
aimed 
at 
overall 
optimisation 
is 
an 
opportunity for companies to 
increase profits as well as 
achieve long term sustainability.
Positive
3
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste is commonly produced 
during Company operations, 
machinery maintenance, and 
administrative 
tasks, 
posing 
risks to the environment, air 
quality, climate, and ecosystem. 
Improper waste management 
can 
endanger 
personnel 
safety and result in substantial 
fines for non-compliance with 
regulations.
SML 
has 
established 
Waste 
Management 
and 
IT 
E-Waste 
Management Policies to promote 
a circular economy. We have

Climate Risk 
and Adaption
Risk
Climate change events pose 
physical risks such as floods 
and wildfires or transitional risks 
such as mandatory renewable 
energy regulations.
Such events can potentially 
impact the business. Hence, the 
need to assess and mitigate.
Our Company has not identified 
any climate risks to our business. 
However, we are actively monitoring 
the 
evolving 
environmental 
landscape 
and 
associated 
regulations to ensure that we stay 
informed and prepared for any 
potential climate-related risks in the 
future.
Negative
5
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
The Circular Economy model 
of production and consumption 
promotes 
the 
reusing, 
refurbishing and recycling of 
existing materials and products. 
The transition to a circular 
economy will affect a change 
in building design and material 
usage. A shift in regulations and 
demand, combined with new 
technology, has the potential to 
reduce costs.
Positive
6
Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk
In a sector with high-value 
projects, 
ensuring 
customer 
satisfaction is essential. An 
unsatisfactory 
consumer 
experience may pose a risk 
to business continuity, while a 
positive customer experience 
can ensure enhanced profits 
and brand reputation.
Ensuring service quality is our 
utmost priority at SML. We have 
an escalation mechanism in place 
to address customer concerns 
promptly 
and

7
Operational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
A significant amount of manual 
labour is required for operations, 
maintenance, repair work and 
other on-site tasks. Due to 
the workforce’s exposure to 
powered haulage and heavy 
machinery, several mishaps, 
fall 
accidents, 
fatality 
and 
injuries may occur. Additionally, 
temporary employees can be 
at a higher risk due to a lack 
of training or work experience. 
If workers’ health and safety 
are not protected, there may 
be fines and penalties; major 
events may result in acute injury 
and potential liabilities due 
to legal or regulatory actions. 
Risks involving health and safety 
can also cause project delays 
and 
downtime, 
increasing 
project costs and decreasing 
profitability.
SML places a strong emphasis 
on Employee Health and Safety 
(EHS) and strives to maintain the 
highest standards of Occupational 
Health and Safety (OHS). As an 
ISO 
45001 
certified 
Company, 
we have a dedicated EHS team 
that proactively addresses safety 
measures at both our offices and 
sites. The team conducts regular 
trainings 
for 
employees 
and 
workers to ensure their well-being. 
We also organise initiatives such as 
Safety Week and safety workshops 
throughout the year to promote 
a culture of safety and enhance 
awareness of best practices. The 
Company has been following the 
due and necessary SOPs in order 
to ensure maximum operational 
health and safety of its employees 
and cranes at the job sites.
Negative
8
Employee 
Well-being & 
Retention
Risk
Higher employee retention rates 
convey good Company policies 
and 
practices. 
However, 
a 
high attrition rate indicates 
low employee satisfaction to 
investors. Ensuring employee 
well-being can boost employee 
morale and reduce hiring and 
onboarding costs.
SML prioritises the overall growth 
of its employees through robust 
people practices. We emphasise 
health and well-being initiatives, fair 
pay norms, equal opportunities and 
extensive 
training 
programmes. 
Performance 
appraisals 
and 
promotions 
are 
designed 
to 
encourage 
employee 
retention. 
Additionally, we organise various 
events such as annual sports events, 
festival 
celebrations, 
trekking, 
health check-ups and learning 
and development programmes to 
foster a positive and engaging work 
environment.

Labour 
Management
Risk
Businesses requiring workers 
on site must ensure effective 
labour management practices. 
This includes the complexity 
of their workforce (size, labour 
intensity 
and 
operational 
locations), the management-
labour 
interaction, 
the 
effectiveness of worker rights 
and their attempts to engage 
their workers. Attrition of skilled 
labour especially poses an 
operational risk for companies.
The Company implements robust 
labour 
management 
systems, 
including clear job descriptions 
and regular training programmes. 
We 
foster 
a 
positive 
work 
culture, prioritise employee well-
being and maintain open lines 
of

to 
address 
concerns promptly.

Diversity & 
Inclusion
Opportunity
A Company’s high diversity 
and

rate 
reflects 
employees’ sense of belonging 
and 
fairness 
within 
the 
Company. Improving diversity 
and inclusion helps companies 
to support vulnerable groups 
resulting in community brand 
image creation for the Company.
The 
Company

measures to improve diversity & 
inclusion.

beneficial 
relationships with those who are 
influenced or impacted by their 
operations, such as customers, 
communities, 
workers 
and

This 
includes 
demonstrating that they care 
about the people whose lives 
they engage with.
At SML, human dignity is a 
fundamental core value. We prioritise 
equal opportunity, strictly enforce 
policies against sexual harassment, 
prohibit child and forced labour and 
adhere to a comprehensive code 
of conduct. By upholding these 
principles, we ensure the highest 
level of compliance with human 
rights standards throughout our 
operations.

the

personal data they collect, 
their exposure to evolving or 
increasing privacy regulations, 
their vulnerability to potential 
data breaches, and their data 
protection systems.

 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
As the Managing Director of Sanghvi Movers Limited, I am pleased to provide an update on our ongoing 
commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles and sustainable practices. We firmly 
believe that conducting our business responsibly is essential for creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.
To drive our sustainability goals, we have adopted and implemented various policies and practices aimed at 
reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainable development. Our focus on energy conservation, 
emissions reduction, and resource efficiency reflects our dedication to environmental stewardship. We have taken 
our initial steps towards embracing clean energy by installing a solar capacity of 120 Kilowatt-hours. This marks 
the beginning of our journey towards a more sustainable future. We are providing our cranes for development of 
renewable energy projects such as windmills. In addition, we have ambitious plans to expand our Wind Power 
EPC business, solidifying our commitment to the renewable energy sector and furthering our contribution to 
clean energy generation. As a part of sustainability initiatives and green earth, we are conducting ‘tree plantation 
drive’ on regular basis. As on 31 March 2023, we have planted more than 2,000 trees at various premises. We 
have also built up compost fertilizer plant at our Registered office.
Employee well-being is of paramount importance to us, and we have implemented initiatives to support the health 
of our workforce. Our commitment to good governance practices ensures transparency and ethical decision-
making across all our operations.
