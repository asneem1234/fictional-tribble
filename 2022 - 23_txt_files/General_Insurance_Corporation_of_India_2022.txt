Annual Report 2022-2023
GENERAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA 
General Insurance Corporation of India - GICI was formed under General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act (GIBNA) of 1972 for 
the purpose of superintending, controlling, and carrying on the business of General Insurance in India. The GIBNA was amended in 
2002, and w.e.f. 21.3.2003, the words “superintending, controlling and carrying on the business of General Insurance” were substituted 
by “carrying on reinsurance Business”.  During the period, GICI was rebranded as GIC Re, reemphasising reinsurance business conducted 
by the corporation.
As the Indian reinsurer, GIC Re provides reinsurance support to the 54 direct general and life insurance companies, both public and 
private, in the Indian market. GIC Re has also emerged as an effective reinsurance solutions provider for international markets and has 
now become a leading global reinsurance company and very aptly called ‘The Indian Reinsurer with a Global Footprint’. 
GIC Re is the largest reinsurer in the domestic reinsurance market in India. It leads many of the domestic companies’ treaty programmes 
and facultative placements (Treaty reinsurance programmes provide support for the risk portfolio and facultative reinsurance arrangement 
provide support for an individual large risk). Internationally, GIC Re is an effective reinsurance partner for the Afro-Asian region, leading 
the reinsurance programmes of several insurance companies in Middle East and North Africa, and Asia including SAARC countries.
