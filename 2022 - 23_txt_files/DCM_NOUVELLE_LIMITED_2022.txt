Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The company aims to minimize all types of waste by adopting Reduce-Reuse-Recycle philosophy. The company
ensures that all the waste collected like Plastic Waste, Battery Waste, E-waste etc. are disposed through authorized
dealers for recycle. Further, Electronic waste management is being done as per the guidelines established in E-waste
Management Rules, 2016.
Further, DCMNVL being a Cotton Yarn Manufacturer, we have no such usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our
products and processes.
Following are the waste management practices adopted by the company:
•
To minimize the usage of paper products, the company has implemented use of reusable cups & glasses for
employees to consume tea & coffee. This step has reduced waste by doing away with the need of paper products
for tea/ coffee leading to less wastage.
•
Encourage employees to switch to reusable water bottles to reduce plastic waste.
•
We have removed dustbins from individual workstations to reduce the usage of Garbage bags.
