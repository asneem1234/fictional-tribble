1.
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
The Circular Economy 
model of production and 
consumption promotes the 
reusing, refurbishing, and 
recycling of existing materials 
and products. The transition to 
a circular economy will affect 
and reduce material usage. 
A shift in regulations and 
demand, combined with new 
technology, has the potential 
to reduce costs.

2.
Sustainable 
Sourcing and 
Supply chain 
Management
Opportunity
Companies that source 
materials sustainably and 
promotes the reusing, 
refurbishing and recycling of 
existing material are often 
viewed as more responsible 
company. It can enhance 
their brand reputation 
and foster trust among 
consumers, investors, and 
other stakeholders. This can 
increase brand loyalty and 
potentially lead to higher sales. 
Furthermore, sustainability 
in supply chain management 
enhances brand reputation 
and customer loyalty. It can 
also attract eco-conscious 
investors, creating financial 
opportunities. Hence, 
sustainable sourcing and 
supply chain management 
provide a strategic advantage 
for textile companies 
navigating a future shaped by 
sustainability.
Positive
3.
Water and 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical input for the 
textile company. Inefficient 
water use can lead to scarcity, 
increasing operational costs 
and affecting production. 
Similarly, waste is generated 
as part of a company’s 
operations, maintenance 
of machinery and office 
administrative work. Improper 
waste handling may contribute 
to air pollution, climate change, 
and various direct and indirect 
impacts on the ecosystem. 
Our company has taken an 
effective approach to mitigate 
water and waste management 
risk. We have implemented 
CTP and ETP plants at all our 
facilities to regulate water 
waste and minimize pollution. 
These practices ensure we 
maintain our status as a Zero 
Liquid Discharge company, as 
we continuously aim to recycle 
and treat all wastewater. We 
prioritize responsible waste 
management to address 
environmental and human risks. 
Our generated hazardous waste 
are managed properly with the 
help of authorise waste handlers. 
Similarly, Non-hazardous waste 
undergoes various recycling 
For example, boiler ash is sent 
to brick manufacturers for 
reuse, while dry vegetation and 
a portion of canteen waste are 
composted onsite to minimize 
our environmental impact.

4.
Energy and 
Emission 
Management
Risk
In the textile industry, energy 
and emission management is 
a significant risk. High energy 
consumption, predominantly 
from fossil fuels, leads to 
substantial greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. Stricter 
environmental regulations, 
increased energy costs, 
potential carbon taxes, 
and public pressure for 
sustainability are escalating 
the risk. Inefficient energy 
use can escalate operational 
costs. An unmanaged energy 
and emission footprint can 
also impact market access, as 
customers and stakeholders 
increasingly demand 
sustainable supply chains. 
Therefore, it’s critical for textile 
companies to implement 
robust energy and emission 
management strategies, 
such as energy-efficient 
technologies and renewable 
energy sources, to mitigate 
these risks, reduce operational 
costs, and improve their 
environmental footprint.
Our company is actively 
undertaking several initiatives 
to minimize emissions and 
reduce energy consumption 
from non-renewable sources. 
To counter GHG emissions, 
we’ve implemented Rooftop 
Solar Power Plants, Biomass 
Co-generation Thermal Power 
Plants, and Wind Energy 
Turbines. These interventions 
allow us to leverage renewable 
energy, significantly reducing our 
carbon footprint. Furthermore, 
we have introduced energy 
conservation measures, 
including the conversion 
of Condensing Turbines, 
initiatives for Compressed Air 
Leakage Reduction, WCS Duct 
Modification, and Auto Corner 
Machine Speed Optimization. 
Together, these strategies 
aim to optimize energy use, 
mitigate environmental risks, 
and promote sustainability, 
aligning with our commitment to 
responsible business practices.
Negative
5.
Human 
Rights & 
Labour 
Management
Risk
Companies focussing 
on respecting human 
rights demonstrate their 
commitment to building 
sustainable and mutually 
beneficial relationships with 
those who are influenced or 
impacted by their operations, 
such as customers, 
communities, workers, and 
investors. This includes 
demonstrating that they care 
about the people whose lives 
they engage with. Similarly, 
Businesses requiring workers 
on site must ensure effective 
labour management practices. 
This includes the complexity 
of their workforce (size, labour 
intensity, and operational 
locations), the management-
labor interaction, the 
effectiveness of worker rights, 
and their attempts to engage 
their workers.  
Our company prioritizes 
human and labor rights, 
establishing policies and 
grievance mechanisms to 
safeguard these principles. 
We encourage our employees 
to raise concerns, fostering a 
culture of transparency and 
open communication. Through 
regular internal and external 
audits at all our facilities, we 
continuously assess and adapt 
to uphold human and labor 
rights. Furthermore, we commit 
to annual Sedex-SMETA-4 
Pillar Audits, scrutinizing labor 
standards, health and safety, 
environmental impact, and 
business ethics. This approach 
guarantees adherence to global 
standards, mitigates risks, and 
promotes a safe, fair working 
environment. Through these 
comprehensive measures, we 
aim to minimize human rights 
and labor management risks, 
demonstrating our unwavering 
respect for these values.

Employee 
training, 
development, 
wellbeing & 
satisfaction
Opportunity
Investing in employee training, 
development, wellbeing, 
and satisfaction presents a 
great opportunity for a textile 
company. Enhanced skill sets 
can boost productivity and 
efficiency, driving superior 
results and competitiveness. 
Fostering employee wellbeing 
reduces absenteeism and 
fosters a positive work 
environment, leading to 
improved job performance. 
Higher job satisfaction can 
result in increased loyalty 
and reduced turnover, saving 
recruitment and training costs 
in the long run. 
Positive
7.
Impact on 
community
Opportunity
When businesses invest in 
the development of local 
communities, they can help 
to create a more stable, 
prosperous, and sustainable 
environment in which to 
operate. This, in turn, can 
benefit the business by 
creating a more supportive 
local economy and customer 
base.
Positive
8.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk
Customer satisfaction is a 
key factor for the success 
of business. Focusing on 
customer satisfaction can help 
in establishing a positive brand 
reputation, which differentiates 
the business apart from its 
competitors and attract more 
consumers. Overall, focusing 
on customer satisfaction 
can help the textile industry 
improve customer loyalty 
and the brand value of the 
company.
To mitigate customer 
satisfaction risk, we implement 
an inclusive, responsive system. 
We have shared our contact 
details with customers to 
facilitate easy communication. 
When a complaint arises, it’s 
logged into our system, assigned 
to a specialized team member 
and thoroughly investigated. We 
strive to resolve issues promptly, 
and maintain transparency by 
updating the customer about 
progress. Furthermore, we 
leverage these complaints to 
identify common problem areas, 
allowing us to improve our 
products and services.

Product 
Design and 
Innovation
Opportunity
Product design and innovation 
can assist the textile business 
to stay competitive and 
relevant in an ever-changing 
market. By embracing new 
technologies and materials, 
textile manufacturers can 
tap advantage of new market 
opportunities and boost their 
efficiency and productivity. 
Similarly, Innovation in textile 
materials and manufacturing 
processes can help reduce 
the industry’s impact on the 
environment.
Positive
10.
Ethics & 
Business 
Conduct
Risk
Textile companies face 
significant ethical and 
business conduct risks, 
including fraud, executive 
misconduct, corrupt practices, 
money laundering, and anti-
trust violations. These risks 
threaten their reputation, 
financial stability, and overall 
sustainability. Maintaining 
high ethical standards helps 
minimize these risks. To 
manage these, it’s essential 
to implement strict ethical 
guidelines, comprehensive 
monitoring systems, and 
ongoing employee training.
To mitigate ethics and 
business conduct risk, we 
have established a robust 
ethics program with a clear 
code of conduct. These are 
effectively communicated and 
integrated into all aspects of 
the business. Regular training 
and education programs 
are conducted to promote 
awareness. An anonymous 
reporting mechanism is crucial 
to encourage whistleblowing.
Negative
11.
Compliance 
with Laws & 
Regulations
Risk
Compliance with laws and 
regulations is a significant 
risk for textile companies. 
This includes a variety 
of local and international 
regulations on labor rights, 
environmental impacts, health 
and safety standards, and 
quality standards. Unable to 
comply this laws can result in 
financial penalties, reputational 
damage, and disruption of 
operations.   
To mitigate compliance risk, we 
maintain a robust understanding 
of relevant laws and regulations, 
conduct regular audits, and 
enforce stringent internal 
policies. Also, invest in ongoing 
training and education for their 
employees and establish a 
culture of compliance.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses are assessed 
based on their performance 
across all key governance 
issues, which include 
ownership & control, Board 
pay, accounting, business 
ethics, and tax transparency. 
This topic examines the effect 
that a company’s corporate 
governance and business 
ethics practices have on 
its shareholders and other 
investors.
The cornerstone of the 
Company is rooted in principles 
such as transparency, 
integrity, professionalism, and 
accountability. The Company 
ceaselessly strives to enhance 
these facets, adopting cutting-
edge methods to utilize 
resources effectively and 
transform opportunities into 
successes. This is accomplished 
through appropriate 
empowerment and inspiration.

7.   	  Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related  challenges,  targets  and  achievements 
(listed  entity  has  flexibility  regarding  the placement of this disclosure)
	
As the director of a leading textile company, it is my privilege to present the business responsibility report, highlighting our commitment to 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). At our company, we recognize the importance of sustainable practices and strive to make a 
positive impact on the world around us.
	
We conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment to identify the key ESG challenges that we face. Our assessment revealed that 
water management, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and energy management, circular economy are significant areas where we can 
make a difference. These challenges serve as our guiding principles for implementing sustainable initiatives throughout our operation
	
Under our company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy, we have identified several focus areas for engagement. We are dedicated 
to eradicating hunger, poverty, and malnutrition while promoting healthcare, including preventive measures. Ensuring environmental 
sustainability and ecological balance is another priority, alongside employment and livelihood-enhancing vocational skills and projects. 
We are committed to promoting education, especially among children, women, the elderly, and the differently abled. Gender equality and 
empowerment of women are crucial aspects we aim to support, along with contributing funds to technology incubators located within 
academic institutions and undertaking rural development projects.
	
To achieve our goals, we are continuously transforming our business culture. We believe in being accountable to the planet we live on and 
strengthening our symbiosis with the community. This mindset drives us to take concrete actions and implement sustainable practices.
	
We have implemented various initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, such as the installation of Rooftop Solar Power Plants, biomass Co-
generation Thermal Power Plant, and Wind Energy Turbines. Additionally, we have undertaken energy conservation measures, including the 
conversion of Condensing Turbine, Compressed Air Leakage Reduction, WCS Duct Modification, and Auto Corner Machine Speed Optimization.
	
At our company, health and safety are of paramount importance. We hold ISO-45001:2018 certification, ensuring the highest standards 
in occupational health and safety. Furthermore, our Denim and Sareri units are SA 8000:2014 certified, and we undergo biannual external 
audits to monitor compliance. We also undergo annual Sedex-SMETA-4 Pillar Audits, which assess labor standards, health and safety, 
environment, and business ethics to ensure transparency and compliance. Additionally, we prioritize food safety and water treatment, with 
the canteen committee overseeing FSI-certified food quality and the worker committee addressing welfare concerns. We also maintain 
safe water supplies through our water treatment facilities.
	
Looking ahead, we have ambitious plans to further improve our sustainability performance. We aim to increase the use of recycled fiber, 
reducing plastic waste by utilizing it as a raw material. Additionally, we will focus on organic cotton to minimize greenhouse gas emissions 
during manufacturing processes.
	
In conclusion, our textile company remains dedicated to ESG-related challenges and making a positive impact. By aligning our business practices 
with environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and good governance, we strive to create a better and more sustainable future for all.

Yes, at Sangam India Limited, we take every concern raised by our employees seriously. We have 
established a robust three-tier grievance redressal mechanism to ensure that all complaints 
and issues are addressed promptly and effectively.
If an employee has a grievance, they can report it to the following points of contact:
1.	
Immediate or Next Supervisor/Head of Department (HOD)
2.	
Plant HR Head/Plant Head
3.	
Function Head/Business Head (FH/BH)
If the issue remains unresolved or the outcome is unsatisfactory, the employee can then 
proceed with the following grievance mechanism:
Supervisor/Floor In-Charge -> Head Of Department -> Worker Representative -> Grievance 
Redressal Committee -> Managing Director
We are committed to resolving or escalating all grievances within 7 days from the receipt of the 
grievance at any level of the three-tier system. This allows us to ensure that employee concerns 
are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.
Furthermore, our HR Department conducts a quarterly review of all grievances from the previous 
three months. The aim of this review is to identify common issues among employees and to 
create an action plan to address these concerns and prevent a recurrence.

on significant risks / concerns 
arising from assessments of 
health & safety practices and 
working conditions.
To ensure the health and safety of our employees, we undertake a range of corrective 
actions in response to identified risks and hazards. 
Recently, we identified a high-risk rate of fire in the Finished Goods Warehouse. To mitigate 
this, we installed fire sprinklers of the MOD type throughout the area. These advanced 
sprinkler systems are designed to provide rapid and effective response to any potential 
fire outbreak, significantly reducing the risk of damage and ensuring employee safety.
In addition, we have implemented a fire alarm system across our facilities to provide 
immediate alerts in case of fire, thus enabling swift evacuation or other necessary actions. 
Beyond the inclusion of the MOD-type sprinkler system, we also have a pressurized 
fire hydrant system, complete with a main pump and a jockey pump, as an additional 
safeguard to address any emergencies effectively. Employees are trained regularly on 
how to respond when the fire alarm system is activated.
Furthermore, to safeguard against work-related hazards, particularly those related to 
handling of chemicals, we emphasize on the provision and usage of appropriate personal 
protective equipment (PPE). Regular checks are conducted to ensure all staff members 
are using the correct PPE. An immediate PPE check is carried out in case of a chemical 
spill to ensure all affected staff are properly protected.
Through these corrective actions, we continually strive to maintain a safe work 
environment and safeguard the health and wellbeing of all our employees.

Briefly describe the 
waste management 
practices adopted in your 
establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage 
of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in your products 
and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.
Unscientific waste and effluent management pose significant threats to the environment 
and humanity. At SIL, we recognize this fact and prioritize the responsible management 
of waste and effluent generated at our facilities. Our waste management practices are 
guided by the principles of waste avoidance, reduction, and recycling.
Within our manufacturing sites, various streams of hazardous waste are generated, 
including ETP sludge, waste oil, empty chemical containers, and MEE salt. We strictly 
adhere to regulatory requirements concerning the handling and management of 
hazardous waste. We apply scientific principles and exercise care at every step of the 
waste management process.
To ensure proper storage and containment of hazardous waste, each of our plants 
has dedicated hazardous waste storage yards. These storage yards are equipped with 
impermeable flooring, appropriate labeling, and stringent storage protocols.
Furthermore, all our sites have obtained authorization from the state pollution control board 
for managing hazardous waste. Each plant diligently complies with the conditions specified 
in the authorization. We maintain and submit all necessary regulatory documents, such as 
Form 3 and Form 4, to the pollution control board as per legally defined frequencies. Our 
hazardous waste handlers receive periodic training on the safe handling and disposal of 
waste to ensure utmost care and compliance.
In addition to hazardous waste, we also manage non-hazardous waste generated at our 
SIL sites. This includes dry vegetation, canteen waste, fabric waste, corrugated boxes, 
stiffener boxes, and paper waste. We handle these non-hazardous waste categories with 
the same level of care, following scientific principles.
For instance, boiler ash is sent to brick manufacturers for reuse, while dry vegetation and 
a portion of canteen waste undergo onsite composting. Other forms of waste, such as 
paper waste and additional canteen waste, are sent to municipal composting sites for 
appropriate treatment.
Through these comprehensive waste management practices, we strive to minimize our 
environmental impact and promote sustainability. At SIL, we are committed to responsible 
waste management to protect the environment and contribute to a cleaner, healthier 
future.
