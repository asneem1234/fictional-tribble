Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
PREFACE BY THE LEADERSHIP
Dear Shareholders, Partners and Stakeholders,
“Sustainability, woven into our Company’s cultural fabric, has been 
beneficial and has resulted in improved performance that generates 
long-term value. We have a clear mission and solid familiarity of the 
path we must pursue to overcome global concerns in our own humble 
way and contribute to the universal agendas of ESG and the SDGs.”
- Anurag Gupta, Jt. Managing Director and Chairman, 
ESG Committee
I extend a warm welcome to you to Roto Pumps’ Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the financial 
year 2022-23.
We began our journey in 1968 with the intention of creating 
sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Ever since, we have 
pursued an inclusive and shared route to prosperity and progress 
and have been practicing the tenets of ESG (Environmental, Social, 
and Governance) much before they came into vogue, focusing on 
building a resilient society for a sustainable future for all.
With the release of our first Sustainability Report this year, we 
have reached a significant milestone that we are proud of. Our 
relentless effort to work in harmony with the environment and the 
ecology has resulted in the conscious and continuous evolution 
of our organisational processes and practices.
Sustainability is a strategic goal for us, and we have concentrated 
our effort on investing in innovation, efficiency, health & safety 
and environmental stewardship, in tandem with industry 
advancements and regulatory requirements. The business 
and ethical imperative for organisations today is to focus on 
sustainability before acting on scale and speed. I am proud that 
Roto Pumps is one such organisation where we have always 
focused on making our foundations stronger for achieving a sure 
and secure impact.
By including our partners and stakeholders in this journey, we 
have directed our efforts not only internally but also externally. 
We have set ambitious aims to further improve our ESG agenda, 
guided by the Company's vision of "Creating Value Sustainably 
Through Pursuit of Excellence and Good Governance." Through our 
strong impetus and deep organisational skills, we are prioritising 
portfolio innovation to meet our customers' sustainability 
requirements, which includes product footprint and lifecycle 
analysis. We are thus also supporting our customers to burnish 
their own sustainability credentials.
We operate from a position of strength as we embark on new 
environmental commitments since our most valuable asset—
our people—are aligned to our common goals. We are proud 
of our diverse and bright workforce, which plays a critical role in 
implementing our sustainability strategy to solve the challenges 
confronting our generation. To that aim, we make certain that our 
human capital is properly nourished, equipped and supported in 
their professional journey in accordance with our leadership ideals.
Our firm opinion is to deliver sustainability practices in response 
to evolving market demands that requires an iron will backed by 
a well laid strategy. Our approach encompasses collaboration 
and innovation throughout our value chain, which includes our 
suppliers, contractors and customers. We are actively putting 
our commitment to sustainability into action, and we are well 
positioned to continue aiding our partners and clients in meeting 
their sustainability objectives.
In conjunction with our stakeholders, our approach is centered 
on skill development, diversity, equality, fair labour practices, 
ethics and governance, gender parity, and inclusive growth. We 
are devoted to aligning our activities with the broader social 
agenda, and we are constantly engaging with local communities 
to achieve social impact through our projects in education, 
healthcare, environmental awareness, and women empowerment. 
Sustainability, woven into our Company’s cultural fabric, has 
been beneficial and has resulted in improved performance that 
generates long-term value. We have a clear mission and solid 
familiarity of the path we must pursue to overcome global 
concerns in our own humble way and contribute to the universal 
agendas of ESG and the SDGs.
We would like to share our learnings through this report as we aim 
to broaden our sphere of impact and inspire the next-generation 
to follow in our footsteps.
Warm regards,
Anurag Gupta
Jt. Managing Director and Chairman of the ESG Committee
