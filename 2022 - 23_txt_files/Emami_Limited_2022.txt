Materiality assessment is the process of determining topics (issues) that can impact economic, 
environmental, social and governance attributes in our business. It has the potential to influence the 
decisions of stakeholders. Our stakeholders are entities, individuals, organizations, and institutions who 
influence and are also interested in our business performance. The preliminary step in our materiality 
assessment is to identify and consult with the right set of stakeholders (or representatives) who can 
provide useful insights for our business. Our materiality assessment process includes –
a)	 Identification of sector specific material topics: The process involves identifying mapping of 
standards like Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(UN SDGSs), International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) requirements, to understand the 
appropriate material topics.
b)	 Identification of external stakeholders: We assess the impact of our business operations on 
investors, customers, employees, community, industry associations, suppliers and NGOs and 
evaluate ways to improve stakeholder value creation.
c)	 External stakeholder consultation: We liaison with external stakeholders and seek their perception-
based scoring on the material topics identified. Such material topics are further prioritized basis the 
importance it holds to each stakeholder group.
d)	 Prioritization of material topics relevant to our Company: External stakeholder responses are 
first assessed and collated in a table and average score of each material topic is calculated based 
on stakeholder scoring. The collated tables of material topics are categorized into low, medium, 
and high category and finally the materiality map is finalized post consultation with our decision-
making committee and senior leadership team.
	
We are committed towards implementing relevant policies to ensure responsible business conduct 
and undertake required sustainability initiatives. We are evaluating the scope of procedures that 
needs to be incorporated and identify key personnel to monitor our performance at regular intervals.

converted into manure 
and utilized as an organic 
fertilizer for plants at 
our site Consumers are 
becoming more aware of the 
environmental impact of the 
products they buy, and they

power usage confirms 
lesser dependency on 
conventional energy sources

cost as it offers clean and 
efficient combustion by not 
leaving deposits on heat 
exchange surfaces

Governance, leadership, and oversight
7. 	 Statement by director 
responsible for the 
business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets, 
and achievements
The issues of climate change and environmental degradation have taken centre stage 
among many agencies and authorities around the world. The need for sustainable 
development has gained immense importance. 
The FMCG industry has witnessed growing environment consciousness among its 
customers, hence lack of ESG accountability and supply chain ethics will taint brand 
image, affect consumer decisions, despite high growth potential. We at Emami Limited 
are guided by a comprehensive set of policies which outlines our commitment to combat 
the negative impacts of climate change and preserve natural and human resources.
As a responsible organization, we are taking concerted efforts and take decisive 
actions that benefit people and planet towards building a brighter future. By taking on 
sustainability commitments and working towards their achievement, we create value for 
our stakeholders including employees, investors, customers, value chain partners, local 
community etc. and positive footprints for a healthy and sustainable future.
We continuously engage with our stakeholders to identify key ESG risks and concerns 
that have become our core focus. We have defined our commitments, goals and targets 
in line with the identified material topics. When I look back on FY23, I’m particularly 
proud of the work we did to bolster our commitment to sustainability and corporate 
social responsibility (CSR).
To preserve our natural resources, we have adopted the principles of Reduce, Reuse, and 
Recycle (3R's) and have replaced more than 25% of primary PET bottles, 40% of secondary 
PET bottles and 50% of LDPE with recycled materials.
We have also installed solar rooftop system at three of our manufacturing sites to 
promote clean energy. Our Effluent Treatment Plants and transition towards Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) is helping us to manage our water footprint. 
The Company’s CSR programmes are focused on strengthening the country’s holistic 
societal development with its thrust in areas such as education & skill development, 
health, water & sanitation, and social upliftment engagements. The success of these 
initiatives lies in delivering impact with optimum use of resources, leveraging strengths 
and collaborating on areas where capacities need to be built. We engage with reputed 
NGOs to carry out our community welfare activities. In the fiscal year 2022-23, the 
company prioritized its efforts on providing support to the 78,000+ beneficiaries in the 
areas of education, healthcare, skill development and sustainable livelihood.
Emami Limited has embarked on a sustainability journey to ensure our transformation 
into becoming a Company of the future, enhancing a sustainable outlook across all our 
businesses and operations and build a better world by taking one step at a time.
While we are proud of our achievements, we recognize that there is still much to be done. 
We will continue to take proactive steps towards sustainability and integrate it into every 
aspect of our business practices.

Awareness programmes conducted for value chain partners on any of the principles during the 
financial year:
Yes. Emami Limited conducts workshops with value chain partners to discuss on product traceability 
and supply chain ethics. We are focussed towards developing awareness on key areas like human rights, 
labour management and business sustainability.
Over the past 2 years, we have embarked on a journey to double the rural coverage from 32,000 villages 
to 60,000 villages as part of our rural expansion and micro-entrepreneur skill building program through 
Project Khoj. This rural expansion is getting geocoded at the same time giving the organization a wealth 
of rural retail level behaviour and buying patterns to ensure higher service performance. The approach 
uses analytical tools to identify the right villages and map them by their coordinates to create a full-proof 
expansion plan for reaching out to the places with the right potential. We conduct one-on-one sessions 
with the distributors to discuss benefits of association, product portfolio and analyse consumer purchase 
patterns.
We have already added approximately 20,000 villages in the last 2 years, thereby taking the total rural 
footprint upwards to 52,000 villages. In FY 23-24, we plan to add 8,000 villages more to reach our target

made by the entity, respectively.
Emami Limited has undertaken various initiatives to drive the overall organizational sustainability 
objectives. In order to lower environmental and social impacts of our products and processes, our R&D 
team is actively engaged in product innovation and technological improvements. The company is 
strongly committed to reduce its environment footprint and promoting sustainable practises across our 
operations. Few such key aspects of our R&D efforts are:
	y
For the production of Zandu Rhumasyl, the Company has developed a heating free process 
to advocate the objective of reducing energy intensity and promote sustainable practices. By 
eliminating heat, the Company is not only reducing their energy consumption, but also lowering 
their carbon footprint.
	y
The company has made changes to Zandu Lalima’s manufacturing process in order to conserve 
water. Previously, the herbs used as raw materials were individually extracted and mixed, which 
required more water usage. However, the Company has now switched to mixing the herbs together, 
which has reduced the overall water consumption requirement for manufacturing the product. This 
change is in line with the Company’s commitment to sustainable practices and water conservation.
	y
The company has replaced sugar with jaggery for the production of Zandu Chyawanprash, Jaggery 
is an unrefined natural sweetener that requires less processing compared to sugar, which is typically 
refined. This ensures minimal processing requirements. Furthermore, jaggery has lower sucrose 
content than sugar, making it a better alternative.

entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system?
	
	
Yes
b. 	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
We have established a strong Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) governance system that is headed 
by the Associate Vice President (AVP) EHS. The AVP is responsible for ensuring the implementation 
of an effective EHS management system across all the Company’s operations. To support the AVP, 
every unit has an EHS Committee that is headed by the Unit Head. This committee is responsible 
for implementing the EHS management system at the unit level, and each unit has a dedicated EHS 
officer to support the implementation of the system. This structure ensures that EHS management is 
well integrated into the Company’s operations.
Weekly meetings by the EHS committee are held to review the EHS performance of each unit. These 
meetings provide a forum to discuss any issues pertaining to environment, health and safety and 
identify areas of improvements. By holding these regular meetings, Emami Limited can proactively 
identify and address any issues through corrective actions to prevent any incidents.
Our EHS officers also conduct monthly internal HSE audits at every unit using an internal checklist 
with scoring. This audit is an important tool to assess the effectiveness of the EHS management 
system at the unit level.
To monitor the progress across the Company, every unit sends a monthly MIS of all EHS KPIs to 
the corporate. The AVP, Corporate EHS Cell, supported by an EHS Executive, conducts monthly 
reviews of the EHS performance of all units, called L1 review. This ensures a clear overview of the 
EHS performance of each unit and helps identify any areas where improvements are necessary.
The EHS performance of the Corporate EHS Cell is reviewed by the President of Operation and COO 
monthly in an L2 review, while the Director conducts a quarterly review in an L3 review to ensure 
that the EHS management system is being implemented effectively across all units. This multi-
level review structure ensures that the EHS management system is continuously monitored and 
improved upon.
Our EHS governance system plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and health of all employees 
and stakeholders, as well as safeguarding the environment by promoting an effective management 
system throughout the Company’s operations. By regularly reviewing and improving the system, 
we can ensure that all our sites are compliant with relevant EHS regulations and standards. We have 
adopted Occupational Health & Safety Management System (OHSMS): ISO 45001 certification for 
Pacharia unit, Pantnagar unit, Massat unit, Amingaon unit and Vapi unit.
