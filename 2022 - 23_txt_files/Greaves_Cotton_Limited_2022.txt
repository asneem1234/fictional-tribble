At Greaves, we are committed to doing our business in an ethical and transparent manner taking into consideration the impact of operations 
on environment, community, employees, customers, investors and other stakeholders. 
This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) is an attempt to disclose our performance against the nine principles of the 
‘National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct’ (NGRBCs). The BRSR targets investors and other stakeholders seeking responsible 
and sustainable businesses in value creation journey. Each principle of BRSR is further divided into Essential Indicators and Leadership 
Indicators. Essential Indicators must be reported on a mandatory basis, while the reporting of Leadership Indicators is voluntary. As this is 
our first year, we have opted to disclose Essential Indicators and a few Leadership indicators, with a commitment to disclose Leadership 
Indicators in the future. The format of BRSR further allows us to make disclosures on standalone or consolidated basis. Considering that we 
have only one Material Subsidiary i.e., Greaves Electric Mobility Private Limited, we included only Greaves Electric Mobility Private Limited 
for purpose of consolidated disclosures. We continue to enhance our disclosures and are in process of developing of systems to capture 
data for other subsidiaries as well.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
	
Greaves does not have process for reclaiming the products at the end of their life. However, Greaves continues to reduce the waste by 
adopting the following process:
•	
Engines are sent to clients utilising recyclable pallets rather than corrugated boxes. We estimate a savings of ~ 220 tonnes of 
waste corrugated boxes annually with this switch to recyclable pallets.
•	
In our electric mobility production site, we re-use the carton boxes for purpose of packaging.
•	
Raw material sent by vendors in polythene covers are sent back to vendors which leads to saving of ~ 200 tonnes of plastic waste 
every year.
•	
The e-wastes such as batteries, computers and laptops are disposed of through authorised vendors.
•	
Hazardous and other non-hazardous wastes are disposed of as per environmental norms.
4. 	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, 
provide steps taken to address the same.
	
No. EPR is not applicable to the Company.
Leadership Indicators
1. 	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for the manufacturing industry) or for 
its services (for the service industry)? 
	
No, we acknowledge the need for a comprehensive LCA, as it provides valuable insights into the environmental footprint of products 
throughout their lifecycle, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, use, and disposal. 
	
We have taken proactive steps to minimize our environmental impact. The implementation of measures to reduce energy consumption, 
water usage and waste generation are few of the Company’s commitment to sustainable practices.
2. 	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products / 
services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same

3. 	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing industry) or 
providing services (for service industry). 
	
Customer safety is of utmost importance to Greaves. Considering the critical products manufactured by Greaves, we do not recycle 
or reuse the input material in production. However, we do reuse/recycle packaging material to the extent possible. For more details, 
please refer answer to question number 3 of essential indicators in Principle 2.
4. 	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tons) reused, recycled, and safely 
disposed of. 
	
Greaves has not claimed the products back at the end of life. However, we do reuse/recycle packaging material to extent possible. 
We reuse steel pallets for engine transfer to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), thus minimizing waste generation. Instead 
of using disposable or single-use pallets, the practice of reusing steel pallets reduces the need for additional resources and promotes 
sustainability.
	
We also extract oil from scrap coolant through a chip winger which allows the reuse of the coolant. This process helps recover 
valuable oil while separating it from the coolant. We not only reduce waste but also maximize the utility of resources and promoting 
environmental efficiency by reusing the coolant.
	
For more details, please refer answer to question number 3 of essential indicators in Principle 2.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and workers? If yes,

(If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
At Greaves, we follow “Pancha Tatva” comprising of five values: Transparency, Integrity, Responsibility, 
Passion for Excellence and Respect, towards all our stakeholders. Greaves has developed various 
mechanisms for grievance redressal which is available for all employees and workers and gives them 
the opportunity to address and report any complaints or concerns. ‘SAMVAAD’ is one such mechanism 
where employees and workers collaborate and connect with each other for cooperation and better 
understanding.
We also conduct periodic welfare meeting, safety committee meeting, ‘Happy to Help’ activity 
for effective grievance redressal and ensuring a healthy workplace environment. Unit meetings are 
periodically held for both contractual and non-contractual workers and employees to discuss any 
concerns or grievances.
We also have a robust ‘Whistle Blower Policy’ in place which acts as a mechanism for employees, 
workers and senior management to approach the Compliance Officer or the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee in situations of misconduct or breach of code of conduct and any other grievances which 
hamper the functioning of the organization. This policy ensures responsible whistle blowing through 
efficient redressal and disciplinary action. 
We strive to ensure transparency and effective redressal through open communication and access for 
all employees and workers to voice their concerns to the senior management.
Besides the above we also have a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy to ensure a safe 
and secure working environment which can be accessed at https://greavescotton.com/wp-content/

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions? If yes, then provide details. 
Yes, Greaves understands the significance of reducing its carbon emissions and minimize the environmental impact of its operations. It 
has adopted the Miyawaki Method, a Japanese technique of tree plantation, through which it endeavours to ensure building of native 
forests and restoration of natural vegetation on degraded land at in and around the sites. Through this method, we have reduced 
our carbon footprint, increased the green cover and have built a forest with a wide variety of species. We continue to move towards 
renewable energy and adopt energy efficient techniques to reduce the overall GHG emissions. A few initiatives include installation of 
energy efficient compressors, air dryers, cooling pumps, variable frequency pumps etc. Additionally, we have installed solar plant at our 
sites in Maharashtra, which will help us to move towards consumption of renewable sources and reduce GHG emissions.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
Greaves understands its responsibility towards the environment and adheres to all applicable environmental laws and regulations. To 
ensure responsible waste management, we have undertaken several initiatives such as: reuse of steel pallets for engine transfer to 
OEMs to reduce waste generation, reuse of coolant from scrap by extracting oil through a chip winger and reuse of oil from testing 
engines through filtration process, which enhances its end-of-life.
We have also implemented several initiatives to decrease the use of harmful and hazardous chemicals in our operations and products. 
One of the methods is to shorten the engine testing cycle time, which has decreased the amount of diesel consumed. We have further 
combined the Heat Treatment (HT) cell, which resulted in shorter shifts and decreased energy use. We also recognize the importance 
of recycling the wastewater by reusing the treated wastewater generated from Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STPs) for gardening purposes.
