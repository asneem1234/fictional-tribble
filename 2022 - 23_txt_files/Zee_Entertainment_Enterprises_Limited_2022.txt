ecosystems, the ‘War for Talent’ 
goes on unabated. The linear

It is crucial for us to mitigate the 
risks of losing our talent and 
the domain knowledge built, 
by deploying multi-pronged 
approaches.
Opportunity:
Identify and leverage various 
avenues to engage with 
employees and provide 
them opportunities within the

being competitive, there 
could be a potential change in

consuming content. This could 
lead to possible decline in the 
viewership.
Opportunity:
Understanding customer 
preferences can lead to attraction 
and retention of a signification 
amount of audience, thereby 
enabling higher viewership.

providing exclusive content can 
lead to revenue generation and 
build a loyal customer base.

remotely, while retaining the same high rigor in operations, governance and security. The fully distributed nature of this model is better suited to

Statement of Independence, Impartiality and Competence  
TÜV SÜD South Asia Pvt. Ltd is an independent professional services company that specializes in 
Health, Safety, Social and Environmental management services including assurance with over 150 
years history in providing these services.   
No member of the assurance team has a business relationship with ZEEL, its directors or Managers 
beyond that of verification and assurance of sustainability data and reporting. We have conducted this 
assurance independently and we believe there to have been no conflict of interest.  
TÜV SÜD has implemented a Code of Ethics across the business to maintain high ethical standards 
among staff in their day-to-day business activities.  
Based on the scope of our review, our conclusions are outlined below: 
Governance, leadership and supervision: The top management commitment, business model to 
promote inclusive growth, action and strategies, focus on services, risk management, protection and 
restoration of environment, and priorities are represented adequately. 
Stakeholder Inclusiveness: We have not identified any discrepancies in this aspect. Internal 
Stakeholder identification and engagement is carried out by ZEEL on a periodic basis to bring out key 
stakeholder concerns as material aspects of significant stakeholders. External Stakeholders 
engagement is at the initial stage. 
Materiality: The materiality assessment process has been carried out, based on the requirements of 
the GRI Standards, considering aspects that are internal and external to ZEEL’s context of the 
organization. The Report fairly brings out the aspects and topics and its respective boundaries of the 
diverse operations of ZEEL and meets the requirements. 
Responsiveness: We believe that the responses to the material aspects are fairly defined and captured 
in the report, in our view, the Report meets the requirements. 
Completeness: The Report has fairly disclosed the General and Specific Standard Disclosures including 
the Disclosure on Management Approach, monitoring systems and sustainability performance 
indicators as prescribed in the Standards in accordance with the Core requirement, hence in our view 
the Report meets the requirements. 
Reliability: Most of the data and information was verified by the assurance team at ZEEL’s sites as well 
as the corporate office and found appropriate. Some inaccuracies in the data identified during the 
verification process were found to be attributable to transcription and interpretation errors and these 
errors have been corrected. Therefore, in accordance with the GRI Standards and AA1000AS for a Type 
2, moderate level assurance engagement, TUV SUD concludes that the sustainability data, parameters, 
information, and indicators presented in the Report are reliable and acceptable. In our view, the 
Report meets the requirements.  
Impact: We observed and assessed that the ZEEL has well-defined procedures to routinely monitor 
and measure their sustainability impact, and they have skilled subject matter experts who are driving 
the sustainability effectively and efficiently. During verification we did not come across any such 
instances or issues where we found anything which has an impact on the ecosystem as well as the 
neighboring infrastructure. In our view, the Report meets the requirements. 
Consistency and comparability: The information in the Report is presented in a consistent and 
comprehensive method. Thus, the principle of consistency and comparability is satisfactory.
