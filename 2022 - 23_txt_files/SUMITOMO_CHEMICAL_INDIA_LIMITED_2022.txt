Company, the Corporate Secretarial team maintains a database of the Directors and the entities in 
which they are interested. This list is shared with the Finance Department which flags the parties in 
their system for monitoring and tracking transaction(s) entered by the Company with such related 
parties.
 
 
All related party transactions are approved by the audit committee. The audit committee reviews related 
party transactions on a quarterly basis. Approval of shareholders is obtained through resolution for 
related party transactions when the amount of such transactions with a particular related party exceeds 
10% of the turnover. The concerned related party as well as all other related parties are debarred from 
voting in favour of such a resolution.
