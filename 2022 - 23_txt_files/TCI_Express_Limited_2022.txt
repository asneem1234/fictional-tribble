1.
Energy 
use and 
management
Risk
Resource depletion: Fossil fuel reserves are finite, and as we continue 
to extract and consume them, they become increasingly scarce and 
harder to access. This leads to higher extraction costs, geopolitical 
conflicts, and price volatility, all of which pose risks to energy security 
and stability. Many energy technologies, including solar panels, wind 
turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles, require minerals and metals 
such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements. These 
resources are not infinite, and their extraction can have environmental 
consequences. Energy production, particularly in thermal power plants, 
often requires large amounts of water for cooling purposes.
Energy Efficiency: Promoting energy efficiency measures can reduce overall 
energy demand and slow down resource depletion. This includes improving building 
insulation, using energy-efficient appliances, and implementing industrial processes 
that minimize energy waste.
TCI Express has implemented several technological solutions to conserve electricity 
and enhance efficiency at its offices. These include installation of energy-efficient 
equipment in office premises, replacing the existing conventional lighting with light-
emitting diode (LED) and shutting down air-conditioners beyond operational hours. 
Apart from improving the energy efficiency in operations, the Company is also 
committed to invest on reduction in consumption of energy from conventional 
resources. The Company focuses to use energy conserving roofing at its various 
sorting centers, which helps to save energy by reflecting light and heat away 
rather than absorbing them. The Company has successfully commissioned 
automated sorting center at Gurugram, which offers automated loading, reduced 
parcel handling and vehicle halting time by 40%, thus resulting in lower energy 
consumption. 
Renewable Energy Transition: Shifting towards renewable energy sources, such 
as solar can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and their associated depletion risks. 
In addition to the 600 kWp solar panels at sorting center situated at Gurgaon, 
which is fully energy self-sufficient. We have also installed a 280 kWp solar panel 
at Pune sorting center, which is partially energy self-sufficient, and these new age 
sorting centers are able to utilize solar energy in an efficient manner and optimize 
the Company’s energy consumption. These solar(s) have been able to generate 
8,04,311 kWh of renewable electricity in the current FY 2022-23.
Negative
2.
Emissions/ 
carbon 
footprint
Risk
Climate change: Climate change presents numerous risks, including 
extreme weather events, rising sea levels, disruption of ecosystems, 
agriculture, and food insecurity.
Economic impacts: GHG emissions and climate change have 
significant economic consequences such as increased costs, business 
disruptions, and market instability.
Health risks: GHG emissions contribute to air pollution, which poses 
health risks to individuals and communities.
Reducing GHG emissions, energy use, and mitigating the effects 
of long-term changes in the earth’s climate and its physical impacts 
on business operations, communities and the natural environment is 
imperative to any business.
Mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and addressing climate change 
risks requires concerted efforts to transition to cleaner and more sustainable 
energy sources, improve energy efficiency, promote renewable energy adoption, 
implementation of effective policies and regulations. By reducing GHG emissions, 
we can mitigate climate-related risks and build a more resilient and sustainable 
future.
In the pursuit of reducing the Company’s GHG emissions, the Company has 
implemented several measures such as:
-  Promotion and usage of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for running its vehicles.
-  Use of BS VI compliant vehicles to restrict its emission level.
In addition to reducing GHG emissions, our Company is dedicated to minimizing 
other air emissions as well. We prioritize the regular pollution under control (PUC) 
and maintenance checks for all our vehicles to ensure that they comply with the 
prescribed norms and maintain minimal air pollution levels.
Furthermore, our Company has undertaken an extensive plantation initiative in the fiscal 
year 2021-22, we have successfully planted 100,019 trees on 82.19 acres of land. This 
substantial effort not only contributes to enhancing green cover but also aids in carbon 
sequestration. By sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, these trees help 
mitigate climate change impacts and foster a healthier environment for all.

Cyber security Risk
The increasing reliance on digital technologies and interconnected 
systems exposes various risks and vulnerabilities. Data breaches can 
result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal 
liabilities. Ransomware attacks, disruption of critical Infrastructure, 
phishing attacks, and insider threats being other critical risks. 
Organizations that fail to comply with cybersecurity regulations 
and industry standards may face legal and regulatory penalties. 
Inadequate security measures or a data breach can expose customer 
information, leading to privacy concerns and potential legal and 
financial consequences for the organization.
By proactively addressing cybersecurity risks and implementing appropriate security 
measures as explained herein below, the Company has minimized the potential 
impact of cyber threats and are protecting digital assets and operations:
-  The Company has implemented robust cybersecurity policies and procedures.
-  The Company conducts security audits and vulnerability scans on a timely basis.
-  It has implemented multi-factor authentication and strong access controls.
-  The Company has implemented virtual private network software to encrypt 
sensitive data and regularly back up critical information.
-  The Company keeps the software and systems up to date with patches and 
security updates.
-  The Company trains the employees in cybersecurity best practices and raising 
awareness of common threats.
-  The Company has deployed intrusion detection and prevention systems and firewalls.
-  The Company engages with third-party security experts for expert advice.
-  The Company has established an incident response plan to effectively respond 
to and recover from cyber incidents.

5.
Customer 
management
Risk
While effective customer management is crucial for the success of an 
organization, there are certain risks associated with it. Poor customer 
management can result in dissatisfied customers, who may express 
their discontent through negative reviews, complaints, or word-of-
mouth. Negative experiences shared by customers can damage the 
organization’s reputation and hinder customer acquisition and retention 
efforts. Inefficient customer management practices can result in 
misallocation of resources.
To mitigate the risks associated with customer management, the Company has a 
robust customer service team that works on various aspects like:
-  The Company has an effective customer service and support processes to 
ensure timely and satisfactory resolution of customer inquiries and issues.
-  The Company has established various touch points for the customers to raise 
complaints or share feedback such as a tollfree number, e-mail, a dedicated 
page on the website, social media platforms.
-  The complaints are recorded in an online application in the Company’s system.
-  The customers are provided with realistic turnaround time, and resolved on a priority.
-  The Company has also established an escalation procedure, which is 
communicated to the customers.
-  The Company provides a feedback link to the customer with every order to 
regularly seek customer satisfaction level and feedback to identify areas for 
improvement and address customer concerns.
-  The Company also provides regular training to its business associates (BA) 
and delivery business associate (DBA), where they are sensitized with basic 
etiquette of handling customers, product handling, customer service skills, 
communication skills, etc.
-  The Company fosters a customer-centric culture throughout the organization, 
emphasizing the importance of customer satisfaction and retention.
-  The Company continuously monitors and analyzes customer data to gain 
insights, make informed decisions, and personalize customer experiences.

practices for the waste categories:
	
a)  Plastics (including packaging)-In order to manage plastic waste in a responsible manner, we have implemented effective 
processes throughout all our facilities. We prioritize the use of 100% biodegradable plastic garbage bags for the 
collection and disposal of both dry and wet waste. At our corporate office, we have established a partnership with a 
vendor, who specializes in the composting and recycling of our wet and dry waste, ensuring an environmentally friendly 
approach. Most of the waste is handed over to authorized recyclers, ensuring that the waste is disposed of in a safe and 
responsible manner.
	
b)  E-waste-We have implemented processes to safely manage e-waste. We aim to reuse, recycle, and dispose of e-waste 
responsibly. A pan-India-based agency authorised by the Pollution Control Board (PCB) is selected for ensuring safe 
disposal of e-waste with minimal environmental impact. This will also reduce waste to landfill.
	
c)  Hazardous waste-We also handle other types of hazardous waste, such as used oil, although the quantity generated is 
relatively small. For the proper management and recycling of this waste, we collaborate with PCB’s approved recyclers, 
ensuring compliance with environmental regulations
	
d)  Other waste-The paper waste is disposed of in a structured manner only through authorised dealers and recyclers. 
Further, at every Corporate and Regional Offices, we have a proper mechanism for segregating the organic and inorganic 
waste, which permits more efficient processing of waste.
4.	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps

The provisions contained under EPR regime are currently not applicable to the Company, being part of the services sector. 
However, the Company’s waste management plan takes changing requirements into account from the perspectives of 
waste minimization and recycling/reuse.

an additional input to the SEMA process -

Those who are impacted;
	
-	
Those who have a major influence on business decisions;
	
-	
Those that we foresee to be reasonably impacted.
