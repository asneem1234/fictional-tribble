Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental 
and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same,

Data 
protection & 
privacy
Risk
The evaluation of companies 
includes an assessment 
of the quantity of personal 
information they gather, 
their susceptibility to data 
breaches, their data protection 
systems, and their exposure to 
emerging or expanding privacy 
regulations.
Veranda has implemented 
a data protection policy 
that is shared with its 
stakeholders and hosted 
on its Company website. 
This policy outlines the 
purpose of collecting and 
using personal information, 
as well as the measures 
taken by Veranda to ensure 
the security of the personal 
information.
Negative implication
2
Corporate 
governance
Risk
Companies are evaluated 
on their overall performance 
regarding important 
governance matters, such as 
ownership and control, board 
compensation, accounting 
practices, business ethics, and 
transparency in tax matters. 
This subject investigates 
how a Company’s corporate 
governance and ethical 
practices impact its investors, 
including shareholders.
Veranda’s board of 
directors with diverse 
expertise ensures proper 
governance and decision-
making. The company 
maintains robust internal 
control systems, to 
prevent fraud and ensure 
compliance. Transparency 
and accountability are 
upheld through clear 
governance structures 
and defined roles and 
responsibilities.
Negative implication
3
Product 
innovation 
and quality
Opportunity
Customer preferences and 
needs are constantly evolving, 
and a Company that fails to 
keep up with these changes 
may find itself losing customers. 
In a highly competitive 
market, a company that 
does not innovate risks losing 
its competitive edge to its 
rivals. By introducing new 
and improved products, a 
company can stay ahead of 
its competitors and capture 
a larger share of the market. 
Companies that are known for 
their innovative products are 
often seen as more dynamic, 
progressive, and forward-
thinking.
