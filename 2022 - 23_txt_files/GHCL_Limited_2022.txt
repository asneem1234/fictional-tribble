Management
OPPORTUNITY
Failure of suppliers to conduct 
adequate Environmental and

poses a significant threat, 
potentially resulting in the closure 
of production units and adversely 
impacting our output.
To mitigate this risk, it is crucial 
for suppliers to prioritize 
E&S assessments, ensuring 
compliance with sustainability 
standards and maintaining 
uninterrupted production 
operations.
Proactive measures in supplier 
selection and collaboration can 
help safeguard against potential 
disruptions and maintain a 
sustainable supply chain.
Incorporating Environmental and 
Social (E&S) indicators into vendor/
supplier due diligence is essential 
to ensure responsible sourcing 
practices.
Evaluating suppliers based on 
E&S criteria, along with regular 
assessments of the effectiveness 
of their E&S systems, helps identify 
potential risks and supports 
sustainable business practices.
This proactive approach strengthens 
supply chain resilience, promotes 
responsible supplier relationships, and 
mitigates any adverse impacts on the 
environment and society.

Energy 
and GHG 
Emissions 
Reduction
RISK
GHCL’s business and operational 
activities face potential impacts 
in the short, medium, and long 
term due to the ever-changing 
regulatory landscape concerning 
energy and greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. The evolving 
regulations necessitate careful 
adaptation and compliance 
to mitigate any potential 
disruptions.
Furthermore, the physical 
impacts of climate change, such 
as altered precipitation and 
temperature patterns, as well as 
increased frequency of extreme 
weather events, pose significant 
risks to GHCL’s operations. It 
is crucial for the company to 
proactively assess and address 
these risks to safeguard its 
operations and maintain business 
continuity. Implementing 
resilient strategies and adopting 
sustainable practices can help 
mitigate the adverse effects 
of climate change on GHCL’s 
operations.
GHCL is committed to reducing its 
greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint by 
investing in technology upgrades that 
promote sustainability and minimize 
environmental impact. Additionally, 
the company recognizes the 
importance of managing carbon risks 
and opportunities and is considering 
the adoption of an internal carbon 
price mechanism.
GHCL will maintain its focus 
on understanding the broader 
implications of climate change on 
its operations and supply chain. This 
includes assessing the potential 
risks and exploring suitable solutions 
for climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. By prioritizing these 
initiatives, GHCL demonstrates its 
dedication to sustainable practices 
and addressing the challenges posed 
by climate change.

management and is committed 
to minimizing its water footprint.
GHCL is steadfast in its commitment 
to reducing freshwater consumption 
and is actively pursuing various 
measures to achieve this target.

technologies, optimizing processes, 
and promoting responsible water 
practices across its operations, GHCL

We are proud 
to announce 
the successful 
implementation 
of our Internal 
Carbon Price 
initiative at 
GHCL. As 
part of our 
commitment 
to sustainable 
business 
practices, we 
have adopted 
an internal 
shadow carbon 
price to guide 
our investment 
decisions across 
all operations.
By incorporating 
a carbon 
price into our 
investment 
evaluation 
process, we 
ensure that 
the financial 
implications 
of carbon 
emissions are 
adequately 
considered. 
This internal 
mechanism 
helps us 
prioritize 
low-carbon 
projects, identify 
opportunities 
for emission 
reductions, and 
drive innovation 
toward cleaner 
and more 
sustainable 
technologies.
GHCL has been 
honoured with 
the prestigious 
“Great Place to 
Work” (GPTW) 
recognition 
for the 7th 
consecutive year. 
Our consistent 
inclusion among 
the top 50 
companies in the 
manufacturing 
sector 
underscores our 
commitment 
to providing an 
exceptional work 
environment and 
fostering a culture 
of trust and 
excellence.
We are proud 
to report a 
commendable

attrition rate for 
FY 2022-23 stands 
at 26%, reflecting 
our focus on 
employee 
retention and 
creating a fulfilling 
work environment.

noteworthy overall 
representation 
of 36% female

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impact or issues caused or 
contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, we have set up a committee for grievance redressal and a POSH committee to help address any human rights-related 
problems or issues that may arise during our operations. Our employees are encouraged to report any incidents of harassment, 
victimization, bullying, or discrimination without fear of retribution or mistreatment. The committee will then take appropriate 
action to formally investigate and resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all parties involved.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues
	
GHCL is committed to upholding human rights and has developed a policy to ensure compliance. Our adherence to this 
policy is of the utmost importance to us. We have established two committees, the POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) 
Committee, and the Grievance Redressal Committee, to address human rights-related issues that may arise.
	
The POSH Committee is responsible for identifying and preventing sexual harassment in the workplace. We have implemented 
a policy in line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act that applies to 
all employees and workers in GHCL.
	
The Grievance Redressal Committee has successfully implemented an Executive Grievance Redressal Policy through our 
GHCL Employee Management System (GEMS) platform. Going forward, we plan to digitize the entire policy. This policy 
ensures that grievances are handled in accordance with established procedures. The committee operates on two levels, and 
if the response from the first level is not satisfactory, the issue can be escalated to the second level with a proper explanation. 
We are committed to resolving issues and ensuring that a final response is provided to the complainant within 30 days.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
GHCL provides equal opportunities for all individuals, and we strongly oppose any discrimination or harassment based on 
characteristics such as race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, origin, religion, age, disability, or sexual orientation. We have thus 
established policies on non-discrimination, prevention of sexual harassment (POSH), whistleblowing, and grievance redressal 
to ensure that our employees are aware of and adhere to our commitment.
	
Our Grievance Redressal Mechanism is available through the GHCL Employee Management System (GEMS), which is 
accessible to all employees for reporting grievances at any time. In addition, we conduct regular workshops, group meetings, 
online training modules, and awareness programs to sensitize our employees to the prevention of sexual harassment in the 
workplace.
	
 We are committed to maintaining a work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment, and we strive to ensure 
that all employees feel valued, respected, and supported.

7.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, we are equally conscious of our carbon footprint and have taken steps to minimize CO2 emissions by implementing 
cutting-edge technology, enhancing the efficiency of existing equipment, and installing energy-efficient lighting systems 
throughout all our plants and sites. We also hold frequent awareness training to encourage our employees across all business 
units to adopt energy-saving techniques. 
	
To meet our Sustainability Vision 2023, we have been steadily increasing our renewable energy portfolio, using a combination 
of wind and solar power to provide a portion of our energy needs while lowering our carbon emissions. Our Consumer Products 
Division is one of our business segments, and solar energy meets a substantial portion of the energy requirement in salt 
pans. Our manufacturing processes are energy intensive and require essential amounts of natural resources. The continuous 
expansion of our businesses has also resulted in huge amounts of GHG emissions. Even as we continue to increase our 
production footprint, we continually monitor and manage emissions to reduce our carbon footprint. With a strong global 
commitment to limit global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement, we understand the urgency and challenge of 
addressing the menace of climate change and have put in place an internal carbon price for relevant business operations. This 
method of pricing will aid in decarbonization by providing financial incentives to switch to low-carbon alternatives.

Implementation 
of an Unmanned 
Weighbridge System”
The system includes RFID technology for the 
automatic identification of drivers and trucks 
and dedicated software for security personnel 
to enter and assign tokens for vehicles to 
enter the plant. The weighbridge system also 
includes sensors and traffic lights for the safe 
and efficient movement of trucks, as well as 
cameras for capturing images and data for 
record keeping.
An unmanned weighbridge system 
reduces costs, increases security, 
improves efficiency, streamlines 
operations, and improves GHCL’s bottom 
line
2.
Carbonation towers
In phase one, a pilot project was undertaken to 
improve efficiency in two carbonation towers. 
Partnering with M/s Honeywell, data capturing, 
and model development was completed for 
these two towers. The pilot model validation 
process is currently ongoing.
In phase two, data capturing, and model 
development will be expanded to include an 
additional 22 carbonation towers.
Digital twin and data analytics have the 
potential to revolutionize carbonation 
tower operations and optimize yield in the 
process industry.

	Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA)
It is an efficient software tool that can 
automate and replicate human activities 
which are generally manual, rule-based, 
and repetitive. We are also in the process of 
developing software to manage the complete 
green field project.
RPA increases productivity by automating 
raw material handling and invoice 
processing, while software assists in all 
stages of greenfield projects.
5.
Tower Installation with 
a capacity of 250 TPD
By controlling temperature in cascade mode 
and modifying the flash drum design, we have 
been able to reduce distiller steam-specific 
consumption. We have reduced excess OH 
concentration and excess CO3 concentration 
in purified brine by fine-tuning lime milk 
through the control valve, flow meter, and cost 
awareness at the operation operator level
Improved efficiency was achieved in 
mother liquor, with reduced steam and 
power consumption, and decreased 
excess OH and CO3 concentration.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster 
management plan? Give details in 100 words/web-link.
	
Yes, we have a business continuity and disaster 
management plan in place, including regular training 
and drills, to effectively respond to potential disasters or 
disruptions at our manufacturing plants and corporate 
offices. and training small groups of workers to execute 
specialised services such as rescue, firefighting, and first 
aid, as well as ensuring that consumers have access to food 
and water. Our business continuity strategy addresses 
sensitive 
corporate 
data, 
operational 
information, 
infrastructure security, and personnel safety. It gives a 
quick overview of GHCL, its context, risk appetite, and the 
requirement for a business continuity strategy. The plan 
is targeted to- contain the incident, minimize causalities, 
and prevent further injuries, migratory measures, quick 
and streamlined relief and rescue operation without 
unnecessary delay, speed up restoration of normalcy, 
and ensure each member of the emergency operation 
including the response team and employees are aware 
of their role in emergency. With respect to business 
continuity, a detailed Business Impact Analysis (BIA) has 
been carried out considering various conventional threat 
vectors and cyber threats. This BIA identifies core business 
functions and critical business sites that are covered under 
the resiliency program. Most of the business functions 
are supported through automation with the help of 
technology. Hence IT resiliency forms a critical component 
of the Business Contingency Plan.

be completed by new suppliers and distributors. We also 
use mechanisms like E&S questionnaires and vendor 
evaluation to monitor supplier quality. All contractors, 
suppliers, and vendors are required to adhere to human 
resources 
policies, 
including 
disciplinary 
practices, 
remuneration, working hours, and health, environment, 
and safety-related clauses in their jobs and contracts. Our 
procurement practices prioritize environmental, social, 
and good governance, and we strive to reduce our carbon 
footprint through our buying purchases.

PRINCIPLE 9:	Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS     
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
GHCL has established a mechanism for promptly and effectively addressing customer grievances. A dedicated team is 
responsible for managing customer complaints, and during the previous year, two grievances were received and resolved in 
the Yarn division whereas forty nine grievances were received and twenty seven were resolved in the Soda Ash division, rest of 
the grievances were found to be not genuine. Our goal is to provide our customers with a seamless experience, and we have 
developed a customer grievance redressal process to achieve this. When materials are dispatched from our premises and 
reach the customer’s location, any complaints regarding wet bags, logistics, or material quality are analyzed by our marketing, 
logistics, and quality teams to identify the root cause. In the meantime, a new sales document type is created for the complaint 
case to track its progress.
	
1.	
ZRCL - Complaint related to logistics
	
2.	
ZRCQ – Complain related to quality
	
After categorizing the complaint in one of the above-mentioned categories, following steps are undertaken
	
1.	
The Marketing team begins the process by selecting the appropriate order type based on the customer’s complaint. They 
then create a return sales order, specifying the quantity to be returned. The team includes all relevant information about 
the nature of the complaint, objective evidence, and other pertinent details.
	
2.	
Once the complaint details have been provided, an email containing the customer complaint form details is sent to the 
logistic/quality team for their approval.
	
3.	
The next step involves creating a new transaction for approval, in which the logistic/quality team enters details of corrective 
and preventive actions (CAPA) as well as root cause analysis (RCA).
	
4.	
In the final stage, the marketing team processes the return request and issues a credit note to the customer as a refund 
for the returned item(s).
	
The teams from different departments collaborate closely with the management to provide frequent updates on processes, 
policies, and customer grievances. This constructive feedback enables the implementation of improvements and ensures a 
reduction in the number of complaints. Whenever a customer complaint is received, it is recorded in our SAP System by every 
Business Manager. The relevant department such as Logistic, Bagging, or Quality conducts a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and 
Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) to address the issue and provide feedback to the customer.

quality control. Our products are subjected to extensive 
testing and quality assurance in terms of safe usage 
and handling. Moreover, our product material, such as 
manuals, brochures, and product packaging, include 
safe-use recommendations. We have used quality control 
tools throughout the value chain to decrease product 
recalls. We conduct a comprehensive study to assess the 
evidence and conduct a risk/benefit analysis of the issues. 
Identifying the issue's root cause whether a manufacturing 
problem or a design flaw is the first step. 
5.

physical asset management ensure we comply with the 
safekeeping of customer data. We are aware that sensitive 
information loss, abuse, or disclosure to third parties, such 
as competition and business partners, could potentially 
have a negative impact on our company's operations 
and give rise to both monetary and non-monetary legal 
challenges. Our IT Security policy clearly outlines our 
approach to data privacy which is accessible to all internal 
stakeholders.

No cases were raised during the reporting year on issues 
relating to advertising, and delivery of essential services; 
cyber security and data privacy of customers, re-
occurrence of instances of product recalls and hence no 
corrective actions were taken. However, we take utmost 
care on safety of products/service and prioritize to educate 
costumer on technical specifications, product usage and 
any health hazards/precautionary measures associated 
with products. We make sure that feedback received from 
our stakeholders are considered in our business processes.
