and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same,

Financial implica-

(Indicate positive 
or negative
implications)
Emission
Risk
Rising power demand has  re-
sulted in higher dependence 
on  costlier coal imports as 
supplies from domestic  sourc-
es are still insufficient to meet 
increased energy demand.
We are already transitioning to lower 
emissions technology by reducing our 
specific energy consumption and in-
creasing our renewable energy sourc-
es. Close to 69 % of the energy we 
use is from renewable sources such as 
wind, solar and biomass.
 Negative
Water &
effluents
Risk
We are dependent on surface 
water for production which is 
dependent on rain. If we re-
ceive less rain in a year, it will 
impact our production and we 
have to buy water from other 
sources.
We are working to reduce our water 
consumption in the processes andin-
stalled water efficient equipment. Both 
our manufacturing plants are Zero Liq-
uid Discharge compliant. Our strategy 
is to treat used industrial water on site 
and reuse it water for process/ utilities.

Health & 
safety
Risk and
Opportunity
We Aim to achieve and sustain 
an incident-free organization
We have health and safety policy 
across GIL and at individual plant level 
and all the manufacturing sites are ISO 
45001:2018 compliant. We have im-
plemented various initiatives to ensure 
health and safety of employees across 
our locations both at operational level 
and managing natural hazards. At 
plants, we ensured this by creating 
task forces to monitor and implement 
health & safety measures going be-
yond compliance and adopting indus-
try best practices
Positive
Human rights
Opportunity
Our strategic people manage-
ment framework is designed 
to create value & execute the 
business strategy. Built on 
three pillars of talent, organi-
zation & culture, we strive to-
wards creating agile & inclu-
sive workplace by defining & 
developing new capabilities 
and accelerating total engage-
ment to build a high perfor-
mance team

Risk
While we have made consid-

specific energy levels and re-
duced our emissions, the ex-
pectations of upcoming regu-
lations is unknown and if the 
guidelines require us to have 
even lower specific energy 
and emissions contributions, 
additional investments will be 
required to comply with the 
standards.
As part of our 2025 sustainability strat-
egy, we are looking for breakthrough 
technology invention to help in energy 
efficiency and carbon capture and we 
would like to move to lower emissions

We have made our sustainable

To achieve that we collaborate

1.	Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board.
Our stakeholders are at the heart of our process of determining material topics so as to collectively address ESG aspects and 
develop lasting solutions.
Periodic engagement with stakeholders helps us to effectively channel our strategies to be able to deliver against company 
wide sustainability goals while following an inclusive, multi-dimensional approach. 
We use the stakeholder prioritisation matrix to understand key stakeholders to our business and the type of engagement to 
be carried out with each of them - consult, collaborate, keep informed & engage. Our regular interactions through various 
engagement modules aid us in collecting important feedback, thereby enhancing our performance and value addition. While 
the kind of our engagement methods can differ from an ad-hoc meeting to long term partnership, it is always driven by our 
core values. Our key stakeholder groups comprise of employees, customers, regulatory bodies, shareholders, team members, 
suppliers, sustainability experts, media, competitors, academica and the communities around operational sites. We use formal 
and informal engagement methods to communicate with our stakeholders through various communication platforms. Through 
this, we map stakeholder feedback and concerns.
Appropriate action plans are also developed to address expectations. These concerns and expectations form a vital input 
for our materiality assessment and in developing short and long term business goals. The Stakeholder engagement exercise 
was conducted using the principles and guidelines from the AASES1000 Stakeholder engagement standard which uphold 
inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness. We abide by the three principles of materiality, completeness and responsiveness 
to ensure holistic engagement and maximum outreach.
