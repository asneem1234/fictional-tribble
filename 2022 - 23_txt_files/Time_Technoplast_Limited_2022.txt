Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Recycling plastic waste within our manufacturing units is a significant step towards sustainable waste management.
By utilizing grinders and shredders, we are able to process and reuse plastic waste, reducing the need for new plastic
production and minimizing the environmental impact associated with plastic disposal.
In addition to plastic waste, we also prioritize the proper disposal of other types of waste such as e-waste, battery
waste, spent oil, and scraps. These materials often contain hazardous components that require specialized handling
and treatment to prevent harm to the environment and human health. By engaging authorized vendors, we ensure that
these waste materials are managed in compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.
