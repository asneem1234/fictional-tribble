Company’s reputation
There 
has 
been 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
the 
sourcing of key raw 
materials through its 
integrated 
facility. 
Over the past 2 years, 
the procurement share 
of raw materials and 
intermediates 
from 
Indian suppliers is on 
a steady rise and the 
direct sourcing of raw 
materials from Indian 
vendors year on year. 
We continuously strive 
to build local alternate

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
We try to evaluate how our operations affect the economy, our communities, and the environment. We continued to execute 
our sustainability commitments, which address the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues impacting our 
stakeholders and the community at large. Our ESG endeavors are rooted in our commitment to delivering relationship-
focused financial services in a way that benefits our communities, instils a sense of purpose and responsibility in our 
employees, and benefits our stakeholders. Our motto, “Nurture the nature in which we exist,” serves as the impetus for our 
constant vigilance to ensure that our operations do not have a negative impact on the environment. This is accomplished 
by increasing awareness, giving employees increased responsibility through training, equipping them with technology, and 
ensuring that there are adequate resources. SMS’s drive for green chemistry is best exemplified by its status as the first 
Indian pharmaceutical business to obtain the Indo-US GCNC award for green chemistry practices. We track our energy 
consumption, manage the emissions and waste generated, and practice responsible water utilization. We have also invested 
in state-of-the-art pollution control equipment to minimize the impact of our activities on the environment. We organize 
tree-planting campaigns and efforts to preserve the ecosystem of the areas where we operate as part of our continued 
commitment to environmental protection.

The potential for environmental pollution prevention is one of the guiding factors in developing the route of synthesis and 
converting by products to useful raw materials for the process. SMS has developed a commercial process to get Neopentyl 
glycol (from waste generated in the process as residue), which is one of the key raw materials in Ibuprofen process. By 
developing the Neopentyl glycol synthesis from waste stream, not only commercial benefit but also environmental protection is 
also addressed.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Water Conservation Measures taken:                                        
At SMS Pharma, we view water through the interconnected 
lenses of effective usage and conservation. We have 
endeavored to improve water conservation by recycling / 
condensate water and streamlining processes. Installed 
200 KLD RO Plant for waste water treatment. Currently we 
are getting 138KLD of water after treatment. Further SMS 
has been planned to recover the water as condensate from 
atmosphere through     while using Air handling Units.
1.	 Enabled to conserve our 
water consumption from 
300KLD to 162 KLD. Total 
Saving Ground Water 
138KL/Day                                                         
2.	 Expected water 
condensate per day will be 
15KL per day.
2
Enhanced the condensate recovery through controls in the 
steam condensate System and increased the condensate 
collection from 45 % to 65%,  By improving the  steam 
condensate recovery, not only   reducing  water consumption 
also benefited with  coal savings by 35 Tonnes/Year.
Apart from water conservation through utilities   we  are 
reusing  16000 Lts of water in stage -2 of Ibuprofen process 
which is being used in Ibuprofen Stage-5   for every batch 
of  of Ibuprofen .The total quantity of water reused by this 
recycling process tuned to 535KL per month 
Resulted in savings of 
makeup water by 20 KL/
day, contributes 20% with 
respect to total feed water 
consumption/day.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 10 of Essential Indicators above, provide details 
of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and remediation 
activities.
	
a) 	 Solvent Distillation System (SDS): The company has adopted and implemented the SDS to recover the solvents from 
mother liquor and SDS well connected to scrubbers to arrest any evolved gases arise during distillation by doing so to 
protect environment
	
b) 	 Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE): to separate the solids from the liquid effluents by which the company become a Zero 
Liquid Discharge Unit (ZLD) and established reverse osmosis system and followed by biological treatment, after treatment, 
we are reusing the evolved water from MEE after condensation.
	
c)	 Material Handling: The Company has implemented various material handlings systems to protect the environment through 
automation of process and auto transfer of input materials.

Energy Conservation continues to receive priority within 
the Company. The continuous monitoring of the energy 
Consumptions across the Company’s locations, has resulted 
in improvement in maintenance systems and reduction in 
Distribution losses.
Steps taken by the Company for utilizing the alternate 
sources of energy: 
a.	 Facility created to purchase power through open access 
during the power holiday time to avoid the running of 
diesel generator sets and saving of HSD. Participating in 
the Open access bidding to get the power in the cheaper
