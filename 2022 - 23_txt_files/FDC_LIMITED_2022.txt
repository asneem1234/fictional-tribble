Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or  an  opportunity  to  your  business, rationale  for  identifying  the  same,  approach  to  adapt  or  mitigate  
the  risk  along-with  its financial implications, as per the following format.

Climate Change and 
Carbon Emissions
Risk
The rise in the greenhouse 
effect and global warming, 
attributed to the release 
of 
carbon 
dioxide 
from 
fossil fuel combustion and 
deforestation, is a growing 
concern. 
FDC 
aims 
to 
operate the business in a 
manner that aligns with 
social, 
economic, 
and 
ecological 
considerations. 
This 
involves 
adhering 
to 
relevant 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
as 
well 
as 
adopting 
pre-emptive 
actions 
to 
preserve 
ecological equilibrium.
We are closely attentive to the 
emerging 
circumstances 
and 
are taking action to reshape this 
situation. FDC is committed to 
enhancing our resilience against 
climate-related 
risks, 
while 
also 
embracing 
the 
potential 
presented 
by 
transitioning 
towards a low-carbon future in the 
pharmaceutical 
sector. 
Notably, 
our waste management strategy 
plays a role in mitigating climate 
change and upholding air quality, 
given that waste is a significant 
source of methane emissions. 
At our facilities, we employ eco-
efficient biomass briquette fired 
steam boilers as our primary 
steam 
source. 
This 
approach 
not only curbs our operational 
emissions but also fulfills the goal 
of creating economic prospects 
for local communities. Additionally, 
we’ve implemented a photovoltaic 
solar system with an approximate 
capacity of 2.5 MWp across our 
manufacturing plants and depots. 
This installation serves the dual 
purpose of conserving energy and 
reducing carbon emissions.

Air 
and 
water 
pollution
Risk
The installation of energy-
inefficient systems could 
result in the dissemination 
of contaminated air within 
the environment. Inadequate 
waste 
management 
practices might lead to the 
generation of both polluted 
water and waste. There 
is a lack of utilization of 
renewable water sources 
and an inefficient water 
consumption 
system. 
Furthermore, the absence 
of 
facilities 
for 
waste 
decomposition 
and 
the 
treatment 
of 
effluents 
contributes to the challenge 
of 
properly 
disposing 
hazardous waste
We 
have 
taken 
measures 
to 
enhance 
energy 
efficiency 
by 
incorporating advanced equipment 
like Dry Scrubbers, Variable Speed 
Drive (VSD) air compressors, and Air 
Handling Units (AHUs). To improve 
air quality, Exhaust HEPA filters 
have been integrated into all AHUs. 
Our commitment to environmental 
responsibility extends to installing 
Dry and Wet scrubbers across all 
air emission systems. Recognizing 
the impending threat of water 
scarcity with potential catastrophic 
consequences, 
we 
closely 
monitor the water footprint of our 
manufacturing 
processes. 
This 
aids us in curbing our reliance on 
fresh water sources through the 
application of the 4R principle: 
reduce, reuse, recycle, and recharge. 
Striving for water conservation, 
we’ve implemented rigorous KPIs 
to diminish water consumption in 
all our manufacturing units. Our 
dedication to sustainability is also 
evident in consistent investments 
for process enhancements and 
the 
modernization 
of 
effluent 
treatment infrastructure. Notably, 
our Roha facility has achieved 
zero liquid discharge status with 
the incorporation of cutting-edge 
equipment for treated effluent 
recycling. 
Our 
commitment 
to 
effective waste management is 
supported 
by 
well-documented 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedures 
(SOPs) 
that 
are 
continuously 
executed and monitored. Initiatives 
to 
reduce 
waste 
production, 
particularly in terms of minimizing 
wastewater generation, remain a 
focal point of our efforts.

Biodiversity
Risk
The absence of energy-efficient 
systems, condensate recovery 
mechanisms, 
and 
devices 
aimed at conserving electricity 
further compounds the energy-
related limitations.
A 
comprehensive 
range 
of 
measures 
were 
undertaken 
to 
curtail 
energy 
consumption 
in 
our operational processes. These 
efforts encompassed optimizing 
systems across various stages, 
including 
intensifying 
greenery 
within the factory premises to 
mitigate air pollution, incorporating 
energy-efficient utility equipment, 
such 
as 
HVAC 
Chillers, 
Air 
compressors, boilers, fans, pumps, 
and motors. A steam condensate 
recovery system was implemented, 
utilizing it as boiler feed water. We 
are gradually transitioning from 
lamps to LED bulbs. A PV solar 
system has also been in place, 
which 
generated 
approximately 
32.30 Lakhs units, resulting in 
savings of approximately ₹ 1.16 
Crores during the fiscal year 2022-
23.
Negative
4
Deforestation
Risk
The 
presence 
of 
a 
substantial 
green 
cover 
around the pharmaceutical 
factory stands as a pivotal 
determinant for ensuring 
air quality. However, the 
predominant utilization of 
cement and concrete in 
constructing 
the 
factory 
premises has the potential to 
contribute to the generation 
of contaminated air within 
the environment.
We actively engage in initiatives to 
enhance the greenery by organizing 
tree plantation campaigns, thereby 
playing a role in augmenting the 
verdant surroundings. Notably, we 
have 
introduced 
approximately 
1000 Teak wood trees within the 
confines of our factory premises. 
Additionally, our commitment to 
fostering a green environment 
is evident as around 40% of our 
factory premises is embraced by 
lush green corridors.
Negative 
5
Energy efficiency
Risk
There is a lack of aspiration 
and expansion in production 
aimed at optimizing energy 
utilization 
and 
elevating 
energy efficiency.
In light of our operational growth 
and 
increased 
production 
capacity, we utilize specific energy 
consumption as a gauge of our 
operational energy efficiency. Our 
commitment to elevating energy 
efficiency at the operational level 
has led to a range of actions that 
collectively contributed to lowering 
the overall energy intensity of our 
operations. This accomplishment 
has inspired us to establish even 
more ambitious energy efficiency 
objectives moving forward.

Waste management
Risk
Inadequate protocols are 
in place for the proper 
management 
of 
waste 
disposal. The facilities face 
challenges 
in 
effectively 
recycling 
manufacturing 
waste 
and 
processing 
effluents. The organizations 
struggle 
to 
adhere 
to 
established 
rules 
and 
regulations 
governing 
waste 
management 
procedures. 
Moreover, 
there is a deficiency in 
providing employees with 
the 
necessary 
training 
regarding the segregation, 
disposal, and handling of 
waste materials.
Hazardous waste is directed to 
authorized 
waste 
management 
facilities for secure and proper 
disposal. FDC has established 
systematic 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) to effectively 
manage waste. Diverse waste 
materials such as waste water, 
glass, plastic liners, fibre drums 
and metal drums are subjected to 
recycling initiatives. This includes 
the 
establishment 
of 
effluent 
treatment 
plants, 
collaborating 
with 
registered 
recyclers, 
and 
involving 
scrap 
vendors 
for 
paper 
and 
plastic 
materials. 
A 
commitment 
to 
minimizing 
waste at its origin is upheld. The 
waste 
management 
strategy 
encompasses 
categorization, 
segregation, reduction, handling, 
and 
safe 
disposal 
of 
waste, 
alongside 
vigilant 
monitoring, 
regulation, and control of these 
processes. 
Stringent 
internal 
policies are in place to ensure that 
waste collection is exclusively 
carried out by authorized third 
parties registered with regulatory 
bodies.
Negative 
7
Data protection and 
privacy
Risk
Computer systems are highly 
susceptible to various risks 
such as potential failures 
and malware infiltrations. 
Despite 
significant 
investments in data security, 
it is challenging to guarantee 
complete 
prevention 
of 
system 
breaches 
or 
disruptions. 
There 
is 
a 
deficiency in establishing 
adequate contingency plans 
and ensuring robust system 
security measures.
In order to proactively address 
and circumvent such vulnerable 
situations, we have implemented 
measures to ensure robust backup 
systems 
and 
fortified 
system 
security. These precautions are 
aimed at mitigating the potential 
risks and consequences associated 
with data mishaps.
