Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative
implications)
1
GHG Emissions
Risk
With an 
increase in the 
manufacturing 
capacity – to 
keep up with 
the production 
demand, the 
GHG emissions 
will go up.
Using new 
technology for 
efficient system 
to reduce GHG 
Emissions
Negative –
The Company may
be required to set up 
improved and 
efficient systems and 
processes to reduce 
the GHG Emissions 
which will require a 
new or additional 
setting up of required 
facilities resulting in 
additional capital/ 
revenue expenditure.

Waste
Management
Opportunity
Risk
HAP has a robust 
collection and 
recycling process 
for plastic. We 
also convert ETP 
scum to compost 
which is used in 
irrigation land
Water being a 
finite resource 
will pose a risk
to the operations 
of our business.
HAP has a 
community led 
water management 
and conservation 
projects
Rainwater 
harvesting is being 
practiced in our 
manufacturing 
locations
Reduction in raw 
water usage in 
manufacturing
facilities 
implemented 
Positive –
We are taking
efforts to ensure 
efficient water 
management 
to avoid it 
becoming
an unsolvable 
issue
Energy
Management
Opportunity
Processes and 
Systems are in 
place to ensure 
maximum energy 
efficiency and 
this will be 
continuously
improved
HAP through
Solar panels, Wind 
mills,  LEDs and 
natural lighting  
manage energy 
consumption 
efficiently.
Positive –
Any cost incurred for 
improving the energy 
management system 
will fetch positive 
outcomes and reduced 
cost in the long run
5
Employee
Health and
Safety
Risk
This can lead to 
decreased 
productivity
Many efforts and 
initiatives have 
been put in place 
to ensure 
employee health 
and safety. 
Neutral –
Immediate incurring of 
expenditure on this 
count will result in 
financial outgo. But,
Any cost incurred 
towards employee 
health and safety will 
yield positive results in 
the long term
Better usage 
of our waste 
segregation
 and collection 
processes to 
improve the 
efficiency of 
the process
Positive –
The waste generated 
(scum) is used back 
in our land. Plastic 
recycling reduces
 further costs on plastic.
