Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Our company's complaint resolution process is aimed at providing customer satisfaction. Upon receiving a complaint through 
various channels such as verbal, written, or email communication, our Customer Technical Service (CTS) team reviews the product 
details using our comprehensive traceability system which communicates the lot number, date of production, etc. and initiates 
a comprehensive inquiry, including on-site visits and trials if necessary. Any relevant samples are sent to our plant for detailed 
analysis. Based on the findings, appropriate solutions are proposed, and the customer is informed of the results. In instances 
where the material does not meet our standards, provisions for goods return or claims are promptly managed. The entire process 
emphasizes transparent communication, thorough investigation, and timely resolution, reflecting our unwavering commitment to 
quality and customer satisfaction.

In alignment with our commitment to maintain the utmost

comprehensive cyber risk management policy that adheres 
to industry best practices and regulatory standards. Here is 
an overview of our core cybersecurity strategies:
1. 	 Firewall Management: Utilizing advanced Dell Sonic 
Firewall devices, we have updated our firewalls with 
the latest anti-virus packages. These are configured 
with stringent policies to restrict both external and 
internal access, with WAN policies explicitly limiting 
external accessibility.
2. 	 Network Configuration: Our network leverages 
MPLS connectivity and Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
implementations across various locations, thereby 
ensuring secure and seamless access to data and our 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.
3. 	 Malware Defense: We have positioned our servers 
behind firewalls with updated anti-virus software 
capable of scanning and neutralizing a wide spectrum 
of malicious threats, including Malware, Ransomware, 
and various other viruses.
4. 	 Data Backup and Recovery: Comprehensive in-house 
data secure management is maintained, with backups 
conducted bi-daily and redundant copies stored on 
Microsoft's Azure Servers.
5. 	 Technical Team Oversight: A dedicated and experienced 
technical team is in place to manage the firewalls, 
servers, and network infrastructure.
6. 	 Mobile 
Device 
Management 
(MDM): 
The 
implementation of MDM ensures that emails are 
configured by the IT team exclusively on senior officers' 
devices, following precise management guidelines.
7. 	 Domain Policy Enforcement: We employ stringent 
Domain Group Policies to restrict users from attaching 
unauthorized mobile devices, and to govern Internet 
usage across the organization.
8.	
Email Security: Utilization of Microsoft's O365 
suite provides robust virus and spam management 
capabilities, enhancing email security.
9. 	 IT Department Security: The IT department across all 
locations is safeguarded through restricted access to 
authorized personnel only, further mitigating potential 
internal threats.
10. 	Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: Our cyber 
risk management policy ensures compliance with all 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, providing 
an additional layer of assurance to our investors.
	
These advanced technical implementations underline 
our robust approach to cybersecurity, emphasizing 
both proactive and reactive strategies to safeguard the 
integrity, availability, and confidentiality of our digital 
assets. We continually assess and update our security 
posture to align with emerging threats and technological 
advancements, reflecting our unwavering commitment 
to protect shareholder value and uphold our reputation 
as a secure and trustworthy organization.
