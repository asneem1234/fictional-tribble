opportunity to become self-sufficient members of society. We are committed to build an accessible inclusive 
workplace and welcome the skills and talent of differently abled people. Over the year, we have identified appropriate 
roles to onboard more differently abled team members through our inclusive hiring practices. We are working 
progressively to increase their participation in the organization and making our physical and digital infrastructure 
accessible by auditing the existing facilities across the country as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. 
These facilities have been made accessible by altering door width to 900 mm, installing hand grabs in restrooms, 
fire exit signage’s, portable ramps, lift etc. wherever possible. We ensure that our associates have opportunities to 
perform their best in an inclusive workplace which doesn’t discriminate based on physical ability thereby foster a 
culture of mutual respect, growth and equal opportunities for all.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link  :
	
The company has developed a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) specifically designed for its IT Services. 
The primary objective of this plan is to enable seamless operations from an alternate location in the event of any 
unforeseen circumstances or disruptions at the primary location.
	
When the Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan is invoked, the company's IT systems seamlessly transition to the DR facility, 
which is strategically situated in a different seismic zone. This geographical separation enhances the resilience and 
stability of the IT infrastructure. The BCP plan encompasses several key objectives:
	
i.	
Timely Business Recovery: The plan aims to recover business operations within the agreed-upon timeframe as 
per the policy terms. This ensures minimal disruption and allows the company to resume operations efficiently.
	
ii.	
Continuous IT System Functionality: The BCP plan ensures that the IT systems continue to operate smoothly 
from the alternate location until the primary location is fully restored. This uninterrupted availability of IT services 
helps maintain business continuity and minimize the impact on critical operations.
	
iii.	 Crisis Response Guidelines: The plan provides detailed guidelines on how the company should respond during 
times of crisis. These guidelines assist in managing and mitigating the potential risks and challenges associated 
with disruptive events. 
8.	 Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard:
	
While the current implementation of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) principles 
focuses on the company itself, the organization is strive to expanding its scope to include its Value Chain Partners. 
This strategic approach reflects the company's future aspirations to measure and mitigate environmental impacts 
throughout its value chain.
9.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for 
environmental impacts:
	
During the period under review, the implementation of the BRSR principles focused solely on the company itself, 
and no assessment was conducted for the value chain partners specifically in relation to environmental aspects. 
However, the Company recognizes the importance of extending the assessment to its value chain partners in order 
to comprehensively address environmental impacts.
