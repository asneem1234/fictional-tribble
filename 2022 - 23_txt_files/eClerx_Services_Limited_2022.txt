Yes, we have a Grievance handling policy. The process of Grievance redressal is

followed by investigation of grievance. After investigation comes closure of 
grievance and implementation of recommendations. Last stage is appeal 
against the decision where If an employee (the complainant or defendant) is 
dissatisfied with the final decision he / she can appeal the same to the Vertical 
Head and HR Head of eClerx. If at any point during the investigation it is 
found and established that the raised grievance was fabricated and had been 
raised with the intent of malice, strict punitive action will be taken against the 
employee as approved jointly by the Head of HR and Vertical Head.
