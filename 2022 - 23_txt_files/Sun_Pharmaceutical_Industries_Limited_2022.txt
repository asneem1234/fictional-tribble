Director’s Message
Dear Stakeholders,
I am extremely pleased to present our Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for 
FY 2022-23, which highlights our steadfast commitment 
to delivering sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
Our commitment to excellence extends beyond the 
traditional bounds of business to encompass environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) parameters. We have 
incorporated sustainability principles in our business from 
the outset and have built a strong foundation for creating 
a sustainable future.
As part of our commitment to sustainable development, 
we recognise the importance of transparency in our 
communication with stakeholders. We believe that the 
BRSR is one of the essential tools to provide an accurate and 
detailed account of our corporate responsibility initiatives, 
sustainability measures, and overall performance. This 
report demonstrates our efforts to integrate sustainability 
into our everyday operations while providing a holistic view 
of our ESG performance.
Our corporate governance framework is an integral 
factor for driving the best governance practices across 
our businesses, enabling sustainable outcomes for all our 
stakeholders. The Board has oversight through various 
committees focussing on different aspects of responsible 
business practices as part of our corporate governance 
framework. We have adopted multiple policies to facilitate 
the implementation of these practices. We also employ 
a secure grievance redressal and global whistle blower 
mechanism for our stakeholders, enabling us to uphold 
our values and highest standards of corporate governance. 
To enhance transparency, several of our Company policies 
and redressal mechanisms are publicly available on our 
corporate website. Furthermore, as a member of the United 
Nations Global Compact (UNGC), we support the 10 
principles covering human rights, labour, environment and 
anti-corruption and further we are committed to ensure that 
these principles are a part of our overall business strategy.
Our approach to workforce well-being and community 
upliftment emphasises our commitment to caring for 
people, communities, and the planet. Our strong workforce 
of 24,767 employees (permanent and contractual) 
with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (SPIL), the 
standalone entity, is essential to realising our vision. 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
We take a systemic approach to create a conducive working 
environment for employees through training and inclusive 
policies that foster employee well-being and resource 
development. Our company has received the “Great Place 
To Work” certification in India, reflecting an inclusive work 
culture and positive people practices.
As a responsible Company, we are committed to delivering 
social impact through a well-defined CSR strategy. Our CSR 
initiatives demonstrate our strong commitment towards 
social causes and responsibilities. Our CSR initiatives 
in FY 2022-23 included programs covering healthcare, 
education, rural development, environment conservation, 
drinking water and disaster relief.
As a leading global generic pharmaceutical company, we 
enable access to medical products through our global 
presence in over 100 countries and a portfolio of 1,000+ 
products spanning across multiple therapeutic segments.
We are committed to addressing the impact of climate 
change through strategic actions to manage and mitigate 
carbon emissions associated with our operations and by 
assessing climate risk exposure. Our climate change action 
plans are in line with Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs) and Paris Agreement. We are also signatory to India 
CEO forum on Climate Change. In the near future, we plan 
to initiate a climate risk assessment as per the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) protocol. 
We are also planning to carry out Biodiversity assessment 
for some of our manufacturing locations. With 2020 as 
the baseline year, we have set targets for reducing Scope 
1 and Scope 2 emissions by 35% by 2030, reducing water 
consumption by 10% by 2025, and disposing of 30% of 
hazardous waste through co-processing by 2025. We have 
a comprehensive roadmap for achieving these targets, 
including energy, water, and waste management plans and 
corresponding implementation and integration strategies.
While we continue to integrate sustainability principles into 
our operations, and deliver on our promises of sustainable 
value creation, we welcome your valuable feedback in order 
to improve our sustainability performance.

Sailesh Desai

5.
Human Capital 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Human Capital 
Development pertains to talent 
management initiatives, including 
talent acquisition, retention, 
development, employee 
well-being and satisfaction. 
As our business is dependent 
on the well-being of our 
people, failure to meet/exceed 
employee expectations may 
have an adverse impact on the 
Company's employee retention 
rate, productivity, and business 
continuity.
Opportunity: The Company's 
efforts to improve employee 
welfare and development 
directly demonstrates its focus 
on human capital development. 
This facilitates retention and 
attracts the right talent, which 
drives productivity, innovation, 
long term growth of the business 
and leads to value creation for all 
stakeholders.
1.	
We have multiple initiatives 
to attract and retain talent 
through development programs 
encompassing global talent 
management, competitive 
remuneration, inclusive work 
culture and other employee 
benefits programs.
2.	
Formal succession planning

satisfaction rate. These metrics 
demonstrate the Company’s 
efforts to foster a healthy work 
environment and reflects a 
proactive strategy for workforce 
development, which is imperative 
for long term growth and 
sustainability of the business.
Negative: Failure to cater to 
employee expectations could 
have negative long-term effects 
on employee productivity 
and adversely impact the 
Company's growth.
6.
Access to and 
Affordability 
of Medicines
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Addressing impediments 
related to product portfolio, 
product accessibility, and 
pricing, is important for the 
pharmaceutical sector. Lack of 
access to medicines owing to 
pricing and availability has a 
negative impact on the society’s 
access to medicines and may 
create challenges in aligning 
with the Company’s vision and 
long-term growth potential.
Opportunity: Given our strong 
generic and specialty product 
portfolio, coupled with our global 
presence, the company is well 
positioned to facilitate access to 
medicines for its patients across 
the world, and meet the growing 
demand for pharmaceutical 
products.

that are both easily accessible 
and reasonably priced. These 
products enable us to cater to 
unmet patient needs and also 
facilitates access for low and 
middle income countries.
Negative: In the long run, the 
Company's brand value and 
long-term growth may be 
negatively impacted in case of 
inaccessibility of its products and 
inability to expand geographically.
7.
Environmental 
Impact 
Management
Risk
Risk: Management of water 
and waste are critical issues 
for the company to create a 
positive environmental footprint. 
Focused efforts for efficient 
water usage and reduced waste 
generation and proper disposal 
are imperative to demonstrate 
the company’s commitment 
to a sustainable future and a 
healthy planet.
1.	
The Company continuously 
identifies opportunities to manage 
its environmental impact. We 
have established targets for 
water conservation and waste 
management. We have a target to 
reduce water consumption by 10% 
by 2025 and 30% of hazardous

our performance on water and 
waste parameters. We are focusing 
on efficient water consumption, 
reducing water withdrawal and 
increasing water recovery. For waste 
management, we are focusing on 
increasing the share of recycling and 
reuse within our own operations, and 
co-processing of hazardous waste.
Negative: Failure to manage 
environmental impacts can lead 
to adverse legal, regulatory and 
financial consequences, loss of 
reputation and stakeholder trust, 
ultimately leading to a loss of 
license to operate.

Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Ineffective management of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
may expose the company to 
climate related physical and 
transition risks which might lead 
to disruption of operations and 
affect business continuity.
Opportunity: Adapting new low 
carbon technologies may unlock 
opportunities for more efficient 
manufacturing processes 
and will contribute towards 
business resilience.
1.	
The Company has taken a GHG 
reduction target to reduce 35% 
GHG emissions (covering scope 1 
and scope 2) by 2030.
2.	
We are also conducting climate 
risk assessment across our 
operations to evaluate physical 
and transitionary risks.
3.	
We are continuously exploring 
avenues to reduce our reliance on 
fossil fuels in our operations by 
increasing the share of biomass, 
procurement of renewable 
energy and implementing energy 
efficiency initiatives to optimise 
our energy consumption.
Negative: Potential immediate 
physical risks to our operations 
may damage our assets, which 
in turn, could lead to business 
interruptions and increased 
expenses for repairs and 
restoration of damaged sites. 
The transition risks associated 
with climate change could also 
result in more stringent regulations 
in the countries of our operations 
and exports, leading to higher 
compliance costs or investment 
costs in newer technologies.
Failure to adapt to adverse 
impacts of climate can also 
lead to loss of reputation and 
stakeholder trust.
Positive: Working towards 
climate change mitigation and 
adaptation may offer businesses 
opportunities to take advantage 
of emerging technologies 
and more efficient means 
of production.
9.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusivity
Opportunity
Opportunity: Diversity, inclusion 
and providing equal opportunities 
improves the company’s 
performance by bringing together 
people with varied knowledge, 
views, and perspectives. This 
results in identifying innovative 
ideas and improves talent 
attraction and retention at the 
workplace.
-
Positive: A diverse and inclusive 
workforce from different genders, 
age, ethnicities, and special 
abilities enables a productive 
environment and drives 
innovative thinking, helping 
in employee engagement and 
unlocking higher efficiencies.
10.
Sustainable 
Supply 
Chain and 
Responsible 
Procurement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Due to the pharmaceutical 
industry’s reliance on the 
supply chain for critical raw 
materials and last mile delivery 
of medicines, any disruption of 
supply chain may impact business 
continuity and/or product quality. 
Non-substitutable suppliers also 
pose a risk in terms of continued 
availability of critical raw 
materials.
The Company requires its 
supply chain partners to adhere 
to its ESG principles and any 
non-adherence may result in a 
disruption of supplies.
Opportunity: Supply chain 
plays a determining role in the 
sustainability of an organisation. 
Integrating suppliers into the ESG 
journey helps the Company to 
develop a resilient supply chain 
and cascade a virtuous cycle 
of environmentally and socially 
responsible behaviour across the 
value chain.
1.	
We are continuously exploring 
opportunities to de-risk the 
supply chain by evaluating 
alternate suppliers for critical or 
non-substitutable raw materials.
2.	
As part of the Company’s Supplier 
Code of Conduct, the suppliers are 
expected to adhere to the Company’s 
ESG standards.
3.	
The Company has a high focus on 
developing quality products and 
safety of consumers. The quality of 
raw materials for our production 
process is ensured by conducting 
periodic supplier audits.
Negative: Long-term commercial 
partnerships with suppliers may 
be impacted if standards related 
to various social, environmental 
and safety aspects are not 
complied with by suppliers, 
leading to loss of business value.
Non-substitutable and critical raw 
material suppliers may impact 
the business in case of any 
unforeseen disruptions.
Positive: The Company's ability 
to deal with supply chain 
disruptions brought on by 
unprecedented circumstances is 
ensured by responsible supply 
chain practices. In addition, the 
Company's adherence to its 
responsible sourcing enhances 
its social and environmental 
performance.
Assessing alternate suppliers may 
also help reduce risk exposure 
and open access to previously 
unexplored suppliers for raw 
materials. It may lead to discovery 
of local suppliers, which reduces 
environmental footprint and 
may result in better control over 
evaluation of supplier practices.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk: Occupational health and 
safety is a vital component of 
the Company’s commitment 
towards providing a safe and 
secure working environment. 
Ineffectiveness of the current 
Health and Safety management 
programs may lead to a large 
number of health and safety 
incidents.
1.	
The company has a strong 
Environment Health and Safety (EHS) 
management system that includes 
regular internal and external audits 
of its EHS practices.
2.	
Our risk assessment methodology 
and safety practices are based on 
guiding principles of our Process 
Safety Management system which 
adds cohesiveness to our health and 
safety approach from the aspects 
of risk assessment and working 
conditions.
3.	
Adoption of a detailed corrective 
action plan post the identification 
of hazards and assessment of safety 
incidents help in preventing any such 
instances in the future.
Negative: Frequent health 
and safety incidents will have 
a negative influence on the 
Company’s performance in terms 
of both safety and workforce 
well-being. This will impact the 
brand image, reputation and the 
Company’s ability to attract and 
retain talent.
12.
Ethical Clinical 
Trials and 
Animal Testing
Risk
Risk: Addressing risks associated 
with clinical trials and animal 
testing is critical to demonstrate 
the Company’s commitment to 
responsible research practices, 
especially around the ethical and 
safety related concerns of trials 
on human subjects and animal 
testing. Adverse events related 
to research practices can cause 
delays in product development 
and lead to financial losses and 
negative public perception.
1.	
The Company complies with all 
relevant regulatory requirements 
governing clinical trials and animal 
testing. We have dedicated teams 
responsible for ensuring adherence 
to these regulations, which involve 
obtaining necessary approvals, 
permits, and maintaining thorough 
documentation.
2.	
We also implement robust quality 
control and safety measures 
throughout the research process. 
This involves monitoring and auditing 
the conduct of clinical trials, data 
collection, and analysis to ensure 
accuracy, reliability, and compliance 
with relevant standards.
3.	
Long term safety studies are 
undertaken for some of our 
innovative specialty products, 
post commercialisation, in order 
to evaluate and measure safety 
parameters over a longer time 
horizon.
4.	
On certain projects we collaborate 
with academic institutions, research 
organisations, and regulatory 
agencies to share knowledge, 
expertise, and resources. Such 
collaborations also enable collective 
efforts, checks and balances to 
enhance the quality and ethical 
standards of clinical trials and 
animal testing.
Negative: Failure to comply with 
guidelines and regulations of 
clinical trials and animal testing 
can undermine the efficacy and 
safety of the Company’s clinical 
trials. It may also have an adverse 
regulatory/legal impact, lead to 
financial damages and reputation 
loss and have a negative impact 
on participant’s health and safety. 
Delays at any stage can also 
prolong the overall timeline for 
drug development, leading to 
increased costs.
13.
Social Impact 
through 
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Opportunity: By aligning CSR 
programs with the needs of the 
community, through impact 
assessments and stakeholder 
engagement sessions, the 
Company focuses on creating an 
environment of mutual trust with 
the community. This will help in 
ensuring a long-term beneficial 
relationship with the community 
and enhance the social 
positioning of the Company.
-
Positive: The Company's 
perception among the local 
community members is 
enhanced by its contributions 
to the community's upliftment 
through various initiatives and 
partnerships that focus on health, 
education, rural infrastructure 
development, sanitation, and 
environment conservation 
among others. These efforts 
also help to promote positive 
social outcomes.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The Company has a comprehensive complaint management process to facilitate timely redressal of the product quality 
complaints. Once a product quality complaint is received, either directly by the Company or through a third-party 
entity (appointed to handle product complaints), and registered in the Company’s system, it is acknowledged, and a 
preliminary assessment is undertaken. In certain markets, based on local requirements, a Field Alert Report (FAR) may 
be filed for the complaint depending on its nature and severity. Along with the initial evaluation, a follow-up is initiated 
for requesting the complaint sample and any additional information to facilitate the preliminary assessment and the 
investigation. The initial risk assessment and the investigative process proceeds concurrently with the follow-up. 
A remedial action plan is launched after the investigation is completed and the root cause is determined. A complaint 
summary report is also prepared at the same time. The complaint is finally closed after a final risk assessment 
is completed and a response is delivered to the complainant. Any market actions for the impacted product are 
considered and may be communicated with the local regulatory authorities depending on local requirements.

incident, including employing appropriate containment protocols to mitigate the threat, and enhancing security 
measures and utilising global cyber security experts to ensure the integrity of the Company’s IT systems’ 
infrastructure and data. As part of the containment measures, the Company proactively isolated its network and

Director’s Message
Dear Stakeholders,
I am extremely pleased to present our Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for 
FY 2022-23, which highlights our steadfast commitment 
to delivering sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
Our commitment to excellence extends beyond the 
traditional bounds of business to encompass environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) parameters. We have 
incorporated sustainability principles in our business from 
the outset and have built a strong foundation for creating 
a sustainable future.
As part of our commitment to sustainable development, 
we recognise the importance of transparency in our 
communication with stakeholders. We believe that the 
BRSR is one of the essential tools to provide an accurate and 
detailed account of our corporate responsibility initiatives, 
sustainability measures, and overall performance. This 
report demonstrates our efforts to integrate sustainability 
into our everyday operations while providing a holistic view 
of our ESG performance.
Our corporate governance framework is an integral 
factor for driving the best governance practices across 
our businesses, enabling sustainable outcomes for all our 
stakeholders. The Board has oversight through various 
committees focussing on different aspects of responsible 
business practices as part of our corporate governance 
framework. We have adopted multiple policies to facilitate 
the implementation of these practices. We also employ 
a secure grievance redressal and global whistle blower 
mechanism for our stakeholders, enabling us to uphold 
our values and highest standards of corporate governance. 
To enhance transparency, several of our Company policies 
and redressal mechanisms are publicly available on our 
corporate website. Furthermore, as a member of the United 
Nations Global Compact (UNGC), we support the 10 
principles covering human rights, labour, environment and 
anti-corruption and further we are committed to ensure that 
these principles are a part of our overall business strategy.
Our approach to workforce well-being and community 
upliftment emphasises our commitment to caring for 
people, communities, and the planet. Our strong workforce 
of 24,767 employees (permanent and contractual) 
with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (SPIL), the 
standalone entity, is essential to realising our vision. 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
We take a systemic approach to create a conducive working 
environment for employees through training and inclusive 
policies that foster employee well-being and resource 
development. Our company has received the “Great Place 
To Work” certification in India, reflecting an inclusive work 
culture and positive people practices.
As a responsible Company, we are committed to delivering 
social impact through a well-defined CSR strategy. Our CSR 
initiatives demonstrate our strong commitment towards 
social causes and responsibilities. Our CSR initiatives 
in FY 2022-23 included programs covering healthcare, 
education, rural development, environment conservation, 
drinking water and disaster relief.
As a leading global generic pharmaceutical company, we 
enable access to medical products through our global 
presence in over 100 countries and a portfolio of 1,000+ 
products spanning across multiple therapeutic segments.
We are committed to addressing the impact of climate 
change through strategic actions to manage and mitigate 
carbon emissions associated with our operations and by 
assessing climate risk exposure. Our climate change action 
plans are in line with Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs) and Paris Agreement. We are also signatory to India 
CEO forum on Climate Change. In the near future, we plan 
to initiate a climate risk assessment as per the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) protocol. 
We are also planning to carry out Biodiversity assessment 
for some of our manufacturing locations. With 2020 as 
the baseline year, we have set targets for reducing Scope 
1 and Scope 2 emissions by 35% by 2030, reducing water 
consumption by 10% by 2025, and disposing of 30% of 
hazardous waste through co-processing by 2025. We have 
a comprehensive roadmap for achieving these targets, 
including energy, water, and waste management plans and 
corresponding implementation and integration strategies.
While we continue to integrate sustainability principles into 
our operations, and deliver on our promises of sustainable 
value creation, we welcome your valuable feedback in order 
to improve our sustainability performance.
Regards,
Sailesh Desai
Whole-time Director

Human Capital 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Human Capital 
Development pertains to talent 
management initiatives, including 
talent acquisition, retention, 
development, employee 
well-being and satisfaction. 
As our business is dependent 
on the well-being of our 
people, failure to meet/exceed 
employee expectations may 
have an adverse impact on the 
Company's employee retention 
rate, productivity, and business 
continuity.
Opportunity: The Company's 
efforts to improve employee 
welfare and development 
directly demonstrates its focus

6.
Access to and 
Affordability 
of Medicines
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Addressing impediments 
related to product portfolio, 
product accessibility, and 
pricing, is important for the 
pharmaceutical sector. Lack of 
access to medicines owing to 
pricing and availability has a 
negative impact on the society’s 
access to medicines and may 
create challenges in aligning 
with the Company’s vision and 
long-term growth potential.
Opportunity: Given our strong 
generic and specialty product 
portfolio, coupled with our global 
presence, the company is well 
positioned to facilitate access to

middle income countries.
Negative: In the long run, the 
Company's brand value and 
long-term growth may be 
negatively impacted in case of 
inaccessibility of its products and 
inability to expand geographically.
7.

the company’s commitment 
to a sustainable future and a 
healthy planet.
1.

management, we are focusing on 
increasing the share of recycling and 
reuse within our own operations, and 
co-processing of hazardous waste.

environmental impacts can lead 
to adverse legal, regulatory and 
financial consequences, loss of 
reputation and stakeholder trust, 
ultimately leading to a loss of

Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Ineffective management of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
may expose the company to 
climate related physical and 
transition risks which might lead 
to disruption of operations and 
affect business continuity.
Opportunity: Adapting new low 
carbon technologies may unlock 
opportunities for more efficient 
manufacturing processes 
and will contribute towards 
business resilience.
1.	
The Company has taken a GHG 
reduction target to reduce 35% 
GHG emissions (covering scope 1 
and scope 2) by 2030.
2.	
We are also conducting climate 
risk assessment across our 
operations to evaluate physical 
and transitionary risks.
3.	
We are continuously exploring 
avenues to reduce our reliance on 
fossil fuels in our operations by 
increasing the share of biomass, 
procurement of renewable 
energy and implementing energy 
efficiency initiatives to optimise 
our energy consumption.
Negative: Potential immediate 
physical risks to our operations 
may damage our assets, which 
in turn, could lead to business 
interruptions and increased 
expenses for repairs and 
restoration of damaged sites. 
The transition risks associated 
with climate change could also 
result in more stringent regulations 
in the countries of our operations 
and exports, leading to higher 
compliance costs or investment 
costs in newer technologies.
Failure to adapt to adverse 
impacts of climate can also 
lead to loss of reputation and 
stakeholder trust.
Positive: Working towards 
climate change mitigation and 
adaptation may offer businesses 
opportunities to take advantage 
of emerging technologies 
and more efficient means 
of production.

Opportunity: Diversity, inclusion 
and providing equal opportunities 
improves the company’s 
performance by bringing together 
people with varied knowledge, 
views, and perspectives. This 
results in identifying innovative 
ideas and improves talent 
attraction and retention at the 
workplace.
-
Positive: A diverse and inclusive 
workforce from different genders, 
age, ethnicities, and special 
abilities enables a productive 
environment and drives 
innovative thinking, helping 
in employee engagement and 
unlocking higher efficiencies.
10.
Sustainable 
Supply 
Chain and 
Responsible 
Procurement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Due to the pharmaceutical 
industry’s reliance on the 
supply chain for critical raw 
materials and last mile delivery 
of medicines, any disruption of 
supply chain may impact business 
continuity and/or product quality. 
Non-substitutable suppliers also 
pose a risk in terms of continued 
availability of critical raw 
materials.
The Company requires its 
supply chain partners to adhere 
to its ESG principles and any 
non-adherence may result in a 
disruption of supplies.
Opportunity: Supply chain 
plays a determining role in the 
sustainability of an organisation. 
Integrating suppliers into the ESG 
journey helps the Company to 
develop a resilient supply chain 
and cascade a virtuous cycle 
of environmentally and socially 
responsible behaviour across the 
value chain.
1.	
We are continuously exploring 
opportunities to de-risk the 
supply chain by evaluating 
alternate suppliers for critical or 
non-substitutable raw materials.
2.	
As part of the Company’s Supplier 
Code of Conduct, the suppliers are 
expected to adhere to the Company’s 
ESG standards.
3.	
The Company has a high focus on 
developing quality products and 
safety of consumers. The quality of 
raw materials for our production 
process is ensured by conducting 
periodic supplier audits.
Negative: Long-term commercial 
partnerships with suppliers may 
be impacted if standards related 
to various social, environmental 
and safety aspects are not 
complied with by suppliers, 
leading to loss of business value.
Non-substitutable and critical raw 
material suppliers may impact 
the business in case of any 
unforeseen disruptions.
Positive: The Company's ability 
to deal with supply chain 
disruptions brought on by 
unprecedented circumstances is 
ensured by responsible supply 
chain practices. In addition, the 
Company's adherence to its 
responsible sourcing enhances 
its social and environmental 
performance.
Assessing alternate suppliers may 
also help reduce risk exposure 
and open access to previously 
unexplored suppliers for raw 
materials. It may lead to discovery 
of local suppliers, which reduces 
environmental footprint and 
may result in better control over 
evaluation of supplier practices.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk: Occupational health and 
safety is a vital component of 
the Company’s commitment 
towards providing a safe and 
secure working environment. 
Ineffectiveness of the current 
Health and Safety management 
programs may lead to a large 
number of health and safety 
incidents.
1.	
The company has a strong 
Environment Health and Safety (EHS) 
management system that includes 
regular internal and external audits 
of its EHS practices.
2.	
Our risk assessment methodology 
and safety practices are based on 
guiding principles of our Process 
Safety Management system which 
adds cohesiveness to our health and 
safety approach from the aspects 
of risk assessment and working 
conditions.
3.	
Adoption of a detailed corrective 
action plan post the identification 
of hazards and assessment of safety 
incidents help in preventing any such 
instances in the future.
Negative: Frequent health 
and safety incidents will have 
a negative influence on the 
Company’s performance in terms 
of both safety and workforce 
well-being. This will impact the 
brand image, reputation and the 
Company’s ability to attract and 
retain talent.
12.
Ethical Clinical 
Trials and 
Animal Testing
Risk
Risk: Addressing risks associated 
with clinical trials and animal 
testing is critical to demonstrate 
the Company’s commitment to 
responsible research practices, 
especially around the ethical and 
safety related concerns of trials 
on human subjects and animal 
testing. Adverse events related 
to research practices can cause 
delays in product development 
and lead to financial losses and 
negative public perception.
1.	
The Company complies with all 
relevant regulatory requirements 
governing clinical trials and animal 
testing. We have dedicated teams 
responsible for ensuring adherence 
to these regulations, which involve 
obtaining necessary approvals, 
permits, and maintaining thorough 
documentation.
2.	
We also implement robust quality 
control and safety measures 
throughout the research process. 
This involves monitoring and auditing 
the conduct of clinical trials, data 
collection, and analysis to ensure 
accuracy, reliability, and compliance 
with relevant standards.
3.	
Long term safety studies are 
undertaken for some of our 
innovative specialty products, 
post commercialisation, in order 
to evaluate and measure safety 
parameters over a longer time 
horizon.
4.	
On certain projects we collaborate 
with academic institutions, research 
organisations, and regulatory 
agencies to share knowledge, 
expertise, and resources. Such 
collaborations also enable collective 
efforts, checks and balances to 
enhance the quality and ethical 
standards of clinical trials and 
animal testing.
Negative: Failure to comply with 
guidelines and regulations of 
clinical trials and animal testing 
can undermine the efficacy and 
safety of the Company’s clinical 
trials. It may also have an adverse 
regulatory/legal impact, lead to 
financial damages and reputation 
loss and have a negative impact 
on participant’s health and safety. 
Delays at any stage can also 
prolong the overall timeline for 
drug development, leading to 
increased costs.
13.
Social Impact 
through 
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Opportunity: By aligning CSR 
programs with the needs of the 
community, through impact 
assessments and stakeholder 
engagement sessions, the 
Company focuses on creating an 
environment of mutual trust with 
the community. This will help in 
ensuring a long-term beneficial 
relationship with the community 
and enhance the social 
positioning of the Company.
-
Positive: The Company's 
perception among the local 
community members is 
enhanced by its contributions 
to the community's upliftment 
through various initiatives and 
partnerships that focus on health, 
education, rural infrastructure 
development, sanitation, and 
environment conservation 
among others. These efforts 
also help to promote positive 
social outcomes.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The Company has a comprehensive complaint management process to facilitate timely redressal of the product quality 
complaints. Once a product quality complaint is received, either directly by the Company or through a third-party 
entity (appointed to handle product complaints), and registered in the Company’s system, it is acknowledged, and a 
preliminary assessment is undertaken. In certain markets, based on local requirements, a Field Alert Report (FAR) may 
be filed for the complaint depending on its nature and severity. Along with the initial evaluation, a follow-up is initiated 
for requesting the complaint sample and any additional information to facilitate the preliminary assessment and the 
investigation. The initial risk assessment and the investigative process proceeds concurrently with the follow-up. 
A remedial action plan is launched after the investigation is completed and the root cause is determined. A complaint 
summary report is also prepared at the same time. The complaint is finally closed after a final risk assessment 
is completed and a response is delivered to the complainant. Any market actions for the impacted product are 
considered and may be communicated with the local regulatory authorities depending on local requirements.
	
The Company has a global Pharmacovigilance Policy and mechanism in place, which is supported by a product safety 
group, committed to responding to patient safety concerns and incidents.
