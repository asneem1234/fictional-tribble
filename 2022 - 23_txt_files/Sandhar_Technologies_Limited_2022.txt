Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company has implemented a waste management policy that supports the Company’s operations by segregating waste at the 
source and carrying out the following practices: 
•	
Waste prevention
•	
Reusing waste 
•	
Recycling waste 
•	
Responsible disposal of waste
	
Furthermore at Company level, we use a hierarchy of waste reduction to implement the concepts of the circular economy, covering 
the aspects of Recover, Reduce, Reuse & Recycle including the following areas: 
•	
Recovering resources as much as possible 
•	
Reducing usage of natural resources and materials
•	
Reusing waste wherever practicable
•	
Recycling materials whenever possible 
	
With respect to hazardous wastes, these are managed in accordance with the applicable Regulations (State Pollution Control Board 
(SPCB)/Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Rules and Guidelines). As per these Regulations, all of these items are handled, 
delivered, recycled, stored and disposed of through licenced agencies. Further, proper records are being maintained for all types of 
hazardous waste and its movement. 
	
With respect to non-hazardous wastes, over the period, the Company has devised specific solutions to handle and dispose of non-
hazardous waste in the most efficient available mechanism. These solutions require either no or very low investment, to achieve 
advancement both commercially and environmentally. For example, to eliminate the need for wood pallets for delivering the 
products, we have started using the recycled cardboard boxes as a filler for packaging material. Use of reusable pallets and recycling 
programmes for paper and plastic are some of the other initiatives.
