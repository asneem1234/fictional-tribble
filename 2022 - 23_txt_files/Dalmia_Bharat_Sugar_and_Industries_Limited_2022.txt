At Dalmia Bharat 
Sugar and Industries 
Limited, we had two 
options across the 
most challenging 
phase of the Indian 
sugar industry during 
the last decade.  
We could wait for 
change to happen.  
We could be the 
change instead.  
We selected the 
latter option…and 
that has made all the 
difference.

Vibrant growth under strong values 
embedded environment with strong 
impetus on value creation for all the 
stakeholders.  
Integrity: Wisdom is knowing which 
is the right path. Integrity is taking that 
right path. Integrity is the quality of being 
honest and having strong moral values. 
It is our aptitude for doing what’s right 
and not what’s easy. We believe it is an 
opportunity to come out of our comfort 
zone and create a bridge of faith with 
those around us. We nurture a habitat 
where success is measured by conduct 
and individuals never stray from their line 
of duty.
Commitment: Motivation gets you 
started; commitment is what keeps you 
going. We believe commitment is the 
power which transforms a promise into 
reality. It is the bond that glues us with 
our goals and helps us realize that success 
is never attained by accident. It makes us 
believe that where there is a will, there is 
always a way.
Trust and respect: Trust takes years 
to build, seconds to break and forever 
to repair. Respect is earned but trust is 
gained. The two together remind us of 
our unique worth, multiply our combined 
strength and the miracles that each of us 
are capable of.
Humility: Humility is the concern of what 
is right and not who is right.
Perfection is impossible without humility. 
Humility is our ultimate strength; it is 
our willingness to follow as much as our 
capacity to lead. It discovers the true 
measure of our own self and transforms 
us into being open towards learning 
and growing. Humility is the bliss of an 
equilibrium that lets us scale to the next 
level of greatness that is captured in 
a single word and summed up in one 
philosophy.
The Company was listed on BSE and NSE 
with a market capitalization of H 2735 Cr 
as on March 31, 2023.  
To be among the Country’s top five sugar 
companies in respect of total revenue 
coupled with a strong impetus on value 
creation to drive the highest Return on 
Capital Employed (RoCE) in the industry.

Values  
Listing     
DBSIL, a part of the Dalmia Bharat Group 
with a turnover of H 3328 Cr, is a leading 
sugar producer Company in India. In 
1994, the Company entered the sugar 
industry by establishing a 2500 TCD 
capacity sugar mill in Ramgarh, a village 
located in the Sitapur district of Uttar 
Pradesh. DBSIL is a relatively new entrant 
among the prominent sugar companies 
in India. The Company has established 
itself as one of the fastest-growing sugar 
companies in India, with a presence in 
two non-contiguous cane-growing States 
with experience spanning three decades, 
navigating various market cycles. 
DBSIL has a strong commitment to 
environmental and social responsibility. 
During the sugar production process, 
molasses and bagasse are generated as 
by-products. DBSIL utilizes molasses to 
produce ethanol, which is a green fuel, 
while bagasse is used to generate clean 
power. This approach not only helps to 
reduce waste but also generates a ‘green 
footprint’ for the Company.  
In FY2022-23, 36% of the Company’s 
revenue came from non-sugar products. 
The Company is striking a balance 
between economic growth and social 
and environmental responsibility, 
strengthening sustainability.  
Late Shri Jai Hari Dalmia, who was Vice 
Chairman and Managing Director of 
the Company, played a leading role in 
initiating Company’s growth, together 
with Shri Gautam Dalmia, the present 
Managing Director and the senior 
management team.  
Pedigree    
Management    
Products  
Sugar: The Company’s sugar production 
decreased by 2% in the financial year 
2022-23, reaching 4.78 Lakh tonnes 
compared to 4.86 Lakh tonnes in the 
previous year. The Company reported a 
normative sugar recovery of 11.80% in 
Uttar Pradesh and 13.28% in Maharashtra 
during the Sugar Season (SS) 22-23. The 
higher sugar recovery rate was attributed 
to the use of superior cane variety and 
robust cane management practices.  
Co-generation: The Company reduced 
its exposure to the cyclical nature of the 
sugar industry by producing power from 
bagasse. By operating co-generation 
plants at its sugar mills, DBSIL is able to 
produce renewable energy and lower its 
greenhouse gas emissions. In FY2022-23, 
around 39% of the Company’s power 
generation was utilized for its own 
consumption, while the remainder was 
sold to the state electricity grid.  
Distillery: The Company benefited 
from an increasing government focus 
on ethanol blending and in-house raw 
material availability by using molasses 
to manufacture ethanol. The Company’s 
ability to produce different grades of 
alcohol such as ethanol, rectified spirit, 
and extra neutral alcohol, suggests that it 
has been able to cater to a wide range of 
customers, which contributed to a growth 
in distillery revenues. Distillery revenues 
increased 45 % from H 698 Cr in FY2021-22 
to H 1013 Cr in FY2022-23.   
Key businesses 
The Company is headquartered in Delhi 
and has manufacturing facilities in Uttar 
Pradesh and Maharashtra. This is possibly 
the only instance of a Company with 
sugar operations in these two non-
contiguous States in India.  
The Company markets products pan-India, 
with Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and the 
eastern states being the major markets. 
It exports to various locations, including 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, China, 
Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Middle East, 
Mediterranean countries, North Africa and 
East Africa.  
The Company is a preferred supplier of 
sugar to brand-enhancing institutional 
giants like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Mondelez, 
Perfetti, Britannia, Walmart India, Dabur, 
D-Mart, India Glycols, Radico Khaitan 
Bacardi India, United Breweries, Carlsberg, 
SABMiller and others in the alcohol 
industry.  
The Company owns and operates five 
modern sugar manufacturing plants 
located in two states- Maharashtra and 
Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, it has five 
co-generation plants that have a total 
capacity of 126 MW, spread across these 
two states. The Company also has four 
distilleries in Ramgarh, Jawaharpur, 
Nigohi and Kolhapur, with a combined 
capacity of 710 KLPD (Kilo Litres Per Day).

working capital outlay has increased from 
H794 Cr to H 887 Cr. Correspondingly, 
interest outflow moderated from H35 Cr 
to H38 Cr even as the Company’s revenues 
grew by 8%. Interest cover (an index of 
how effectively we cover interest payment 
through our EBITDA) strengthened from 
17x to 23x. The Company’s credit rating 
was maintained at the same level.
The growth of this one business – distillery 
– has transformed your Company’s 
financial foundation. If one removes 
concessional debt from the Balance 
Sheet, the quantum of long-term debt 
was H401.17 Cr as on March 31 2023. 
Your Company’s debt-equity ratio 
strengthened from 0.17 to 0.15 despite an 
ongoing expansion programme.
The conclusion that I would want our 
shareholders to take note of comprise: 
your Company’s growth is being driven 
by internal accruals; your Company is 
generating adequate surplus to plough 
into aggressive capacity growth; this 
capacity expansion is expected to 
graduate the Company to one of the 
largest ethanol producers in Uttar Pradesh 
in 2024. This capacity expansion is 
expected to provide the Company with 
a large and liquid foundation that should 
translate into a sustainably enhanced 
shareholder value.
Capacity expansion
Given a positive industry environment, 
where the government intends to procure 
an even larger quantum of ethanol, the 
priority is for an opportunity-driven 
Company like yours to commission 
additional distillery capacity.
Your Company possessed a distillery 
capacity of 710 KLPD as on March 31 
2023 following an expansion of 110 KLPD 
that was commissioned in October 2022. 
The Company is presently engaged in 
increasing Jawaharpur grain distillery 
capacity of 110 KLPD to 250 KLPD that 
should get commissioned by December 
2023. Given the industry optimism, 
your Company announced yet another 
expansion – making it two expansions 
in the pipeline – of 300 KLPD at Nigohi 
that is expected to be commissioned in 
September 2024.
I must assure our shareholders that these 
expansions – even as they have been 
planned with speed – will only enhance 
the value of their holdings for the 
following reasons. 
One, the sharp increase in distillery 
capacity – from 600 KLPD as on March 31 
2022 to 1150 KLPD as on March 31 2025 – 
will translate into an estimated 33 Cr liters 
of ethanol throughput per annum, which 
provides the Company with enhanced 
revenue and profit visibility. 
Two, with virtually all our molasses-based 
distillery capacity having been optimized, 
we will commission around 550 KLPD 
distillery capacity around grain, which will 
be our future growth driver. 
Three, the ratio of sugar capacity to 
distillery capacity (following our expansion 
programmes) will be among the lowest in 
the industry with correspondingly positive 
upsides for our capital efficiency. 
Four, our distilleries will be fueled by 
bagasse generated from within, obviating 
the need for the procurement of fossil 
fuels – a cheaper and cleaner way to grow 
our business. 
Five, we will sustain the switch from sugar 
to ethanol until sugar realisations rise to 
the point where it becomes significantly 
remunerative to produce sugar over 
ethanol.
Outlook
At Dalmia Bharat Sugar, we have 
aggressively invested in building 
productive and profitable assets through 
net worth as the best way to remunerate 
shareholders. By doing this, we believe we 
would be putting capital to the best use. 
This policy will be sustained across the 
foreseeable future.    
We believe that we are building a 
foundation that should translate into 
sizable and sustainable long-term growth 
that should enhance value for all our 
stakeholders in a sustainable way.
Gautam Dalmia 
Managing Director 
 Paradigm shift from 
sugar to ethnol and 
then Penetration to 
Grain Ethanol will not 
only lead to better 
business model but will 
give us an opportunity 
to be a leading 
participant in ethanol 
blending program.
Overview
At the outset I would like to highlight 
that the Company is in a phase of 
aggressive expansion especially in the 
distillery segment and has sown the 
seeds of a significantly higher trajectory of 
profitability growth in the coming years.
Perspective
Before dwelling further on other aspects, it 
is imperative to review the government’s 
National Biofuel Policy 2018. The policy 
articulated a higher blending ratio 
of ethanol with automotive fuel and 
empowered sugar companies to switch 
from the manufacture of sugar (which was 
earlier seen as mandatory) to ethanol.
This forward-looking policy has proved 
to be a win-win for all stakeholders in 
the industry value chain. It has ensured 
that the benefits of bio-fuel manufacture 
translate to cane farmers in the form 
of timely and adequate compensation, 
helping build the country’s agricultural 
sector from the grassroots upwards 
and reinforcing the rural economy. The 
policy has provided the country’s sugar 
industry with a second wind; a number 
of companies have invested aggressively 
in their distilleries; within just a few years, 
even as the larger proportion of revenue is 
being derived from sugar, the proportion 
of profit is being largely derived 
from distillery operations, enhancing 
shareholder value. The increased use of 
ethanol in automotive fuel (estimated 
at around 11% today and likely to 
increase to 20% in the next couple of 
years) has already begun to moderate 
vehicular pollution through a better 
fuel combustion in automotive engines, 
benefiting society. The enhanced use of 
ethanol has helped moderate oil imports 
with positive implications for the country’s 
foreign exchange reserves and currency 
strength.
I cannot think of any policy that has had 
such extensive multi-stakeholder upside 
as this one, transforming the health of the 
country’s sugar industry in a compressed 
period of time. The outcome is that a 
cyclical sector has turned sustainable 
and is likely to remain so across the 
foreseeable future.
Performance
The performance of your Company during 
the last financial year was built around 
the backdrop of this positive sectorial 
landscape. Your Company reported a 
revenue growth of 8%.The Company 
reported an EBITDA margin of 15%. 
Increase in cane prices last year resulted 
in a higher opening inventory carrying 
cost for the year without a commensurate 
increase in sugar prices.
Transformation
I must take this opportunity to explain 
a profitable churn in the Company’s 
revenue and Balance Sheet profiles that 
should translate into enhanced value 
across the foreseeable future.
The proportion of revenues being derived 
from distillery operations increased 
during the last financial year – from 24% 
of overall revenues to 31%. Besides, the 
Company’s distilleries operated for an 
average 314 days, delivering an average 
(across distilleries) capacity utilization of 
nearly 100%.
This increased distillery revenue 
proportion had a transformative impact 
on the Company’s Balance Sheet. The 
manufacture of sugar is compressed 
within a period of five months; the 
sale of that sugar often extends across 
15 months. During this period, your 
Company (as also the sector) needs to 
store the sugar in its factory. This storage 
represents blocked inventory that can 
only be progressively liquidated as per 
the sugar release advice received from 
the government. While the sugar lies 
unsold, the Company is required to 
invest in working capital (and short-term 
debt correspondingly mobilized) on its 
books. This increases the interest outflow 
and moderates profits. This is how the 
Company operated for years, becoming a 
part of its legacy, culture and practice.
This reality has begun to transform. 
Thanks to the government’s permission to 
companies to move from the manufacture 
of sugar to ethanol at will, your Company 
has begun to ‘sacrifice’ the production 
of sugar and utilize the cane syrup to 
manufacture ethanol instead (or utilize 
the molasses generated from sugar 
manufacture to do the same). This one 
switch has transformed the dynamics of 
the sugar industry and our Company for 
an important reason: ethanol enjoys a 
ready market and does not need to be 
inventorized. The Company can generate 
immediate revenues and get remunerated 
in less than a month by oil marketing 
companies. This quicker revenue inflow 
has helped your Company moderate its 
working capital (and related debt) outlay. 
The result is that the more ethanol we 
manufacture, the less short-term debt 
on our books (in addition to interest 
subvention on long-term loan to set up a 
distillery, which is an additional bonus).
The result is that the Company’s peak 
The performance of 
your Company during 
the last financial year 
was built around the 
backdrop of this positive 
sectorial landscape. Your 
Company reported a 
revenue growth of 8%.The 
Company reported an 
EBITDA margin of 15%. 
Increase in cane prices 
last year resulted in 
higher opening inventory 
carrying cost for the year 
without commensurate 
increase in sugar prices.

Our culture of 
digitalisation  
will graduate 
the Company 
to the next 
level    
Our culture of 
operational 
excellence   
in FY2022-23  
At DBSIL, we are engaged 
in a legacy business with a 
modern mindset.
At DBSIL, we are engaged in a legacy 
business with a modern mindset.
This contemporary approach has 
been reflected in forward-looking 
investments by the Company in 
advanced equipment across the 
decades, resulting in enhanced plant 
availability, utilisation and operating 
efficiency.
The Company is at the cusp 
of gradating its systemic 
contemporariness to the next level 
through a digitalization programme. 
The Company has engaged a 
multi-national consulting company 
to conduct a study on the various 
probable interventions by the 
Company across its processes that 
could generate superior sustainable 
automated processes and outcomes.
The digitalization will be directed at 
specific outcomes: a replacement 
of the manual with the automated; 
a phased reduction in processes; 
targeted reduction in costs; an 
increase in people productivity.
We see this digitization graduate 
the Company into a new age where 
scalability does not translate into 
proportionately increased costs.
At DBSIL, we pride on our 
operational excellence 
in a business marked by 
variables.
Our capacity to address deviations 
from foreseen realities with speed 
underlines our operating culture. This 
was visible during the year under 
review when parts of our command 
areas were affected by the red rot 
disease that affected cane health. 
Your Company’s cane development 
teams addressed this outbreak with 
speed and decisiveness: the affected 
cane stalks were cut and disposed; 
an ongoing check ensured no new 
outbreak.
The Company extended its response 
from the tactical to the strategic: 
it moderated the coverage of the 
erstwhile successful CO 0238 cane 
variety that had shown a growing 
indication of disease susceptibility. 
The Company moderated the 
coverage of this variety across its 
command areas from 90% in the 
previous year to 65% during the 
year under review, one of the fastest 
varietal replacement programmes 
by sugar companies in Uttar Pradesh 
(targeted to reduce to 50% during the 
current financial year).
This responsiveness and other 
initiatives were responsible for better 
sugar recovery with our Ramgarh 
plant reporting the maximum 
recovery across all sugar mills in 
Uttar Pradesh. Besides, the blended 
normative recovery of 12.19% across 
the Company’s units (Maharashtra 
and Uttar Pradesh) was arguably the 
highest across sugar companies in 
India.

Our 
investment 
in the next 
round of 
growth    
Our growth 
foundation 
– within 
time and 
cost targets 
At DBSIL, we are among India’s youngest 
sugar companies – especially among 
those companies with a sizable capacity.
During the last three 
decades, the Company 
emerged among the 
fastest growing in its sector, 
convinced that rapidly 
enhanced scale would 
translate into superior 
operating economies 
that would protect the 
Company’s viability during 
industry downtrends and 
enhance viability during 
recovery.
Since the Company 
came into existence, its 
gross block has grown 
from scratch to H2804 
Cr (March 31 2023). The 
Company invested in 
segments where it was 
likely to generate the 
highest return. In the last 
three years, for instance, 
40% of its investment 
was allocated to the 
distillery business where 
the Company perceives 
a disproportionate 
opportunity. Besides, this 
plough back has been 
consistently higher than 
the dividend outgo, driven 
by the insight that cash in 
the hands of the Company 
would generate a larger 
return - for longer.
This is a distinctive 
perspective that the 
Company has brought to 
its expansion programmes. 
The Company is engaged 
in commissioning two 
grain-based distilleries, 
which should cumulatively 
add 440 KLPD to its 
distillery capacity.
The aggregate output from 
the distilleries is expected 
to graduate the Company 
to one of the largest 
ethanol producers in India 
across the foreseeable 
future with a total capacity 
of 1150 KLPD and a 
projected throughput of 33 
Cr litres.
At DBSIL, we are engaged in the most 
aggressive asset building programme in 
our existence.
This asset expansion 
programme is expected to 
generate sustainable multi-
year returns.
An important part of this 
sustainability is the capacity 
to prudently cost the 
expansion and schedule 
it in a manner that it is 
commissioned on time and 
within planned costs.
This disciplined holistic 
project management 
represents the foundation 
of multi-year sustainability.
At DBSIL, we completed 
the Jawaharpur grain 
distillery of 110 KLPD 
capacity in November 2022. 
The distillery was operated 
at almost 93% capacity 
utilization during the rest 
of the financial year under 
review.
Going ahead, the Company 
intends to commission one 
more grain-based distillery 
of 300 KLPD capacity at 
Nigohi and increase the 
Jawaharpur capacity to 250 
KLPD from 110 KLPD for a 
consolidated investment of 
H550 Cr.
The Jawaharpur expansion 
will be commissioned 
during the FY2023-24 and 
the Nigohi capacity will go 
in stream by mid FY2024-
25.
By betting on sizable 
capacity expansion and 
investing in disciplined 
commissioning, the 
Company is optimistic 
that these grain-based 
distilleries will strengthen 
the Company’s proportion 
of non-sugar revenues, 
strengthening business 
sustainability.

Report Profile
About our  
Integrated 
Annual Report
DBSIL replaced the conventional financial and 
sustainability reporting frameworks  with an integrated 
alternative in FY2021-22. This was intended to provide a 
unified perspective of how the Company creates value in 
the short, medium, and long-term. The Company is one of 
few Indian sugar companies to publish such a report.
Frameworks
This report covers all publicly available 
ESG metrics relevant for FY2022-23. The 
Company adopted the IIRC framework 
for integrated reporting (www.
integratedreporting.org) by which the 
Annual Report has been included in 
the Integrated Report. The Company 
provides a brief integrated account of its 
strategy, governance, performance, and 
prospects, covering key non-financial 
performance indicators (material to the 
Company as per GRI). 
This voluntary initiative also 
comprises newly introduced Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, 
establishing links between environment, 
social and financial outcomes. 
Scope of reporting
Reporting period: The report, 
published annually, provides material 
information relating to the Company’s 
strategy and business model, operating 
context, material risks, stakeholder 
interests, performance, prospects and 
governance from April 1, 2022 to March 
31, 2023
Reporting boundary: This report 
covers information about the operations 
of the company.
Financial and non-financial 
reporting: The report extends beyond 
financial reporting and includes non-
financial performance, opportunities, 
risks and outcomes attributable to or 
associated with our key stakeholders, 
which have a significant influence on 
our ability to enhance value.

Material issues impacting value creation
The Company analyses environmental, social, and governance issues impacting the business, value creation and stakeholders. 
These influence strategic priorities, mitigate actions and influence our effect on the environment and stakeholder value.
We analyse the environment through a quadrennial materiality exercise involving all internal and external stakeholders 
to identify material issues. We create a list of potential material aspects by analysing material issues encountered by peer 
companies, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

GHG: Moderated greenhouse gas 
emission. Specific GHG emissions 
(TCO2/MT of cane) were maintained 
at the same level as previous year.
Air: Moderated emission of 
potentially noxious substances. Air 
emission quality improved by 2% in 
FY2022-23.
Water: Reduced use of this precious 
resource (through treatment and 
reuse). Specific water consumption 
(KL/MT of cane) reduced by 42% in 
this financial year compared to the 
previous year.
Waste to wealth: Upcycling of waste

Identify the Risk
Mitigate the Risk
Report the Risk
Monitor & Review the Risk
Evaluate the Risk 
Analyze the Risk
Risk owners identify the risks 
involved in their respective 
departments/ units that could 
potentially affect objectives. 
This comprises initiatives that help 
manage risks to an acceptable level. 
The risk owner assesses existing 
process competence to mitigate 
risks and make improvements 
thereto.
Once risks are 
identified, the risk 
owner determines 
the nature, 
likelihood and 
potential effect on 
objectives. 
The Risk 
Management 
Committee is 
updated biannually 
and the Board of 
Directors annually.
The risk owner 
determines the 
risk magnitude, 
a combination 
of likelihood and 
consequence, and 
decides whether the 
risk is acceptable or 
serious enough to 
warrant addressal. 
All the key KPIs 
depicting the risks, 
their mitigation 
plans and the 
impacts on the 
organization are 
analysed as a part 
of periodic Business 
Review Meeting. 
Approach to risk management
The Company’s risk management framework is founded on sound organisation design principles that are periodically reviewed. The 
integrated ERM framework is based on COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of Treadway Commission) and customized. 
Whether risks are external/ internal to the Company, or can / cannot be directly influenced/ managed, they are addressed by a 
common set of processes through the risk management process.

Risk management
The Company’s evolving business 
landscape exposes it to several risks. The 
risk management process helps identify, 
assess, mitigate, and monitor key risks, 
which emphasizes risk discussions and 
risk oversight (by Risk Management 
Committee / Board of Directors).
Risk agendas include all risks, trends and 
concerns that could impact the Company 
in the short (zero to two years), medium 
(two to five years), and long term (five 
to ten years). Other risk management 
areas and processes complement the 
surveillance and risk management 
function: Process Assessment, Internal 
Control, Legal, Financial Risk Management, 
Compliance and Sustainability.

medium and long term. We believe that 
effectively managing our material issues 
are critical to achieving our strategic 
objectives and meeting stakeholders’ 
expectation.
How we assess materiality
Through our annual materiality 
assessment, we engage internal and 
external stakeholders so that we have an 
improved understanding of the issues 
that directly impact our ability to create 
value. These issues are not static and they 
change on the basis of changes in our 
external operating environment and the 
evolving expectations of our stakeholders. 
We conduct the materiality mapping 
exercise as a way to link materiality to 
stakeholder concerns, and for setting 
long-term goals and strategy.

growth across three businesses 
and widens rural prosperity.
The focus of Natural Capital is 
to unleash the fullest value of 
this stakeholder and enhance 
its process integrity that helps 
protect Natural Capital or the other 
capitals. The Company’s farmer 
support has been reinforced 
through the following initiatives:
• 100% purchase of all the 
cane offered to the Company, 
enhancing farmer confidence
• Timely payment for cane 
purchase, strengthening farmer 
liquidity
• Playing an assistive role for 
farmers in helping them enhance 
incomes
• Playing a catalytic role in helping 
farmers strengthen yields through 
new cane varieties

Strategic goals 
The principal risks and 
counter-initiatives related to 
Natural Capital    
The legal and regulatory environment 
related to disclosures, emissions, water 
and climate change are perpetually 
changing, warranting compliance. Besides, 
there is an excessive dependence on cane 
productivity for success and this is, in turn, 
influenced completely by climate factors 
at a time of climate change.  
The key focus areas to counter the 
risks comprise a periodic review of 
compliance policies and procedures as 
well as system improvements to minimize 
energy intensity and dependence on 
non-renewable sources. There is also a 
concerted initiative to engage actively 
with farmers to enhance cane output in a 
sustainable manner. 
The Company’s environment 
approach      
DBSIL’s green growth journey is marked 
by an investment in technologies leading 
to operational efficiencies as well as 
resource savings – getting more out of 
less. More specifically, the Company’s 
environment management has comprised 
the 5R’s approach (reduce, restore, recycle, 
renewable and replace) resulting in the 
following initiatives:  
Resource conservation: Reduced 
consumption of chemicals, power and 
water through optimized processes    
Pollution control: Emissions and 
pollutants discharge were moderated 
through a proactive investment in 
pollution control technologies.  Dalmia 
was among the first Company in India 
to introduce electrified gravel bed 
precipitators to reduce particulate 
matter from the slop incineration boiler

Inter-cropping with 
sugarcane    
Sugarcane is a long duration crop, 
standing in the field for 12 months. The 
large inter-row spacing provides an 
opportunity to raise a suitable inter-
crop. The Company promotes growing 
an additional crop with sugarcane to 
increase gross productivity of land per 
unit area, generating an extra income for 
the farmers.A number of crops can be 
grown as an inter-crop like mustard, green 
gram, cow peas, onion, coriander, ladies 
finger, tomato, lentil, garlic, pea and radish, 
among others. Leguminous inter-crops 
provide benefits of nitrogen enrichment 
and green manure to the soil.  
Enhancing sustainable 
agriculture    
Regenerative agriculture: Regenerative 
agriculture is becoming increasingly 
relevant as farming and grazing practices 
that reverse climate change by rebuilding 
soil organic matter and restoring 
degraded soil biodiversity. This is resulting 
in a carbon drawdown while improving 
the water table. The Company is working 
to improve water usability, soil health 
and agricultural techniques to promote 
regenerative agriculture.   
Soil regeneration: The Company 
distributed organic potash fertilizer 
directly to farm areas through dealers on 
a ‘door delivery model’ as a part of the 
programme to enrich organic soil content. 
Sustainable sugarcane production: 
DBSIL was among the first sugar 
companies in Asia and among a handful 
of global sugar players to be awarded the 
Bonsucro International Certification for 
sustainable sugarcane production. This 
has provided the Company with access to 
a fast-growing, value-added market with a 
focus on sustainable sourcing.

farm yields. It encourages irrigation 
practices by enhancing rural water 
retention through the renovation of rural 
ponds and the construction of bore well 
recharge structures that enhance water 
table levels.
The Company provides press mud, k-ash, 
vermi-composting and bio-compost to 
farmers that incentivize a reduction in the 
use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. 
This, in turn, ensures long-term soil fertility 
and biological balance. The Company’s 
in-house soil testing lab analyses the 
soil samples of farmers that provide 
better farming solutions. It guides small 
and marginalized cane growers in the 
selection of the right variety of cane seed, 
agri-inputs and agronomical practices.
Project Parivartan
DBSIL launched Project Parivartan in 
2021 to address issues pertaining to cane 
varieties and diseases in Uttar Pradesh 
across its manufacturing facilities and 
achieve a recovery of 11.80% in Uttar 
Pradesh.
In view of this, the Company selected to 
play the role of a responsible evangelist 
and the result of sustained propagation is 
that early maturing cane covers 95% of its 
command areas; cane yields are expected 
to enhance from 500 quintals per hectare 
to 750 quintals per hectare in the space of 
five years ending 2025-26.
This increased farm coverage and yield 
have helped transform farmer incomes, 
deepening the cane growing culture and 
creating a long-term pipeline of resource 
sustainability.
Varietal improvement
Sugarcane is vulnerable to different biotic 
and abiotic factors like diseases, insects, 
pests and climate change. This moderates 
cane yield and sugar recovery. This makes 
periodic varietal improvement initiatives 
important for climate resilience and 
cane cultivation. DBSIL is committed to a 
varietal improvement program, prompted 
by proprietary research and development 
leading to the introduction of enhanced 
cane varieties.
The Company moderated the coverage 
of the erstwhile successful CO 0238 cane 
variety that had shown growing disease 
susceptibility. The Company moderated 
the coverage of this variety across its 
command areas from 90% in the previous 
year to 65% during the year under review, 
one of the fastest varietal replacement 
programmes by sugar companies in Uttar 
Pradesh (targeted to reduce to 50% during 
the current financial year).

How we promote  
sustainable 
agriculture  
Overview
At DBSIL, cane availability cum quality 
influence business success; cane 
availability helps optimize production 
on the one hand whereas cane quality 
directly influences mill recovery on 
the other. The Company deepened its 
farmer relationships with the objective 
to enhance farmer throughput and 
prosperity, coupled with the Company’s 
growth – a virtuous cycle.
Our cane sourcing 
effectiveness
The Company procures cane from around 
2,00,000 cane growers (small and medium 
scale) and a cane area of around 1,20,000 
hectares across five manufacturing 
units (three in Uttar Pradesh and two in 
Maharashtra). Around 70% of the cane 
was procured at the mill gate in FY2022-
23, making it quicker and economical for 
growers to supply.
Our farmer support 
initiatives
The Company shares knowledge around 
sustainable agricultural practices with 
farmers. Farmers are encouraged to 
increase the use of organic formulations, 
which is then monitored for suggestions 
related to quality and cane yield 
improvement.
The Company encourages farmers to 
grow robust cane, marked by enhanced

Water management in India’s 
sugar industry
In the process of sugar manufacture, 
excess condensates are accumulated and 
reused. Sugarcane juice is extracted in 
mills after clarification, boiled in multiple 
effect evaporators and vacuum pan. If 
the condensate is contaminated by juice 
during boiling in the evaporator and pan 
due to entrainment, it needs to be treated 
in an effluent treatment plant.
It is important for sugar manufacturers 
to take preventive steps in condensate 
contamination. The uncontaminated 
condensate is recycled. A large quantity of 
water is required to cool bearings, glands, 
air compressors, sulphur burner and 
masscults.
Experts have indicated that the cooled 
condensate water should be recycled 
instead of being released as wastewater. 
The wastewater from sugar mills contain 
large quantities of bio-degradable organic 
matter and goes through extensive 
biological treatment. In general, anaerobic 
biological processes are advantageous 
over aerobic processes when the BOD and 
COD inputs are high.
Water treatment and disposal is tedious 
work as a majority of sugar plants struggle 
to manage the surplus water generated. 
Most sugar plants discharge process water 
as the government permits discharge of 
200 kilolitres per metric tonne of treated 
water outside the plant.
DBSIL and water 
management
The Company is working towards effective 
water management. All its sugar units 
have achieved zero liquid discharge; all 
treated water is used in the power plant, 
reducing groundwater extraction in the 
power plant to zero.
This treatment scheme has resulted in a 
complete discontinuation of ground water 
extraction in the sugar and power plants. 
The treated surplus water is supplied to 
farmers, reducing ground water extraction 
in farms, saving water.
Irrigation is a core DBSIL agenda as the 
Company promotes furrow irrigation, drip 
irrigation and mulching. Drip irrigation 
is economical in the areas of restricted 
irrigation facilities. Cane irrigated using  
drip alternative is almost close to the 
consumptive use of the plants, minimising 
losses like percolation, run-off and 
evaporation.

Emissions in the Indian sugar 
industry  
All cane-based sugar mills in India use 
bagasse as a fuel in boilers. The burning 
of bagasse in boilers produces particulate 
matter, oxides of nitrogen, carbon, sulphur 
and water vapour. Except for particulate 
matter, emissions of bagasse-fired boilers 
need to be within the limits prescribed 
by the pollution control authorities. 
The particulate matter, usually referred 
to as fly ash, consists of ash, unburnt 
bagasse and carbon particles. Fly ash is 
light and contains a large percentage 
of fine particulate matter. If air pollution 
control equipment is not installed at 
the sugar processing units, fly ash can 
escape into the atmosphere through 
the chimney. The particulate matter 
coming out of the chimney travels long 
distances, depending on the particle size 
and atmospheric conditions. It results in 
reduced visibility in the areas surrounding 
the sugar mill. Heavier particles settle 
on vegetation. There could be reports of 
dizziness and irritation in the eye, nose, 
throat and lungs from residents in the 
surrounding areas.  
As per the general emission standards, 
particulate matter is required to be 
within 150 mg/Nm3. In case of horse 
shoe/pulsating grate and in the case of 
spreader stroker bagasse-fired boilers, the 
particulate matter emission is required to 
be within 500 mg/Nm3 and 800 mg/Nm3 
respectively.  
DBSIL and emission control  
The Company has invested adequately in emission control by way of ESP, bag filters and scrubbers. It has implemented online systems 
to monitor emissions across manufacturing units. These systems monitor emissions with online alerts in case of deviations. These 
investments have improved ambient air quality.

Energy saving projects    
Steam reduction in the Ramgarh plant 
from 44% to 33%.  
The Company upgraded cane crushing 
capacity from 6200 TPD to 6500 TPD 
with B-heavy molasses and partial syrup 
diversion to distillery under the steam 
saving project.  
The Company modified its evaporation 
system by adding falling film evaporators 
with a flash pot (cigar) and steam saving 
devised in juice heating like condensate 
juice heaters, direct control juice heaters, 
plate type heat exchangers. The Company 
installed mechanical circulators in the pan 
station.   
Installation of dust collector in the 
sugar bagging area      
Dust is a crucial factor in environment, 
health and safety. Fine dust in the bagging 
area when final sugar comes from the 
centrifugal machine is usual.  
The Company installed a dust collection 
system in the Ramgarh and Jawaharpur 
units to arrest fine flying dust particles. The 
sugar dust does not just affect revenue 
loss in the shape of fine sugar but affects 
human health and damages electrical and 
mechanical components.
Replacement of coal with bagasse in the Kolhapur distillery        
The Company replaced coal with bagasse in the distillery. The advantage of bagasse 
feeding in the boiler is that it has reduced carbon dioxide output by up to 9.5 tons a year.

DBSIL and waste management    
At DBSIL, the endeavor is to reduce waste by opting for innovative mechanisms, recycling and reuse waste product in processes. The 
Company undertakes efforts to ensure that all waste is utilized.  
Compost, press mud K-ash and fly ash
The Company ensures a prompt supply of 
organic wastes directly or as formulation 
to the farmers and has an annual plan for 
its  distribution.
Vermicomposting and farmyard 
manure
DBSIL is promoting the infrastructure 
development for vermicomposting and 
farm yard manure through pit preparation 
in the farmer’s field. The produced 
manures are rich in nutrients and in 
bacterial and actinomycetes population, 
used as organic fertilizer to improve 
soil health. The Company promotes the 
numbers of such units in its cane areas.
Mechanization of sugarcane 
cultivation
Mechanization of sugarcane cultivation 
is the need of the day to address the 
problems faced in sustainable production 
and productivity. It is useful in saving time 
and labour. Cane growers are educated 
to change their mindset towards 
mechanisation in sugarcane cultivation.
The Company distributed farm 
equipment (trench cutter planter, ring 
pit machine, spray tankers, land leveler 
and small tractors, among others) to 
cane growers through its Uttar Pradesh 
units. These help develop agri equipment 
entrepreneurs who have tractors with 
more than 60 horse power to undertake 
additional plantation based on subsidized 
rates. The Company provided trench 
openers at subsidized rates. The Company 
organized training-cum-demonstration 
for cane growers.
Trash mulching
Sugarcane trash mulching helps conserve 
soil moisture, reduce moisture stress and 
atmospheric drought. The Company 
promotes mulching the inter-row space 
with a 5-7 centimetre thick layer of dry 
sugarcane leaves. About 8-10 tonnes of 
sugarcane trash per hectare are required 
to be mulched.
Trench planting
The Company educates farmers on trench 
planting. In this system, ‘U’ shaped furrows 
or trenches of about 25-30 centimetres 
are prepared with ridges and furrows with 
a distance of 120 centimeters formed by 
using a tractor drawn ridge and trench 
planter. Besides, the Company’s paired 
row system of planting has become 
popular. In this system, the space 
between a pair of two rows is reduced 
by bringing them closer and increasing 
spacing between adjacent pairs of rows.
Zero waste generation using 
innovative technology
The Company recycles and reuses all 
waste products through a close loop 
process. The sugar industry is carbon 
negative and the power produced is 
green in nature. The Company uses 
bagasse for the power plant; the excess 
bagasse is supplied to the paper industry. 
The Company sends unutilized water 
to farmers for irrigation. The Company 
supplies press mud to farmers to increase 
soil nutrition. The boiler ash goes into 
the soil with 17-18% of potash besides 
nitrogen and phosphorous.
Way forward
The greening growth process is 
imperative, which should help achieve 
organizational green growth targets by 
2025.

The Company’s 
Financial 
Capital   
Introduction
There is a distinctive role played by 
Financial Capital in organizational 
sustainability. It generates the surplus that 
makes all the other Capitals a reality.
At DBSIL, we have invested deeply in the 
reinforcement of this Capital, given its 
cascading influence on the other Capitals.
This Capital is generated from the surplus 
derived from operations and financing 
activities. This comprises the prudent 
mobilisation or collection of net worth 
and receivables in response to market 
dynamics, strategic needs and probable 
asset monetisation.

Overview
At DBSIL, we have progressively 
strengthened the competitiveness of our 
business with the objective to drive long-
term stability, visibility and sustainability.
The Company selectively appraises 
investment opportunities, market 
dynamics and sectorial fundamentals 
through a complement of knowledge 
derived from networks, peers and 
technologies. This filter-based approach 
has empowered the Company to make 
prudent decisions with sustainable 
long-term outcomes. The result is that 
the Company has emerged among the 
fastest growing sugar companies in three 
decades with credible fundamentals. 
These fundamentals have evolved into 
a robust platform of sustainable growth 
that can potentially maximize shareholder 
value, a virtuous cycle.
Profitable growth
Our business model has been defined 
by the need for profitable growth, where 
in the long run,  our profit growth in 
percentage terms is higher than the 
revenue growth in percentage terms. We 
believe that profitable growth is a visible 
measure of our competitiveness and a 
validation that our investment outcomes 
are aligned with our objectives.
Margins
The Company has generally focused 
on the generation of superior margins, 
measured at 15% during the year 
under review (16% in FY2021-22). The 
Company is focused on the protection 
or enhancement of EBITDA margins, 
based on existing synergies, competitive 
advantage, resource stability, demand-
supply dynamics and projected 
investments.
Over the years, the Company’s margins 
were strengthened by the complement 
of the following: increased focus on 
distillery operations (including a conscious 
sugar sacrifice in favour of enhance 
ethanol manufacture), debt prepayment, 
manufacture of a superior sugar quality, 
wider utilisation of sugar byproducts and 
backward integration (into co-generated 
power).
Revenue engines
The Company has been among the 
most aggressive investors in its sector 
across three decades. The commitment 
to plough accruals into the business 
made the Company arguably the fastest 
growing modern sugar-based Company 
in India. In the three years ending 
FY2022-23, nearly 40% of the Company’s 
investments were made in the distillery 
business.
The investment in profitable engines paid 
off: the Company’s ethanol business grew 
45% from H 698 Cr in FY2021-22 to  
H1013 Cr in FY2022-23; the core sugar 
business was maintained from H2084 Cr 
in FY2021-22 to H2087 Cr in FY2022-23; 
the cogeneration business grew 12% 
from H106 Cr in FY2021-22 to H119 Cr in 
FY2022-23. The Company expects to grow 
its manufacturing capacity in the ethanol 
business by around  50% by FY2024-25.
The proportion of revenues from ethanol 
manufacture increased 31% in FY2022-
23 and is projected to rise further during 
the current financial year (on a larger 
revenue base), indicating the progressive 
ethanolisation of the Company and 
moderation in sugar. This transition is 
seminal, transforming the Company’s DNA 
towards sustainability.
Hygiene
The Company recognizes the importance 
of financial hygiene (as distinct from 
revenue growth). This issue deals with 
the efficiency of our operating engine 
and is measured best by capital efficiency 
(how much one is able to extract from the 
business compared with what one has 
invested).
New investments
At DBSIL, we believe that we are looking 
at our business from the bottom-end of a 
long J-curve. Our business has multi-year 
growth possibilities; success lies in utilising 
a large part of our earnings in making 
fresh investments that generate a return 
higher than what the Company had 
retained as cash on its books or returned 
to its investors.
The Company invested H821 Cr in the 
business between 2018 and 2022; it 
invested H568 Cr between 2022 and 2023. 
The Company added approximately 8% 
of its gross block in the three years ending 
FY2022-23. More specifically, a large 
part of this investment was deployed in 
enhancing our distillery capacity from 600 
KLPD to 710 KLPD during the last financial 
year.
The full outcome of the 110 KLPD 
Jawaharpur grain distillery will come 
from FY2023-24 onwards. The Company 
is expanding the 110 KLPD Jawaharpur 
distillery to 250 KLPD during FY2023-24. 
The Company will install another 300 
KLPD grain-based distillery in Nigohi, 
which is expected to be commissioned in 
FY2024-25 and whose outcomes will be 
visible from the same year. 
Revenue visibility
At DBSIL, we believe that in a governance-
driven world, there is a premium on 
revenue / surplus visibility. The Company 
has evolved from a sugar-centric business 
model that was completely dependent on 
volatile commodity market movements 
where prospective cash flows could not 
be predicted. By the virtue of having 
invested in distillery operations, marked

by a complete buyback by oil marketing 
companies at stable realisations, there is a 
visibility in terms of revenues.
The only risk on the books is related to 
the cost of cane, which is increased by 
the government on a periodic basis. This, 
in turn, could have outcomes on the 
surplus from sugar operations. It would 
be relevant to indicate that the Company 
moderated its exposure to sugar by 
around 25% during the last year as a 
hedge against sluggish sugar realisations 
(which means that the only net risk on the 
books is an exposure to cane costs, which 
are announced each year applicable to 
the season).
Enduring drivers
The Company believes that some 
underlying realities of the business will 
stay favourable. For instance, ethanol 
demand for automotive fuel blending 
will remain robust in the long-term 
scenario due to the ethanol blending 
programme of the government. Sugar 
as a sweetener is likely to be in demand, 
given the growing nature of India’s 
population and sugar being extensively 
rooted in the culture as a celebratory 
imperative. Besides, co-generated power 
as a renewable energy is likely to become 
increasingly relevant. In view of this, the 
Company’s business model will remain 
valid and relevant from an aggregated 
holistic perspective.
Cane availability: The most important 
growth driver is not the capital asset 
in the manufacturing facilities; it is 
the cane in the fields. Being a cane-
dependent company there is a premium 
on enhancing cane availability year 
after year. The Company makes prudent 
investments in proprietary cane research 
and development, process technology, 
multi-year farmer engagement and 
increased engagement with farmers 
with the objective to generate a growing 
cane outcome each year. The Company 
procured H1811 Cr worth of cane in 
FY2022-23, which was 3% higher than 
the previous financial year. The greater 
the procurement, the larger is the ability 
to drive the most profitable end of the 
business – ethanol. Besides, the Company 
is attractively placed to build its ethanol 
business through a larger diversion of 
cane syrup away from sugar manufacture 
to ethanol manufacture and the prospect 
of manufacturing ethanol through the use 
of grain as feed.
Balanced approach: The Company has 
a balanced approach towards financing 
long term projects within a debt-equity 
ratio of 1.1. The Company aims to keep the 
tenure of loans as high as possible (around 
10 years), taking the pressure off working 
capital management. As at March 31, 2023 
all the long-term debts covered under 
interest subvention scheme/ subsidized 
interest rate scheme. There is a growing 
bias towards investment using the 
earnings generated from the company’s 
business coupled with concessional debt 
from the government (when deployed for 
ethanol manufacture).
Liquidity management: The Company 
generates a larger cash flow than it is able 
to immediately deploy. During the last 
financial year, the Company generated  
H323 Cr in net cash profit (after dividend 
payment). The daily cashflow statements 
were consulted periodically to ensure 
day-to-day liquidity. The Company took 
investment calls and redemption calls 
each day as per plan and implemented 
them accordingly.

Key technological 
achievements   
The Company was among the leading 
sugar companies to invest in steam-saving 
devices.
It adopted the multiple vapour 
recompression-based distillation 
technologies in the Jawaharpur distillery. 
This technology facilitates capacity 
expansion from 110 KLPD to 250 KLPD 
without an additional boiler.
The Company has an online compliance 
management system ‘Sanskriti’.
The Company has a structured digital 
database system.   
Way forward
DBSIL’s focus is directed at enhanced 
ethanol manufacture, leveraging 
low fuel dimension technology. The 
multi-vapour recompression-based 
distillation technology facilitates low fuel 
consumption, low steam consumption, 
higher yield and near-to-low capital 
expenditure.
The Company will proactively examine 
new technologies to stay ahead of the 
curve. The Company is expected to 
enhance digitalisation in three years 
following a gap assessment study by PwC. 
The Company will undertake phase-
wise initiatives based on criticality and 
outcome speed by managing capital 
expenditure.

The Company’s 
Manufactured  
Capital
Asset sweating
Manufactured Capital represents 
one of the most decisive 
competitive advantages at DBSIL. 
The higher the operating efficiency 
the greater the output from a cane 
stick and the better the profitability.
In view of this, the Company 
has invested capabilities and 
competencies in Manufactured 
Capital, establishing the Company’s 
respect as one of most efficient 
sugar companies in India. Over 
the years, the Company enhanced 
the efficiency of its manufactured 
process, warehousing and logistics, 
underlined by a commitment to 
operational safety. The Company is 
dedicated to enhance production 
and product availability through 
responsiveness to opportunities 
as they emerge (organic and 
inorganic). The Company’s 
integration has extended from 
raw material to value-added 
end product, strengthening cost 
leadership.
Asset Sweating
The Company is committed to enhance 
capacity utilisation; the higher the 
capacity utilisation the stronger the 
amortisation of fixed costs and the lower 
the  per unit cost of the end product. This 
represents the basis of the Company’s 
profitability. Over the years, the Company 
resourced capital equipment from its 
units for a second life, strengthening asset 
utilisation, productivity and efficiency.

Quality
At DBSIL, we have consistently invested 
in equipment with the objective to 
strengthen process integrity and product 
quality. These capital investments 
enhanced process stability, plant uptime 
and output quality. The  Company 
installed a rotary dryer in the Nigohi 
unit, installed refineries in Nigohi and 
Jawaharpur, installed dust collection 
system in Jawaharpur and Ramgarh, 
installed an online metal detector in 
Nigohi, Jawaharpur, Ramgarh and 
Kolhapur, and installed stainless steel 
liners in sugar hoppers in Nigohi, 
Jawaharpur and Ramgarh. 
Automation
At DBSIL, the batch pan process has been 
progressively automated with standard 
operating procedures for minimum 
variances. The result is that this leg of 
operations has been marked by lower 
vibrations that could have arisen out of 
human interventions, enhancing uptime 
and output consistency. 
Packaging  
At DBSIL, we have endeavoured to 
moderate the carbon footprint of 
packaging material; the Company ensured 
100% purity in liners and at least 90% 
purity in polypropylene woven bags. The 
Company procured packaging material 
through ISO 9001-certified and foods 
grade vendors (certified). The Company’s 
products are customer-focused through 
distinctive design, customized colours and 
preferred language.

Value chain integration
The Company addressed the entire supply 
chain from the basic stage to the value-
added end. By embracing value-chain 
integration, the Company connected and 
streamlined various stages of the sugar 
production process from sourcing raw 
materials to delivering the final product.
The Company controlled the supply 
chain through backward integration by 
creating a relationship with the farmer 
and managing sugarcane plantations. 
This integration allows the Company 
to influence quality and raw material 
availability, ensuring reliable supply. By 
integrating the value chain, the Company 
minimized dependence on external 
suppliers and reduced disruptions, 
enhancing operational efficiency.
Forward integration enables the Company 
to market and distribute sugar products. 
By establishing a network of distribution 
channels, the Company ensures timely 
delivery to retailers and consumers. 
This integration allows DBSIL to engage 
directly with the consumer, enabling 
a better market understanding and 
responsiveness.
Value chain integration not only optimizes 
operational efficiency but also facilitates 
innovation and diversification. By 
exercising control over multiple stages, 
the Company explores opportunities for 
product development, comprising value-
added sugar derivatives or by-products, 
expanding its portfolio and capturing new 
market segments.
This integration has empowered the 
Company with greater control, efficiency 
and market responsiveness. By integrating 
backward and forward elements, the 
Company has enhanced its competitive 
advantage, ensuring sustainable 
prospects.

The Company’s 
Human Capital
Human Capital      
One of the most under-rated attributes 
in successful business building is culture. 
Culture is generally taken for granted. 
However, a successful culture is built 
around the promoter’s vision, prudent 
people recruitment and the influences 
that they bring, the overarching 
guardrails of what is acceptable within 
the Company and what is not, and 
the overall environment - innovation 
and youthfulness, a commitment 
to outperformance and emerge as 
a sectorial benchmark.  This makes 
culture the most valuable facet of the 
Company’s competitiveness to translate 
into sustained growth, ability to counter 
challenges and the capacity to ride 
growth opportunities the fastest.

from the recruitment to the closure of full 
and final settlement.
Training and development: The 
Company’s training and development 
programmes are conducted by Nalanda, 
Dalmia School of Leadership, Learning 
and Change (LLC). The institute helps 
inspire employees through high impact 
developmental programs that help 
the mind explore new dimensions and 
exercise their true potential. The programs

leaders and their inputs.
Reward and recognition: At Dalmia 
Bharat, we aim to monetarily reward 
individuals for overall performance on key 
responsibility areas and organisational 
performance.
Leadership succession planning: 
Dalmia School of Leadership created and 
groomed a leadership pool through the 
in-house Lakshya Program for passing on 
leadership and critical-to-business roles 
to an employee or group of employees. 
Replacement planning for essential roles 
in a systematic way ensures business 
continuity and the smooth running of 
visualized operations even after the key 
organisational leaders move on to new 
opportunities, retire or pass away. The 
Company undertakes periodic review and 
upgradation of the succession plan to 
ensure its readiness for dynamic changes 
in the organisational structure aligned 
with the strategic organisational planning 
and future growth plans.
Recruitment process: The Company 
attracted meritorious employees for 
approved roles in a timely manner. The 
Company’s employee engagement was 
through the Origin Recognition Complex 
(ORC) employee acquisition module. 
This is applicable for the entire talent 
acquisition process from requisition to the 
issuance of the appointment letter.
Performance management system: 
At DBSIL, we believe that performance 
management is not just a tool to evaluate 
the performance of an individual but also

(i)	 Commodity price risk or foreign exchange risk and hedging activities
Commodities form a major part of business of the Company and hence commodity price risk is one of the important risks for 
the Company. The Company has a robust mechanism in place to protect the Company’s interest from risks arising out of market 
volatility. The Company’s forward integration into cogeneration and distillery helped hedge revenues and moderate dependence 
on sugar for profitability.
Company is exporting large amount of sugar. Most of these exports are done in foreign currency, hence there is a risk of exchange 
rate fluctuation especially in the current volatile scenario. Hence, the Company hedge all the foreign currency exposures.

Global economy 
Overview: Post Pandemic the global economy was estimated 
to have grown at a slower 3.2% rate in 2022, compared to 6% 
in 2021 (which was on a smaller base of 2020 on account of 
the pandemic effect). The relatively slow global growth of 2022 
was marked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, unprecedented 
inflation, pandemic-induced slowdown in China, higher interest 
rates, global liquidity squeeze and quantitative tightening by the 
US Federal Reserve.   
The challenges of 2022 translated into moderated spending, 
disrupted trade and increased energy costs. Global inflation was 
8.8% in 2022, among the highest in decades. US consumer prices 
increased about 6.5% in 2022, the highest in four decades. The 
Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to its highest 
in 15 years. The result is that the world ended in 2022 concerned 
that the following year would be slower.
The global equities, bonds, and crypto assets reported an 
aggregated value drawdown of USD26 trillion from peak, 
equivalent to 26% of the global gross domestic product (GDP). In 
2022, there was a concurrently unique decline in bond and equity 
markets; 2022 was the only year when the S&P 500 and 10-year 
US treasuries delivered negative returns of more than 10%.  
Gross FDI inflows – equity, reinvested earnings and other capital – 
declined 8.4% to $55.3 billion in April-December. The decline was 
even sharper in the case of FDI inflows as equity – these fell 15% 
to $36.75 billion between April and December 2022.  Global trade 
expanded by 2.7% in 2022 (expected to slow to 1.7% in 2023).
The S&P GSCI (benchmark for commodity investments and a 
measure of global commodity performance) fell from a peak of 
4288 in June 2022 to 3233.4. There was a sharp decline in crude 
oil, natural gas, coal, lithium, lumber, cobalt, nickel and urea 
realisations. Brent crude oil dropped from a peak of around USD 
120 per barrel in June 2022 to USD 80 per barrel at the end of 
the calendar year following the enhanced availability of low-cost 
Russian oil.

Outlook: The global economy is projected to grow a weak 2.9% 
in 2023, marked by sustained Russia-Ukraine conflict and higher 
interest rates. Global inflation is projected to be 6.5% in 2023 
(Source: IMF). On the positive side, the reopening of China’s 
economy after the waning of the pandemic, the decline in the 
European energy crisis and robust US consumption (despite 
high inflation) remain positives. Interestingly, even as the global 
economy is projected to grow less than 3% for five years, India 
and China are likely to account for half the global growth in 2023 
(IMF).
Indian economy
Overview: Even as the global conflict remained geographically 
distant from India, ripples comprised increased oil import bills, 
inflation, cautious government and a sluggish equity market. 
India reported an estimated economic growth of 7.2% in FY 2022-
23. India emerged as the second fastest-growing G20 economy 
in FY 2022-23. India had retained its position as the fifth-largest 
global economy and was seen as a principal driver of the global 
economy (with China).

According to the India Meteorological Department, the year 
2022 delivered 6% higher rainfall than the long-period average. 
India’s wheat harvest was expected to rise to around 107 million 
metric tons (MMT) in 2022-23 from 102 MMT in the preceding 
year. Rice production at 122 million metric tons (MMT) was down 
6 percent due to unseasonal rains. Pulses acreage grew 5 percent 
to 154.80 lakh hectares following better monsoon rains. Due to a 
renewed focus, the oilseed area increased by 7.31% from 102.36 
lakh hectares in 2021-22 to 109.84 lakh hectares in 2022-23. India’s 
wheat production in crop year 2022-23 is expected to be 102.9 
million tonnes (mt), less than the government’s estimate of 112 
mt.
India’s auto industry grew 21% in FY23; passenger vehicles (UVs, 
cars and vans) reported impressive growth with retail sales hitting 
a record high of 3.9 million units in FY23, crossing the previous 
high of 3.2 million units in FY19. Commercial vehicles segment 
grew  33%. Two-wheeler sales fell to a seven-year low; the three-
wheeler category grew 84%.

India’s exports (merchandise and services) in April-February 2022-
23 were estimated to have grown 16.18 percent over the same 
period of the previous year. As India’s domestic demand remained 
steady amidst a global slowdown, imports in April-February 
2022-23 were estimated to have grown 19.93 percent over the 
corresponding period of the previous year. India’s exports in 
FY2021-22 were $676 billion and likely to achieve a record $750 
bn in FY23.
Till Q3, FY23, India’s current account deficit, a crucial indicator of 
the country’s balance of payments position, decreased to $18.2 
billion, or 2.2% of GDP from $22.2 billion (2.7% of GDP) a year ago. 
India’s fiscal deficit was estimated in nominal terms at ~ H17.55 
lakh crore and 6.4% of GDP for the year ending March 31, 2023. 
India’s headline foreign direct investment (FDI) numbers rose from 
US$74.01 billion in 2021 to a record $84.8 billion in 2021-22, a 14% 
Y-o-Y increase due to 100% FDI approval via automatic route in 
the Insurance sector, civil aviation, coal sector, telecom, pharma, 
infrastructure. In 2022-23, the government was estimated to have 
addressed 77% of its disinvestment target (H50,000 crore against 
a target of H65,000 crore).  
After three consecutive years of rise, India’s foreign exchange 
reserves declined by around $ 70 billion in 2022 amid rising 
inflation and interest rates. The country’s forex reserves, which 
stood at $606.47 billion on 1 April 2022, declined to $578.44 
billion on March 31, 2023. India’s currency weakened from H75.91 
to a US dollar to H82.34 as on 31 March 2023 due to a stronger 
dollar and weaker current account deficit. 
The country’s retail inflation, measured by the consumer price 
index (CPI), accelerated to 5.66% in March 2023. Inflation data on 
the wholesale Price Index (which calculates the overall prices of 
goods before selling at retail prices) eased to 4.73% during the 
period. In 2022, CPI hit its highest of 7.79% in April 2022; WPI 
reached its highest of 15.88% in May 2022. 
India moved up in the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings 
from 100th in 2017 to 63rd in 2022.
In 2022-23, total receipts (other than borrowings) were estimated 
at 6.5% higher than the Budget estimates. Tax-GDP ratio was 
estimated to have improved by 11.1 percent Y-o-Y in RE 2022-23. 
The total gross collection for FY23 was H18.10 lakh crore, an 
average of H1.51 lakh a month and up 22% from FY22, India’s 
monthly goods and services tax (GST) collections hit the second 
highest ever in March 2023 to H1.6 lakh crore.
For 2022–23, the government collected H16.61 lakh crore in direct 
taxes, according to data from the Finance Ministry. This amount is 
17.6 percent more than what was collected in the previous fiscal. 
Per capita income almost doubled in nine years to H172,000 
during the year under review, a rise of 15.8 percent over the 
previous year. India’s GDP per capita was 2,320 USD (March 2023), 
close to the magic figure of $2500 when consumption spikes 
across countries.  
Outlook: India is expected to grow 6.8% in FY2024, catalysed 
in no small measure by 35% capital expenditure growth by the 
government. The growth could also be driven by broad-based 
credit expansion, better capacity utilisation and improving trade 
deficits. Headline and core inflation rates could trend down. 
Private sector investments could revive.  
According to the World Bank April 2024 projections, India’s GDP 
is projected to expand by 6.3 percent in FY24, supported by 
domestic demand and increased public investment. India’s retail 
inflation rate could decline from 6.6 percent to 5.2 percent in 
FY24.
The global landscape favours India: Europe is moving towards 
a probable recession, the US economy is slowing, China’s GDP 
growth forecast of 4.4% is less than India’s GDP estimate of 6.8% 
and America and Europe are experiencing their highest inflation 
in 40 years.  
India’s production-linked incentive appeared to catalyse 
downstream sectors. Inflation was steady. India was at the cusp 
of making significant investments in renewable energy and 
other sectors and emerging as a suitable industrial supplement 
to China. India was poised to outpace Germany and Japan and 
emerge as the third-largest economy by the end of the decade.  
The outlook for private business investment remained positive 
despite an increase in interest rates. India was less exposed to 
Chinese economic weakness, with much less direct trade with 
China than many Asian peers. As a result, export growth was only 
about 13.81%YoY, quite significant decline from the the 20% in 
the Korean, Taiwanese and Singapore economies. 
Broad-based credit growth, improving capacity utilisation, 
government’s thrust on capital spending and infrastructure 
should bolster investment activity. According to our surveys, 
manufacturing, services and infrastructure sector firms are 
optimistic about the business outlook. The protracted geopolitical 
tensions, tightening global financial conditions and slowing 
external demand are the downside risks. 
Union Budget FY 2023-24 provisions 
The Budget 2022-23 sought to lay the foundation for the future of 
the Indian economy through projects like PM GatiShakti, Inclusive 
Development, Productivity Enhancement & Investment, Sunrise 
Opportunities, Energy Transition and Climate Action, as well as 
Financing of Investments. The capital expenditure of the Indian 
government expanded 35.4% from H5.54 lakh crore to H7.50 lakh 
crore. An outlay of H5.25 lakh crore was made to the Ministry of 
Defence (13.31% of the total Budget outlay). An announcement 
of nearly H20,000 crores was made for the PM Gati Shakti National 
Master Plan to catalyse the infrastructure sector. An expansion of 
25,000 km was initiated for the national highways network. An 
outlay of H1.97 lakh crore was announced for Production Linked 
Incentive schemes across 13 sectors.   
Industry overview
Global sugar sector overview
According to International Sugar Organisation, the second 
revision of the global 2022-23 sugar balance is expected to 
report a surplus of 4.151 million tonnes compared to a deficit of 
2.247 million tonnes in 2021-22. The global sugar production is 
pegged at 180.431 million tonnes in 2022-23 while global sugar 
consumption is placed at 176.280 million tonnes. 
Trade dynamics are the major factors influencing market price 
outlook. The harvests in the southern hemisphere extended 
beyond their normal finishing dates, providing additional supply 
to the 2022-23 balance. Besides, growing global exports resulted 
in a shorter than expected impact on global trade flows. 
The Indian government’s hesitation to commit to additional 
export licensing in 2022-23 moderated export prospects. Global 
export availability during the 2022-23 season was estimated at 
64.55 million tonnes, while import demand increased to 63.863 
million tonnes. The trade surplus for 2022-23 sugar season stood 
at 0.7 million tonnes compared to a surplus of 0.4 million tonnes 
in 2021-22 sugar season. Changes in global stocks will balance the 
difference between production/ consumption surplus and trade 
balance. In 2022-23, International Sugar Organisation estimates 
global stocks could rise to 103.4 million tonnes from 99.92 million 
tonnes at the beginning of the season. By implication, the ending 
stocks/consumption ratio for 2022-23 increased to 58.65% from 
57.17% at the end of 2021-22.
A major importer like China is expected to draw down its stocks 
to meet its domestic consumption needs instead of importing; 
while India’s reduced production levels are anticipated to lower its 
stocks and Thailand is expected to decrease its stocks to support 
higher exports driven by strong global demand.
(Source: International Sugar Organization)
Brazil: Production is expected to increase by 2.6 million tons to 
38.1 million as favorable weather conditions are anticipated to 
result in higher cane availability for crushing. However, the total 
harvested area is expected to decline as marginal sugarcane areas 
switch to soybeans and corn. Consumption levels are expected to 
remain the same while exports are projected to rise due to higher 
supplies. Additionally, stocks are estimated to double with the 
increase in production.
China: Production of sugar is expected to increase by 400,000 
tons to reach 10.0 million driven by higher production levels of 
both cane sugar and beet sugar. Assuming that COVID-related 
restrictions ease, consumption levels are projected to rise. 
However, imports are expected to decrease due to high global 
sugar prices as stockpiling is encouraged instead.
USA: Production is projected to remain steady at 8.2 million tons. 
Meanwhile, sugar imports are expected to decline by 6 per cent 
to 3.1 million tons, based on projected quota programs set at 
minimum levels that are consistent with World Trade Organization 
and free-trade agreement obligations as well as on anticipated 
imports from Mexico, re-exports and high-tier tariff imports.
Thailand: Sugar production is forecast to increase by 0.34 million 
tons to reach 10.5 million tons, while consumption is expected to 
rise in line with the anticipated economic recovery. Additionally, 
exports are expected to increase due to larger exportable 
supplies. However, stocks are projected to drop sharply following 
strong exports.

production. The sector provides direct employment to more 
than 50 million people including farmers, mill workers and 
transporters. India’s sugar industry operates in the organized 
and unorganized sectors. The organized sector comprises sugar 
factories that process sugarcane into refined sugar and by-
products like molasses, bagasse and press mud. The unorganized 
sector includes traditional produce like gur (jaggery) and 
khandsari (semi processed sugar). Sugarcane is the primary raw 
material for sugar production in India; the country has among the 
largest global areas under sugarcane cultivation. Uttar Pradesh, 
Maharashtra and Karnataka are the top sugarcane producing 
states in India.
In Sugar Season (SS) 2022-23, Indian sugar mills are expected to 
produce around 32.80 million metric tons of sugar. Around 532 
sugar mills operated in 2022-23 compared to 518 operational mills 
during the previous season. India produced 35.8 million metric 
tons of milled sugar during the 2021-22 SS. Sugar consumption is 
expected to remain at the same level whereas sugar exports are 
expected to drop to 6.2 million metric tonnes. This is expected to 
tighten the net sugar Balance Sheet with expected closing stock 
levels at around 6.1 million metric tonne as against an opening 
stock of 7.0 million metric tonnes.
Unseasonal rains and a higher portion of ratoon cane in key 
production areas like Maharashtra and Karnataka resulted in 
drastically lowered agricultural yields, mainly in the Marathwada 
region. These regions reported a drop in sugar yields as high as 
35% from the previous season. With a slightly higher diversion 
of juice, a drop down of 44 bps in recovery is expected from 
Maharashtra.
India’s sugar consumption is likely to touch 27.5 million metric 
tonnes in SS 2022-23 which is slightly higher than the previous 
year. (Source: fas.usda.gov, Economic times)

Indian cane cost trends
The Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) is the price that mills are required by law to pay sugarcane farmers for their crops. For the sugar 
season in India (October 2022 - September 2023), the government has increased the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane to 
H3050 per metric tonne (USD $38.3/MT), which is H150 per MT higher than the 2021-22 season.
To protect the interests of sugarcane farmers, the government has decided that there will be no deduction in payment for farmers 
whose sugarcane is processed in mills with a recovery rate below 9.5%.

State-wise analysis
Uttar Pradesh: Sugarcane cultivation area in Uttar Pradesh 
increased by 3% to reach 23.8 lac hectares in 2022-23 SS compared 
to 23.1 lac hectares in 2021-22 SS. Agricultural yield of plant cane 
has improved as ratoon yield in western regions was down by 
5-7% due to pest infestation. A drop in 35-40 bps in sucrose yield 
was reported in 2022-23 SS on account of a higher diversion of 
syrup and B-heavy towards ethanol production. The state’s sugar 
output is expected to enhance slightly to 10.5 million tonnes in 
2022-23 SS compared to 10.2 million tonnes in 2021-22 SS.
Maharashtra: Sugarcane acreage in Maharashtra increased by 
almost 7% to 14.5 lac hectares in 2022-23 SS compared to 13.5 
lac hectares in 2021-22 SS. Despite this, Maharashtra’s sugar 
output is expected to decline to 10.5 million tonnes in 2022-23 
SS compared to 13.7 million tonnes in 2021-22 SS. Maharashtra 
reported a rise in acreage continuously in the last two seasons. 
Strikingly, ratoon percentage in some of the main cane producing 
zones like Ahmednagar and Marathwada was 65-70% of the 
total acreage. Unseasonal and un-even distribution of rains in 
the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods led to a decline in 
agricultural yields during 2022-23 SS. A slightly higher diversion 
of syrup and B-Heavy impacted overall drop down in net sugar 
output in the state.
Karnataka: Sugarcane acreage in Karnataka is expected to 
enhance by 11% to reach 6.5 lac hectares compared to 5.9 lac 
hectares in 2021-22. Northern Karnataka accounts for almost 
80-85% of net cane weightage. Cane production in this region 
reduced significantly due to uneven rains. Further, enhanced 
crushing capacities in the state, reduced the length of the season 
and reportedly less matured cane got harvested resulting into 
lowered crush and recovery. During the last two-three seasons, 
several mills have enhanced their distillation capacities as well as 
installed new ones which resulted in further increase in diversion 
towards growing ethanol production. An overall decline in sugar 
output at levels of 5.7 million tonnes in 2022-23 SS is expected, 
compared to 6.2 million tonnes in 2021-22 SS. (Source: fas.usda.

Sectorial demand drivers
Population growth: India’s population has grown from 555.2 
million in 1970 to 1.41 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach 
1.67 billion by 2050, catalysing sugar consumption
(Source: Indianexpress.com, Weforum.org)
Confectionary segment growth: In 2023, the confectionary 
segment in India generated revenues of US$ 43.97 billion and 
is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 7.63% (2023-27). The bakery industry in India is anticipated to 
grow at a CAGR of 9.6% during 2023-28.
(Source: Statista.com, Expertmarketresearch.com,)
Robust soft drink consumption: In 2022, the sales volume of 
carbonated soft drinks is projected to reach around 5.5 billion litres, 
which is slightly more than 4 litres per capita per year. However, 
the trend is likely to drive the growth of sugar consumption.

Government initiatives
In the sugar export policy for SS 2022-23, the government has 
implemented a system that assigns export quotas to sugar mills 
based on their average production in the last three years as well

as the average sugar production of the country in the same time 
period. This policy is aimed at ensuring that the export of sugar 
is conducted in a fair and efficient manner, while also taking into 
account the overall production capacity of the country.
By assigning quotas based on production averages, the 
government is able to encourage efficient sugar production and 
export practices among the mills, while also preventing any one 
of the mill from dominating the export market and to promote 
healthy competition within the industry, which ultimately benefit 
both the mills and the consumers.
Overall, the sugar export policy for SS 2022-23 appears to be a 
well-thought-out system that takes into account the needs and 
concerns of all stakeholders involved in the sugar production and 
export process.
The government has set a goal to provide financial assistance 
to cover various marketing costs incurred by sugar mills. These 
costs include expenses related to handling, upgrading, and other 
operational aspects of the production process, as well as both 
international and domestic transportation costs.

Indian ethanol sector overview
The government’s ethanol program promotes the use of 
ethanol as a fuel for transportation and reducing the country’s 
dependence on imported crude oil. The program was launched 
in 2003 and Since then, the government has taken several steps 
to promote the production and use of ethanol. India is projected 
to become the world’s third-largest ethanol market after US and 
Brazil by 2026 as per the International Energy Agency report.
The Indian ethanol program has several benefits. One, it reduces 
the country’s dependence on imported crude oil. Second, it helps 
reduce air pollution by reducing emissions from vehicles. Third, it 
provides an additional source of income for farmers who can sell 
their sugarcane or other crops for ethanol production. In India, 
the practice of blending ethanol with petrol has significantly 
benefited the sugar industry by reducing its cyclical nature.
The Indian government’s target for blending ethanol with 
petrol has been revised upwards. The current target requires the 
country to achieve a 20% ethanol blending ratio by 2025 from 
the 10.02% achieved in ESY 2021-22. To achieve these targets, the 
government has implemented a range of measures to promote 
the production and use of ethanol in India. These measures 
include:
	
Pricing and fiscal incentives to encourage the production of 
ethanol from sugarcane, corn and other feedstocks
	
Mandating the use of a minimum percentage of ethanol 
in petrol
	
Establishing a national biofuels policy to provide a framework 
for the development of the biofuels industry in India.
	
Encouraged the use of other feedstocks such as rice, corn 
and biomass for ethanol production
	
Providing subsidies and financial incentives for the 
installation of ethanol production capacities.
The country achieved 10.02% ethanol blending in ESY  2021-
2022, five months ahead of schedule and is expected to achieve 
12% blending in ESY 2022-23. Starting from April 1, 2023, all 
passenger vehicles produced in India will need to comply with 
E20 standards, they can run on a 20% ethanol blend which is 
expected to help India achieve the goal of using a 20% ethanol 
blend by 2025.
India’s fuel ethanol program is currently the fastest growing 
ethanol program in the world. The government’s push towards 
the increasing use of renewable fuels, coupled with the country’s 
abundant sugarcane and grain resources has resulted in a 
significant increase in ethanol production in recent years. The 
government implemented the Indian Biofuel policy to promote 
the production and use of biofuels in the country. The policy was 
first announced in 2009 and was subsequently updated in 2018 
with the objective of reducing India’s dependence on imported 
fossil fuels, improving energy security and promoting sustainable 
development. The policy encourages investment in research and 
development to improve the efficiency of biofuel production 
processes and to develop new feedstocks and technologies for 
biofuel production. The policy provides for the establishment of 
biofuel corridors and biofuel hubs to promote the distribution 
and use of biofuels. The policy emphasizes the importance of 
sustainability in the production, use of biofuels and set standards 
for feedstock, production processes and greenhouse gas 
emissions.
The government has announced an increase in ethanol 
procurement prices for the marketing year starting from 1st 
December 2022 to 31st October 2023. The increase in prices varies 
for different types of ethanol. The procurement price for ethanol 
manufactured from C-heavy molasses has been increased by 
5.9%, from H46.66 to H49.41 per litre. The procurement price for 
ethanol manufactured from B-heavy molasses has been increased 
by 2.8%, from H59.08 to H60.73 per litre. The procurement price 
for ethanol manufactured from cane juice has been increased by 
3.4%, from H63.45 to H65.61 per litre.
India has set an ambitious target to increase its ethanol 
production capacity to around 15 billion litres, which will require 
substantial capacities to be installed. Many sugar companies have 
already set up dual-feed ethanol plants that use corn and grains 
along with sugarcane and molasses to increase production. 
The Indian ethanol program has been successful in promoting 
the use of ethanol as a fuel additive with ethanol blending 
rates steadily increasing. However, there are still challenges to 
be addressed related to the availability of feedstock, storage 
infrastructure, distribution of ethanol and investments in research 
and development.
It is expected that ethanol production capacity will reach 
around 12 billion litres by 2025, which is a significant increase 
from the current levels. The sugar mills and distilleries are free to 
establish ethanol plants after obtaining statutory clearances. The 
government has already notified an interest subvention scheme 
to help in the establishment of these plants.

Indian co-generation sector overview
The crushing of sugarcane results in the production of bagasse, 
which can be used for power cogeneration. By utilizing bagasse 
efficiently, along with minimizing transmission and distribution 
losses, the energy source offers several benefits, including zero 
carbon emissions, lower fuel costs, fuel diversity and enhanced 
energy security. Overall, it represents a cleaner alternative to 
traditional energy sources. With the growing awareness of 
quality, sugar manufacturers anticipate significant growth in the 
domestic market for refined sugar.
In November 2022, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy 
announced the National Bioenergy Program with a budget of 
H1715 crore for the period from 01.04.2021 to 31.03.2026. India has 
an installed capacity of 10,232 MW for biomass power, bagasse 
cogeneration and non-bagasse cogeneration plants. The states of 
Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh together account for almost 45% 
of the total installed capacity.

DBSIL’s distillery business
Overview
The company increased its distillery production to 17.08 Crores 
Litres from 11.71 Crores Litres in the FY 2022-23. The allotment of 
the ethanol tender quantity for the Ethanol Year 22-23 was 15.04 
Crores litres, compared to the previous year’s 11.60 Crores litres. 
With its current expanded capacity, the company is expected to 
sell around 17.23 Crores litres of Ethanol/ENA annually.
Strengths
	
The distilleries operated at almost full capacity utilization.
	
The Company had the ability to manufacture multiple types 
of alcohol, including ethanol, rectified spirit, and extra-
neutral alcohol.

DBSIL is executing the strategy of becoming water positive and improve soil carbon content. Currently, half of the land in 
the Company’s catchment area has low organic carbon content (< 0.5%). The Company aims to increase and maintain the 
soil organic carbon in medium range (0.5% - 0.75%) by 2030. The Company aims to increase the soil carbon content through 
recommended doses in organic manures / compost and intervention through animal husbandry programme for domestic 
animals. The Company plans to use green manure crops, undertake crop rotation, and eliminate the burning of crop residue.
The water table in the Company’s catchment area in Uttar Pradesh has depleted by 2 metres in ten years. To address this 
concern, the Company aims to become 10x water positive by 2025. The Company will work with 200,000 sugarcane cultivators 
in reducing their annual ground water consumption by 500 KL per hectare by 2030, with annual conservation potential of 25 
billion litres.
Soil carbon content and water are the two most critical elements for sustainable sugarcane cultivation. By addressing both 
critical elements, DBSIL is also ensuring sustainable livelihoods and income for farmers.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
In this rapidly changing environment the Company is adapting and responding to issues that matter the most to business and 
stakeholders. It is constantly working on understanding these issues as they help us define strategic priorities and report issues of 
interest to stakeholders. To identify and subsequently validate the material issues, the Company first creates a bucket list of potential 
material aspects by analysing the material issues of peer companies through the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Furthermore, the Company engages with stakeholder groups to understand views and 
concerns on identified material issues. This helps the Company in defining these material aspects and fabricating a path for long-
term value creation. The assessment makes it possible to shortlist and prioritize material elements and group them under four 
pillars: empowering people, responsible consumption, responsible growth and business ethics and sustainable business practices.
2.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Yes, the stakeholder consultation is important to identify the areas of concern in environment and social sectors. The Company’s 
major stakeholder is the farmers/suppliers/community around us. The main concern is soil health and water conservation, being 
an agrarian community. Hence, the Company is working extensively on soil health management and efficient water usage with 
water conservation, while promoting better agricultural practices for superior yield through the cane department and corporate 
social responsibility initiative. The Company considers unemployment as a concern and operates skill training centres that provide 
placement-linked, short-term skill training programs to the youth.
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
The Company undertakes cane development activities and provides necessary guidance to marginalized cane growers with regards 
to the selection of the right variety of propagation materials, agri-inputs and agronomical practices, support in setting-up farmyard 
manure units, vermicomposting units, provide solar operated sprayers, among others. The promotion of energy-efficient cooking 
methods and the installation of solar lighting has particularly benefited the women and children of the communities. Women 
Self Help Groups are promoted and skills development training sessions (stitching and weaving, Moonj craft, among others) are 
conducted to create additional avenues of income generation for them. Also maternal, neonatal and adolescent health camps 
are run periodically. Many school intervention programmes have been implemented and remedial education centres have been 
established for children. The construction of individual sanitary latrines in line with ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’ and ‘Swachh Vidyalaya 
Abhiyaan’ benefitted the local community. Skill training centers (ITI and DIKSHa) are being run to ensure skill development, 
enhancing the employability of the local youth.

materials are procured from sources close to the units, the Company minimizes transportation costs. A significant proportion of the 
cane is supplied by small and medium-scale farmers through bullock-driven carts, reducing pollution.
The Company strives to procure materials and services from local suppliers. Majority of the sugarcane is purchased from local 
farmers (including small and medium scale-farmers) based in the units allotted to the respective areas by the cane commissioner.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of 
Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of 
Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss including Other Comprehensive 
Income, the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement 
of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to 
the financial statements including a summary of significant 
accounting 
policies 
and 
other 
explanatory 
information 
(hereinafter referred to as “the financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, 
as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a 
true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company 
as at March 31, 2023 and its profit and other comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended 
on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance 
with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the 
Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion on the financial statements.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw your attention to note 48 to the financial statements, 
regarding the approval of the Scheme of Arrangement between 
Himshikhar Investment Limited (the “Transferror Company” or 
“HIL”) and the Company and their respective shareholders for 
transfer of the transferor company (the ‘Scheme’) received from 
the National Company Law Tribunal vide its Order dated June 
10, 2022, from appointed date of April 1, 2021. However, the 
accounting treatment pursuant to the Scheme has been given 
effect to from the date required under Ind AS 103 - Business 
Combinations, which is the beginning of the preceding period 
from April 1, 2021. Accordingly, the figures for the year ended 
March 31, 2022, have been restated to give effect to the aforesaid 
merger.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of above matters.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
(1) Determination of net realizable value of inventory of 
sugar as at the year ended March 31, 2023 (Refer note 8 
& 36 to the Financial Statements)
 
As on March 31, 2023, the Company has inventory of sugar 
with the carrying value H671.85 Crores. The inventory of sugar 
is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
 
We considered the inventory valuation of sugar as a key 
audit matter given the relative size of the balance in the 
financial statements and significant judgment involved in 
the consideration of factors such as minimum sale price, 
monthly quota, fluctuation in selling prices and the related 
notifications of the Government in determination of net 
realizable value.
Our procedures included the following:
• 
We understood and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of controls as established by the management 
in determination of net realizable value of inventory of sugar.
• 
Assessing the appropriateness of Company’s accounting 
policy for valuation of finished goods and compliance of the 
policy with the requirements of the prevailing accounting 
standards.
• 
We considered various factors including the actual selling 
price prevailing around and subsequent to the year-
end, minimum selling price, monthly quota and other 
notifications of the Government of India, initiatives taken by 
the Government with respect to sugar industries.

Other Information
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual Report but does not include the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained during 
the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
Responsibilities of the Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of 
the financial position, financial performance including other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows 
of the Company in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act, read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, 
as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken based on these financial 
statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) 
of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal financial 
controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
•	
Compared the cost of the finished goods with the estimated 
net realizable value and checked if the finished goods were 
recorded at net realizable value where the cost was higher 
than the net realizable value.
(2)	 Litigations Matters & Contingent Liabilities (Refer note 
32 of the Financial Statements)
	
The Company is subject to claims and litigations. Major 
risks identified by the Company in that area relate to claims 
against the Company and taxation matters. The amounts of 
claims and litigations may be significant and estimates of the 
amounts of provisions or contingent liabilities are subject to 
significant management judgment.
	
Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters, 
management’s 
judgment 
regarding 
recognition 
and 
measurement of provisions for these legal proceedings is 
inherently uncertain and might change over time as the 
outcomes of the legal cases are determined and it has been 
considered as a key audit matter.
Our procedures included the following:
•	
Assessing the procedures implemented by the Company to 
identify and gather the risks it is exposed to.
•	
Discussion with the management on the development in 
these litigations during the year ended March 31, 2023.
•	
Obtaining an understanding of the risk analysis performed by 
the Company, with the relating supporting documentation 
and studying written statements from internal/ external 
legal experts, when applicable.
•	
Verification that the accounting and/ or disclosures as the 
case may be in the financial statements is in accordance with 
the assessment of legal counsel/ management.
•	
Obtaining representation letter from the management on 
the assessment of those matters as per SA 580 (revised)-
written representations.
(3)	 Calculation of deferred tax liability on the basis of dual 
rates (Refer note 28 to the Financial Statements)
	
From the financial year commencing April 1, 2019, the 
Government of India Promulgated the Taxation Laws 
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 (enacted into Taxation Laws) 
(Amendment) Act, 2019) has introduced Section 115BAA of 
the Income Tax Act 1961 in which companies can opt for 
lower tax rate based on certain conditions such as foregoing 
exemptions/deductions including deduction under chapter 
VI A and foregoing the benefits of MAT credit entitlement. 
	
As per Para 47 of Ind AS 12 and clarifications given in bulletin 
no 23 of ITFG, where a company expects to avail of the 
lower tax rate only from a later financial year it should apply 
the lower tax rate in measurement of deferred taxes only to 
the extent that the deferred tax assets are expected to be 
realized or deferred tax liabilities are expected to be settled 
in the periods during which the Company expects to be 
subject to lower tax rate. To the extent deferred tax assets are 
expected to be realized or deferred tax liabilities are expected 
to be settled in earlier periods, the normal tax rate should be 
applied.
	
Based on the assessment made by the Company, deferred tax 
liability/Assets has been calculated on the basis of dual tax 
rates as may be applicable in future. Measurement of deferred 
tax assets & liabilities has resulted in reversal of deferred tax 
liability of H NIL (Previous Year H42.46 Crores)
Our procedures included the following:
•	
Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness 
of key controls implemented by the Company over 
recognition of deferred tax assets based on the assessment 
of Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable profits in 
foreseeable future allowing the use of deferred tax assets.
•	
Considered the relevant accounting standards and 
clarifications given by ITFG for recognition of deferred 
tax assets and liabilities based on the tax rates expected 
to be applied at the time of reversal and assessed the 
appropriateness of the recognition of deferred tax assets/
liabilities. 
•	
Evaluated the management’s assessment for complying 
with the prescribed conditions as mentioned in the relevant 
notification issues by income Tax department.
•	
Understood and verified the assumptions taken for 
preparation of future profit projections, utilization of MAT 
Credit and for migration to new tax regime as prepared by 
the management.
•	
Tested the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations 
performed by the management.
•	
Evaluated management’s assessment of time period 
available for adjustment of such deferred tax assets as per 
provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and appropriateness 
of the accounting treatment with respect to the recognition 
of deferred tax assets as per requirements of Ind AS 12, 
Income Taxes.
•	
Evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosures made in 
the financial statements in respect of deferred tax assets.

transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
   We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
	
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
	
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Other Matter
The Company has prepared these financial statement after giving 
effect to the Scheme of Amalgamation of Himshikhar Investment 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, with the Company with an 
appointed date of April 1, 2021 (the “Scheme”) and accordingly the 
audited financial statement of the Company for the year ended 
March 31, 2022 have been restated as per the requirements of 
Ind AS 103 to include the audited financial statement of erstwhile 
Himshikhar Investment Limited for the above periods. We did 
not audit the audited financial statement and other financial 
information of Himshikhar Investment Limited which, without 
giving effect to elimination of intra-group transactions, reflect 
total assets of H 200.28 crore as at March 31, 2022, total revenues 
of H2.08 crore, total net profit after tax of H2.10 crore and total 
comprehensive losses of H8.17 crore for the year ended March 31, 
2022 and net cash inflows amounting to H 0.11 crore for the year 
ended March 31, 2022. These audited financial statement and 
other information were reviewed by other auditor whose report 
had been furnished to us.
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited 
(‘the Company’)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act”) and referred to in paragraph 2(f) of ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ of 
our report of even date
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2023, in conjunction with our audit of 
the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on 
that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”. These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the 
Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls 
both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to the financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to the financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to the 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to the 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to the Financial Statements
A Company’s’ internal financial control with reference to the 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A Company’s’ internal financial control with reference to the 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to the Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to the financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable 
inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the 
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets & liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and the risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis as 
explained above, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 102, leasing transactions 
that are within the scope of Ind AS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, 
such as net realizable value in Ind AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36.
3.	 Significant accounting policies
A.	 Property, plant and equipment and Capital work-in-progress
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost net of tax/ duty credit availed, less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an asset includes the purchase cost of materials including import duties and non-
refundable taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to the location and condition of its intended use. Interest 
on borrowings used to finance the construction of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of the asset until such time that 
the asset is ready for its intended use. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is 
included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.
	
When significant part of the property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company derecognized 
the replaced part and recognized the new parts with its own associated useful life and it is depreciated accordingly. Likewise when 
a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 
recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance cost are recognized in the statement of the profit and loss as 
incurred.
	
Internally manufactured property, plant and equipment are capitalised at factory cost.
	
Capital work in progress include property plant & equipment under installation/under development as at the balance sheet date 
and are carried at cost, comprising direct cost, related incidental expenses and attributable borrowing cost.
	
Property, plant and equipment are derecognised from the financial statement, either on disposal or when no economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal. Losses arising in the case of retirement of property, plant and equipment and gain or losses arising 
from disposal of property, plant and equipment are a recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year of occurrence.
	
For transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and equipment, 
except Land, recognised as of April 1, 2016 (transition date) measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its 
deemed cost as of the transition date. For Land the Company has elected to use Fair Value at the transition to Ind AS and use this 
value as its deemed cost.

at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period. Although these estimates are 
based upon the Management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Difference between the actual results and estimates are recognized in the period in which the results are known / materialized.
	
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods
	
a.	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
	
The useful life and residual value of plant, property equipment and intangible assets are determined based on technical 
evaluation made by the management of the expected usage of the asset, the physical wear and tear and technical or 
commercial obsolescence of the asset. Due to the judgements involved in such estimations, the useful life and residual value 
are sensitive to the actual usage in future period. The management evaluates and reviews the pattern of expected economic 
benefits from the asset along with commensurate method of depreciation on periodic basis and decides to follow suitable 
method of charging depreciation.
	
b. 	 Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations
	
The cost of the leave encashment, defined benefit plan and other post-employment benefits and the present value of such 
obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and attrition rate. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are periodically reviewed at each reporting 
date.
	
c. 	 Fair value measurement of financial instruments
	
When the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on the 
quoted market price in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation technique. The input to these models 
are taken from the observable market wherever possible, but where this is not feasible, a review of judgment is required in 
establishing fair values. Changes in assumption relating to these assumptions could affect the fair value of financial instrument.
	
d. 	 Provision for litigations and contingencies
	
The provision for litigations and contingencies are determined based on evaluation made by the management of the present 
obligation arising from past events the settlement of which is expected to result in outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits, which involves judgements around estimating the ultimate outcome of such past events and measurement of the 
obligation amount.
	
e. 	 Impairment of financial and non-financial assets
	
The impairment provision for financial assets is based on assumptions about risk of default and expected losses. The Company 
uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Company’s 
past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a Non-financial asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable 
amount which is higher of an asset’s or Cash generating unit (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Where 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount.
	
F.	
Fair value measurement
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
•	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
•	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the 
asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

Where the Company is the lessee
	
Finance leases are capitalized as assets at the commencement of the lease, at an amount equal to the fair value of leased asset or 
present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, valued at the inception date. Lease payments are apportioned 
between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are recognized as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable 
to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the Company’s general policy on borrowing cost. A 
leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the 
lease term.
	
Payment made under operating leases are recognized as expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over 
the lease term, unless the receipts are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s 
expected inflationary cost increase.
	
Where the Company is the lessor
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as 
operating leases. Where the escalation of lease rentals is in line with the expected general inflation so as to compensate the lessor 
for expected inflationary cost, the increases in the rentals is not straight lined.
F.	
Government grants
	
Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant would be received and the 
Company would comply with all the conditions attached with them.
	
Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current 
assets are recognised as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis 
over the useful lives of the related assets.
	
Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving 
immediate financial support to the Company with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they 
become receivable.
	
The benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference 
between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates.
G.	 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost 
of such asset till such time that is required to complete and prepare the asset to get ready for its intended use. A qualifying asset is 
one that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that the Company incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs also include exchange differences to 
the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
	
All other borrowing costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.
H.	 Segment accounting and reporting
	
The chief operational decision maker monitors the operating results of its business segments separately for the purpose of making 
decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit and loss and 
is measured consistently with profit and loss in the financial statements.
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker 
(CODM).
	
The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are in line with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and 
presenting the Financial Statements of the Company as a whole. In addition, the following specific accounting policies have been 
followed for segment reporting:
•	
Segment revenue includes sales and other income directly identifiable with / allocable to the segment including inter segment 
transfers.
	
Inter segment transfers are accounted for based on the transaction price agreed to between the segments which is at cost in 
case of transfer of Company`s intermediate and final products and estimated realisable value in case of by-products.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023
B.	 Investment Property
	
Investment properties are properties, either land or building or both, held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including 
property under construction for such purposes). Investment properties are measured initially at cost including transactions costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured in accordance with requirement for cost model.
	
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and 
no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated 
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period 
in which the property is de-recognised.
C.	 Intangible assets
	
Intangible asset are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to 
the entity and the cost of asset can be measured reliably.
	
Capital expenditure on purchase and development of identifiable assets without physical substance is recognized as intangible 
assets in accordance with principles given under Ind AS-38 – Intangible Assets.
	
Internally generated intangible asset, excluding capitalized development cost, are not capitalized and the related expenditure is 
reflected in statement of profit & loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
	
The useful lives of intangible asset are assed as either finite or indefinite. The amortization period and the amortization method for 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful 
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets are considered to modify the 
amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, if not amortised, but are tested for impairment either individually or at the cash 
generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues 
to be supportable. Currently there are no intangible assets with indefinite useful life.
	
Gain or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit & loss when the asset is derecognised.
D.	 Depreciation and amortization
	
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Intangible assets is calculated on the basis of useful lives as prescribed 
under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The following methods of depreciation are used for PPE and Intangible assets:
A.	
Plant and machinery
	
Sugar, Cogeneration and Distillery Segment (Excluding 
Sanitizer)
Written down value method
	
Sanitizer 
100% depreciation charged in the year of purchase
	
Situated at Salem (excluding earth moving machinery) 
Wind Farm and MLCC division
Straight line method 
B.	
Leasehold land
Amortised over the period of lease, i.e., 99 years
C.	
Computer software
Amortised over a period of 3-5 years on a Straight line basis.
D.	
Other intangible assets
Amortised over a period of maximum 10 years on a straight line 
basis.
E.	
Capital Spares
Based on technical estimates by the management depreciated on 
straight line method over a period of 10 years.
F.	
Remaining  Property Plant and equipment
Straight Line Method 
E.	 Leases
	
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception 
of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to 
sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess 
of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the 
non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized at the date of de-recognition.
	
Assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. 
Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
	
Assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other 
assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities 
in the balance sheet.
	
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
•	
Represent as separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,
•	
Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
	
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as profit or loss before/ after tax 
from discontinued operations in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Additional disclosures are provided in note 31. All other notes to the financial statements mainly include amounts for continuing 
operations, unless otherwise mentioned.
L.	 Financial Instruments
	
(a)	 Financial Assets
	
	
i.	
Classification
	
The Company classified financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value though other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) on the basis of its business model for managing the financial 
assets and contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
	
	
ii.	
Initial Recognition and Measurement
	
The financial assets include equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, loans and advances, cash and bank 
balances and derivative financial instruments. All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of 
the financial asset.
	
	
iii.	 Subsequent Measurement
	
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement the financial assets are classified in three categories:
•	
At amortised cost - For debt instruments only.
•	
At fair value through profit & loss account
•	
At fair value through other comprehensive income
	
	
iv.	 Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
	
A Financial Asset i.e. a debt instrument is measured at the amortized cost if both the following condition are met.
•	
The assets is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flow 
(business model test), and
•	
Contractual terms of the assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principle and 
interest (SPPI) on the principle amount outstanding (contractual cash flow characteristics).
	
After initial measurement (at Fair value minus transaction cost), such financial assets are subsequently measurement 
at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount and premium and fee or costs that are an integral part of an EIR. The EIR amortization is included 
in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023
•	
Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are identified to segments on the basis of their relationship to the operating activities 
of the segment. Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which relate to the Company as a whole and are not allocable to 
segments on direct and/or on a reasonable basis, have been disclosed as “Unallocable”
I.	
Employee benefits
	
Expenses and liabilities in respect of employee benefits are recorded in accordance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS)-19 - 
‘Employee Benefits’.
	
a.	
Short-term employee benefits
	
Short-term employee benefits in respect of salaries and wages, including non-monetary benefits are recognised as an expense 
at the undiscounted amount in the statement of profit and loss for the year in which the related service is rendered.
	
b.	
Defined contribution plan
	
Retirement benefits in the form of provident fund, pension fund, superannuation fund and ESI are a defined contribution 
scheme and the contributions are charged to the statement of profit and loss of the year when the contributions to the 
respective funds are due. There are no other obligations other than the contribution payable to the provident fund/trust.
	
c.	
Defined benefit plan
	
Retirement benefits in the form of gratuity and provident fund contribution to Dalmia Cement Provident Fund Trust are defined 
benefit plans. Gratuity is provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on projected unit credit method made at the end 
of each financial year. Contributions to Dalmia Cement Provident Fund Trust are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of 
the year when the contributions to the fund is due.
	
The Company’s liabilities on account of gratuity and earned leaves on retirement of employees are determined at the end 
of each financial year on the basis of actuarial valuation certificates obtained from registered actuary in accordance with the 
measurement procedure as per Indian Accounting Standard 19 (Ind AS 19) ‘Employee Benefits’. Gratuity liability is funded on 
year-to-year basis by contribution to respective fund. The costs of providing benefits under these plans are also determined on 
the basis of actuarial valuation at each year end. Actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit plans are recognized through 
OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee benefit. 
The Company measures the expected cost of such absenteeism as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result 
of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The Company treats accumulated leave expected 
to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes. Such long term 
compensated absences are provided for based on actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation is done as per projected unit 
credit method at the year-end.
J.	
Inventories
a.	
Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. In case of Dead Burnt Magnesite Dust Stocks to the extent 
these are considered saleable, valuation is done at raw materials cost plus packing charges or net realizable value, whichever 
is lower. By-products (including final molasses) are valued at net realisable value. B Heavy molasses is valued at derived values 
based on proportionate sugar content. Cost includes direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads 
based on normal operating capacity. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
b.	
Work in progress is valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
c.	
Stores, Spares and Raw Materials are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. However materials & other items of 
inventories held for use in the production are not written below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated 
are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
d.	
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
K.	 Assets (or disposal group) held for sale and discontinued operation
	
Assets (or disposal group) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. Assets held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.

iv.	 Financial Liability at amortised cost
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) Method. Gain and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are 
derecognised.
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and transaction cost. The EIR 
amortization is included as finance cost in the statement of profit and loss.
	
This category generally applies to loans & borrowings.
	
	
v.	
Financial Liability at FVTPL
	
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either contingent consideration recognised by 
the Company as an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies or is held for trading or it is designated 
as at FVTPL.
	
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit 
or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability
	
	
vi.	 Equity Instruments
	
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company entity are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
	
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
	
	
vii.	 Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When 
an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of 
an existing liability are, substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amount recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and loss.
	
	
viii.	Offsetting of financial instrument
	
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
	
ix.	 Derivative financial instruments
	
The Company uses derivative instruments as a part of its management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates. The Company does not acquire or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The 
Company does not enter into complex derivative transactions to manage the treasury.
	
All derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value, 
generally based on quotation obtained from banks/financial institutions. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a 
derivative instruments depends on the intended use of the derivatives and the resulting designation.
	
The fair values of all derivatives are separately recorded in the balance sheet within current and non-current assets and 
liabilities. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are classified as current and non-current depending upon the maturity 
of the derivatives.
	
The use of derivative can give rise to credit and market risk. The Company tries to control credit risk as far as possible by only 
entering into the contract with reputable banks/ financial institution. The use of derivative instrument is subject to limits, 
authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management. The limits, authorities and monitoring systems 
are periodically reviewed by the management and board. The market risk on derivatives are mitigated by changes in the 
valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management purposes.
	
	
x.	
Cash flow hedge
	
The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange 
exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. 
	
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the 
derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. Any ineffective

v.	
Debt instrument at Fair value through Profit or Loss
	
Debt instruments included within the fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) category are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
vi.	 Debt instruments at Fair value through other comprehensive income
	
	
A financial asset should be measured at FVTOCI if both the following condition are met:
•	
The assets is held within a business model in which asset are managed both in order to collect contractual cash flows 
and for sale (business model test), and
•	
Contractual terms of the assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principle and 
interest (SPPI) on the principle amount outstanding (contractual cash flow characteristics).
	
After initial measurement (at Fair value minus transaction cost), such financial assets are measured at Fair value with 
changes in fair value recognized in OCI except for:
(a)	 Interest calculated using EIR
(b)	 Foreign exchange gain and losses; and
(c)	 Impairment losses and gains
	
	
vii.	 Equity investments
	
All equity investments other than investment in subsidiaries, joint venture and associates are measured at fair value. Equity 
instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides 
to classify the same either as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or FVTPL. The Company makes 
such election on an instrument-by- instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument at FVTOCI, then fair value change on the instrument, excluding 
dividends, are recognised in other compressive income (OCI). There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement 
of profit or loss, even on sale of such investments.
	
Equity instrument includes within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the 
Statement of profit or loss.
	
	
viii.	Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) is primarily derecognised when:
•	
The right to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or
•	
The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, or
•	
The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, but has 
transferred control of the assets.
	
(b)	 Financial liabilities & Equity
	
	
i.	
Classification
	
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance 
with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
	
	
ii.	
Initial recognition and measurement of Financial Liability
	
The Company recognizes financial liability when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All 
financial liability are recognized initially at fair value minus, for financial liability not subsequently measured at FVTPL, 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of financial liability.
	
	
iii.	 Subsequent Measurement of Financial Liabilty
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.
	
However, financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or when 
the continuing involvement approach applies, financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company, and commitments 
issued by the Company to provide a loan at below-market interest rate are measured in accordance with the specific 
accounting policies

•	
Initial recognition
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currency, using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction.
	
•	
Conversion
	
Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary 
items, which are measured in terms of historical cost denominated in a foreign currency, are reported using the exchange rate 
at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items, which are measured at fair value or other similar valuation denominated 
in a foreign currency, are translated using the exchange rate at the date when such value was determined.
	
•	
Exchange differences
	
The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is 
recognized in OCI or profit or loss are also recognized in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
P.	
Taxes
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current income tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities in accordance with the Income-Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount 
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date.
	
Current income tax
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of 
profit and loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
Minimum alternate tax
	
Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged to the statement of profit and loss as current tax. The Company recognizes 
MAT credit available as an asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax 
during the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the year in which the Company 
recognizes MAT credit as an asset in accordance with the Guidance Note on Accounting for Credit Available in respect of Minimum 
Alternative Tax under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the said asset is created by way of credit to the statement of profit and loss and 
shown as “MAT Credit Entitlement.” The Company reviews the “MAT credit entitlement” asset at each reporting date and writes down 
the asset to the extent the Company does not have convincing evidence that it will pay normal tax during the specified period.
	
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet approach on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purpose at reporting date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or 
settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the 
period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be 
utilized.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow deferred tax assets to be recovered.
	
The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized 
amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Q.	 Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is 
discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedge reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in 
cash flow hedge reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the 
cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the 
related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated 
in cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
M.	 Investments in subsidiaries, Joint venture & Associate
	
Investments in equity shares of Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures & Associates are recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment at each 
balance sheet date.
N.	 Revenue recognition
	
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can 
be reliably measured.
	
Sale of goods
	
Sale is exclusive of goods and service tax (GST) and is accounted for upon dispatch of goods from the factory when the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer. Gross sales and net sales are disclosed separately in Statement of Profit & Loss.
	
Ind AS 115 introduces a new framework of five step model for the analysis of Revenue transactions. The model specifies that 
revenue should be recognized when (or as) an entity transfer control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which 
the entity expects to be entitled. Further the new standard requires enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing, and 
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts with customers.
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
	
The Company has evaluated the requirement of the amendment and the impact on the financial statements. The effect on adoption 
of Ind AS 115 was insignificant.
	
Sale of Power
	
Revenue from power has been recognized on transmission of electricity to Grid. Power generated at power plant is consumed 
at manufacturing units and excess power is sold to Grid, which is included in sales at power tariff prevailing as per the respective 
Power Purchase Agreements.
	
Inter-unit transfer of power is accounted at the rate at which the Company would have purchased power from grid. For consolidation 
purposes these transfers are eliminated from respective heads.
	
Revenue from sale of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) and Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)
	
Entitlement to Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) owing to generation of power are recognized to the extent sold.
	
Dividends
	
Revenue is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established by the Balance Sheet date.
	
Insurance claim
	
Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis of claims admitted/ expected to be admitted and to the extent that the amount 
recoverable can be measured reliably and it is reasonable to expect ultimate collection.
	
Sale of services
	
The Company being a manufacturing entity does not generally provide services in the normal course of business except the travel 
related service.
	
Revenue from supply of services if any is recognized as and when the services has been provided and recoverability accrues.
O.	 Foreign currency translation/conversion
	
Financial statements have been presented in Indian Rupees (H), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.

An impairment loss is reversed in the statement of profit and loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization or depreciation) 
had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
	
Impairment losses on continuing operations, including impairment on inventories are recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation taken to other comprehensive income. For such properties, the 
impairment is recognized in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus.
	
Financial assets
	
The Company applies ‘simplified approach’ measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and 
credit risk exposure:
•	
Financial assets that are debt instrument and are measured at amortized cost e.g. loans, debt securities, deposits, and bank 
balance.
•	
Trade receivables
	
The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit loss at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares.
R.	 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
	
Provisions
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it 
is probable that the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settled the obligation in respect of 
which reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, the expense relating to provision presented in the statement of profit & loss is net of any reimbursement.
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are disclosed using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 
the risk specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as 
finance cost.
	
Contingent liability is disclosed in the notes in case of:
•	
There is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.
•	
A present obligation arising from past event, when it is not probable that as outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation
•	
A present obligation arises from the past event, when no reliable estimate is possible
•	
A present obligation arises from the past event, unless the probability of outflow are remote.
Commitments include the amount of purchase order (net of advances) issued to parties for completion of assets.
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets and commitments are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
	
Onerous Contracts
	
A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower expected cost of terminating the contract and the 
expected cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes the impairment on the 
assets with the contract.
	
Contingent assets
	
Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements.
S.	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand and at bank, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and short term deposits, as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdraft as they being considered as integral part of the Company’s cash management.
T.	
Impairment 
	
Non-financial assets
	
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and assets classified as investment property with finite life are evaluated for 
recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or 
CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial risk management objectives and policies:
	
Sugar industry being an industry which is cyclical in nature, the Company’s operational activities are exposed to various financial & 
operational risks, such as economical & political risk, market risk, credit risk and risk of liquidity. The Company realizes that risks are 
inherent and integral aspect of any business. The primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of markets and seek to minimize 
potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The Company’s senior management oversees the management of these 
risks and devise approrpiate risk management framework for the Company. The senior management provides assurance that 
the Company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified,

Market Risk:-
	
The Company operates internationally and is transacted in foreign currencies and consequently the Company is exposed 
to foreign exchange risk through its sales in overseas. The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign 
exchange forward to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures.

During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow 
hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. The related hedge 
transactions for balance in other comprehensive income - cash flow hedge as at March 31, 2023 are expected to occur and 
reclassified to statement of profit and loss within 1 year.
	
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness 
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including 
whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.
	
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged 
and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the 
volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk 
management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the Statement of Profit or Loss at the 
time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

Credit Risk:-
	
Credit risk arises when a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations to pay, resulting in financial loss to the Company. 
The Company is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities, primarily trade receivables. Since there is a blend of 
instituitional & non instituitional buyers with the Company and also considering the fact that major sales gets effected after 
receipt of advance from the customers, the credit risks in respect of trade receivables is minimized.

Liquidity risk:
	
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of cash credit 
facilities, short term loans and commercial papers and to reduce debts to be able to meet the cyclicalities of the sugar business. 
Apart from cyclical sugar business, the Company has alternate revenue streams in the form of cogeneration and distillery, 
which, to a large extent, offset the impact of sugar cyclicalities.

In view of seasonal nature of sugar business, which is a dominant business of the Company, there is a peak build-up of sugar 
inventories at the year end, resulting in peak working capital requirement. With the liquidation of such inventories over the 
year, the working capital requirement is gradually reduced. Thus, the current ratio computed at the year end is not a reflection 
of average and realistic ratio for the year.

Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023
46	 Capital Management
For the purpose of capital management, capital includes net debt and total equity of the Company. The primary objective of the capital 
management is to maximize shareholder value along with an objective to keep the leverage in check in view of cyclical capital intensive 
sugar business of the Company.
One of the major business of the Company is the sugar business, which is a seasonal industry, where the entire production is made in 
about five to six months and then sold throughout the year. Thus, it necessitates keeping high sugar inventory levels requiring high 
working capital funding. Sugar business being a cyclical business, it is prudent to avoid high leverage and the resultant high finance cost. 
It is the endeavor of the Company to prune down debts to acceptable levels based on its financial position.
The Company may resorts to further issue of capital when the funds are required to make the Company stronger financially or to invest 
in projects meeting the ROI expectations of the Company.
The Company monitors capital structure through gearing ratio represented by debt-equity ratio (debt/total equity). The gearing ratios 
for the Company as at the end of reporting period were as follows:

In addition to the above gearing ratio, the Company also looks at operating profit to total debt ratio (EBIDTA/Total Debts) which gives 
an indication of adequacy of earnings to service the debts. The Company carefully negotiates the terms and conditions of the loans and 
ensures adherence to all the financials convenants. With a view to arrive at the desired capital structure based on the financial condition 
of the Company, the Company normally incorporates a clause in loan agreements for prepayment of loans without any premium. During 
the year, majority of the long term debts have been contracted by the Company at concessional interest rates under various soft loan 
schemes of the Government.
Further, no changes were made in the objectives, policies or process for managing capital during the period.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
47	 This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are 
recognised and measured at fair value. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the 
Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the Indian accounting standard.

49	 Impairment Review
	
Assets are tested for impairment whenever there are any internal or external indicators of impairment. Impairment test is performed 
at the level of each Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) or groups of CGUs within the Company at which the assets are monitored for 
internal management purposes, within an operating segment. The impairment assessment is based on higher of value in use 
and value from sale calculations. During the year, the testing did not result in any impairment in the carrying amount of other 
assets. The measurement of the cash generating units’ value in use is determined based on financial plans that have been used by 
management for internal purposes. The planning horizon reflects the assumptions for short to- mid-term market conditions.
	
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations are:-
	
(i)	
Operating margins (Earnings before interest and taxes),
	
(ii)	 Discount Rate, 
	
(iii)	 Growth Rates and 
	
(iv)	 Capital Expenditure
